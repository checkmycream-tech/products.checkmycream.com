<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought it for my niece and she likes it.</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I have been using these mirrors for many years.  I started out with 3X, moved up to 5X, and bought the 8X for my spare.  My latest 5X was broken, so I needed a spare for guests.  These are of good quality, which cannot be said for all brands of magnifying mirrors.  I have recommended  these to my sisters, and they agree with my assessment.  I have used better tweezers, but these are good to have around for splinters.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she loves it, what else can I say. The purchase fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I needed this mirror for travelling, to stick on the bathroom mirror in the hotels...and it DOES NOT FALL OFF.  Love it. It is a perfect size, perfect magnification and the price is right. One thing that would make it better would be if it had a light...but...not a deal breaker!  Would recommend this mirror to anyone who needs a stick-up mirror, it is the best one I ever had.  Love it.</li>
    <li> just what I was ;ookinf for. Great if you have trouble seeing without glasses.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this many times a day</li>
    <li> Good price and since my vision is poor about the only way I can see well enough to apply makeup. Price is reasonable. Second time I have ordered one.</li>
    <li> My brothers and I are all in our 40s now and have to wear glasses for reading.  I tried a mirror like this and liked it so well that I purchased one for everyone in the family.  The suction cups allow you to mount it to your bathroom mirror and leave it there all the time so there is no inconvenience of getting a make-up mirror out daily.  For my brothers they sometimes get a piece of construction dust in an eye and this helps them see well enough to remove the irritant.</li>
    <li> This mirror is wonderful.  It&#x27;s gives a clear image unlike many magnifying mirros.  It sticks right to the window where the light is the best.  It&#x27;s large enough to see your entire face in.  Very valuable for those of us who have a few chin hairs to pluck.  The seller shipped promptly with the product well packaged.</li>
    <li> no false advertising here!  what you see is what you get!  I would have preferred a 10x magnified mirror, but, this is the closest I was able to find!</li>
    <li> This is a really large mirror. bigger than i expected.  but it works well.</li>
    <li> I can not live without this mirror.  I recently purchased this item because I carelessly left the one I had had for years in a motel room.  (The motel \\&quot;could not find it\\&quot;  after I contacted them of the loss just 6 hours after checking out!).  I was delighted to find the exact mirror which I lost on Amazon.com and more than pleased after receiving the item.  This is one wonderful product.  I am a 70-something lady and this mirror allows me to apply make-up and not end up looking like a clown.  Thank you for this great, great mirror.</li>
    <li> I can finally seeeee, yeah.</li>
    <li> after item received i realized (by doing online research) that this product is too expensive, similar ones sold for half the price. but i already have it and it works well, so its not the seller&#x27;s fault i didn&#x27;t buy it cheaper somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for Amazon.  I&#x27;ve used the 5X mirror for years, but needed a stronger one and absolutely could not find one in my shopping trips.  If you have a hard time putting on makeup or mascara because when you take your glasses off, you can&#x27;t see anything, this is great.  There are three suctions cups on the back so you can put it right on the mirror in your bath or bedroom.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It sticks well to my mirror and it magnifies just right.  It is great for applying make-up or seeing tiny flaws.  It has great tweezers too.  I love both and recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product.  When the eyesight goes, there&#x27;s no way to put on makeup without magnification, and attaching this to my well lit bathroom mirror is especially great.  There&#x27;s no way a mirror with lights can match this one.  Yes, you have to stand close to the bathroom mirror, but I used to do it all the time anyway when I didn&#x27;t need a magnifier.  And to the person who complained about this mirror fogging up, try opening a window or door to let the steam out of the bathroom, most mirrors fog up after a shower and need to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; with a paper towel and ventilation - common sense.  I hope this mirror never goes out of production because I would never want to be without it.  GREAT PRODUCT!  As far as the tweezer goes, this was something I didn&#x27;t need anyway and whether it worked or not did not influence my purchase.</li>
    <li> The mirror quality is great suction cups work very well. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. When I went to Amazon I already had a specific idea of what I wanted and how much I was willing to pay and this fit both criteria. It arrived promptly within 5 days,and I love it.</li>
    <li> Ordered three got one had to request the others to be sent. like it great for shower shaving!</li>
    <li> They are wonderful.  Thanks for your help.</li>
    <li> put this mirror on my bathroom mirror, I don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.</li>
    <li> It works great. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  This is the 3rd I hav purchased, one for home, one for travel and one to replace that one when I broke it.  I&#x27;m lost putting my makeup on without it due to not being able to wear my glasses.  This solves the problem.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are suprisingly good for a free pair too.</li>
    <li> Mirror suction cups do not hold. The mirror slid off mirror hit floor and broke within first week of use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful...attaches to bathroom mirror so I can see HOW to brush my teeth &amp; pluck eyebrows.  Over 50 now, so it&#x27;s getting a little tough.  Could not find in local retail.  Tweezers were best I&#x27;ve ever had too-what a bonus.  LOVE them both!</li>
    <li> First, I broke my first 8x mirror and looked everywhere to find one that had suction cups.  I ordered two: ONE IS  PERFECT, and the other-the image is distorted.  BUT--having one that was perfect was worth the money.  Perhaps would not feel the same if both had distored images. So I rated 4 of 5 stars due to one that was distorted.</li>
    <li> Very good price. Product is exactly as described. I have one like it but paid much more for it. They are hard to find</li>
    <li> Product shipped promptly, but the suction cups on the mirror do not work at all.  The first time I tried to attach it to the bathroom mirror it fell within five seconds and the plastic around the mirror chipped.  Its virtually impossible to get it to stick anywhere.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Not crazy about the tweezers but the mirror is as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a stand type makeup mirror for years. My vision area for using it has gotten smaller and smaller as time marches on. I reached the point where I could only see one eye, or part of my face, at one time. A real challenge when trying not to end up with clown makeup! I needed the increased viewing area of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Since it has a suction cup back, I attached it to my old stand mirror. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> You can see details, but it&#x27;s a real strain on the eyes to see them because you have to shape your cornea in special shapes to adapt to the mirror&#x27;s. It&#x27;s useful and I&#x27;ll use it because I&#x27;m too cheap to get another product (expected lifetime usage is 10 hours)</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  It is just the right size for seeing exactly what I am doing while applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted.  Came very quickly.  Package was missing the tweezers and company quickly refunded a portion of price to compensate.  Very happy with mirror.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those of us who have trouble seeing in the bathroom mirror!  The tweezers weren&#x27;t all that great, but the price for the mirror was well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd one!  I LOVE this mirror!  Accidents do happen, so I hope you never stop making this.  If you do, let me know so I can stock up! I have even given as gifts, (3)  all appreciated the gift!</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for, great for travel!</li>
    <li> The &#x27;just-right&#x27; mirror has three healthy suction cups&lt;br /&gt;to affix it to whatever surface is required.  It does just fine.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of the DB-Tech Large 10\\&quot; Suction Cup 8X Magnifying Mirrors and I am very pleased with my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnifying image is clear with no distortions and the suction cups keep the mirrors firmly affixed to both my bathroom mirror and my bedroom closet door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear image definitely helps to apply my makeup without glasses.</li>
    <li> I have had a similar magifying mirror on suction cups before.  When it broke (the suction cups were not very strong), I found this replacement.  It has a nice clear image and sticks well to any flat surface, such as mirrored closet doors in hotel rooms.  Very helpful for applying makeup, tweezing, etc.</li>
    <li> I am getting so blind in my late 50&#x27;s and putting on eye make up is a pain so I can&#x27;t leave home with out this. But now my husband asked me not to take the mirror with me so I had to order an extra to take with me and one to leave home at all times. ( He doesn&#x27;t wear eye make up )</li>
    <li> Only effective a couple of inches away. No instructions. Not going to be able to use as intended.</li>
    <li> Holds firmly to the bathroom mirror and lets me see my face clearly and up close.</li>
    <li> This mirror is larger than I imagined, though the listing clearly stated 10\\&quot;.  I am happy with the clarity of the magnification. It suits my needs very well- plucking eyebrows and other stray fuzzies.  The tweezers is a nice added bonus!  It is a very fine tweezers, it holds on tight and makes for less painful plucking.  I wish the mirror had some way to allow it to be hung on a wall.  I do not want to stick it onto my bathroom mirror.  I tried to stick it to the wall but it would not hold to my surface.  The larger size makes it a bit inconvenient to hold.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Like the mirror very much but there were no tweezers with the order--okay since I didn&#x27;t need them, but it is always nice to get exactly what you ordered, no?</li>
    <li> Nice big mirror.  As promised in the write-up.</li>
    <li> I have hunted for one of these mirrors for a long time.  I love it and thre teezers work very well also.  I am very happy with the mirror and will be ordering some for family members.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok mirror but the suction isn&#x27;t the greatest.  Nice size but don&#x27;t bump it or it falls right off.</li>
    <li> This mirror has a very sharp image, appears to be a quality piece and should give me many years of use.</li>
    <li> I can see my eyebrows &amp; eye lashes again! This mirror is great for putting make up on with.</li>
    <li> I love it and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  I take it travelling as well.  In fact I just bought a second one to keep in my suitcase in case I would forget to bring it home.  It is wonderful for putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> The mirror was so distorted you cannot see your face unless you are touching your nose to it.  Wanted to return it but for some reason unable to</li>
    <li> The mirror is what I wanted. And the tweezers were a nice bonus, and they are very good!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was lookiing for as far as size, no distortion and effective suction cups.</li>
    <li> A bit of distortion, but for the price a good value.  Shipping very fast.</li>
    <li> Love love love this mirror,</li>
    <li> This mirror is super so far I just received it and the suction cups are staying on the mirror and the mirror is very large not made cheaply. You do have to come in close for the magnifying effect but it really does work. Super for the price I ordered a small one from ebay and it was made very poorly and to small I had to close one eye to see me (lol) gave to my kids to play with.  This is a great buy 5stars for sure Happy to see again</li>
    <li> This mirror does exactly what it is supposed to!  It sticks to my large bathroom mirror and magnifies&lt;br /&gt;everything very well.  Quick service!  It arrived right away!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> 2nd one we&#x27;ve bought. wife&#x27;s happy, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected - nice quality - good value.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my mirror with suction cups!  I had one like this...took it on vacation...left it at a hotel!  I am SO happy I found another one!  The eyes aren&#x27;t as good as they used to be!!!!</li>
    <li> Mirror is perfect to see image without glasses or contacts. Attaches well to glass. I purchased two, one for a freind and one for myself.  We are both well pleased.</li>
    <li> This mirror was purchased as a gift so I have no opinion other than the receiver was pleased.  I have a similar one and am happy with mine.</li>
    <li> The suction cup mirror was good and the price was less then in stores.</li>
    <li> I been looking for something like this in a lot of store even beauty supplies store and couldn&#x27;t find this size that sticks to the wall.&lt;br /&gt;Like it very much and the delivery was fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I have bought many magnifying mirrors in the past but this mirror is not only easy to stick onto&lt;br /&gt;your bathroom mirror (or any mirror) but magnifies 8\\&quot;x larger than a regular mirror making it&lt;br /&gt;incredibly easy to do your makeup or tweeze your eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;I have found that sticking it to the mirror with the suction cups completely dry seems to work the best.&lt;br /&gt;If you normally need reading glasses you won&#x27;t need them when using this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I also take it everywhere when I travel since you can just slip it into your suitcase in-between your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to repack it when you leave!!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> love it - great size and magnification</li>
    <li> We already have one of these - this was purchased for the second bathroom</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup mirror and the price was cheap.  Delivery was really fast&lt;br /&gt;and the quality was better than anticipated.  Thanks for the good deal</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the large size and quality of the mirror,  So far the suction cups are holing up really well.</li>
    <li> This mirror is only usable in the center of the mirror, like for removing eyebrow hairs. It is totally out-of-focus near the sides compared to other magnifying mirrors I have used.</li>
    <li> I just returned this item for the inaccurate magnification. It&#x27;s actually 5X not 8X magnification. Price was high but was willing to pay to get what I wanted. I was very disppointed with this product.[[ASIN:B0024JMXQY Large 10</li>
    <li> The mirror is awesome but the tweezers are crap.</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror before and like it very much.  The last one got broken, so had to get another.</li>
    <li> After going to 6 local stores to find a 10 inch suction cup magnifying mirror I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;I went to amazon found immediately what I wanted. Two days later I received the mirror which was exactly what I wanted! Excellent quality and service.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like this mirror. It&#x27;s difficult to see in--you have to hold it too close. And I don&#x27;t trust the suction.</li>
    <li> Awesome just as I expected, very happy</li>
    <li> Smooth transaction!  It&#x27;s scary to see so much of myself in a mirror, but that&#x27;s why I wanted this item.  I&#x27;m having a difficult time getting it anchored to my bathroom mirror, but I&#x27;ll get it figured out.  The tweezers--handy bonus.</li>
    <li> Someone admired the mirror I had.  When I visited them.  I presented as a \\&quot;thank you for letting me visit you for a few days\\&quot;  gift.  If you do not want to see every pore on your face, do not buy this product.  It is only for up close and personal.</li>
    <li> I am happy I purchased this mirror. I do wish, like the other reviews, that it had an extension &amp;#34;arm&amp;#34;. I find myself leaning into the bath counter top to look into the mirror. not a huge deal but I do wish it were closer. it&#x27;s useful and helpful and i&#x27;m glad I purchased it. it gets used every day. the magnification is very good and Lord knows I need it at this age!!</li>
    <li> Dec. 2015 - New review - I&#x27;ve changed my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because I no longer travel for business &amp; the 10&amp;#34; size is great for me to use in my home for applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a 6&amp;#34; magnifying mirror I carried with me when I traveled - necessary to put makeup on in hotels.  It broke so I ordered this mirror.  I&#x27;m very happy with the quality &amp; the magnification - but the 10&amp;#34; size does make it larger/bulkier to pack.  Would&#x27;ve been nice to have had one like this just smaller - maybe 6&amp;#34; or 8&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would&#x27;ve gotten a 5 star rating if it had been a better size for me.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  Very clear, perfect size very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> suction cups do not work, wouldn&#x27;t buy again!!</li>
    <li> The mirror is on a window, suction is good, mirror is good, tweezers I threw away.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Adults getting older and need magnification. Great gift and Wife Loves them. We ordered 2 of them. One for Upstairs Bathroom and One for Downstairs</li>
    <li> I left my special mirrors behind on our last trip, so Iooked on line and found this one at Amazon.com.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> perfect for what I required, mounted on the bath room mirror perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to anyone, also good service and on time</li>
    <li> I had never used a magnifying mirror before, and was very pleased with this one.  Sticks easily to the basic bathroom mirror and provides excellent clarity.  Tweezers are nice too.  Good product.</li>
    <li> The tweezers were not that great.  I think I should have ordered a smaller one to fit over the mirror  that  I&#x27;m using now.</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower and I needed to replace my magnifying mirror. This was the perfect replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old one was  5X and the new one is 8X, which I really like.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  A Christmas gift for my daughter.  She wat thrilled with your product.  Will most likely order one for myself.</li>
    <li> The mirror is fine, but Ii did not get the tweezers as advertised, and also claimed on box to be included.  PLEASE SEND ME THE TWEEZERS.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
    <li> A little larger magnification, but it works for me.</li>
    <li> The mirror is exactly what I expected. The suction has been great. The tweezers are nothing special, a little cheap.</li>
    <li> I like that this mirror suctions to my larger bathroom mirror.  It&#x27;s not as good a quality as a smaller one I bought, but it does the job. The tweezers that come with it do a good job of grasping the hair I want to remove.  I&#x27;ve bought several tweezers in the past that the hair just slips through.  These ones are effective.</li>
    <li> The mirror arrived on time as promised. I always have two of this type of mirror, one for home and one for travel. This was a replacement. There&#x27;s only one suggestion I have: I think it might be a good idea to have another suction cup on the mirror. It&#x27;s a little heavy for the three suction cups. The precision tweezers were a welcome bonus. I&#x27;ve never had tweezers just like these and they work really well.</li>
    <li> The mirror is just what I was looking for; however, would much prefer if it were a tad smaller with a handle---then it would be perfect.  The x8 magnification is VERY hard to find, that is why I settled for this one.  Please make one with a handle!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had a mirror that looked just like this one stuck on my bathroom mirror for more than 10 years.  One day - \\&quot;Crash\\&quot;  no more mirror!  I sent for this one because it was the same size and seemed to be the right magnification.  WOW!  8x is a lot more than whatever I had.  Shocking for a 68 year old woman but exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect mirror for home or travel. It&#x27;s lightweight, large and fits securely on my bathroom mirror or any surface. The image is clear and very useful for applying make up. The price is very low for the value.</li>
    <li> sticks where you put it &amp;amp; has lots of magnification. it&#x27;s big enough to actually see yourself. the tweezers are so-so.</li>
    <li> This is a LARGE large magnification mirror that I keep at home. Great price and suctions work great. Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror when I left my travel mirror in a hotel room.  This mirror is really nice but it&#x27;s 10\\&quot; in diameter which is too large for travel IMO.  I took it on my trip, wrapped in the bubble wrap in came in, but I will look for a smaller one to travel with.</li>
    <li> The magnifying mirror kept falling off my bathroom mirror ,the suction cups aren&#x27;t very good,they don&#x27;t have much suction ,an inferior product .The precision tweezers are substandard .</li>
    <li> this is a great mirror.  sticks well.  magnifies about the right amount for putting on makeup and tweezing stuff.  very happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror.  It&#x27;s just what I was looking for and it was at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love the mirror and it is so convenient to attach to my mirror over the counter.  Tweezers work great too.</li>
    <li> I can not apply my makeup without this and feel comfortable that it looks satisfactory when I put my glasses on and look at myself in the regular mirror.  I ordered two so I can leave one in my luggage for traveling.  Just remember to take it with you when you leave your hotel; I have left a few in the past.  After a few years the suction cups begin to fail and I have had a couple fall off the mirror and break;  this does not stop me from ordering more as I love this mirror.</li>
    <li> This suction cup mirror is just perfect to take along on a trip. It is easy to attach using the suction cups and provides the magnification for worry free make-up application or grooming. The addition of the precision tweezers is a nice plus!</li>
    <li> This mirror does not distort as it magnifies whether for  make up application or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;The suction cups are large enough to stay attached to smooth surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the added bonus of the tweezers.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Prompt shipment</li>
    <li> The mirror is excellent and it attaches to any shiny surface while traveling, so suits me for the reason I ordered it.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this after leaving the other one at a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;Both were excellent and I will order again if needed - can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I am not even able to see my face when this is put on my large bathroom mirror. It makes me crosseyed just to hold it and try to find one part of my face. We have just returned from a two week vacation and just tried the mirror..it will be returned a.s.a.p.</li>
    <li> This magnifying mirror is a great  help when applying makeup.  It is also a very good mirror for travel. Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror because of th command strips and because it was anti-fog.  The first time I used it, I had run the shower on hot to warm it up, stepped in and the mirror was totaly fogged up.</li>
    <li> I need a magnifying mirror that I can count on.  I used to purchase a mirror like this one from another company but they stopped making a quality product.  I am very happy with this one.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This magnifying mirror is just right for when I am shaving in the shower. I had a smaller one that was just to small. Plus the price was right. With the Prime shipping, it was a lot cheaper than going to a brick store to buy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaving mirror with the right magnification. The suction cups appear to be adequate (my last magnification mirror broke when the suction cups let go).  The tweezers are a bonus and I relayed them on to my wife.</li>
    <li> I was afraid this would be blurry and fall the mirror surface in the damp.  Instead it&#x27;s both clear as a bell without distortion or flaw and the suction cups require a good twist to remove.  You can get up close when shaving and check whether or not middle age has blessed you with 3\\&quot; ear hairs or grey needle like eyebrows.  You can easily see how tired your eyes look as you clean up your eyebrows.  It&#x27;s very well priced and the only complaint I&#x27;d have is the included tweezers which are worthless- hard to grab, poorly finished and with tips both too small and too rounded and uneven to grasp basicaly anything.  Just ditch them please and stick to the mirror which is done very well.</li>
    <li> I like that the mirror has suction cups on the back. Not only can I use it in the bathroom, I can take it into a natural light situation to locate those hard-to-find wild hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The magnification is enough to see what I need without blowing things so far out of distortion that it is unusable.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would make this better is a slide in stand for uses away from the bath room.</li>
    <li> It fell and broke. Luckily nobody cut himself. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one, only if you glue it to the wall.</li>
    <li> I likes the mirrors (my husband and I each have a large mirror) in my bathroom so much that I bought one for the guest bath. The mirrors are outstanding.  This is my second order.  My daughter&#x27;s used the one in the guest bath and just had to have one.</li>
    <li> Giving this three stars only because the quality of the product is fine.  My fault with this product is my own: it is absolutely useless as a shaving mirror.  The magnification means that you basically have to be inches away from the mirror which, in a shower setting, fogs the mirror. Also it makes it hard to see your whole face at once and makes focusing properly difficult.  So if you&#x27;re getting this to tweeze eyebrows, great. But if you&#x27;re getting this to shave, pick something else without magnification.</li>
    <li> Really good magnifying mirror. Three suction cups on the back keep it firmly in place. The tweezers are good too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this item.  Magnification of the mirror is fine, but the suction cups don&#x27;t adhere as well as I would have liked.  And, I was hoping the tweezers would be more like a Tweezerman, but it isn&#x27;t.  The tweezers do not grab well enough to get the very fine hairs that need to be plucked!</li>
    <li> Just love these, couldn&#x27;t apply makeup without it.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Needed to replace one I broke, and was having a hard time find one exactly like it.  This is exactly what I wanted, and the bonus tweezers are great!</li>
    <li> This mirror was to replace the one I forget to retrieve in Dumas Texas after a stay there. This is the best travel mirror I have found.</li>
    <li> i had a smaller one for the bathroom mirror  but needed a stronger and bigger mirror as I age this work for the eyebrows and fine hairs</li>
    <li> Works better than smaller close-up mirrors that I&#x27;ve had in the past. Now I want an illuminated one!</li>
    <li> A perfect mirror for anyone having sight problems needing magnification to see ones face clearly.  Great for travel and home.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mirror a bit too much magnification but it&#x27;s workable.  The tweezers are fine, they are just tweezers like any other ones.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect size for me.  Very clear and easy to see without glasses.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to go over my old magnifying mirror, which is a 5x.  My old mirror is attached the the wall of my dresser and this is a great addition than ordering another more expensive wall mirror.  The suction cups work wonderful.  I will also take this mirror with me on cruises, that&#x27;s why I saved the bubble wrap and box to transport in.</li>
    <li> One of the suction cups doesn&#x27;t want to attach but other than that it is acceptable but not great.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t order another one from this particular manufacturer.  Magnification is not what I had hoped it would be.  Not quite enough for my farsightedness.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Suction cups hold surprisingly well.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described, and the suction cups are really good. I just had to set it up once on the wall, and it hasn&#x27;t budged.</li>
    <li> Was what I expected.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this mirror!  It&#x27;s just perfect. It exactly the size i was looking for to go my mirror in bathroom.  Great makeup mirror for those that have trouble seeing</li>
    <li> This is better the the hard wired lighted mirrors a friend has in her bathroom.  My walls are tiles (ceramic) and it sticks very well also sticks to a mirror well.</li>
    <li> The optical quality of the mirror is high. The frame is light enough to hand hold. The suction cups certainly work for the short periods I have attached it to glass but I have not left it up for long periods. If this is needed, I&#x27;d probably use a peelable adhesive for security. And I found the tweezers to work well even though the design is odd. Eight power magnification seems the best choice for most uses. If mine were stolen, I would buy another.</li>
    <li> A nice mirror.  Packed in a box with plastic.  I ve used it a couple of times, comes with tweezers.  My eyes are old and fading, so I need it for makeup as I have macular degeration.  With mac. degeration, your eyes loose light and become blurred, and normal vision decreases.</li>
    <li> Really a great tool to have.  So nice to see up close when necessary.</li>
    <li> One has to be too close for this mirror. OK for use in a shower where one can stand close to the mirror. The mirror has a very short focal length. If there&#x27;s a lavatry basin between you and the missor, you are too far away.</li>
    <li> Ordered it to use at a condo we rented. It was great! Ordering another one!</li>
    <li> Fabulous mirror!!! I can see great in it :) Nice tweezers too! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!!Thanks so much</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, she finds it to be great for travel. It&#x27;s like her Amex. card never travel without it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mirror. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it. I&#x27;m going to get another for my bathroom and traveling (I put this one on my vanity mirror). I&#x27;m also going to buy a few for my sisters and girlfriends. They&#x27;ll be so happy!</li>
    <li> The mirror is helpful for putting my make up on.  I like the idea of the little pads on the tweezers but they don&#x27;t work as well BECAUSE of the little pads.  They sometimes prevent the tips from touching.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect! Stick it on the big mirror to put on make-up then remove it and store until next use.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of my time and $$$. Mirror fogs immedately and the tweezers are very cheaply made. It wasn&#x27;t worth returning due to cost of postage so I tossed it in the trash. Lesson learned - don&#x27;t buy from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I finally found this mirror to replace the one I have just like it because it&#x27;s been everywhere with me from Australia to Europe. It has taken a beating, but I couldn&#x27;t find one like it until now. This one works just as well for me even though my last one was 10X magnifying.  Make sure your bathroom mirror is clean before applying.  When I stick it on I also pull on it to make sure the suction is secure.</li>
    <li> Size is great. Magnification is great. Just didn&#x27;t realize how close to the mirror you have to be to use it. You have to be very close, which means leaning over the bathroom vanity. Now I know why the type that comes on a swinging or accordion arm is so popular, you can bring it to your face. However this one is portable, so I can take it when we travel. I have been using it everyday over the past month or so, and it&#x27;s working out fine. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Met expectations. Quick ship.</li>
    <li> Yep, if you really want to see what your complexion is up to then get this mirror.  Everything you could and could not imagine shows up and the mirror never lies.  The suction cups work great attached to my bathroom mirror so I can see both normal and magnified views of what&#x27;s happening.  Also, the price is exceptional for what you are getting.</li>
    <li> First, the wrong product was sent &amp; was a HUGE hassle and added expense to get the right item. When it did arrive it was FILTHY dirty, had (what I hope was only) bug feces on it &amp; the plastic rim was so covered in a tar-like film that it still looks bad after cleaning. It functions as expected and is not worth another hassle of returning, but I&#x27;d be wary of buying from this vendor. YUCK!</li>
    <li> Love the large size of this mirror.  Suction holds great on my large bathroom mirror.  There is no distortion at all.  Not a fan of the tweezers, but bought this for the mirror.</li>
    <li> Suits my needs just fine.  Firmly adheres to mirror; lets me (a tall guy) see to shave closer.</li>
    <li> Mirror doesn&#x27;t want to stick to mirror. Appears to be too heavy.</li>
    <li> The greatest mirror for putting on makeup and tweezing your brows</li>
    <li> My wife loves this especially when we go on trips.  i will buy her another one soon.</li>
    <li> Great mirror with strong suction cup.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The mirror is a little bit distorted and the suction cups on the back do not hold well.  OK for travel but not for long-term home use.</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these mirrors for several years.  My daughters are always borrowing it so I decided to purchase one for each of them and they love it!</li>
    <li> Wow!  I can see my eyebrows.  I&#x27;ll buy another for my daughter.  The tweezers are an excellent plus.</li>
    <li> Wanted a mirror. That would magnify and show my entire face and this one delivers. The suction cups are strong. I attach it to a window so I can use natural light to see my face up close. Great for tweeting and make up.</li>
    <li> The mirror is both durable and versatile. I was able to place it wherever I needed it for the correct lighting. It&#x27;s made well. It traveled easily and safely.</li>
    <li> exactly what is was looking for!!!</li>
    <li> Arrive damaged. Package squashed &amp; mirror shattered. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I had a 3x magnifier stuck on my bathroom mirror which kept falling down.  I bought this one initially for the three suction cups on the back for added adhesiveness, but I LOVE the 8x magnifier.  I use it all the time, not just for make-up.  Now that I&#x27;m approaching 50, I need all the help I can get seeing :)</li>
    <li> I received the mirror on time,found it to be larger then I really wanted...it&#x27;s ok but really wanted for my purse which this will not work...</li>
    <li> Perfect, large enough to work with, with no distortion. Great for old eyes like mine.</li>
    <li> The mirror was too magnified, and it was hard to return it.  However, I&#x27;ve learned to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I&#x27;ll get the measurements right before ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only time I&#x27;ve been disappointed in a product ordered through Amazon, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> This is a well-constructed mirror which is just the right size and magnification for my wife&#x27;s bathroom mirror.  The suction cup mounts are great, the tweezers are a nice extra and it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. The size is perfect.</li>
    <li> Working well for my dad who has limited vision.  Has stayed well on his vanity mirror.</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror great for traveling, have given them away as gifts, and they were very appreciated ! from the over or way over 40 set !!!</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectations. Perfect for travel. Great suction, not flimsy or cheap. Also the size of the mirror is great. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After recent cataract surgery, I needed a close up mirror for make up and eye drops.  My vision at 12&amp;#34; was blurry and this mirror solved the issue.  It has nice suction on my medicine cabinet regular mirror.  Would buy it again in a minute.</li>
    <li> This is the second mirror I tried - the first one was so distorted it gave me a headache.  This one seems completely distortion-free, the size is just right, the magnification is great for those of us who need it (we know who we are), the suction cups work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers weren&#x27;t a factor in my purchase since I didn&#x27;t need them, so I can&#x27;t comment on them, but this is a great mirror -- I have it on my bathroom window at just the right height.</li>
    <li> I actually had one for years. And broke it. I was so glad to find another one on Amazon. Love this one too. Very good quality</li>
    <li> My eye sight is very bad and I was really having trouble putting on my make-up, tweezing, etc.  I had a  lighted 5x mirror, but this one is much stronger and much better.  It suction-cupped right on top of my old wall-mounted one and has never fallen off.  I liked it so much I bought a second one to travel with, and I&#x27;ll never go on another trip without it.  It suctions right onto the bathroom mirror.  It is not lighted, but I have never found the lighted mirrors to be that helpful. It is extremely lightweight and lat, so you never even know it&#x27;s in your suitcase.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was EXACTLY as represented. Don&#x27;t waste your money on small mirrors, get this big one, you will be very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Wanted a mirror in the shower so I could shave. I had a mirror for years w/ suction cups so I ordered 2 of these. They never stayed on the wall and never unfogged no matter what I did. Both finally fell into the shower tub and broke. The tweezers worked ok... big deal. Thumbs down.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror. And the extra tweezers are a bonus!</li>
    <li> With smaller 8x mirrors, it is difficult to focus.  This mirror makes it much easier, and for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This mirror is an outstanding product. I bought it for travel and it has not disappoint! I recommend this mirror as the best travel accessory a woman can own.</li>
    <li> I like this product but after about 18 months, it began to fall off the shower door.  I would pick it up and stick it back on. Yesterday it shattered into dozens of pieces when it hit the floor.</li>
    <li> As I get older my eyes get less clear. This mirror works great and  help me be able to put on makeup and see what I need to see.</li>
    <li> this item is good.  the only thing that doesn&#x27;t work is the suction cups.  This is the fourth one I buy and they have&lt;br /&gt;all fallen on the floor.  I have not thrown the last one away to see if it can be returned for a refund.  How do I get in&lt;br /&gt;contact with the seller?&lt;br /&gt;Need to return it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Cristina Grille</li>
    <li> Handy!  Install on the bathroom mirror for hands free makeup application.  Give this to friends who wear glasses.</li>
    <li> Great magnifying mirror. The magnification and the size of the mirror are perfect. The tweezers are not so good but the mirror was the reason for the purchase anyway.</li>
    <li> sturdy and easy to place on wall or bathroom mirror.. Just perfect for travel as it can be easily packed in some type of cosmetic case,  Anyone with &amp;#34;older eyes&amp;#34; will love the 8x magnifying mirror for applying make-up or tweezing eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Though DB Roth is the vendor, the fulfillment is by Amazon, which unsurprisingly was top notch, and I received the product on time and as expected. (I buy from the Marketplace only when Amazon is listed as the fulfiller.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for my husband as a shaving mirror, and though my first impressions were a bit negative (its packaging is utilitarian and bare), it has performed admirably for its main purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;1. At 10 inches, it is the perfect size for a shaving mirror.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is very clear with no imperfections on its surface.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is priced at a very reasonable level.&lt;br /&gt;4. Its suction pads are simply awesome. Once affixed to our main bathroom mirror, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get off.&lt;br /&gt;5. I didn&#x27;t see this advertised as a fogless mirror, but it turned out to be very resistant to fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;1. There is no articulating arm here to pull the mirror to you. This was a problem for us, but one that we chose to live with for the convenience of installation.&lt;br /&gt;2. Make sure you understand the magnification that you get from a 8x mirror. More is not necessarily better. With hindsight, I&#x27;d have preferred a 5x magnifier instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Devi</li>
    <li> This mirror is great. My eyes are very bad so this really helps. QUALITY PRODUCT. The twitters are nice too</li>
    <li> Love it so much, I&#x27;ve bought 4 of them, for myself and family.  Problem is now I need a stronger magnification..do you make 10x same size and all other details just stronger?  Does anyone know where I could purchase.  I have to buy 3 more with 10x + magnification but the same size at least 10&amp;#34; diameter like this one, it was and still is perfect, my eyes are just weaker now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one if these mirrors for years as I am far sighted and can&#x27;t see up close without my glasses. My old one got left behind on a trip so I needed a new one. They work well. Are good for putting on makeup etc but the first time you see yourself it, it may be a bit scary. Tweezers are useless tho.</li>
    <li> This mirror is OK.  I have had other mirrors like this so I knew what to expect. You do have to lean over the sink to use this or your image is blurry.  The suction cups are holding the weight of the mirror very well.  The tweezers were included and not the reason I chose the mirror which is a good thing because they are worthless. All this being said....I would purchase it again. It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> My wife wishes she would have ordered the 10X rather than the 8X.</li>
    <li> Love this! Stays on my bathroom mirror and good magnification.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling. Groom and look beautiful!! Easy to set up and take down.</li>
    <li> The suction cups fail, but the mirror is great!</li>
    <li> I liked the look of the product and 8x magnification. However, mounting hardware (3 suction cups) do not hold the weight of the mirror. I have been trying to find alternate ways to hold it as I like the product. but if it does not work I may have to return it.</li>
    <li> My wife needed this after cataract surgery, as now she cannot focus close-up.  She seems happy with it, but then she&#x27;d better as she helped choose it.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace one that I had for years from BB&amp;amp;B.  They don&#x27;t seem to have them anymore.  Totally disappointed, I got online with Amazon, and found this one.  I highly recommend.  Perfect size for the whole face!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see that well any more and this made it positively perfect for me to see myself in the mirror. I like that I can put in up in my bathroom on the mirror to see myself close up or far away</li>
    <li> You need to get used to the magnification but you have several distances you can use with this mirror.  Great detail and  I love the tweezers.</li>
    <li> I NEVER travel without this mirror.  Hotel lighting is always so awful so this goes on the window in the room and I have natural light.  My girlfriend loved the mirror so much I gave mine to her so this order was a replacement!</li>
    <li> Purchased this just after a trip to Tucson, and bathroom mirror was yet another example of poor design - especially for women. Mirror too far away to see to apply make up or see anything other than an overall view.  Have not used the mirror as of yet, but it seems like it might work well since I would be able to stick it up in the best light and it is magnified.  From other reviews - just have to be close in case it releases and crashes to the floor.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. She love it as it provides space for her entire face.</li>
    <li> Ever want to see those tiny bits of dirt, make-up, blackheads and unwanted hair on your face clearly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever wanted to know how flawlessly cleaned your teeth are?  Or what food was stuck in between?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evern wanted to see how much &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; are up inside your nose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then enlarge your view with this 10-INCH 8X magnifying mirror!  You would be able to see those minute details that may need a squeeze, tug, pull, wipe, brush, scrub, scratch, pick and whack!  Your date will be enamored of your flawless face and mucus free nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even comes with precision tweezers that you can bring and use anywhere!  In school...in the office...at the playground...under the sea....in space....or even while orbiting the moon.  And while there you can even bounce the sunlight using the mirror and aim it at your evil neighbor&#x27;s grill (he&#x27;ll never know why his burgers burned!).</li>
    <li> It is just what I wanted.  Only problem is the suction cups don&#x27;t stick real good.  It has fallen off my mirror twice.  Luckily it hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> It was bigger than the one that got broke but I&#x27;m glad turns out to be better.It&#x27;s on my bathroom window where I have to have it to get the natural light to put my make up on and pluck.</li>
    <li> The magnifying mirror is perfect for travel and the magnification is just right for me. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> The mirror is exactly what I wanted. Now that I am having trouble seeing to put my make-up on this was a very reasonable priced product that helps me see to do so. I will recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror  .  It&#x27;s bigger than the one I had and even though it&#x27;s magnification is 8 times normal, it is not distorted . It&#x27;s light in weight and packs very well . And, by the way, the tweezers are great too . I just threw my old one&#x27;s away .</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my bathroom as I love using hotel magnifying mirrors and thought why not have one at home?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;*good value for price, you also get a bonus tweezer&lt;br /&gt;*the suction cups grip glass surfaces with confidence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;*as others have mentioned you do have to get physically close to get the full magnification effect. You can not place this on the mirror in front of your sink as you will  have to lean in way too much. You will need to put this on a side mirror or door mirror where you can be inches away from it.&lt;br /&gt;*wish there was lighting option with this model, but then the price would probably go up as well&lt;br /&gt;*tweezers lost grip after a few uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good value, but if you are looking for a really high quality mirror you may want to look at other options. Also buy a separate pair of dedicated tweezers, the ones included with this I consider a \\&quot;bonus\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror for my wife and she loves it wishes she had it sooner it came as advertized and on time. I am looking for another one smaller for traveling.</li>
    <li> love it and travel every where I go</li>
    <li> I am very happy about all the selections I made and purchased thru Amazon.com. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  Finally I can see those hairs that grow all over my aging chin and neck!  And that tweezers is much better than the one I had.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.  I bought the X8 and it was plenty magnified enough.  I stuck it on the mirror over my sink and it looks fine there and is very convenient to lean over to to do that weekly plucking.  Plus, now I can finally see my eyes as I put eyeliner on!  Everyone needs one of these!</li>
    <li> My husband and I travel and this is the perfect size. We wouldn&#x27;t be without it. You can see yourself so well. And those tweezers are the best ever.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror and it arrived quickly - within a few days. I took it on vacation to a hotel that advertised that they supplied a magnifying mirror but those never have enough magnification for my 60-something eyes. I was able to stick this one right over their mirror using the suction cups, and it stayed in place nicely until I removed it when I left. It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see to apply makeup without it!</li>
    <li> Suction is good.  Great mirror.  Been using it for over a week now. Magnification takes a little to get used to but great product overall.</li>
    <li> Are you at the age and stage of needing a little help (visually) for those \\&quot;close-up\\&quot; shots?  Or do wonder if those \\&quot;younger eyes\\&quot; are seeing make-up flaws you missed?  Then, this mirror is a must!  Suction cups are easily attached and detached, so it travels well.  As for the tweezers, my own are better.</li>
    <li> I use it for shaving. Because of its size, it is very useful to find some &amp;#34;forgotten&amp;#34; single hairs, when a good shave is necessary.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  I had one previously that I accidentally left in my hotel room, so this is a replacement.  Great magnification with no distortion whatsoever!  Couldn&#x27;t put my makeup on without it!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect mirror!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The magnifying mirror is well made such that the image reflection is clear and a quality job of manufacturing.  The same with the tweezers.  Very well made, glad to have them in our med kit.  They are precise in tip construction such that they will be able to handle issues such as splinter removal and more.  Read the manufacturer specs on both items, and it can be assured they can be trusted.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I had hoped for- sticks on a mirror and with a little help from a knife, the suction lets go and you can take it with you.  Perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as we expected.</li>
    <li> This product (10&amp;#34; diameter, 8x mirror) meets all my expectations. It&#x27;s finally easy to see my reflection without correction lenses on this large mirror with full width magnification. Three suction cups hold the mirror in place on a non-porous surface, but I chose to use an additional hook and string to prevent the mirror from falling. I bought two of these items; if I had only purchased one mirror I would have ordered a second one, anyway, after seeing the quality.</li>
    <li> I take it with me when I travel….I have 50 yr old eyes and need it to put on makeup….I can stick it up on any mirror in the hotel room and apply my makeup easily.  I love that some hotels are providing magnification mirrors in their bathrooms, but most do not.  I like that I can clear out of the bathroom for someone else to use, and stick my mirror up in the room on any mirror or glass surface (window).  The tweezers are okay.  I like my &amp;#34;Tweezerman&amp;#34; tweezers better.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to my friends and family. The only thing is that it breaks easily when I dropped mine.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great, but if you are depending on the suction cups to work you may get a surprise often. It sticks well, but will eventually fall off. I have broken one of these already because of this. I think the mirror itself is decent quality, but it can use some improvements as s suction cup mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the second mirror broke, when the suction cups decided to give way. I ordered a third mirror and with in only a few days, suction cups failed again, and mirror shattered.  I love the mirror, but the fact that the suction cups aren&#x27;t dependable, leaves it less desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Update: I truly like the Mirror itself, but if you are planning to use the suction cups you may want to consider another Mirror. I am going on my third mirror now, and it is broken as well. The suction cups gave way, I only had it a week, and now it is now broken once more. I will not buy this mirror again, because I can&#x27;t afford to replace it every few weeks.</li>
    <li> everything went perfect</li>
    <li> Have ordered before. Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Great mirror, magnifies great (a little scarey when your my age) stays attached to bathroom mirror. good buy.</li>
    <li> Ordered this mirror as a replacement for a previous smaller mirror that had lost suction and shattered on the floor. How did I get alone without this amazing mirror for so many years?&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is amazing and I was more than pleased for picking this one. The 3 suctions hold tight on a window for the natural light. The tweezers are the best I have ever had and are worth the price alone without the extra bonus of the mirror. My mom came to visit and loved using this mirror so much she bought 2 for herself. You will not be dissapointed with this incrediable buy!</li>
    <li> Suction cups held mirror to shower wall for about two weeks before it fell in the middle of the night shattering the mirror.  The same think happened to the original one I had, but at least it stuck to the wall for months.  Would be better if hung from a stick on hook or the mirror was polished metal that would not break if it fell.  It was quite alarming when both fell and broke.  Both occurred in the middle of the night and it took some time to determine what the noise was.  Both times we thought someone was trying to break into the house and had broken a window.  Not a good way to wake up from a sound sleep.</li>
    <li> I am older and do not see well to put on makeup I needed a large magnifying mirror.  I had one similar, but it broke.  I have been looking to replace it but could not find one big enough. This one has great magnification, is large enough to see my whole face,not just 1 eye at a time. Tweezers so-so??</li>
    <li> fast shipper. as advertised.</li>
    <li> the mirror is a great size and perfect magnification! really very nice for travel and tweezing my eye brows. perfect!</li>
    <li> This product is just what I needed.  It works just like I want.</li>
    <li> 8x is the perfect enlargement for those pesky face hairs; love the tweezers also</li>
    <li> cant see my face until it is too close</li>
    <li> I purchased this for applying makeup after a workout at the gym.  The three suction cups really secure it to the gym mirror in a steamy environment.  I good purchase; which came on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works great. Is just as described. Stays suctioned and is perfect for being able to see close up.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. I have not had any issues with the mirror falling. I keep it attached on my medicine cabinet mirror above my sink. Nice for applying make-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror like this for a long time.  This one was very easy to mount on my existing mirror and it has just the right magnification- I can use it without wearing my glasses!  This one is a winner.</li>
    <li> I always take my mirror with me when I travel and the DB-Tech 10\\&quot; Suction Magnifying Mirror is exactly what I need to see clearly to apply makeup wherever I am.</li>
    <li> The magnification is uneven and as a result the image is distorted. I could not use this product to put in contacts because of this. I ended up throwing it out. And the suction cups don&#x27;t adhere to anything.</li>
    <li> I had purchased another mirror by a different distributor on Amazon  a while back but it broke (because it fell) that I absolutely loved.  So, I went back to Amazon to locate another mirror.  This type of mirror has come with me on numerous vacations as well because it&#x27;s very hard to put makeup on when you can&#x27;t see close up.  I use it faithfully at home and have even given it to a friend as a gift to try and they loved the magnification.  Really can&#x27;t live without it.  Have never found a mirror locally in stores around me that I can attach to a mirror (I have looked forever) so needless to say, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  As a matter of fact, I purchased two in case of another &amp;#34;accident&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Updated 5/20/13 - I really LOVED this mirror.  However, the suction cups didn&#x27;t hold, and the mirror kept falling into the sink.  Yes... eventually, the mirror broke.  :(  I did replace it with another product:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AS1N8K/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1.  So far... the new mirror is holding.  The other mirror is a lot smaller, but I like it.  Again... I really liked the original mirror, and had I been home more often, probably could have checked how well it was holding (suctioned??) to the mirror in the bathroom.  Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the suction cup option; it is always available for use, as I keep it on the top corner of my bathroom mirror.  Magnification is as expected, and seems true as opposed to a couple comments about it being skewed.  Tweezers were a throw away; not at all effective.  But, as I didn&#x27;t purchase the mirror for the tweezers... that&#x27;s just fine!</li>
    <li> Does all it promises.  Excellent suction cups; make sure you are fairly commited to the location.  Tweezers are an unexpected good quality bonus</li>
    <li> As soon as I received it, I noticed that the suction cups were made of very light plastic, looked too soft and some were defective, with a strange irregular shape. When I tried to make it stick to the bathroom tile wall, it became apparent one of thrree suction cups did not work at all. With a lot of effort, the other two seemed to work. In the middle of the night it fell and broke into a thousand pieces. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> OMG, Everyone needs to own this.  You will be soooo embarrassed when you see what others maybe seeing.  YIKES!  I&#x27;m addicted to this mirror.  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> The product is very well made, and the tweezer addition really nice, but I apparently got the wrong magnification for my eyes (tried to be careful about that, when a couple of other reviewers had said the 10x was too distorting/strong). It is a real strain on my eyes to try to look into this 8x magnification mirror, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem easily to give me the clear view I need to help put on eye makeup. I just can&#x27;t use it, sad to say. I had used one of my sister&#x27;s before, and it was just fine, but maybe it was 5x or lower--don&#x27;t know. I will see if my daughter can use this one.</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror.  I used to have one similar but lost it or broke it and have been looking for another one ever since.  This mirror is perfect for make-up, tweezing, all that stuff that you can&#x27;t see when you get OLD!</li>
    <li> My wife has gone through a few magnifying mirrors - they use find their untimely end when they are dropped onto our bathrooms ceramic floor. I hope that our luck has changed and we manage to keep the DB-Tech 10\\&quot; magnifying mirror attached to our shower door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -  A large 10\\&quot; mirror that offers 8x magnification. it works well, and since it is so large it is very easy to see your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Three suctions cups located on the back of the mirror. Although a fourth suction cup may have come in handy , since it did fall off of our shower door. I cleaned the shower door and it seems to stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The tweezers are a different story. While I think they are fine for my use my wife said that they weren&#x27;t as nice as her high-end tweezers. Apparently plucking eyebrows requires a heavy duty set of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - A very nice mirror with a functional set of tweezers (for men) - the mirror has both 8x magnification, large in size, and it is a great value. The mirror, alone, is well worth the overall cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note - I received this product for reviewing purposes</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2SSZL8IRUFGQM]]This is a high quality mirror that features a great magnification level.  We found the optical and reflective properties of the mirror to be very good and you can clearly see great detail of your face.  The mirror is circular with a clear bezel ring around it.  The mirror features 8 X magnification and the large size of the mirror lets you basically see your entire face in it.  The back of the mirror has three reasonable sized suction cups to allow you to stick it to the shower wall or door.  Ours is going to be on our marble shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror also comes with a pair of surgical stainless steel tweezers with slanted tips.  This mirror is ideal for the bathroom to help with your female and male personal grooming.  We liked the product and rated it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I received a sample of the product for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> I love how this mirror magnifies.  It&#x27;s an 8-time magnifier so I can really see spots of makeup on my face that I didn&#x27;t apply very good.  The suctions on the back hold the mirror in place perfectly to where it doesn&#x27;t slip or slide.  The circumference of the mirror is plenty big enough to see your whole face.  I love this mirror and am very happy to have bought it.  Plus it&#x27;s great to take when traveling too.</li>
    <li> The 8X magnification of this mirror provides a very up close view of you face. To get the best viewing angle, hold it 6 inches or so out in front of you while using it. This is just the right distance and magnification for applying eyeliner and plucking eyebrows, which you can do with the included precision tweezers. While the mirror is nice and large, it&#x27;s not overly heavy. This is good for those who might normally have a hard time holding anything weighty in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three suction cups on the back of the mirror which you can use to stick this onto a smooth surface, if you&#x27;d rather use it hands-free. It would work well attached to the top of a full length mirror or a wall mirror, since you can easily get close to it to use it. Attaching it to your bathroom vanity mirror may cause you to need to lean over your sink some to get close enough to it to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers have nice thick rubber finger grips, making them easy to hold and pluck eyebrows with. They are have a nice edge on them, so they grip small items well. This mirror and tweezers combo will help you get a very close up view of your face so you can apply your makeup and couture your eyebrows perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> I took this traveling and absolutely love this mirror.  I did not receive the tweezers, but, actually, i didn&#x27;t care.  The mirror is perfect for seeing your whole face, when putting on makeup....I&#x27;m going to order another because i&#x27;m so pleased....i didn&#x27;t have any issues with any distortion....</li>
    <li> they are great the mirror quality is good.  The last time I bought them the mirrors were distorted.  I ordered 4 broke one it fell of the mirror I put it on and sent the rest back.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to surfaces.  I tried everything I could think of, getting suction cups wet, tried to stick it to my window as well as my mirror.  Neither worked.  Very annoying.  Best thing I can say about the mirror is even though it would fall, it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Love the new mirror, now I can see every little thing on my face!  Just kidding, really like it.  It does the job!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror, just what I needed...  And I can take it with me when I travel.  Tweezers are awesome as well.</li>
    <li> Not sure why someone came up with the idea of this magnifying mirror that has suction cups so that it can be placed anywhere it needs to go, but who ever thought of it deserves the gratitude of those of us who use reading glasses (!) to put it gently.  The magnification of this mirror is excellent - just right for getting up close to go after that tiny ingrown hair, or that eyebrow hair that needs careful attention, or the plucking of ear hairs, nose hairs (the list could go on, but...). It is great for the shower because it can go anywhere you need it - on the wall where the shower head protrudes, on the glass door, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one feature of the mirror may not be explored by many. It is really handy when doing those close-up jobs of screwing the screws into your glasses&#x27; sidebars, changing the digital areas on the watch, or any little job that could benefit form actually SEEING what you&#x27;re doing. These should sell very well - and women are sure to find multiple uses for them for vanity purposes. A great little product! Grady Harp, March 13</li>
    <li> This mirror serves my old eyes well. I can see all I need to see. However, the &amp;#34;Precision Tweezers&amp;#34; did not accompany my order. I wish they had.  I could use a good pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> I want to point out that the mirror itself measures under 8\\&quot; in diameter. Including the clear acrylic bezel, the mirror measures 9-1/4\\&quot;. It has three suction cups attached to the back, each measuring 1-3/4\\&quot; across. I ended up taking it down, about every other day it would lose suction and fall off my regular, full-size bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is slightly concave, so there is distortion until you get your face within 5\\&quot; of the mirror, at that point, you CAN see your entire face and it does a good job with the 8X magnification. I&#x27;m scarier up close than I thought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try the tweezers since I&#x27;m too chicken to use any, however, they looked like some you&#x27;d pick up in a dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars for \\&quot;It&#x27;s OK!\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a nice mirror for travel because I don&#x27;t think it is real mirror glass so it&#x27;s not breakable. If you have an upscale bathroom, this would not be suited to leave out and attached to a wall, it&#x27;s too cheaply made.</li>
    <li> When I first took this out of the box I thought it was VERY blurry. Then, as I brought it closer to my face I realized I was just too far away. At about 4 inches I could see every single flaw. I mean every teensy tiny flaw! It was not only clear, it was revealing ... I think I may have nightmares. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are easy to handle, I like the grip on them, but they hurt just as much as the old fashioned one when plucking eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this is the size (nice and large), the clarity close up, and the ability to suction it to my bathroom mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is the focal point, which is really a bit too close for my normal use .. a few steps away from the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, it is great for those tiny things, like eyeliner, and as a reviewer, it is super for comparing products for review - you really can see the difference after applying them. So I am grateful to have received a complimentary sample for testing ... now I can use it to test other stuff.</li>
    <li> Well, I received this product for a review from the manufacturer and I was very impressed by the quality. No distortion, solid build, high-quality precision tweezers included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was happy times for my \\&quot;older eyes\\&quot; that needed a close-up view when getting ready in the morning!! ......unfortunately this mirror was kidnapped by my college-aged daughters to be used in their bathroom, and now I have ordered another from Amazon for myself.  My girls tell me this would be the perfect Christmas gift for teen-age and up cousins and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the just the right size, suction cups work great affixed to mirror surface. Can&#x27;t find anything just like it at the beauty supply store even!  So well worth it.</li>
    <li> the mirror was never very clear in the shower and after a few months the suction cups gave way &amp; it fell &amp; broke on the shower floor. You can get better tweezers at any drug store.</li>
    <li> This magnifying mirror has three suction cups. This allows you to place it on any mirror. I find it works great on the bathroom mirror. Now I can see every pore and every stray eyebrow hair. You will be amazed at how much you can see. If you are over 45 or have vision issues like I do then you will really appreciate this mirror. The tweezers are also very good and precise. I was actually shocked to see I had quite a few blocked pores which I would never have noticed without this mirror. Looks like I need some of those Biore strips. This mirror will show you the true condition of your skin and pores. I love this mirror and think you will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free in exchange for a review. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> These suction cups don&#x27;t suck. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money - go get the one at your local drug store.</li>
    <li> Perfect size - hard to find 8x magnifying around town - only 5 or 10 available.  Needed something in between.  Tweezers very good, also.</li>
    <li> Great for plucking eyebrows, applying makeup etc.  Good tweezers too.I simply can&#x27;t function without it now that I have gotten used to it.  If you have trouble seeing close up, its really good to have this.</li>
    <li> I am very glad I purchased this mirror. I use it everyday when applying makeup. The tweezer that came with it, is a nice plus - I use it as well.</li>
    <li> Good quality mirror And nice size.</li>
    <li> This was a gift &amp; have not gotten any feedback from the receiver, but anticipate that it will be satifactory.</li>
    <li> Nice and big mirror. nice big magnifying power.</li>
    <li> Wonderful wonderful wonderful</li>
    <li> This is my third one, one for a second home and replacing one I dropped and broke-my fault. Perfect for shaving in the shower if you have a non-porous surface to attach it to. Highly recommend this product .</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> This 8x magnifying mirror is great for travel. It is light weight and attaches to smooth surfaces with suction cups, so it is very convenient for me.</li>
    <li> The suction cups hold the magnifying mirror securely on my vanity mirror.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about it falling off the counter and shattering on a tile floor.  Tweezers are well designed so that I can hold a fine hair.</li>
    <li> The mirror was perpetually fogged, even after the application of an anti-fogging agent, and the magnification level was excessive. And why include tweezers?</li>
    <li> Did not appear any different than a 7x power that we have</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for a large stick on mirror with magnification for traveling.</li>
    <li> Love the mirror!  The magnification is perfect for my eye sight ...some mirrors have been too strong. I cannot wait to take this mirror on our next trip</li>
    <li> This is a well made sturdy mirror. Has suction cups that look strong but I just hold it while I use it. GREAT magnification and clarity for detail work. The tweezer is hefty enough so you can grab it right away and is easy to use. I have a 1930&#x27;s bathroom mirror so I need extra help to check for details with skin and beard care.</li>
    <li> I got the mirror, but the tweezers were not in the package.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for. The tweezers do a pretty good job as well. It is not the mirrors fault that every time I look into it there is an old lady looking back. I can see every hair, wrinkle and blemish but that&#x27;s what I bought it for.....GREAT mirror, that is if you really want to know what you look like...LOL!</li>
    <li> The 10in.is great, and the 8x magnifying is better then the 5x that I have. 3 suction cups hold the mirror in place, so it will not fall. The precision tweezers are just ok, but I was buying the 8x MIRROR not tweezers. All the stores i checked had standup mirrors , or 3in suction cup mirrors. This was the only place I could find the 10in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ezcmj</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect!  The mirrors at the store were 5 or 7x....but I needed 8x (or I hoped that&#x27;s all I needed) and I was right!  Also, nice and big at 10&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> No doubt when I saw this mirror I was impressed.  No, I wasn&#x27;t all that pleased when I looked into it and saw every little flaw on my face magnified, but was impressed by the type of mirror it was.  I have an old-fashioned mirror that actually rests on my shoulders and flips from a magnified side to one of no magnification, but it&#x27;s quite a pain to use.  This type of mirror is rather uncommon these days, to say nothing of awkward to use.  And then there are the mirrors that have extension arms that are attached to the wall. I&#x27;ve often encountered them in hotels and that&#x27;s just where they belong.  I have no wall space to hang one, to say nothing of the price they command.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pedestal mirrors are nice, but often get broken.  They too can be rather pricey and even the big box stores command a pretty penny.  You can choose everything from nickel to brass brushed.  I know because I went shopping for one once and was rather disappointed with the selection, price, and lack of function.  Mind you, I&#x27;m not fussy, but I was shopping for a gift and never did find what I wanted.  Maybe I&#x27;m picky, but it&#x27;s usually for a reason.  I&#x27;ll tell you what I like about this particular, unique mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  The three suctions cups allow the user to put the mirror at a convenient height.  No stooping at a table or vanity to peer into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  The 8\\&quot; of mirror space (10\\&quot; across if you include the plastic) allows me to see my entire face, not just a portion of it like some of the swivel mirrors do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  The 8x magnification is perfect for any farsighted person.  You can simply \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; the mirror by moving your face closer or further away from the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  Once you are through with the mirror, you can simply take it down from either your own vanity mirror or other mirror/glass surface, put it back in the box and tuck it away out of sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  This is an excellent magnification for those who want to do eyebrow shaping or makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  A set of tweezers is included (3 3/4\\&quot; long) with an easy-to-use centralized plastic grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I find that comparatively, this mirror is quite reasonably priced in comparison to many I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unique, functional mirror is quite economical and although not the most \\&quot;attractive\\&quot; I&#x27;ve seen it has more going for it that a lot I&#x27;ve seen.  If you want something that&#x27;s functional and can be tucked away, this one is perfect.  As I mentioned, there are swivel mirrors, ones with extension arms, brass and nickel plated ones.  If you want a useful one, as I do, I&#x27;d probably stick with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by the distributor.shaping or makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  A set of tweezers is included (3 3/4\\&quot; long) with an easy-to-use centralized plastic grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I find that comparatively, this mirror is quite reasonably priced in comparison to many I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unique, functional mirror is quite economical and although not the most \\&quot;attractive\\&quot; I&#x27;ve seen it has more going for it that a lot I&#x27;ve seen.

    <li> I am so pleased to see this mirror is still available. After years of use, moving and traveling with it, the suction cups just wore out. When it fell off my bathroom mirror twice in 12 hours, I knew it was time to search for a replacement. I would recommend this mirror to everyone. I really don&#x27;t need the tweezers as incentive to order.</li>
    <li> Love the magnification capabilities of this mirror. This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. The only problem is that sometimes the mirror would come unglued from the frame + fall on the floor, so I would Krazy Glue it back in. This last time, it broke so I had to replace. Hoping to avoid the 7 years of bad luck!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and much less expensive than Linens-n-Things where I had purchased others.</li>
    <li> Not that anyone wants to see their pores magnified or wrinkles enhanced, but this sure makes tweezing those annoying stray eyebrow hairs easy. Easy to adhere to your vanity mirror, it doesn&#x27;t take up valuable counter space. It&#x27;s also portable for travel. The tweezers that came with it are ok, but I like my old ones better. Shipped fast, just as promised.</li>
    <li> Better than expected. I had one similar years ago and the suction cups were small and inadequate causing it to fall off my bathroom mirror and break. This one has three large suction cups and is a very good price compared to others I have seen.</li>
    <li> After having a similar model fall off my shower door 3 times I went on a quest for a replacement that was more secure and less inclined to earn me any more bad luck. 3 mirrors later I came back to this style, took a chance on this brand and it is perfect. I use it for tweezing - wonderful - and eye makeup application. This mirror is perfect for intended use. I have secured it with 3M hooks so hopefully I can ward off any more bad juju and enjoy it for years to come! I have yet to use the tweezers so can&#x27;t attest to their worth at this time - were promptly lost in a pile of mail in my living room, I think.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my Mother and she loves it because she doesn&#x27;t need to put in her contacts to see with this mirror!</li>
    <li> I like this mirror...  it&#x27;s bigger than most at a very competitive price and allows you to really see.  They need to make a 45 or 90 degree version.</li>
    <li> Awesome mirror. Love the size and magnification</li>
    <li> Magnifying glass broke upon arrival.  I tried to hang it on top of a mirror and it fell to the ground and broke.  Upon examination I noticed that I failed to remove pieces  of carton attached to the suction cups.  My fault, yet proper instructions would have been useful.  No instructions were provided with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror.  I can&#x27;t see as well as I used to and this helps tremendously when putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to use to put on my makeup.  Great to take on vacation and use at home.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Huge! Perfect for my bathroom window! Love it! The tweezers are junk just like most are but the mirror is terrific!</li>
    <li> I also purchased the Luxor Cosmetic mirror- Large Magnifying Stick Up Mirror 5X / 9&amp;#34; Diameter, for my wife after she forgot to pack hers when returning from vacation. She tells me that both are great magnifiers and that the image is clear and well focused in both mirrors. I&#x27;ve checked my reflection in both of them, and I can&#x27;t find fault with them either, other than the fact that they are on the mirror above the sink making me have to look around them to shave. &amp;#34;The things we men do for our wives so they won&#x27;t kill us for the things we forgot to do&amp;#34;. Buy the mirror, &amp;#34;Happy wife happy life&amp;#34;, ain&#x27;t it the truth.</li>
    <li> great mirror, but make sure you re-suction w/ water now and again, or it may fall off</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;ve reached a certain age, I must wear reading glasses for close work like applying eye make-up, but the glasses get in the way. I&#x27;ve tried those magnifying glasses with only one, swiveling lens, but they just don&#x27;t work well. Until now I used a 3\\&quot; magnifying mirror, but it was really too small for seeing my whole face and it had distortion on the sides and the suction cups were crappy and didn&#x27;t stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is wonderful! The mirror is distortion-free and the 10\\&quot; size is perfect. It is surrounded by a thick, clear plastic frame. Best of all, it has 3 suction cups on the back that work perfectly. They aren&#x27;t those floppy ones that come unstuck easily - they are thick and stiff and the suction really holds. It is stuck solidly on my bathroom mirror and it&#x27;s not moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with tweezers, which are kind of lightweight, but the slant tips meet perfectly and they work well. Not sure how long they will last, but I don&#x27;t care. The mirror rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because just like reading glasses, we all need different levels of magnification, you should figure out what magnification works best for you before ordering. This one is 8X and is perfect for me standing about a foot from the mirror. Others may need the 5X or the 10X. Once you figure out the strength you need, you&#x27;ll be delighted with this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was provided this mirror in exchange for my candid and unbiased review of the product. No promise was made or implied for a positive review.</li>
    <li> I shopped a lot of similar mirrors and settled on this one. It stays stuck to the mirror and provides a clear reflection. The tweezers were thrown in for good measure and that was about what they were worth. But I would have bought the mirror anyway.</li>
    <li> My magnifying mirror hangs 24/7 from my bathroom mirror for use on a constant basis.  I use it when applying my makeup everyday.  My husband uses it when he needs to &amp;#34;check out his face&amp;#34; for various reasons.  This is the second mirror I&#x27;ve purchased as the first one is stored in my suitcase to hang on hotel mirrors when traveling.</li>
    <li> Trying to resolve a problem with an old magnifying mirror, I found this product. It was perfectly described, reasonably priced  and promtly delivered.  I love it.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Perfect. This is just what I was looking for but couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else. Love the price too. Just right.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for 2 years for a magnifying mirror of this size and someone suggested I go to Amazon and so I did and it certainly helps me put on eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Had to send this product back, as the magnification was so strong I couldn&#x27;t see in the mirror.  Nice quality, but not for the average person&#x27;s eyesight.</li>
    <li> This size x 10 magnificatoin is almost impossible to find.  The product arrived in a timely manner and to the quality specs which I would have expected.  A great value as well.</li>
    <li> P&amp;eacute;simo no funciono bien la succi&amp;oacute;n y termino por romperse al caer, duro 30 min no lo compren</li>
    <li> This mirror provides great magnification.  It took a few days before it consistently adhered to my wall mirror but seems to be holding up well now.  The tweezers were a wonderful bonus, and I use them almost every day!</li>
    <li> A very good product... magnified so well it scared me!</li>
    <li> Great product. Flawless and perfect in every detail.</li>
    <li> did not stay on wall, broke after second drop</li>
    <li> Great mirror, purchased to use when I travel. Lightweight, easy to use, and clear image.Wish I had bought one years ago!!</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase.  There are three suction cups on the back and they work great.  I am very pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> Fits on the wall mirror perfectly. With the right light, it magnifies your face as good as I assume anyone would need. It also looks nice with the opaque ring around it. Almost looks like it would be a light. (Probably would be a good idea to have made it light, although it wouldn&#x27;t be this cheap.) Need to see how long the suction holds and whether the mirror will break when it falls if the suction quits. The tweezers don&#x27;t work as well as I would l have liked. But I didn&#x27;t really buy it for the tweezers.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this mirror/tweezers.  Could&#x27;nt find anything like this anywhere.  Great size, magnification, tweezers are awesome.  I am missing the plastic cover it came in.  Could you send me another please??</li>
    <li> Mirror is nice and big the tweezers do not grab very good.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, no distortion, very secure with 3 large suction cups.  Best one I&#x27;ve had! The tweezers were a bonus, which I really sisn;t need.  Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. It stick where ever I want it and stays, High quality, and very BIG! I bought two so I would not have to keep moving it.</li>
    <li> Great size and not too heavy for airplane travel.  I do not use the tweezers.  I feel that they could have been left out.</li>
    <li> I find this a perfect makeup mirror. Great magnification, excellent suction cups and fine quality. I expect to have it for many years.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for shaving because my eyes are so bad. Good quiality at a good price. I have recommened to friends</li>
    <li> I like this mirror for make-up application or using tweezers, but lower magnification recommended for men, who like for shaving.</li>
    <li> Makes applying makeup a breeze.  Clear image.  Stays put on larger mirror.  Tweezers aren&#x27;t special, but mirror is! Wish it had anti-fog coating.</li>
    <li> I love my new mirrow, which I bought to replace my old one when it broke.  This on has a much greater magnification and works well for me as I use it when I put on my make-up without my glasses on.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror!  Just what I needed to see the little details my eyes don&#x27;t see anymore.  Tried a small mirror, but couldn&#x27;t see enough of my face.  This is perfect.</li>
    <li> This a good quality magnifying mirror. I am a sculptor making a narcissism piece that requires a mirror in which the viewer sees the self as somewhat larger than life. 10 inches is a good size for my sculpture. I opened the package and saw that the mirror was indeed boxed in an attractive white box that labeled it as a 10&amp;#34; mirror. Suspecting a mistake, I immediately measured the box with a ruler (also made in the same country of origin). The outside of the BOX containing the advertised 10 inch mirror is less than 9.5 inches. The actual mirror has a diameter less than 8 inches. Including the clear plastic frame, the whole thing has a diameter of 9.125 inches. This is nearly an inch smaller than described. How could the maker, the importer, and Amazon all fail to notice that this product is nearly an inch smaller than it claims to be? This mirror does make your face look bigger than real. The description even makes you think the mirror itself is bigger than real until it arrives and you see how small it actually is.</li>
    <li> This mirror is amazing. It was exactly what I needed to replace one that I broke. AWESOME.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday, stays on the bathroom mirror.  Helps with those &#x27;little details&#x27; I can&#x27;t see in the regular mirror anymore</li>
    <li> It was just what had been broken ..has worked wonderful.Thanks for you swift action and good quality product.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a Merry Christmas..marge miller</li>
    <li> This mirror was a bit larger than expected which is a positive in my opinion. (about the size of a plate) I had read a lot of reviews about some mirrors being smaller than expected so I was trying to avoid that. The tweezers than come with this are good quality and sharp enough to grab little stubbles trying to peak out of my eyebrows. I like this mirror because it is easy to stick and easy to remove. I move it from the bathroom mirror to the dresser mirror and even stick it to my window if I fancy some outdoor natural light or just extra lighting. It shows every detail quite well so it&#x27;s quite close to perfect for a magnifying mirror. This mirror isn&#x27;t lighted as some of them are so if you need additional light I would recommend another mirror or maybe using it by a window.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror to replace an old 8X suction cup mirror.  When this one came through it had more magnification (probably 10X) but after installing it, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and all is well.</li>
    <li> Great size, sticks well to my mirror. Fast shipping. Great quality...no distortion.  Great packing...I would recommend this mirror.  Price is great too!</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for. It has large suction cups and there is no distortion. It arrived when I expected it.</li>
    <li> Is Perfect for on my bathroom mirror!  Exactly what I was looking for! thanks!</li>
    <li> As we all get older, vision deteriorates.  This mirror helps me see what I need to see and is large enough to make that easy.</li>
    <li> Es lo que queria, estoy muy satisfecho con este articulo, lleno mis espectativas, es liviano, se ve muy bien, me gusta!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.  Now I can see my makeup!  Sticks great to the bathroom mirror.  No distortion noticed.</li>
    <li> Mirror is great, but the tweezers do not work very well</li>
    <li> this is a great mirror and I have had it up for months with no problems.</li>
    <li> Lightweight plastic.  Very nice mirror.  Tweezers are &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this!the size is fantastic and the 8x magnifier is great for those hard to see areas when you are tweezing.  the only complaint i had was the box was not well taped and through the APO system the tape did not hold well.</li>
    <li> Definitely can see every detail - whether I want to or not.  Keep in mind this is a magnifying mirror, so will not reflect image at a further distance.  I definitely appreciate the size of the mirror (10&amp;#34;) - so much easier to put on make-up while viewing the entire face.  Sticks onto our larger bathroom mirror perfectly - to get off, I carefully take off one suction cup at a time while holding the mirror.  It&#x27;s a durable mirror that I can see will last a long time.  But the real seller on this item has to be the BEST precision tweezers come with it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought it as a shower mirror for shaving, but it&#x27;s clearly not made for that since the magnification is so strong. Would have been nice if the pictures showed this some how. Tweezers work well.</li>
    <li> It looks and works well, but it eventually loses suction and falls off. I had it stuck to a larger mirror. It took a few months, but it fell off and damaged the mirror frame in the process. Probably ok, if you reapply it occasionally, but a little risky</li>
    <li> Terrific mirror.  Provides very clear magnified image.  The tweezers are okay.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for traveling when you can&#x27;t see close up.  Fit very well in my suitcase</li>
    <li> I started out with a smaller magnifying mirror that I got at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which really helped with tweezing eyebrows, putting on mascara, etc., since my eyes aren&#x27;t working as well at age 50!  I realized I wanted a similar larger mirror that I could stick on my regular bathroom mirror to see my whole face and do my makeup, and this is a good size for that. You do have to be close to it, and since my cabinet door swings out and has a mirror on both sides, I can put it on there, and have it close to my face while using it.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t work as well for someone who just had to stick it on their regular mirror and lean all the way forward over their counter towards it.  You can see why the make the ones with arms that attach to the wall swing out towards you - but this is the next best thing, since I don&#x27;t have room for one of those on my bathroom wall.</li>
    <li> The mirror has 8X magnification that prevented it from being used as a shaving mirror. I was able to return this mirror to the seller.</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted and in short order.</li>
    <li> This is a good item serves it purpose for older people have trouble seeing without their glasses&lt;br /&gt;Would not go higher than a 10 zoom have a 25 and makes your face look terrible</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these to stick to the mirrored door on the medicine cabinets over my sinks.  First impressions: 1.) Great clarity and magnification, 2.) DAMN!, I&#x27;m old! ( ... at 8X, all those wrinkles and pores look like canyons and potholes).  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with the 3 suction cups on the back of the mirror, but both of mine came loose in the middle of the night and crashed -- mirror face down, of course -- into the sink below ... scared the bejesus out of our cats.  So, now, not only am I out $30 for the two mirrors, I also get 7 x 2 &#x3D; 14 years of bad luck?  That kinda blows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers included with the mirrors are great; you could do serious surgery with those things.  But it&#x27;s kind of an odd thing to include with a magnifying mirror ... like shipping a hammer with a box of Band-Aids?</li>
    <li> This is BIG.  I think this would have been OK if it had been a little smaller.  It also has 3 suction cups on the back, due, I&#x27;m sure to it&#x27;s size.  It&#x27;s pretty hard to get the mirror off once it&#x27;s on there.  It does give you a GOOD look, though, but I didn&#x27;t get the tweezers.  I did notice this when I received the mirror but didn&#x27;t check to see if they should have been included.  Now, I guess, with this picture, it seems I should have gotten them.  Guess I&#x27;ll contact Amazon and see about getting it.  UPDATE:  The more I use this the more trying to get it off whatever it&#x27;s attached to while using is A GIANT PAIN IN THE A - -!  You need a tool to slide behind the mirror to go under the suction cup because the DAMN THING WON&#x27;T COME OFF ANY OTHER WAY.  And God forbid that more than one should GRAB AHOLD.  And sometimes if you use just one suction cup the thing will \\&quot;travel\\&quot; down the mirror or window.  Wish I had my old one back.&lt;br /&gt;My first mirror broke so I had to order another one.  Let me say something positive about this mirror first.  The magnification is great.  That being said, the first mirror was hard to get off whatever surface I stuck it to. This one \\&quot;travels\\&quot; on the window. You stick it on and in a couple of minutes it&#x27;s traveling across the window.  I wet the suction cups and it still travels.  Couldn&#x27;t get the first one off, this one I can&#x27;t seem to make it stick.  As to the tweezers, not good at all.  Went back to my old ones.  One of these days this company will get it right.</li>
    <li> I love it. The size and the magnifying whithou distorcion are excelent.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for a good make up.</li>
    <li> When you were glasses, this type of mirror is a must. I would never be able to tweeze my brows without it.</li>
    <li> Love the idea that I can move the mirror around to get the best lighting possible.  I didn&#x27;t think much of the tweezers that were included.</li>
    <li> Love this highly magnified mirror stuck on my mirror in bath- perfect for my age (69) or anyone who wears glasses but needs to put make-up without glasses-- this is for you!!</li>
    <li> It works well and magnifies as expected. tweezers are much but I was buying the mirror not the tweezers. Suction cups work reasonably well but are not rock solid.</li>
    <li> As described. Well packed, no problems</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel.  I use it on a stand as attaching it to a mirror or other surface does not allow me to focus well enough.  Has the same problems as any other high-powered round  magnifiers in that the edges are pretty much worthless, but it surely is nice to be able to find one&#x27;s eyes with the liner pencil. Where I go, it goes!</li>
    <li> Great Product and Great Service.</li>
    <li> I consider this an excellent mirror for the money and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I can see everything little thing and that in itself is a good for me and the public.</li>
    <li> But I did not receive the tweezers with my order.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was surprised when I first looked into this magnification mirror.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see such detail...so clearly!  Every little wrinkle was right there before my eyes, even without my reading glasses.  Of course, that is what you want a magnifying mirror for...to see the tiny details, but I&#x27;ve never had a mirror work this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is nice and large to magnify your entire face at one time...not just a portion of it like others I have had.  It&#x27;s 9 1/4 inches round including the clear acrylic rim that makes an attractive frame and gives you something to grasp without leaving fingerprints on the mirror.  It&#x27;s lightweight considering it&#x27;s size.  There are three large suction cups on the back to attach to your bathroom or dressing mirror, but I keep mine in the linen closet and pull it out as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My vision isn&#x27;t what it used to be, so this mirror is especially helpful to me in putting on mascara.  My husband gets the most use out of it, however, for plucking ingrown beard hairs.  This is the first mirror that really provides enough magnification for him, and he also likes the easy-to-grip tweezers they included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I have seen a mirror something like this selling on TV before, but it was not this large and was a lot more expensive.  This is a quality mirror at a good price.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moKTCU6EH6WAR0]]My wife uses this mirror and thinks its great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  mirror is actually only 7-3/4\\&quot; in diameter, not 10\\&quot; as described. In fact, the entire mirror including bezel is not even 10\\&quot; but only 9-1/4\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Is that a big deal? No. But it would be more helpful if the product was described accurately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has a thin profile which would make easy to pack and thus it is ideal for travel. It&#x27;s much larger than most \\&quot;travel\\&quot; mirrors. The 8x magnification is very revealing,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three suction cups really have excellent holding power provided the surface you are mounting the mirror to is clean and non-porus. We&#x27;ve had great success mountint the mirror on tile and on a larger bathroom mirror. The mirror has never lost it&#x27;s grip so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers out of the box were a little bent so that the tweezer tips weren&#x27;t touching. It was easy however to gently adjust the tweezers to get them aligned properly and they now work well. My wife says they are sharp and accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice quality mirror and tweezer combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
    <li> Really helps with getting a clean shave when a persons eye sight starts to go. Now I don&#x27;t look like a partially shaved bum. I get a clean shave every time.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for travel.  Large, but not too large.  Great mirror.  I started using at home to see how it would work and it&#x27;s better than the one I had been using that swings out from my wall....so now I stuck it on top of the other and am using it all the time!</li>
    <li> I occasionally like to shave while in the shower, and have a major problem - can&#x27;t see without my glasses. Regular shower mirrors just don&#x27;t work since it&#x27;s just a blur. This magnifying mirror works great. Magnifies everything so that even without my glasses, I can see what I&#x27;m doing without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very lightweight, which is a good quality in a suction-cup mirror. The three suction cups hold it very securely against smooth tile. As with any suction cup, the tile needs to be spotless for good adhesion (I cleaned the tile with rubbing alcohol) and the cups should be damp when you stick them on. I&#x27;ve not had any problems with getting the cups to stick very tightly to the tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a little distortion in the mirror but nothing that caused a problem (and, with my face magnified 8 times, distortion is not a bad thing!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to not that you have to be very close to the mirror to use it. It does not have an articulating arm. Although it&#x27;s not advertised as a fogless mirror, I haven&#x27;t had any fogging problems to the extent that it interfered with using it to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror comes with a pair of tweezers. They seem OK - haven&#x27;t had a need to use them. But, a nice add-on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the most stylish mirror I&#x27;ve seen, but it works well and the quality is better than expected given the price. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[The manufacturer provided the product for review]</li>
    <li> loved it. i&#x27;ve tried for months to find this mirror at BBB and Ulta etc no one had anything more than 5x. the 8x is best and great size.</li>
    <li> My sight isn&#x27;t like it used to be and this really helps.  I pack it up when I travel and use it throughout my trip. I wouldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> Great mirror....however, my requirements are for a 10x magnification. hence the four stars.....they didn&#x27;t have anything higher than the 8x. I gave it to someone and I have since bought the right magnification for me. Very handy and I like to apply makeup this way...so I don&#x27;t overdo...lol  I put in on my brightest window until I got the stronger one.....highly recommend!  Agi</li>
    <li> This mirror is a nice size and has great suction, put in place on larger mirror and it hasn&#x27;t budged in several months.  The tweezers are a throw away. They don&#x27;t work great.</li>
    <li> Not the mirror but my face~we had to leave our wall mounted magnification mirror when we moved.  Replaced it with this product.  It is very attractive, a simple design and attaches easily and very securely to the bathroom mirror.  It had been some time since we had any magnification mirror so had some things going on that needed attention-very scary! Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without one and this is a good buy and although this is not lighted it gets plenty of light and if you want to be really scared get a small flashlight and keep it close to examine anything that may look curious.</li>
    <li> Getting older....hard to see up close?  This mirror is such a help.  I wouldl recommend this to anyone over 50!</li>
    <li> The suction cups were made from a nice rubber material and had plenty of holding power. The mirror had a little higher magnifying power then expected but that&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The free tweezers were good for what they are, free, the mirror more than makes up. The overall quality was good and will have many years of use. Would recommend to anyone needing this type of magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this and mounted it on a clean mirror.  Within 48 hours it fell and broke in many pieces.  The tweezers work nicely though.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in timely manner, but one of three suction cups did not work.  We tried moistening the cup, using a warm wash cloth and holding it under warm water to make it more pliable.  Nothing worked.  Therefore, we returned the product.  The return was made easy by Amazon.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get the mirror, however I was disappointed.... it doesn&#x27;t stay stuck to anything and I have tried everything!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Third one I&#x27;ve purchased. The tweezers are an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Nice large mirror. Sticks well. Looks good. Very useful for applying makeup and tweezing eyebrows, especially if you&#x27;re over 40. I use it every day. The tweezers are a nice bonus. They are average quality, good to keep around as spares. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Great - nice big size.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for our 5th wheel mirror.  I was lost putting on makeup with out a magnifier when we take out the 5th wheel.  This mirror works great.  Sticks real well too.  Of course we take it down when we are driving.</li>
    <li> Three large suctions thingies on the back. It&#x27;s been stuck on the bathroom mirror for weeks with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers. Still in the package, but I suppose someone will have a use.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used the tweezers bought for the mirror...  suction cups worked great... magnification good... arrived on time...  my sisters each want one!</li>
    <li> Delivered when expected.  Love the mirror!  Easy to use and very, very helpful for old eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help me tweeze my eyebrows.  I successfully was able to pluck 5 hairs before the mirror lost suction and fell to the ground, shattering into multiple pieces.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great but the tweezers...not so much.</li>
    <li> It was perfect! Just what I needed to put on make up without my glasses.  I was pleased at the size of the mirror.  I had purchased smaller ones that didn&#x27;t meet my needs.  Tweezers were a great bonus!</li>
    <li> The magnification in the mirror was very distorted. I had to return the ones I purchased. I would not recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> I had LASIK surgery a couple of years ago and lost my near vision. So putting on make up or doing anything on my face was a little hit and miss without glasses (which ultimately get in the way if you are close up). This 8X mirror allows me to get a good look up close (and now I&#x27;m kind of scared!) without the need for glasses. It has suction cups on the back so I suctioned it to my large mirror where I put on make-up. It stays perfectly and I can place it at the exact height I want it (and reposition if necessary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clarity of the mirror is sharp with some distortion at the edges. The tweezers are great and can easily grab one hair at a time for plucking or whatever else you need. The rubber grip area helps to keep them in the position you want for a secure hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice mirror for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a unit for testing and an honest evaluation.</li>
    <li> Im happy with mirror but tweezers are worthless.</li>
    <li> The suction cups need to be rinsed with hot soapy water befor attaching to anther mirror. If you don&#x27;t it will slide off and make a racket.&lt;br /&gt;Performance wise it does exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great, just what I wanted.  The serve was great too.</li>
    <li> I do love this product.  It does the job.  I didn&#x27;t mount on a surface (reasons won&#x27;t go into), but purchased a stand and it works for me.  Tweezers not wonderful as I like mine better.  Product doesn&#x27;t need to be sold with tweezers, is my thinking.</li>
    <li> Great optical quality. Great size. Came fast.&lt;br /&gt;Will probably order one for myself as a shaving mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried the tweezers but it is a nice gesture to include one.</li>
    <li> The magnifying mirror does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The suction cups are strong and the mirror is a good size. I just wish it was 10X like my last one, which broke.  But I was unable to find a 10X mirror this size with suction cups so I had to settle for 8X.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror; take it everywhere I travel and attaches well to bathroom mirror</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent value.  Quality optics are hard to find at bargain prices, but I took the risk knowing I could send it back.  It&#x27;s a keeper!  The reviews wherein people say they had to get too close (or too far away and therefore got distortion) simply bought the wrong power for their vision-needs.  I&#x27;ve been using these types of mirrors for years. I use smaller sizes for travel and the larger ones (like this 10&amp;#34; one) at home.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great for seeing to put on makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product, totally helps me out.  I can&#x27;t see without my cheaters (glasses) and this little mirror is perfect.  Just stick it on the mirror and leave it.  No mess or clutter in my little bathroom!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly the right magnification for my husband and me.  Great product and would definitely order again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have a small bathroom with no extra counter space. This mirror stays put. You can sit down (toilet, vanity chair) and stare at all your facial imperfections in glorious 8x magnification. Pluck your brows while you&#x27;re at it with the handy included tweezers. Great bargain package. Would definitely order again if this product ever wore out. But it won&#x27;t. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Fell and broke the first day put up on the large door mirror.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and look, just what I have been looking for.  Very pleased with quality and speed of delivery.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all of the time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Perfect</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted! The suction cups really stick even on a wet shower door.</li>
    <li> sticks very well to my bathroom mirror where i wanted it to - nice quality, shipped right away</li>
    <li> I thought it was 10x magnifying not like the 8x that I received. I ordered it for trips....took it to Rio Rancho, NM but realized when I opened it to use that it was not like one I had at home!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have a 10x one that I could switch it out for??</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted -- good magnifying mirror.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it was so hard to find this product in drug stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon ~ I found exactly what I needed in seconds.  This mirror is fantastic!  The size is perfect for the bathroom and what a nice surprise ~ it came with a free pair of tweezers!  Now, if only they could make all the flaws disappear when I look into the mirror!</li>
    <li> She loves it! and has recommended it to her girl friends.  It is round and looks like a mirror mirror.</li>
    <li> I realized how &#x27;necessary&#x27; a magnified mirror was after leaving a hotel (and seeing all the little horrors on my face up close ;). But I live in a high maintenance rental (not too keen on drilling into their precious walls)... This is perfect! I suctioned it to my bathroom mirror. It takes little space, yet it&#x27;s the perfect size. No holes in the wall, doesn&#x27;t take up extra space, AND... great for checking yourself out (close up)... Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong at the price either :)</li>
    <li> have to get right up close on top of mirror to get good results.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror.  It sticks well and is a good size for putting on eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Mirror is a good product, tweezers are ok, nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are useless, very sharp and not good enough for me. But the mirror is good. Still have not found the perfect spot to put it up so it keeps moving around the house for the moment.</li>
    <li> I do like it but should have bought the 10X.  Not the products fault, mine.  I always take one with me when I travel.  It is easy to pack and use.</li>
    <li> just enough magnification to get the job done but not shock you. lightweight, sticks to wall mirror securely.  discreet on the vanity mirror even though it almost reflects your entire face. good value for price.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror works great in the shower you can really see everything - good and bad ;)</li>
    <li> Great for old folks like me who can&#x27;t see without this mirror. Quality construction.</li>
    <li> I just had cataract surgery and I had to find a mirror to put my makeup on! This worked out so well, it is perfect! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see without my glasses and it is really hard to put makeup on while wearing glasses.  This is the perfect solution.</li>
