<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice product. Fast service</li>
    <li> wonderful, weightless!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  You don&#x27;t need to use very much of it, even with long hair.  It&#x27;s very thick so just rub it in your hands a bit before running it through your hair.  A little really does go a long way.  A bottle of this will last me 4 months easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, medium thickness, dry, naturally wavy/curly, heat styled, and very color-treated.  I abuse my hair like there&#x27;s no tomorrow.  Every time I wash it (about every 3-4 days) this stuff goes on and my hair says &amp;#34;ok, I forgive you&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the matching shampoo, which cleans well and also has keratin in it.  It&#x27;s nice to get done shampooing and have your hair already feel a little bit conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin or oily hair this isn&#x27;t going to be for you.  I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s pretty dry and abused.  It sucks up conditioner like crazy.  This is the first one (and I think I&#x27;ve tried them all at this point) that really and truly works for me.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle!  My hair is color processed, and also keratin straightened and it keeps my hair manageable and soft.  With all the chemical processing I have had, my hair should feel like straw and instead feels soft and fabulous!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It was shipped in two (2) days (probably because I&#x27;m a prime member) and it was shipped in excellent condition.  I have 4B natural hair and my daughter has 3B natural hair...therefore I finally found a conditioner that works for detangling and softening both of our hair textures. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I have long, naturally curly hair that I bleach and color. It&#x27;s A Ten products with keratin work great in my hair!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY thing that had gotten my hair back to it&#x27;s old self. Shiny, soft, flexible. It&#x27;s finally quit breaking and is much healthier. My hair is gray, color-treated, and curly. In other words it&#x27;s very difficult to tame. This does it. Only thing I wish is that it did not have dimethicone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. And this is the cheapest place to buy it.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, and fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair that is usually soft and smooth,  but then I dyed it.  The dye dried my hair,  made it frizzy and unmanageable. I tried many products in an attempt to bring it back it&#x27;s health but nothing did the trick until this product.  I noticed a huge difference after the first use and now use it daily to maintain my hair.  It instantly reduced the frizz and brought back the softness.  Could not recommend enough!</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged from chemotherapy, but after using It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle products, it is healthier than ever before.  A friend told me to try it, because my curls were frizzy.  She said it is a little expensive, but a little goes a long way.  I had tried SOOO many products, so I figured I would try one more, before accepting that my hair was permanently damaged and I would just have to accept that I had cancer, so it&#x27;s par for the course.  I bought the shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, and mask, and after ONE use, I could instantly see and feel a difference!  I like the scent of the keratin shampoo, conditioner, and mask more than the leave in scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as wonderful as the others.  If I am in a hurry, I will just shampoo my hair, towel dry, and put some mask product in my hair, comb it through and go.  My hair is so much softer and shinier too!  It will take a MIRACLE to get me to change from these products! No pun intended :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the difference didn&#x27;t make easy to comb hair</li>
    <li> Love the product itself!!!! I have very short bleach blonde hair and have dried it out soooo bad, my stylist recommend this product and it truly brought my hair back to life! As for the company selling it or the bottle that it is in, whenI recieved it half the bottle had leaked out! This large bottle would usually last me a month and a half ( with short fine hair and every other day use) I noticed the bottle felt lite.. when I pryed the top off there was a small hand full at the bottom ( I had just bought it 3 weeks ago) there is a hole where the conditioner had been leaking out!!! Very displeased with the bottle itself!</li>
    <li> I know you&#x27;re not supposed to use this thick conditioner too often but I love it!  Nice, thick conditioner that feels like it really conditions, and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your time or money My hair looks exactly the same as it did when i used a shampoo that was half the price. I see no difference at all.</li>
    <li> I have color treated and lots of intense blow drying so my hair can look dry. This product along with their shampoo and leave in conditioner has my hair looking more healthy than anything else. Very happy with the products.</li>
    <li> The lid was open. Lord only knows how much I lost :(</li>
    <li> Does take the frizz out of my hair at least for a few days.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! A little pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> Best product ever for natural hair (Locs); I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now.  Had to pass along my first bottle to my daughter and grand daughters.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best stuff ever...I have never used anything better.  It smells nice and is highly effective.  The shampoo is good too.  Though I don&#x27;t care for the leave in conditioning spray - but my stylist uses it with success...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It makes my hair look so much better. I have dry, straw like hair.  I use this and then straighten my hair and it looks great!!  I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner it makes your hair gives your hair so much shine,less frizz and makes it so soft. I was so so happy to see Amazon had a seller selling the large size at such a great price and with free shipping. I recive this product a few days later after I order it.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! Shipped quickly too.</li>
    <li> Best conditioning for you hair espcially after swimming in salt water</li>
    <li> I really like the way my hair feels, looks, and smells with this conditioner. I also have the shampoo.. I would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product!  My hair is normally quite dry and frizzy.  It&#x27;s A 10 is by far the best conditioner I have found for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be helpful in calming my curly frizzy hair.  The conditioner also makes it much easier to comb my thick hair and it stays softer longer</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. My hair was so silky and free of frizz (which is so difficult when you have curly hair and live in Florida). Whenever I have some money I&#x27;ll be buying another one.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, my hair is a lot softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I get keratin treatments every 8 weeks for my processed hair and this stuff keeps my tresses ultra smooth, silky, and shiny in between treatments. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this conditioner. A little goes a long way, so this will last you a good while.</li>
    <li> Gave me soft, shiny hair.</li>
    <li> It is so very expensive at the salon. This is definitely the same product as the tiny tubes, but much much cheaper when purchased at this quantity.</li>
    <li> Huge difference in hair!</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Use daily and  my hair is soon oolong happy! Very nourishing, silky and brilliant! Highly recommended for super happy hair!</li>
    <li> First off, I am one who has never really been too too picky regarding the brand of hair products I use. I have extremely long, fine textured hair and have a lot of it. I received the It&#x27;s a 10 Leave In Spray with Keratin as a free sample one day when I signed up for Ulta&#x27;s Reward Card, so one day when I washed my hair, I saw the sample bottle sitting there and thought what the heck, I might as well try it!... From the moment I took off my turby rolled hair, I noticed an EXTREME, IMMEDIATE difference! From that very second, I was hooked!.. I gave all of my Victoria Secret and Tresemme products to my mom and co-workers bc now I will not use anything other than It&#x27;s a 10!!! And quite frankly they should change the name to It&#x27;s a 100, bc there is nothing better than this, period. I have checked every store I shop at, both drug stores and department stores and I can tell you with certainty that you will not find it as cheap as you will on amazon, unless you can win a decent bidded offer on ebay. These 5 star reviews are all spot on. Coming from someone who likes to bargain shop, I can promise you that the It&#x27;s a 10 products are worth every single cent you will pay!!! It&#x27;s nice to finally KNOW I no longer have to question any more brands of hair products, wondering if there may be something better out there, because now I KNOW I already have found it!!! This is one purchase you will never have to question or regret!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have incredibly dry/damaged hair, and high quality European hair extensions in place. This can cause some matting between my natural hair and the extension. But this stuff helps prevent that better than even the more expensive solutions I have tried! It makes my hair incredibly soft for days and easy to comb out.</li>
    <li> Tried tons of conditioners and this is my current favorite. I have a lot of fine waist length hair that&#x27;s in the sun and ocean a lot and gets very hard &amp; snarled on the ends. This conditioner makes my hair silky bouncy shiny and soft. Before I&#x27;ve even put the conditioner down the ends of my hair the top part is absolutely soft, it&#x27;s incredible how fast and how well this conditioner works. It works so well I bought the whole line; the leave in conditioner both keratin and regular, shampoo keratin &amp; regular and their deep conditioning tub works great as well.</li>
    <li> Love the It&#x27;s a 10 line hair conditioner, mask and leave-in treatment! I have super fine hair and most of the products add unnecessary grease and heavy feeling, but not this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo not so much</li>
    <li> Expensive but wonderful product.  The first time I used it I could tell the difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> The whole product line of Its a Ten saved my hair after over processing and coloring for years, which is a miracle.</li>
    <li> Great value for the size.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle worker for my dry, color-treated, naturally curly hair! I use it every time I shampoo and as a weekly deep conditioning treatment by leaving it in my hair overnight. My hair is so soft and silky the next day, and it lasts for days after. I searched many stores in my area for this item and couldn&#x27;t find it locally, so I naturally looked on Amazon to find it. I&#x27;m glad I did because the price is so much better here.</li>
    <li> I luv It&#x27;s a 10 products.  Expensive, but has saved my permed + colored hair!  Other people have written about other products, but none compare pricewise.  If it&#x27;s 3x the price, it BETTER be better.  If u can find anything else that works as well for this price, I&#x27;d like to know!</li>
    <li> It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but thought it would do more for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product really helps my hair. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> I have the leave in treatment and like it, so I decided to try the conditioner and I am not impressed with the smell of this product! It smells like something you would find in your mechanics garage. I would not recommend it, unless your into that smell.</li>
    <li> Very expensive but it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Love this brand. Works well!</li>
    <li> I have dark, dark brown hair that I have dyed blonde which absolutely fries my hair.  My stylist recommended this product to me and it has improved my hair SO much.  I get compliments all the time about how much healthier my hair looks and I attribute it to the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Plus Keratin line.  It is a little on the pricey side, but I save a ton by purchasing on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, leaves my hair soft, smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> Not impressed!  It made my hair fall out in clumps every time I used it.  I can&#x27;t explain other than to say maybe it was too harsh for my scalp.  I would never recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my hair and I like the pump because it makes it easier. The larger size makes a great value.</li>
    <li> I love this and use it about twice per week.  My hair is long, thick, enthnic/coarse (I am mexican).  A little trick, I put the conditioner on in the shower, then place on a shower cap - I get out of the shower and wait about 15-20 minutes for the conditioner to really sink into my hair.  Then rinse and style.  My hair is so soft and shiny after this treatment.  It is definitely a staple in my hair regimen.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, color-treated hair and when I first started using this product, my hair felt wonderful. But over time, the effect wore off and my hair stopped having the silky feeling after use. I switched to Biolage and it works much better for my hair type.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably effective product for super dry/coarse/damaged hair.  I LOVE THIS! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Awesome, gives shine, leaves hair silky.  It&#x27;s a 10 products are great for thick course dry hair.  Makes hair healthy looking.  This is a big bottle.  Wish price was better, because I need to use quite a bit for my long hair.  I love the smell , and it makes my hair smooth shiny and soft.  LOVE!</li>
    <li> I really loved this product at first, it left your hair so soft, but after a month it gave me really bad dandruff. I have never had a problem with dandruff before so I automatically knew it was from the shampoo and conditioner. My sister had the same problem. Once I changed it went away so it had to be the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever!  It makes my hair so soft,no more fly-aways, and no frizz in the Florida weather.</li>
    <li> service was great.  Product is awesome BUT GETTING IT OUT OF CONTAINER LEFT ALOT TO BE DESIRED.  I HAD TO TAKE CONTAINER APART TO GET TO THE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Of course my imagination told me that this product would make me look like a hair comercial model upon first use, so I was undoubtedly disapointed. First thing I notice after leaving it in like an hour (lol). My hair seemed to have more volume, took FOREVER TO DRY and when it did it of course looked a little greasy considering I&#x27;m not supposed to leave it in that long. I feel like it retains moisture in my hair so the slightly greasy look didn&#x27;t concern me- it didn&#x27;t look gross. Have gotten a few comments on my hair but then again that was after I used the miracle hair mask. To summarize my report I would reccomend the miracle hair mask ONLY as it does the most good.</li>
    <li> Bottle leaked from the bottom didn&#x27;t get but 3 uses out of it</li>
    <li> I have course dry very curly hair and this product does wonders for them. It softens my hair and makes them so much more manageable. I use it every time I wash my hair and am an absolute addict for this conditioner!</li>
    <li> Bought the first bottle and it was $35. When I reordered 2 more bottles, the price per bottle was almost $50. As much as I like the product, it is no longer a reasonable price compared to the many other keratin products available.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products and always come back to &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34;!  I have thinner, fly away type hair and this product controls the fly a ways and smooths. This larger size is hard to find but worth the search and money. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love both of these products help tame the frizz, been using these for years.</li>
    <li> Would buy again!!  Love the silkiness of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, brittle, damaged hair from a thyroid condition, living in the TX weather, and being colored.  This product has been amazing and I can do days without washing my hair and it is still like the day I washed it.  LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Leaving this conditioner in for a minimum of 5 minutes with each use is the biggest help in repairing my damaged hair!</li>
    <li> I love the miracle deep conditioner. My hair is dry and needs the extra conditioning so I discovered this after a recent visit with my hair stylist...she recomended this product so I gave it a try..needless to say I love the way it makes my hair feel :)</li>
    <li> I love the product.  The push down/pump dispenser end just barely clears the edge of this wide bottle so it is not that easy to use without the product going on the side of the bottle therefore I probably would not buy this size again, but rather stick t the tubes. Besides, you can never get everything completely out of the bottom of a pump dispense bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, would recommend this to anyone...</li>
    <li> I live in Michigan &amp; the winters here are brutal. I needed a condtitioner that conditioned my hair without leaving my hair weighed down. I have mid back length hair and its wavy wet, have to dry straight daily. This product is amazing! For women out there my age, 40ish. you will love this. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now. Previously my hair was a mess. Had a haircut I was trying to grow out and I used to highlight my hair leaving it super dry. My former stylist got a little nuts with the thinning shears and my hair was breaking off left &amp; right. I started to use this and it felt like my hair grew faster. My hair used to be dry and dull and now its thick and shiny like it was when I was in my twenties. I literally get compliments on my hair everyday. i tried posting a current pic but couldnt get it to attach to this post. Like many women I&#x27;ve spent tons of money and hours online trying to find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; product. I know this product is alot of money but it will save you lots in the long run.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner i have used yet.  Switched from Paul Mitchell Awapui and am extremely happy with this product.  Save a little money by buying the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is a little pricey but man it works and this is the cheapest place to buy it! I have used it several ways. When I&#x27;m in a hurry I&#x27;ll just put it on the ends for a bit in the shower. Other times I will put it it on wet hair and put a shower cap on for about 20 minutes. It works great and this brand has lots of very good products.</li>
    <li> When used with It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo it left my hair a little too oily. I went back to my bedhead shampoo and the combination seems to work nicely.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item about a month ago when I decided to chop my long dark hair off and dyed it blonde. My hairstylist recommended that I use it along with shimmer lights blue shampoo and conditioner. I love love love love this stuff. Bleaching your hair can make it dry and hard to comb especially after shampooing and conditioning. My hair was difficult to comb through wet out the shower even before I dyed it blonde and with this stuff, it&#x27;s silky smooth and not a single tangle in my hair. I don&#x27;t know what people are expecting it to do to their hair, but if you&#x27;re looking to not lose a bunch of hair due to breakage from tangling or dryness, then this is the conditioner to buy. I don&#x27;t even care about the price because the frustration it saves me from tangles and breakage is worth it. Nothing has ever made my hair manageable straight out the shower than this. It doesn&#x27;t matter how tangled my hair is before I shower or after I shower I literally put this stuff on my hair and it&#x27;s bye bye tangles and breakage and hello soft silky hair. I love it</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product.  I use it with the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle shampoo plus keratin&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave-in plus keratin&amp;#34; and I refuse to use anything else on my hair.  A little goes a long way with all of the products.  I have thick, long hair, and I only use 1.5 pumps of shampoo and 2 pumps of conditioner.  My hair has never been so healthy and easy to manage.  It is worth every penny!  I definitely suggest using the set since they all do different things.  The shampoo cleans and cleanses, the conditioner rehydrates and restores, and the leave in locks in moisture and protects from styling and UV rays.  Once you try this you will love how your hair feels and the manageability, you won&#x27;t want anything else!</li>
    <li> I have long, very curly hair and I usually need a ton of conditioner to get through my hair, not with this product!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I love the smell, I love the consistency, and most of all, I love the way my hair looks and feels after I&#x27;ve used it.  My friend, who has gorgeous, LA movie star hair, recommended this to me and it has worked miracles keeping my otherwise coarse, dry, frizzy hair looking soft, silky, and smooth without sacrificing body.  Try it!</li>
    <li> REALLY HYDRATES MY CURLY HAIR AND EITHER PREVENTS SPLIT ENDS OR KEEPS THEM HYDRATED. MY HAIR IS SO MUCH HEALTHIER AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF USE.</li>
    <li> I use this EVERY time I wet my hair in the shower even if I don&#x27;t shampoo. It makes my dry and frizzy hair manageable and healthy looking. I also use the leave in spray version for styling. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this brand and I love the price!&lt;br /&gt;The price and quatity is what peaked my interest and it got to me pretty quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> This will always be my favorite conditioner! Soft silky healthy hair!</li>
    <li> Product is great but the package is horrible. It took a while to even get some product to come out of the container. But I guess it&#x27;s worth it.. 😀</li>
    <li> This product is certainly healthier for your hair than many store brand products considering the ingredients. However, don&#x27;t expect it to work any miracles.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used. I have used a variety of conditioners in the past and none compare to this product. It leaves my hair soft and easy to comb after use.  I could not believe the difference between my top of the line conditioner and this...I will never using anything else!!!!  In a word...outstanding</li>
    <li> After my hair was badly damaged from dying and highlighting my hair just one time using this deep conditioning for my hair, my hair looked like it was out of a magazine.</li>
    <li> LOVE PRODUCT gave it four stars because half the bottle was waste in the box contact seller and they never respond will buy again but for another seller</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel like silk. When my 24yo daughter came to visit over the holidays, she tried and took it with her. Brat! Now I will order some more since it works wonders. I only use it about 1-2 times a week so it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This conditioner does what it claims. My hair recovered its natural shine. This is a great product. I know is little bit pricy, but if your hair has been treated, is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> My daughter is biracial and this is the only product we have found that let&#x27;s us comb her hair smoothly and with no tears.</li>
    <li> it is a miracle  I think God made it!!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!  Best protien conditioner on the market.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year on colored and highlighted hair.  It helps make it soft and stops breakage.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  One of the best in the market., although a bit pricy.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I ever used!  The bottle broke tho and I had to put it all in a tupperwear container.</li>
    <li> Love it and bigger bottle than I could buy in store!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I have long thick curly hair and it just the trick!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. its a ten is a really awesome product. i use the spray in every day and it works miracles.. i am very happy with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged by having it lightened. It&#x27;s a 10 with keratin has helped immensely in repairing the damage and bringing back to healthy and shiny!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very good product. My hair was so damaged and this helped better than any other product I have used.arrived timely.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Makes for soft, easy to manage hair</li>
    <li> really does make a difference even for my hair!</li>
    <li> This saved my over processed hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think is such a big deal as the commercial makes it look like. Other products were as good if not better (the feeling on your hair after applying it...)</li>
    <li> Effective product, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my hair feel amazing. The only downfall is that the price its very expensive and for someone like me who has long hair i go through these bottles like nothing.</li>
    <li> great product, def. worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this by mistake I wanted the hair mask. I will try it, but I just ordered a 17.5 it&#x27;s a 10 miracle hair mask on June 14 too.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for my curly hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Overpriced for what it does.</li>
    <li> I use the entire &amp;#34;its a 10&amp;#34; set and love it! My hair quit falling out when I started using this and it seems to help with breakage as well! Helps hair feel healthy. Strong scented shampoo for my liking, but my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I have been using It&#x27;s a 10 Leave In Conditioner (the original formula) for years. Each bottle lasts me AT LEAST 6 months. I purchased the It&#x27;s a 10 Keratin when my bottle of original was finally low... I fell in love with the scent. I immediately bought the biggest size shampoo-- 33.8oz and the biggest size conditioner-- 17.5 oz. I feel this product line leaves my hair moisturized and feeling great. I don&#x27;t use it daily... only when I plan on styling with a blow dryer and straightener or just as a special weekly treatment after beating it up at the beach and in the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual bottle itself is my one and only gripe with this product and the only reason why I gave it 3 stars. I just noticed now there is a \\&quot;locked\\&quot; and \\&quot;unlocked\\&quot; position in which you can put the squirt top in and that&#x27;s great. However, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me but I cannot for the life of me get the actual lid off! This disappoints me because that means when I get down to the end, I&#x27;m not going to be able to scrape the insides out unless I get some heavy tools and destroy the actual bottle. Ugh. At least the shampoo squirt lid comes off. What if the straw that connects to the pump gets disconnected? Greattt! Or what if the pump just stops working ALL together? I&#x27;m going to Google more and see if anyone figured out how to get this lid off because that really matters to me. For the price of the product, I should be able to get every last drop without destroying the bottle all together. I prefer flip top lids for shampoos and conditioners because I feel I get the most product use out of them. I&#x27;m not into wasting my money. I wish the bottle were different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great product and although I hate the bottle, that won&#x27;t stop me from reordering when I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 yrs of age and noticed my hair becoming very dry. I used to get many complements on my hair so I had been pretty sad about losing my beautiful hair.  I  tried many hair products including Kanpo herbal products though it was costly.  Keratin got my attention and gave it a try.  Wow, this works.  My hair is now manageable, softer, and shine came back.  I like combing through my hair with fingers in the morning to feel softer hair.  I use with Shampoo with Keratin of this series.</li>
    <li> Another I can&#x27;t say enough good about.  It is amazing how good it makes your hair feel!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, quick shipping.  All good!</li>
    <li> LOVE. I have fine blonde hair that gets dry easily.  I use this one or two times a week and  regular daily conditioner to keep it in tip top shape.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve found to date. The only thing I will use now. The search is finally over. My hair is so soft after I use it.</li>
    <li> It makes my fine curly hair very soft and healthy</li>
    <li> Very good conditioning, as promised.  It can be a little heavy for my fine hair, though.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT... I use the Shampoo and keratin leave-in treatment as well... when my 1st bottle of this conditioner finished, I didn&#x27;t wanna spend the money on another, since it&#x27;s kinda pricey and convinced myself to order the WEN shampoo... i made the huge mistake doing so...I have re-ordered this wonderful keratin conditioner again and now i can honestly say i will NEVER buy any other conditioner again...With the first use..i felt my hair super silky and soft again!!! As for the WEN shampoo...i use it on my dogs!!!</li>
    <li> makes my hair fight the frizz!  awesome product, can&#x27;t live without it, makes my hair feel like silk, even have my sisters hooked on it!</li>
