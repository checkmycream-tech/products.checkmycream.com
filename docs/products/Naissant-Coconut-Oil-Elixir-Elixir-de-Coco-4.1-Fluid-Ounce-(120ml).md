      <li>Loved it smelt great less is more</li>
      <li>the coconut smell is amazing and super strong.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite!!</li>
      <li>I use it when my hair is damp and it makes it easy to comb through without tangles.</li>

      <li>I really enjoy using this elixir because it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
      <li>I was also worried that the coconut oil smell would be overpowering, but it&#x27;s quite light and enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Light scent.</li>
      <li>It protects my hair and smells fabulous.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth, and frizz free.</li>
      <li>It has a really helped with my dry hair, and it smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>Amazing great smell made my blonde damaged hair so soft and silky .</li>
      <li>The packaging was very good, and the product arrived less than four days after I placed the order.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about the Naissant oils.</li>
      <li>It is a clear serum which I love because some of the more amber color hair elixirs can make blonde hair dingy.  </li>
      <li>I have found the effects work best when applied to damp hair, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>They do everything you want an oil to do and absolutely none of the things you don&#x27;t want!</li>
      <li>I have tried many different hair oils in my coarse/wavy hair over the years.</li>
      <li>but I smell like coconut and plastic for the first 15 minutes of putting it all over my hair</li>
      <li>Well, that is exactly what this product does for me.</li>
      <li>and I will be purchasing more in the future</li>
      <li>My hair really feels nourished&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so the coconut and argan oils in it must be very nourishing.  </li>
      <li>I have absolutely zero frizz.</li>
      <li>and this really helps repair any damage from the bleaching.  </li>
      <li>It comes out too fast and almost splashes out of my hand.</li>
      <li>pump, rub in hands then apply keeps you from using too much.</li>
      <li>Other than that love this oil.</li>
      <li>other than that, LOVE.</li>
      <li>I love that it has a pump where other products you have to pour into your hands.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine, color treated hair.</li>
      <li>If you are having any of these issues, I highly suggest trying this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a hairstylist at a high end salon and have used everything in the oil category.</li>
      <li>I applied this on my dry hair before flat ironing and my hair has more shine than normal and feels very soft.</li>
      <li>I am an avid user of coconut oil as a pre-wash treatment in my chemical treated, fragile hair.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I have used it 3 times so far (twice with heat styling and once without) in combination with my Josie Maran Argan oil and it is working like a charm.</li>
      <li>The bottle will last a long time because I only need to use small amount to get great results.  </li>
      <li>The scent is natural coconut</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>I was actually sent a bottle of this complimentary and MUST say I will definitely be re-purchasing this when I run out.</li>
      <li>It is a little runny though not thick like most syrups so you definitely want to start with a tiny squirt and rub your hands together then run through with your fingers.</li>
      <li>I have really thick, curly, frizzy hair and this helped me to be able to calm my hair down!</li>
      <li>It also works really well to keep hair looking shiny and manageable in this dry, winter weather.  </li>
      <li>I barely heat straighten because I worry about damaging my hair.</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair that only frizzes a bit the day after heat styling.</li>
      <li>After using just this on my damp hair then blow drying my hair was about 50% less frizzy and still felt super soft as opposed to how it usually feels dried out significantly after blow drying.</li>
      <li>I have short, thin, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>that if u use too much or too little its over done or not enough.</li>

<li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the consistency is very thin and the pump dispenses a lot of product at one time...  </li>
<li> I am obsessed with this!!!!!</li>

    <li> Love, love , love this product! Very good for hair and skin both in my opinion!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! The packaging was very good, and the product arrived less than four days after I placed the order. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this elixir because it&#x27;s not greasy. thats one thing that annoys me about oil or hair serum that if u use too much or too little its over done or not enough. just one pump of this elixir works perfectly. the coconut smell is amazing and super strong. stays on my hair even when dries. and it makes my hair manageable and soft. check out my review on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vtz0ekEahGU&amp;list&#x3D;UU-XPBRjEDQiVQJmK2D6eQ1Q</li>
    <li> I have tried many different hair oils in my coarse/wavy hair over the years. This one works great and is super affordable. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> My hair has transformed with Naissant products to looking both freshly-colored AND healthy. I cannot say enough good things about the Naissant oils. They do everything you want an oil to do and absolutely none of the things you don&#x27;t want! On top of it, this smells great! I will never be without their products!</li>
    <li> I was actually sent a bottle of this complimentary and MUST say I will definitely be re-purchasing this when I run out. I am an avid user of coconut oil as a pre-wash treatment in my chemical treated, fragile hair. Imagine if you could have all the benefits of coconut oil in your hair but minus the oily greasy mess. Well, that is exactly what this product does for me. Not only does it make my hair smoother and shiner it de-tangles wonderfully. I have found the effects work best when applied to damp hair, and a little goes a long way. It is a clear serum which I love because some of the more amber color hair elixirs can make blonde hair dingy.  I apply to then ends and work my way up even smoothing at my roots. I would not recommend doing that if you have oily hair but I don&#x27;t so I have no problems glossing this stuff all over. It has a wonderful coconut smell. It is a little runny though not thick like most syrups so you definitely want to start with a tiny squirt and rub your hands together then run through with your fingers. After using just this on my damp hair then blow drying my hair was about 50% less frizzy and still felt super soft as opposed to how it usually feels dried out significantly after blow drying. I applied this on my dry hair before flat ironing and my hair has more shine than normal and feels very soft. It also worked wonders for my hair extensions when I applied to them damp and allowed them to air dry. PLUS it is very light weight so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or feel like there is product in my hair at all! I am obsessed with this!!!!!</li>
    <li> Loved it smelt great less is more</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the Naissanr brand products. This coconut oil for my hair has been used often.  It smells divine!  It also works really well to keep hair looking shiny and manageable in this dry, winter weather.  I am careful to not use too much at once, adding it to the length of my hair from the ears down. I have long, fine, color treated hair. This oil would work on all hair types - just use the amount needed to work for you. This brands Argan Oil is terrific as are the shampoos and conditioners.  I like to keep them all on hand .</li>
    <li> Love this!!  It smells great and really makes my hair look healthy and silky!!</li>
    <li> Love this coconut Elixir. It has a really helped with my dry hair, and it smells wonderful. I apply it day, and night for maximum results, since i have very dry hair. You can even use it on your hands.</li>
    <li> Been using this serum for the last few months for heat protection when I flat iron and I love it.  My hair feels so silky and has a healthy shine (and no split ends) so the coconut and argan oils in it must be very nourishing.  It protects my hair and smells fabulous.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this elixir for 3 days now and I love it since day one!!! It leaves my hair silky smooth, and frizz free. My hair really feels nourished&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 stars because the smell is strong, it smells like coconut, and something else fruity. And also smells like plastic? I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the bottle I bought.. The smell goes away after a while of course but I smell like coconut and plastic for the first 15 minutes of putting it all over my hair lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist at a high end salon and have used everything in the oil category. This is by far my favorite!! Not too heavy.. Just make sure not to apply to root area. I have baby fine hair..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this hair elixir.  I bleach my hair platinum blonde and this really helps repair any damage from the bleaching.  I use a little bit before blow drying and then a little after I style my hair for added shine.  This product has a wonderful, light coconut smell and the ingredients seem to be very natural (includes both coconut and argan oil).  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the consistency is very thin and the pump dispenses a lot of product at one time...  other than that, LOVE.</li>
    <li> I bought this wonderful hair serum because it was recommended to me by a friend. I use it to tame my unmanageable hair. The bottle will last a long time because I only need to use small amount to get great results.  I apply it before blow-drying my hair. It helps to prevent damage to my ends. It smells great. Trust me you will love it.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, curly, frizzy hair and this helped me to be able to calm my hair down! It smells amazing and is easy to use. I love that it has a pump where other products you have to pour into your hands. I use it when my hair is damp and it makes it easy to comb through without tangles. I really love this and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Amazing great smell made my blonde damaged hair so soft and silky .</li>
    <li> This oil is Fabulous! and the smell is just like coconut. I was having a little dryness and some shedding of my hair. I saw this and&lt;br /&gt;thought I would try it. My hair was shiny it didn&#x27;t feel dry and the shedding has decreased. It does not take a lot,it is concentrated, so&lt;br /&gt;one pump, rub in hands then apply keeps you from using too much. I have not used it after blow-drying, I apply while damp as it&lt;br /&gt;helps detangle hair as well. If you are having any of these issues, I highly suggest trying this product. The scent is natural coconut&lt;br /&gt;so it does not interfere with your other products Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft. I use two pumps on my long hair, ends only. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the product five stars is because of the pump. It comes out too fast and almost splashes out of my hand. Other than that love this oil. Smells good too. Light scent. Nothing over powering.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have short, thin, fine hair.  It adds shine to your hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair that only frizzes a bit the day after heat styling. I barely heat straighten because I worry about damaging my hair. I bought this to protect the softness of my hair and maintain the vibrancy of it. I have used it 3 times so far (twice with heat styling and once without) in combination with my Josie Maran Argan oil and it is working like a charm. I have absolutely zero frizz. I was also worried that the coconut oil smell would be overpowering, but it&#x27;s quite light and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does add a great deal of softness and shine to my hair and I will be purchasing more in the future</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. Doesn&#x27;t help with frizz just doesn&#x27;t do anything</li>
