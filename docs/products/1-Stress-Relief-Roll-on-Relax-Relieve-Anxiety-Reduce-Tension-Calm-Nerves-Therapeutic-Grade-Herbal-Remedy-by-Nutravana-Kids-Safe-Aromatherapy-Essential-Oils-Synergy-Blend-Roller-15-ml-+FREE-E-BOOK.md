      <li>Nice smell but does not ease anxiety for me.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product and use a dash of it before I go to work.  </li>
      <li>and that was the most relaxing grocery store trip ever.</li>
      <li>just ok.</li>
      <li>I wasn’t sure how to get the roll on part off</li>
      <li>so you can’t over dose on it :)&lt;</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work</li>
      <li>and I love the relief it has given me.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of oils and lotions, but works great on my skin.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and refreshing and truly has a calming affect.  </li>
      <li>I would love to see everybody stress free with no medication.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this item at a reduced price or complimentary in exchange for my honest review.</li>
      <li>Relaxing calming and easy to use aromatherapy.  </li>
      <li>This one doesn’t have as strong of a sent.  </li>
      <li>The odor is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>This is my second roll on (bought the energy boost one and was happy with that one as well).  </li>
      <li>love the way this product smells - and the roll on ball allows me to get just the right amount on my skin.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!!!</li>
      <li>I loved the welcoming e-mail, personal touch.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad product .</li>
      <li>Place the thumbnail of your free hand below the lowest point on the plastic roll-on stopper exactly where it meets the glass bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They do exactly as they claim!</li>
      <li>This product provides simple, effective aromatherapy.  </li>
      <li>I really love having this option for natural stress relief</li>
      <li>Love this natural remedy.</li>
      <li>All opinions are my own and not to be mistaken for medical advice.</li>
      <li>but I used it right before a grocery store trip with my two toddlers.</li>
      <li>roll on is just a stopper placed in the neck of the bottle, and it can be removed pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>This product works great for reducing stress - at least for me.</li>
      <li>After a long day the first thing I would love to do is relax.</li>
      <li>I had tried my own blend of essential oils but obviously was not getting the combination just right.</li>
      <li>I have found that this natural remedy with coconut oil, lavender, ylang-ylang, sweet orange, and atlas cedar has a very soothing aroma without making me feel drowsy.  </li>
      <li>Thank you Gary, if you are out to help people not just make huge piles of money( money way over above what you need for living, product research, and run your company), but really try to help  people.  </li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t have time.</li>
      <li>and I felt relaxed the whole time.</li>
      <li>It really helps with anxiety and tension.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing smell.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it might be a little too &amp;#34;mellow&amp;#34; but have gotten to know the product better</li>
      <li>but I found that a quick splash took the edge off and lightened my mood prior to what was going to be a stressful / confrontational meeting.  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>recommend this product if you have high stress or anxiety issues or just need to relax a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If it is - just rock it a little more.)”</li>
      <li>Like the other products from Nutravana, it comes in a convenient roller ball bottle so you can easily apply to pulse points with no mess.  </li>
      <li>Natural Stress Relief Roll&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I like the fact that it’s natural</li>
      <li>It was a light sent, not overwhelming at all.</li>
      <li>I put a little on both wrists, the sides of my neck and right under my nose.</li>
      <li>Holding the bottle firmly with one hand, use your thumbnail and finger to first move the stopper toward you and then away, rocking it between your thumb and finger until it becomes looser.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I WAS SKEPTICAL THAT THIS STUFF WOULD WORK, BUT, IT DOES WORK WELL TO HELP RELAX PRE-BEDTIME</li>
    <li> Giving it a 2 star since I did receive this immediately. Did not work for me.</li>
    <li> smell is great and relaxing!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it.  Life is stressful.  At least it is for me anyway.  I have found that this natural remedy with coconut oil, lavender, ylang-ylang, sweet orange, and atlas cedar has a very soothing aroma without making me feel drowsy.  Like the other products from Nutravana, it comes in a convenient roller ball bottle so you can easily apply to pulse points with no mess.  I really love having this option for natural stress relief and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells ok for me,  and I think it helps!</li>
    <li> Like this product a lot. At first I thought it might be a little too &amp;#34;mellow&amp;#34; but have gotten to know the product better and I do like it.</li>
    <li> I think the ylang ylang is not my fave. Seems good quality</li>
    <li> Nice smell but does not ease anxiety for me.  I would return it but I really don&#x27;t have time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to add to your guided mediation practice.&lt;br /&gt;  I am no great practitioner, but do need to work at relaxing and this product helps a lot.  I have a couple recordings to help me.  The scent of this is perfect to help me relax.  I like that I&#x27;m not lighting a candle or something else across the room.  Or taking any kind of drugs.  Also, because there are no drugs, I am able to use it just to boost quietness in me &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; in a crazy day.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be an hour mediation session.&lt;br /&gt;  I recommend it (and, if you suffer migraines, try their migraine relief formula!).</li>
    <li> I have used this quite a number of times already since purchasing it&lt;br /&gt;about a month ago and I love the relief it has given me.</li>
    <li> Very soothing smell. I use this at work when it gets hectic and stressful</li>
    <li> This is the second product I have ordered from Nutravana. I love their products! They do exactly as they claim! Before trying this product I was on a prescription and still have severe anxiety issues. I was beginning to feel like there was no help to be had. I had tried my own blend of essential oils but obviously was not getting the combination just right. This product works great for reducing stress - at least for me. It calms me when I feel an anxiety attack coming on - and best of all, I am now coming off my prescription medication with the approval of my doctor.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this product smells - and the roll on ball allows me to get just the right amount on my skin. I keep it handy at my desk so I can reach for it when I feel I need to. Even just sniffing the bottle when I remove the cap seems to help. I put a little on both wrists, the sides of my neck and right under my nose. While it doesn&#x27;t last long, it lasts long enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you have high stress or anxiety issues or just need to relax a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this item at a reduced price or complimentary in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own and not to be mistaken for medical advice.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!!!</li>
    <li> Relaxing calming and easy to use aromatherapy.  The odor is not too strong.  I put it on a tissue and would take a deep breath from it when I needed a mind break.</li>
    <li> Bought this for some out of State friends who visited me and were so stressed out from their jobs that I thought perhaps this product might help them some.  They have said it smells great.</li>
    <li> This product provides simple, effective aromatherapy.  I was skeptical at first but I found that a quick splash took the edge off and lightened my mood prior to what was going to be a stressful / confrontational meeting.  It also has a pleasing, subtle smell.</li>
    <li> Natural Stress Relief Roll&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product. After a long day the first thing I would love to do is relax. Now with this oil I can. I would love to see everybody stress free with no medication. I am looking forward to the item.</li>
    <li> I finished tapering off Clonzepam.  The Stress Relief is a big help to me.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff.  It really helps with anxiety and tension.  When I feel upset, I rub some on my temples and take a few deep breaths.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This was great! It was a light sent, not overwhelming at all. I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work but I used it right before a grocery store trip with my two toddlers. I put some on my kiddos as well and that was the most relaxing grocery store trip ever. There was no melt downs and I felt relaxed the whole time. Now I use it all the time one the entire family.</li>
    <li> Love this natural remedy. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Stress relief good, energy boost just ok.Not a bad product . Will last a long time</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me but that&#x27;s just me. It does smell good though.</li>
    <li> Again...HEAVEN IN A BOTTLE!</li>
    <li> Smells great...peaceful. nice quality oil and bottle</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and use a dash of it before I go to work.  The scent is light and refreshing and truly has a calming affect.  I have sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of oils and lotions, but works great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second roll on (bought the energy boost one and was happy with that one as well).  This one doesn’t have as strong of a sent.  Can definitely smell the lavender and a hint of orange though.  I use it by rolling some under my nose and taking a few deep breaths.  Works well and I like the fact that it’s natural so you can’t over dose on it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was suggested that you put a few drops of this in a bath to help relax.  I wasn’t sure how to get the roll on part off but the Nutravana people sent me a message with these instructions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The roll on is just a stopper placed in the neck of the bottle, and it can be removed pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;1. Hold the bottle firmly on a tabletop or similar&lt;br /&gt;2. Place the thumbnail of your free hand below the lowest point on the plastic roll-on stopper exactly where it meets the glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;3. Holding the bottle firmly with one hand, use your thumbnail and finger to first move the stopper toward you and then away, rocking it between your thumb and finger until it becomes looser.&lt;br /&gt;4. Pull the loosened stopper up and off of the bottle. (It shouldn’t be difficult. If it is - just rock it a little more.)”</li>
    <li> Just ordered on10/7 and came today 10/10.  I loved the welcoming e-mail, personal touch.  Signed up couple months ago with YL.  It is too expensive for someone on SS.  Also like the money back offer.  Thank you Gary, if you are out to help people not just make huge piles of money( money way over above what you need for living, product research, and run your company), but really try to help  people.  I will write back after I try the 2 products I bought.</li>
    <li> Good aromatherapy roll on for stress relief</li>
