      <li>Love this stuff, and would pay the price for it any time.  </li>

      <li>my skin is becoming</li>

      <li>thanks origins!!!</li>
      <li>Very pleased so far!</li>
      <li>I was really wanting to love this product.</li>
      <li>Bought the larger size to give it a good try.</li>
      <li>Great product but a little pricey...</li>
      <li>i definitely  see an improvement but you really have to stick with it to see good results.</li>
      <li>The results are noticeable and overnight impact on small blemishes are great</li>
      <li>My scars have really lighten up!</li>
      <li>but this amazing stuff really helped clear up my old acne scars and kept away my acne.</li>
      <li>Within my first try on I could see a difference.</li>
      <li>and at first I didn&#x27;t see a difference, so</li>
      <li>I had to pay more attention to that information prior to wasting $55 on this product!</li>
      <li>I bought it because I trusted that Dr. Weil not put his name on a product claiming to diminish dark spots and even out skin tone if it did nothing of the kind.  </li>
      <li>but really didn&#x27;t see any changes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really???  </li>
      <li>the combination of this, zero oil face wash, modern friction twice a week, and body shop&#x27;s matte finish moisturizer, and...</li>
      <li>but this seemed to really work for me.</li>
      <li>I was really amazed.</li>
      <li>It is very tacky in texture, and remains so overnight.</li>
      <li>Would recommend it to anyone, and especially women with more mature skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is in pretty good shape but has a few brown spots that appear in the summer and my skin&#x27;s overall quality could be improved.</li>
      <li>VASELINE works for my very sensitive, rosacea-fair skin (</li>
      <li>so I would definitly recommended to you if you have old acne scars.</li>
      <li>I will be buying another bottle and see how far i get with it.</li>
      <li>Ive been usong this product for nearly 3 weeks....</li>
      <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin and Origins doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
      <li>I think that I see some scars beginning to fade, though I think it might be too early to tell.</li>
      <li>Although my skin felt nice, the product was pretty much a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
      <li>Such a big difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try it out, as I have several \\&quot;age\\&quot; spots on my face and uneven skin tone.  </li>
      <li>After about a month&#x27;s time, I started to notice a general lightening but no noticeable change to age spots.  </li>
      <li>Generally glowy-er.</li>
      <li>Got a motorcycle pipe burn and you can barely see the spot.</li>
      <li>Although it is kinda pricey I will still continue to purchase as I have tried so many products out there that either do not work or may work for a little bit but after use the dark spots come back.</li>
      <li>I dont have any large dark spots just trying to even my skin tone out.</li>
      <li>I do not have very dark spots, just some light sun damage around the jaw and upper forehead, so I expected some results.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received a sample of this product at an Origins store, and decided to give it a try.  It is very tacky in texture, and remains so overnight. And to my horror, the dark spots on my face, from acne outbreaks, only got worse. I stopped using this product after 1 application.&lt;br /&gt;Thank heavens, I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this product.</li>
    <li> I started using this product in 90 degree weather with 99% humidity and it didn&#x27;t make me break out, so right away I was impressed. I haven&#x27;t had any luck with serums so I was skeptical to start. I&#x27;ve been using for almost a month and have had NO breakouts, which is incredible. I think that I see some scars beginning to fade, though I think it might be too early to tell. What I do see is a brighter, more even complexion. Generally glowy-er. Very pleased so far!</li>
    <li> I used this product as a daytime moisturizer after showering. The consistency is gel-creamy, smooth and silky. Unobtrusive, earthy smell that doesn&#x27;t last. Glides on and absorbs remarkably well. It didn&#x27;t leave any kind of sheen on my face, which is great. Leaves a matte finish that lasts all day. For all of those properties, its a winner.</li>
    <li> Like all teenagers I&#x27;ve had a lot of acne. And I still have some left over scrars from the acne. My skin was red espacially on the T zone. I tried a lot of products to remove that redness from my scars going from cheap to expensive. Waist a lot of money and I finally found the one product that made THE difference. I had asked for a sample because I was tired of buying expensive product for nothing. Within my first try on I could see a difference. I was really amazed. Once I had finishes the sample I immidiatly bought it. It worked for me so I would definitly recommended to you if you have old acne scars.</li>
    <li> its so smooth and doesnt clog my pores! i have super sesitive skin and it makes it feel great! i definitely  see an improvement but you really have to stick with it to see good results.</li>
    <li> The product feels great on the skin, but it does not serve its purpose.  I do not have very dark spots, just some light sun damage around the jaw and upper forehead, so I expected some results.  I used it twice a day, week after week, month after month, until the bottle was finished.  Alas, my lightening effort, the whole point of the exercise, was in vain.  Although my skin felt nice, the product was pretty much a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells great, absorbs quickly, and makes my skin smooth, soft, and bright. I cannot comment on age spot removal as I am only 34 years old, but I have a few red spots on my skin that seem to have faded after a while of continuous use of this product. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> VASELINE works for my very sensitive, rosacea-fair skin (redhead)&lt;br /&gt;in days my complexion was greatly improved. and it&#x27;s inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Bought the larger size to give it a good try. The bottle is empty, my largest dark spot has doubled in size. I contacted Origins customer service several times, but got no response. They will tell you that they back up their product, but they don&#x27;t. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT AND SAVE YOU HARD EARNED DOLLARS.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Such a big difference after the first use. It gave my face more clarity and smoothness. After a week I started to see my dark spots fade. I have been using this for about a month and half now and I love it. Although it is kinda pricey I will still continue to purchase as I have tried so many products out there that either do not work or may work for a little bit but after use the dark spots come back. This one gives me a continuous smooth and brightness on my face even if i don&#x27;t use it for a day or so and also I am tan skinned so it doesn&#x27;t whiten my face like the other products i&#x27;ve used it just smooths out my face without causing it to have bleach effect.</li>
    <li> I use ALOT of different products from Origins even their makeup because I have oily skin &amp; have moderate acne which always includes ofcourse, scars! This product is awesome! It&#x27;s never broken me out which lotion type substances usually do on my face. My scars have really lighten up! In fact I&#x27;m sure if I didn&#x27;t have continuous acne all my scars would be gone or extremely light! (&amp; I had pretty bad scars)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been following Dr. Weil for some time, and I always take his advice with a grain of salt.  Some of it works for me, and some of it doesn&#x27;t.  When I saw this product advertised in magazines, I just assumed that he was just putting his name on it for revenue purposes....so....when a salesperson at Macy&#x27;s saw me glancing at it in the store and started giving me a sales pitch, I was a bit skeptical.  However, since my skin has a lot of sun damage, visible spots, and many spider veins showing up....I thought I might as well try it, since I was using tons of concealer and many liquid make-up products.  Well....the instructions were to use it twice a day, but I ended up using it mostly only once a day...and at first I didn&#x27;t see a difference, so I figured I was just like all the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  That is...until about two weeks later....my skin has improved so dramatically, that all I need now is just a touch of concealer here and there...no more liquid foundation necessary.  Love this stuff, and would pay the price for it any time.  I am not sure what the negative reviews are all about...and the woman who wrote about the \\&quot;sample\\&quot;...well, all I can presume is...perhaps it&#x27;s not this product that she tried.  I&#x27;m 100% sold on it.  Would recommend it to anyone, and especially women with more mature skin.</li>
    <li> I was beginning to get dark spots and sun damage was making itself known. This product got rid of them. I stopped using it and they slowly came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and Origins doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional and meets all expectations for persons with normal skin. This is my second order and I expect future orders of the same product</li>
    <li> i bought this to treat my hyperpigmentation, it did not work. $55 just wasted. It deserves one star because it smells great but after that does not work.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product after receiving a hard sell at an Origins store.  I was excited to try it out, as I have several \\&quot;age\\&quot; spots on my face and uneven skin tone.  I have used it twice a day (at the sales person&#x27;s recommendation), every day for 6 weeks now and have seen absolutely no difference in my skin tone or the appearance of my spots.  I have to say that I love the scent and feel of this product.  However, for $55 and no noticeable results, I would say this is a definite rip off.  I was really wanting to love this product.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I wanted to tell how amazing this stuff is. I ordered the trial size because usually my face breaks out from everything. I have sensitive and acne prone skin but this amazing stuff really helped clear up my old acne scars and kept away my acne. My skin didn&#x27;t get bothered or irritated. I began using it every other night and noticed a different in the texture and spots. I only use it at night and it works great. I would increase but it still helps at using it once a day. Great product but a little pricey... After I&#x27;m done with my trial size I&#x27;ll be buying the bigger container. Good luck!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as instructed and have seen absolutely no difference in the dark spots. I bought it because I trusted that Dr. Weil not put his name on a product claiming to diminish dark spots and even out skin tone if it did nothing of the kind.  A complete waste of money and Dr. Weil should be ashamed of putting his name on such a useless product. A complete sham of a product.</li>
    <li> I like Dr. Weil and I liked the idea of this product but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GOOD side: comes in a beautiful package, looks and smells wonderful, no adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;The NEGATIVE side: it did not do anything for my brown spots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have fair skin, prone to get freckles and sun spots.  I used it for 1 month, regularly, twice daily (morning and night), stayed out of the sun, used sunblock but there was no change in my pigmentation.  I know the change could happen so gradually that I wouldn&#x27;t notice so I actually took a picture of my skin before starting and after a month and the photos look identical.&lt;br /&gt;Something I noticed on the actual website for this product is that it looks like it brightens spots if you have darker skin but for fair skin like mine, it didn&#x27;t seem to have much effect.  I had to pay more attention to that information prior to wasting $55 on this product!</li>
    <li> es muy útil para el cuidado del rostro,  crea un balance en el tono de la piel reduciendo las manchas</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 5 months and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin tone, brown spots and so forth. My skin is in pretty good shape but has a few brown spots that appear in the summer and my skin&#x27;s overall quality could be improved. The product hasn&#x27;t made my skin condition worse - just no improvement. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and i definitely see my skin brightening up but not as much as i expected. I dont have any large dark spots just trying to even my skin tone out. I will be buying another bottle and see how far i get with it. I like that this serum isnt sticky and feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost six months.  After about a month&#x27;s time, I started to notice a general lightening but no noticeable change to age spots.  I continued to use it for another four/five months...it seems to moisturize a bit, isn&#x27;t oily...but really didn&#x27;t see any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Origins to inquire if some age spots were just too deeply entrenched to be touched by this and was told \\&quot;it&#x27;s not meant to remove age spots\\&quot;.  Really???  I sure don&#x27;t remember reading that disclaimer in any of their advertising.</li>
    <li> This item works fantastic on burns. Got a motorcycle pipe burn and you can barely see the spot. I immediately iced spit to get rid of the heat and used this 4 times a day.</li>
    <li> Soooooo good....wonderful product indeed. Ive been usong this product for nearly 3 weeks....my skin is becoming evenly toned Looks awesome....thanks origins!!!</li>
    <li> This has become a &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for me. The results are noticeable and overnight impact on small blemishes are great</li>
    <li> Takes a while though to see improvements but overall great product. I would buy it again it keeps your skin glowing makes you look more radiant. I&#x27;d say it takes a month and a half to see the change</li>
    <li> i received a sampler of this product with my order of modern friction (awesome), and figured, enh, what the hell. i applied a light coating, morning and night, until i ran out, about a week or so. the combination of this, zero oil face wash, modern friction twice a week, and body shop&#x27;s matte finish moisturizer, and... my face GLOWED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have since run out of the wee sampler of mega-bright, annnnnd... i don&#x27;t glow anymore. i read that you should keep using this product for a few weeks before seeing any results, but... damn. my face looked awesome for that week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everyone is different. but this seemed to really work for me. perhaps see if you can get a sample at an origins location, or with a regular order, before committing to a large, expensive bottle.</li>
