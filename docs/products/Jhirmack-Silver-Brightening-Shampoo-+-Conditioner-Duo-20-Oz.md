      <li>Highly recommend...</li>

<li> One of the few grey hair shampoos that does not turn your hair blue!</li>
<li> It seemed to do the job just as well as other brands.  </li>
<li> It is somewhat thick and a bit gritty, but the results are noticeable.</li>
<li> Consistency of products appears to be thinner and less dense than previous bottles we have had.</li>

    <li> I color my blonde hair myself. A new hairdresser asked me who colored my hair, and could not believe I was doing it myself at home from a box. It is somewhat thick and a bit gritty, but the results are noticeable.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner for my 91-year-old mom who has a beautiful head of grey hair.  She loves the way this product keeps her hair looking shiny.  It helps keep the color from yellowing and softens the sometimes coarse grey hair.  Mom has been using this product for a few years now.  About 6 months ago she decided to try another product but quickly went back to Jhirmack.  This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Very good product leaves my hair even blonder!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been gray since I was in my 20s, but I&#x27;ve colored it for years.  I decided once to allow to gray to come through, but I changed my mind and colored it again.  I used this product once before and my hair was beautiful and silvery.  This time, at age 60, I decided to stop dying my hair again, and had a hard time finding  this product in the stores.  It still works,  my hair is soft, manageable and shiny and unlike some of the other products in the beauty stores, it does not turn my hair blue.</li>
    <li> Have used for years; keeps my hair a bright silver.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have to go looking for my Mom&#x27;s favorite!</li>
    <li> Sipped on time&lt;br /&gt;Smells SOOO GOOD&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the shampoo is so watery, though, that I will not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to salon brands which are twice the price, but I only use them once per week, as they are a much higher quality and are therefore  the more budget savvy choice</li>
    <li> Consistency of products appears to be thinner and less dense than previous bottles we have had.</li>
