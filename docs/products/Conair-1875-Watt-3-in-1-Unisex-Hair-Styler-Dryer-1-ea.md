      <li>Works great on curly  hair...</li>
      <li>This is great for men.</li>
      <li>It is a great hair dryer but not for all hair types.</li>
      <li>Because of the brush attachment and the proximity of heat, it successfully tames frizz.  </li>
      <li>As good and lighter than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
      <li>but I remembered when I was a teenager how I loved this shape.</li>
      <li>Therefore, the brush attachment won&#x27;t do me any good.</li>
      <li>this good EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Frankly, I can&#x27;t imagine it doing anybody any good.</li>
      <li>I had one of these before and loved it.</li>

      <li>Now, I am able to do it a couple of times a week!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>so, I purchased the Conair Infinite (which I love!) and put this one in my travel/emergency bag.</li>
      <li>And yes, the brushes wear out eventually, but this hair dryer is so amazing that I do not mind ordering replacement brushes.  </li>
      <li>So they were really nice and helpful with that.  </li>
      <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find this kind of blow dryer in the retail stores I decided to look on Amazon...</li>
      <li>This dryer will work on any kind of hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to take some hair and hold it against the brush attached to the blow dryer and get nicely straightened/curled ends.</li>
      <li>i have reordered the blower many times and am very satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>The dryer has great power, dries and straightens my hair quickly.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a valid point, but it&#x27;s very easily overcome by using a couple of strips of duct tape to keep it in position.  </li>
      <li>I really liked this drier because it seemed to be able to handle my this 4b hair.</li>
      <li>However , on the latest model the attachments pop off very easily while you are using it.</li>
      <li>hair dryer is so easy to use and make my hair nice and soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Am totally satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>And to modify both combs shape to avoid the broom-like ends to achieve a nice smooth flip at the ends.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this blow drier better than the higher level model that I bought last time. This one is nice &amp; light with plenty of heat and air force.</li>
    <li> Excellent product dries hair very fast so there is no drying out of your hair. I use it everyday. I always buy conair tried other more expensive brands and they don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Styler heats fine but will time out if used too long. May have to dry hair in small batches and let brush cool in between.  Brush attachment is to flimsy for coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this style blow drier for about 15 years now &amp; they are selling less &amp; less in the stores. I recently purchased a newer design from Vidal Sassoon and it was horrible- it had more heat options &amp; levels, but it literally turned off after 2.5 mins of using it EVERY single time. I went back to this model since I had bought it the last 2 years &amp; I am very happy with it. Only downfall is that you do have to replace it every year to year &amp; a half, but for the low price &amp; results I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer works exactly as advertised. It has good power, and I particularly like the fine comb attachment. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and easy to take on a trip.</li>
    <li> I Ordered a hair dryer, waited day got a tracking number and the day before I was to get it, I got an email stating that they canceled the order as they did not have it. If I new it was out of stock I would have ordered it from somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived promptly.  This is the best blow dryer for mixed hair.  The brush attachment makes it easier to style my half curly/half straight hair.  I usually use a flat iron to straighten but this dryer does it all.  After I wash my hair, I apply just a little Olive Oil all over, brush it dry with this dryer and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
    <li> If you like heat, then this is the dryer for you.  I love the way it straightens while drying quickly.</li>
    <li> Decent hair-dryer. I have shoulder-length, thick, coarse hair. Therefore, the brush attachment won&#x27;t do me any good. Frankly, I can&#x27;t imagine it doing anybody any good. However, the detangler and the styler attachments work very well.</li>
    <li> I am currently on our third Conair 3 in 1 in probably six years.  I cannot live without this hair dryer.  We use this everyday and all family members are happy.  I personally use it to blow out my hair, then run an iron through my hair afterwards.  My hair never looked this good EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have complained that the brushes pop off.  This is true, but if you squeeze the bottom of the brush then but it on, it will stay on.  And yes, the brushes wear out eventually, but this hair dryer is so amazing that I do not mind ordering replacement brushes.  It comes with an order form that you can get replacement heads from Conair.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This styler was recommended to me by a friend who, like me, has always had curly hair she wished would be straighter.  This one does it effectively and quickly. And with only a dab of \\&quot;product\\&quot; the style holds up through humid weather.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is fantastic! I am black with really course hair and it dried my hair in less than 10 minutes. It is easy to use with the comb attachment. I only use the thick comb. I haven&#x27;t use the brush attachment nor have I used the smaller comb attachment. I would definitely recommend this blow dryer to others.</li>
    <li> I have gone through a few of these over these years.  It blow drys my hair and then the brush is perfect for styling my not-so-thick hair. Sometimes I&#x27;ve bought a different one, but never liked them. Now, it seems no stores have them.  I was very happy to find one on Amazon.  It was shipped promptly and exactly what I expected (of course!).</li>
    <li> Have used this dryer  for years.  It works perfectly with my short  blown style.  Hard to find in retail outlets lately. Thanks to Amazon I was able to locate and ordered two so  I am prepared for the future.</li>
    <li> I love the way my medium length hair looks after getting a blow out at the salon, but couldn&#x27;t manage to do a round brush/blow dry at home. This solved my problem! It&#x27;s very easy to take some hair and hold it against the brush attached to the blow dryer and get nicely straightened/curled ends. Love this!</li>
    <li> Well I have always wanted one of these since seeing my sister-in-law with one and falling in love with it.. This item is just great for my hair as I have thick hair and does my hair very well. I always admire conair products</li>
    <li> It is a great hair dryer but not for all hair types. If only they can modify the attachments design so they don&#x27;t fall easily with heat and when used on coarse hair, and to modify the fine comb attachment to be made from a more sturdy material. And to modify both combs shape to avoid the broom-like ends to achieve a nice smooth flip at the ends. The brush attachment though wouldn&#x27;t make the ends smooth once the air s dry, and it is not convenient to use on wet hair unless your hair is already straight!!  What I like most about it is that it dries thick hair really fast and straight without the need to section your hair.</li>
    <li> After I found this out I totally retired my blow dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is so easy to use and make my hair nice and soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement to an identical Styler that I have worn out.  I have thick, curly hair and it is sooooo much easier to do my blowouts in the morning with this styler, rather than using a dryer and round brush separately.  I hope they never quit making this model.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer does exactly what it is designed to do. There is nothing fancy about it, but the combs are great for straightening my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> i actually really love this dryer. i am black with natural (not relaxed) kinky hair. I purchased this dryer specifically for the comb attachments. I can only use the comb with the widest teeth, the other two are not useful for my hair texture at all. The dryer has great power, dries and straightens my hair quickly. My only gripe is that there is only one wide-tooth comb attachment, and my mother broke it, so now I can&#x27;t really use the dryer anymore for straightening, which is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> this dryer was a recommendation from a friend and I love it.  It does wonders for me a my daughters very curly unruly hair.  I have only used the wide tooth attachment it straightens our hair and makes if feel smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer because I am having shoulder surgery and need to be able to dry and style my hair with one hand.  I thought this would work well for that reason.  When I tried it, the dryer was so bulky that I found it difficult to use.  I am using it with my left hand (and I&#x27;m right handed).  Maybe with practice, it will get better, but as of now, its not a good option.</li>
    <li> The attachment broke after only few uses, and you can&#x27;t return it after 30 days.  Otherwise the power and way it works was excellent.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  The combs make it easy to dry your hair quickly.  The dryer itsself lasts a couple of years.    My only issue is that once the teeth on the combs on the attachment start breaking it is expensive to order a replacement part almost half the cost of getting the whole dryer new.</li>
    <li> Have used this style hairdryer for years and this was my favorite brand.  However, this last hairdryer is disappointing.  I used it twice with no problem.  During the third use, the brush attachment fell off and can&#x27;t be reattached.  I can&#x27;t use the combs with my hair so now the hairdryer is no good to me.</li>
    <li> As soon as product came i just looked at picture and Realized it was too big. Didnt even use and just returned</li>
    <li> This hairdryer overheats too quickly  and the brush attachment falls off.  It&#x27;s fairly new but I&#x27;m looking for a replacement.  If you use it in a foreign country, it only works on one setting and it gets too hot.</li>
    <li> i use the blow dryer to get my bangs straightened its the only thing i can use .. having curly hair is such a problem tho</li>
    <li> Excellent styling tool for those with lots of curly hair. My hairs are fine, but I have quite a lot of hair (stylists often comment about how long it takes to straighten!) But, with this dryer and the brush attachment, my long hair is dry in less than 20 minutes! My only slight con is that is does get pretty hot, but I can work around that. My brush attachment did keep falling off after awhile, but I just super glued it on a couple months ago(I don&#x27;t use the other attachments) and it hasn&#x27;t fallen off since. As a busy mom, I used to blow dry my hair straight once or twice a month. Now, I am able to do it a couple of times a week! Goodbye $200 professional hair dryer!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer has an overheat sensor that turns off the dryer when it overheats.  Sounds like a great idea, but it shuts off every 30 seconds.  Sometimes, it only runs for 10 seconds before shutting off.  I am not exaggerating at all.  It literally has not run for a whole minute once.  HATE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this blowdryer because I had one for a number of years and dropped it and it started over heating. This is a great brand to use because it lasts quite a long time. I like the way it works, the different settings and how it fits in my hand when I am using it.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer keeps shutting off after being on for 30 seconds.  The attachments don&#x27;t stay on when the hair dryer is on, they get too hot and flexible and fall off the hairdryer.  Worst hairdryer I&#x27;v ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have used nothing but Conair products. they are great they are the best. and yes I would so very much recommend all there hair products.</li>
    <li> One of the few ones of the styling type still on  the market for some reason.  Works best on my gradually balding head!</li>
    <li> the brush attachment falls off every time it is used avoid this dryer. Only one heat setting in the UK</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product for very long but so far I am happy with it. I do not use the comb or detangler. I mainly use the brush attachment.</li>
    <li> Described as being useable anywhere in the world which is misleading.&lt;br /&gt;When switched to the UK voltage you can only use the SD4P dryer in the hottest setting with the maximum fan speed - which is fine if you want to use it for paint stripping!!</li>
    <li> The brush attachment falls off right away. Is so frustrating. I had one before that did not fall off. Dont know why this one does. Is almost useless for its intended purpose</li>
    <li> My husband can&#x27;t get used to a regular hairdryer and loves these stylers.  So happy to be able to still find them.</li>
    <li> There is a problem with the switch.  I always have to turn it off by raking it on the edge of the granite counter top.  I should have returned this, however we went on a trip soon after I received the item.  If the switch worked, it would be great.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in good condition and works well. I like it just fine. Would recommend t a friend. Just like the old days</li>
    <li> I always buy Conair for the reliability and long life span.  I really like this model for drying my short hair since I can add body without using 2 hands.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Have used this hair dryer for years and years. I hope Conair never discontinues it. It allows me to use one hand for my hair and one hand for the dryer as the brush is attached. I never liked having to use both a brush and a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine sandy blonde hair, but a lot of it.  The type that takes curl easily, but looks all wavy (not in the pretty way) if it dries naturally.  I&#x27;ve used these Conair brush dryers sine I was old enough to blow dry my hair (my parents used this kind since the 70s too), and I love that it straitens so nicely and gives pretty volume &amp; shine, just by using the brush attachment to dry, without using an iron.  Oh and it straitens + dries completely in under 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old one finally gave out after several years and the only kind like it at Walmart was a cheap Vidal Sassoon one that I had to take back because it had almost no power- really wimpy air strength or &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; power (for lack of a better term).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is I&#x27;ve always wished I didn&#x27;t have to hold down the cool burst button the whole time I use that button when setting my straitened/dried hair (though this newer model doesn&#x27;t make me press so hard, which is nice).&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;I bought this through Amazon Prime (cheapest price. I looked elsewhere first).  My new package came only including the 2 comb attachments and not the bristle brush (which is the only piece I use), so that was annoying.  But the customer service person over Amazon Chat had a whole new package overnighted to me for free, and said she&#x27;d make sure they check that all the parts are in the box.  Should arrive tomorrow.  All I have to do is print a return label and ship the first box back via UPS.  So they were really nice and helpful with that.  (I tried Conair corporate first...they were less kind/helpful.)&lt;br /&gt;-Krystal</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these dryers.  The one I kept works fine.  Took the other one to my daughter&#x27;s in&lt;br /&gt;Steamboat Springs, CO., elevation 7,000 ft.  This one kept cutting off after about one minute of drying time.  Had to blow on it to cool it off so it would start again.  Don&#x27;t know if it was because of the altitude or just a faulty heat control mechanism??  Either way, I left  it there.</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing the hair, as I have naturally wavy hair, I can travel with it and avoid blowout appointments.</li>
    <li> Dryer works great except the teeth on the detangler combs break off, especially on the higher heat setting.  When I first purchased the dryer there was an instruction pamphlet inside that had a small order form for the attachments. I was able to use it and ordered combs a few years ago. But now I need more and can&#x27;t find a place that sells them. Had no luck on the Conair website or on Amazon or eBay..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Conair for many years because I like the brush attached. However, the last 4 that I bought, the brush falls off while using it. Other than that, this is the best hairdryer of this style.</li>
    <li> I love it...Very nice temperature setting! Although I had to use the comb to push the temperature setting down.</li>
    <li> Just used this Conair for the first time today. I found the brush didn&#x27;t work well with my moderately thick, shoulder length hair, but one of the combs did well. It gets hot enough to do the job quickly. I have Lyme disease and struggle with muscle function. This blow dryer is light enough for me to handle. My biggest problem with it is that there is a somewhat shrill noise to the fan. Since it&#x27;s quick, I can live with it but wish it were made of a slightly higher quality.</li>
    <li> I have very curly long hair and have never had the patience to do the whole, \\&quot;hold a blow dryer in one hand while I round brush with the other.\\&quot;  My arms get tired after 2 minutes and I end up sporting the frizzy look.  Either that or the round brush gets all stuck in my hair.  With this blow dryer, I am able to have flat smooth hair in 5 minutes or less.  I also like this dryer is because I don&#x27;t have to spend as much time with the flat iron trying to smooth it out after it&#x27;s dry.  The less damaging heat, the better.    Pros: easy, does not get too hot, quick drying time, shortens styling time  Cons: Brush attachment does not stay on with repeated use</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay.  it dries your hair.  i like the venting on the side rather than the tip for styling rolled-under long hair.  it works, what can you say about a hair dryer, they all work.</li>
    <li> I really liked this drier because it seemed to be able to handle my this 4b hair. The straightness I get from the combs is almost on par with that of a flat iron. My only complaint is that the finer tooth comb has lost a number of teeth after about 4 uses and the wide tooth comb snapped after two bouts of drying my hair. I have been looking for replacement combs for this model, but it seems that they do not exist. The drier is of little use to me without the combs, which is sad, since I only bought it last September.</li>
    <li> I love the attached brush of this blow dyer as it helps smooth out my unruly curly hair. I am on my 5th one now as the dryer lasts me 2-3 years and conks out with the intense use with my thick hair. Not complaining about the life span as it has been par for course for lifespan of other dryers. However the brush does fall off when it does heat up and if you have thick coarse hair that grabs the brush this is very irritating.  Problem solved once  I discovered heat resistant epoxy. If you know that you will only ever use one attachment it solves a problem that the manufacturer has never been able to solve.</li>
    <li> I have used the Conair 1875 Hair Dryer for many years. There is always one thing wrong - the brush does not stay attached to the dryer while you are drying your air. Same with this one. It worked fine for a couple of weeks but now all of a sudden the brush comes off during drying. Is this a known problem?</li>
    <li> Have used in past. Great for my hair.  Unfortunately, brush attachment fell off after only a few uses, doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on very well.</li>
    <li> This appears to be a decent hair dryer.  It isn&#x27;t easy to find a hatchet-style dryer and this one is, so far, just fine.  It isn&#x27;t as powerful as the pistol style, but I guess if you&#x27;re buying this type of dryer, that suits you.</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T USE THE STYLER ON HIGH BECAUSE EVERYTIME I DO IT BLOWS A FUSE.  NO, I DON&#x27;T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ANY OTHER ELECTRICAL ITEMS.  I HAVE TO BELIEVE IT&#x27;S THE STYLER.</li>
    <li> Bought this dryer to replace aged hatchet dryer, not for the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Other raters downgraded it for the attachments not staying attached..&lt;br /&gt;For my use it works satisfactorly.</li>
    <li> Little larger than I thought but does a good job.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and it functions very well and does an excellent job.  I could not make it without this dependable product.</li>
    <li> Works beautiful, now I only need makeup now that I have Skype. It&#x27;s amazing how one new purchase leads to many more.</li>
    <li> Well its a hair dryer fast shipping and my daughter likes it very much not much more you can say really.</li>
    <li> Have used this type Hair Brush/Dryer for years until it finally wore out.  Could not find replacement in any local stores, so was ecstatic when I located the exact same one on Amazon.  So pleased to be able to use one again.</li>
    <li> This dries my thick, coarse, curly hair faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use. The brush attachment falls off the dryer the second it touches my hair. Maybe it would work better for someone with thinner hair, but if you have somewhat thick hair, it&#x27;s just not worth taking the chance. If only it didn&#x27;t fall apart every time, it would be great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of hair dryer for years, but lately you just can&#x27;t find them where they used to be sold (such as drug stores, Target, etc.).  I bought 2 to have as replacements when they eventually stop working after a few years.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine, curly hair and the brush attachment worked to straighten it the first time I bought it.  After that, it was worthless because the brush attachment kept falling off the blow dryer.  In other words, the brush fell off the dryer every time I tried to pull it through my hair.  This was caused by the heat of the device expanding the plastic on the clamps of the attachment so that it no longer gripped the dryer.  I went back to the store and they kindly gave me a replacement, but the same problem occurred.  I phoned Conair and they suggested I put the brush attachment in the refrigerator (I kid you not) while it was still warm so that the cold would shrink the clamps back to proper size.  This did not work.  They then offered to send me a replacement dryer.  I explained that I had already tried that.  I asked for a refund.  They gave me the runaround for quite some time and then phoned me back to say that all they could do was offer me a replacement.  I will not buy another Conair product again.</li>
    <li> As good and lighter than it&#x27;s predecessor.A loop to hang it on a hook is all it missing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace one I have had that was exactly like it and have used for years. However , on the latest model the attachments pop off very easily while you are using it. i have had it less than 2 months and have already purchased a different dryer. I genuinely like Con Air products but this one is poorly engineered.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair styler for many, many years.  I could always find it at a Wal-mart but not anymore (at least not where I live).  I love the styler in that I can dry AND straighten my hair at the same time since I have wavy, frizzy hair.  I never go out of town without it.  The last one I had (before this one) finally gave out on me after 4 years.  The only thing I am not liking is the brush.  In earlier years, the brush stayed put on the styler.  These days the brush part comes off withing a couple of uses.  I have to tie it (literally) with a pony tail band.  However, I will not change dryers/styler because this one is awesome.</li>
    <li> The heat on high is too much, sometimes I cannot work with it. And the power on low isn&#x27;t enough. The brush works but the other attachments aren&#x27;t very efficient. Because of the power it switches off in the middle of the job. It can be held with one hand but it is too heavy and not ergonomic for shaping the hair</li>
    <li> My wife says that it is designed to fit her needs as she is disabled and can only use one hand.  The bristles hold their shape and are more durable.  This extended the live of the blower.  i have reordered the blower many times and am very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I purchase this hair dryer to replace one I had.  I like so much I gave this one to my mother.  Conair products are very reliable.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is a great place to find older products.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a very good unit. However, it is too large and heavy for my use--(male with thinning hair. The ON-OFF switch is rather small and takes some effort to operate;</li>
    <li> I have been using Conair blowers for a while and this particular blower is number three for me.  This particular blower has me quite upset since everytime I use the brush attachment, it keeps coming off.  I don&#x27;t know what the problem was this tinme around.  I am not able to use blowers that have no attachments so this is why I keep buying this particular blower.</li>
    <li> This was my first hair dryer with an attachment comb and I probably used it regularly for over 5 years. I really liked it but as other reviewers have mentioned the attachments plastic clamp expand and then pop off when I attempted to pull the comb through. I only used the comb attachment so I used electrical tape and taped that bad boy onto the dryer and it worked like a dream for many years. Some of the teeth finally began to break off so I went in search of a replacement comb attachment and they cost as much as a whole new dryer so, I purchased the Conair Infinite (which I love!) and put this one in my travel/emergency bag. So I still have it. It still works and I like it. My new one is better but I would still use this in a pinch</li>
    <li> For those of us who are not pros at blows eying hair, this is excellent</li>
    <li> It´s a very good product. The last one I had (the same) lasted many years. It is efficient, easy to use. I recommend it to anybody with long hair.</li>
    <li> I originally wanted this particular Conair dryer that I had had for years but I couldn&#x27;t find it so I settled for this one.  But to my surprise, I like this one much better than the one I had!  What I liked about the one I had was that it had a nice low setting and that the high setting didn&#x27;t blow too hard.  I have curly hair and when the dryer blows too hard, it pulls your curls too hard and ruins them.  This dryer&#x27;s blower speeds and temps. are perfect.  The higher temp. setting is hotter and doesn&#x27;t blow out as hard as my old one which means my hair dries faster and my curls are still intact.  I also love the wide toothed attachment and the brush attachment on those days I straighten my hair.  This is really a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It burnt out literally my first time using it.  I got to the finish of my blowdry and on the last section of my hair it blew out.  I hit reset on the dryer and on the outlet in disbelief and tried it in other outlets but it never worked again.</li>
    <li> This styler works perfectly. It&#x27;s so convenient to use without having to use both a brush and hairdryer. It comes with three accessories, I mostly use the comb one to straighten. It not only dries my hair but also straightens it in about 5 minutes. A very worthy investment.</li>
    <li> Wow this Conair works well, dry, strait my hair very fast! I have it for a year now and I know it&#x27;s going to last me 8 or more years. I had the old version for 10 years the only reason I had to throw it away because somehow my kids found it and bit on the wire. Even my 3 year old son who doesn&#x27;t have a hair cut yet when I can&#x27;t pass a comb through his hair I used the dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it a negative five star if I could. Do not buy this dryer. The attachments will not stay on. The grooves on the dryer are not deep enough to hold the attachments on. The attachments do not lock into place, therefore, less than half a hair stroke, the attachment&#x27;s on the floor. I have yet been able to use it. I&#x27;ve tried to use just about everything I could think of to get the brush to stay on with no avail. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. Horrible and totally useless and so is Conair&#x27;s customer service.</li>
    <li> I love this type of dryer because it comes with attachments. I love how it performs while it lasts. I have owned several brands of this same type of blow dryer and it is always a matter of time usually a couple of months before they give out and stop working. Every single time, without fail. I do like that it is easy to hold and it is almost as using a hair brush which makes it more ergonomic. I wish they lasted longer than a few months before dying on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found my review helpful.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. This is coming from a girl with super thick unruly &amp; curly hair that never uses a hair dryer and rarely straightens her hair due to the hour of time it takes (and that&#x27;s after drying time). This dryer took my hair from wet to straight &amp; flipped out hair in 20-25 minutes. Beautiful results.. It&#x27;s silly to say but this dryer is life altering for a girl with my kind of hair.</li>
    <li> Good  solid quality especially for shorter hair (men) and a quick dry.  This my 2nd one and the first lasted 9 years. Highly recommend this dryer and this seller for quick and reliable service.</li>
    <li> This is a really fine piece of equipment.  My hair is as it has always been, fairly long, and as it&#x27;s quite fine I do need something like this, plus conditioner, to keep it looking okay.  I first bought one of these hairdryers maybe 8 years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  But, knowing it won&#x27;t last forever, and this Conair Styling System being the only one I&#x27;ve been able to find that dries the hair by actually blowing hot hair through the brush, as opposed to simply blowing hot air out of a nozzle, which suits many of today&#x27;s hair styles, I had to but a new one while things were okay.  So I picked up another Conair.  When buying my first one, someone was complaining about the American plug, which of course is no good for the UK.  A simple adaptor is available here on Amazon, which you can pick-up for three or four pounds.  Simple.  Looking through a current review, someone was not happy with the brush attachment, saying it kept coming loose.  That&#x27;s a valid point, but it&#x27;s very easily overcome by using a couple of strips of duct tape to keep it in position.  When doling this, make sure the tape does not cover the air vents, otherwise the product will overheat and cut out.  So, that&#x27;s it.  All very simple - and I have a lovely new Conair for when my old one eventually breaks down.  Buy yourself one *_~</li>
    <li> Lightweight, and I like the brush accesory. The dual temperature control adds to the versility of the Styler. The construction is a not as sturdy as others I have had but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot in comparison to another 1875 watt blow dryer.  One of the combs broke with 2nd or 3rd use.</li>
    <li> I typically use a flat iron to straighten my curly mane, however I was never a fan of the straw-like flat results. With this product it kind of looks like I got my hair blown out at salon, especially after a day of not washing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not always easy to find this style of hairdryer any more, but this one fits the bill exactly and works well.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer worked great, and I was happy to find it online.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer because it has a comb attachment, and I use that to dry with. It tangles my long hair less and I think it drys it quicker.  I have always used this type of dryer and you cant hardly find them in the stores anymore, so I was glad to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and loved it. the old one last for years. the new one had the brush attachments tsart flying off while you do your hair within 2 months, and the dryer will overheat and shut off before you finish your hair. wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product... have been using it for years.  EASY to style hair with this dryer.  Only drawback:  sometimes the brush wants to slide off of the dryer while using it... especially once I&#x27;ve been using it for many months/years.</li>
    <li> Quality, power with the attachments I need. Wish the attachments stayed on a bit better but I&#x27;m still pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and am wanting to let it grow out a little.  I have used a similar product in the past and knew it would help me get through the difficult &amp;#34;growing out&amp;#34; time.  When I couldn&#x27;t find this kind of blow dryer in the retail stores I decided to look on Amazon...and there it was!!!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> great product superfast drying,especially when rushed in the morning and you think yull be late for work.lots of attachments to do all the styles out there.</li>
    <li> I have needed a blow dryer for quite some time and could not wait to use it.  I used it and love it.</li>
    <li> While the power and hand fit are appropriate, the attachments pop off WAY too easily...and I have thin hair....so unfortunately, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair dryer for years. I bought one for my sister for Christmas and she&#x27;s hooked too. Love the shape.</li>
    <li> My favorite Gold N Hot brand hair dryer has been discontinued, so I was trying to find a replacement for it.  I am a fan of the sideways, brush style hair dryer, but this one did NOT cut it.  Yes it does heat up and dry your hair quickly, but the brush attachment continues to fall off!  Very annoying....  I have medium-thick hair, so maybe this hair dryer was meant for people with very thin hair.  Tried using it a few times, but could not stand it after that.  This dryer was definitely not meant for medium-thick African American hair...</li>
    <li> This is great for men. It has two settings; the high setting delivers some seriously hot air. A few swipes through your shower-wet hair and you have dry hair. The comb guides the dryer and brings it just close enough to get the job done quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great on curly  hair...no frizz!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for brushing her hair into a style--no need to hold a brush in one hand and hairdryer in other.</li>
    <li> Bought this one for my summer place.  I liked the other one?  Works as described.  Is fine to take to countries with 220 current.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many of these dryers over the years.  Because of the brush attachment and the proximity of heat, it successfully tames frizz.  An appliance as important as my electric toothbrush and my razor.  &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t leave home without it!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I borrowed a friends and just absolutely loved it so had to get my own.  I have thick hair and a lot of it and its so much easier using this.  I have no patience or enough coordination with holding the brush and a blow dryer so this worked perfectly for me.  Unfortunately i killed the brush attachment, dropped it and stepped on it (yes I cried), but am using the comb attachment till I figure out how to fix the brush or where I can just get a new attachment and its working just as well so far.</li>
    <li> I like the design of this thing and I would not be embarrassed if someone saw it in my bathroom. Yes guys blowdry as well! Anyways so this blowdryer is pretty good in my opinion. It has your usual &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; settings along with a &amp;#34;Cool&amp;#34; button that disengages the heat when held down so you can get a little bit more volume in your hair. As far as the attachments are concerned, I don&#x27;t really use them as I prefer to use my own brush. Guys if you&#x27;re considering a blowdrier I would definitely give this a shot.</li>
    <li> It worked really nice !!! Definitely got all the tangles out of my hair.  Worked better than my old hair dryer that caught on fire.</li>
    <li> Needed one to replace my old one. Usually the brushes get bent and become useless,and never save the box or directions to replace the brushes.This one works fine for me, but the brush itself needs to be built a little better to fit on the unit. Mine seems to slide off sometime, but not a big enough problem not to buy another one when needed</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned. I am so happy with the purchase. I have the usual common hair dryers but I remembered when I was a teenager how I loved this shape. It seems to dry my hair faster. And although I don&#x27;t really need the attachments, I like to have them for when I don&#x27;t have my blow drying brush. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this style of hairdryer for years to staighten my hair and can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore.  Conair seems to last the longest and I&#x27;ve used almost every brand.</li>
    <li> I have bought this blow dryer at a Sallys beauty supply and had no problem with it. Lasted me for years. when it finally recently gave out. I ordered this one. I dont know what the different is, but this one the brush comes right off when you are brushing/drying your hair. It seems as the plastic on the brush is not strong enough to sustain the dryer heat and becomes soft and comes off. I am very unhappy about this. I am going to try to go to the beauty supply again and purchase one there again.</li>
    <li> I have straight fine hair and lots of it. This dryer works best for my hair.</li>
    <li> this thing works great it is a power hog at over 1800 watts but the heat and airflow was surprising. I got this to replace a lost one for my wife and this one works better than the good one dried her hair in less than half the time. I also found out myself on accident that it has a safety heat cutoff In it so it wont catch fire, still works fine and no fire so I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Originally i was only looking to replace the combs but the whole  dryer set was so reasonable in price I had to buy two.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I lost my other one.  I wanted the same product because it not only lasted long, but also has great power in its drying capability for a small dryer.  I did find my old dryer and now I have an extra one whenever the old one breaks down.  This will be my go to dryer for now on.</li>
    <li> No problems.  Hair looks better and dries my hair faster.  Am totally satisfied with it.  I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I should have gotten this years ago, except I never looked for it. This is the best dryer  that I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thick hair that takes a long tie to dry and most hair dryers  make my hair dry and stiff. This dryer will work on any kind of hair.  BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> To Whom It May Concern:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been purchasing the Conair Styler hair dryer for many years and have always been highly satisfied with the product.  So satisfied that I have found it utterly impossible to use a regular hairdryer.  Unfortunately, I am now in a position where I will have to look for another brand.  I recently purchased the SD4P model, as my previous one had just about run its course. After just a few uses with the new one, however, the attachments would not stay attached to the hair dryer.  They just fell off immediately, rendering the dryer useless.  Thinking that it was a fluke and I had purchased a lemon of a hair dryer, I purchased another SD4P shortly after.  But the same thing happened again - with maybe just 5 uses, the brush attachment would not stay attached to the dryer itself.  Since the attachments are essentially 100% of the reason why someone would purchase this particular type of hair dryer, I was extremely unhappy with the quality of the product.  There are now other brands on the market that make this type of hairdryer and so after many, many years of supporting this model of hair dryer from Conair, I will now turn to these other brands.  In my mind, the quality of the Conair product is now subpar and not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Kaitlin Alayan</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother and she loves it.</li>
