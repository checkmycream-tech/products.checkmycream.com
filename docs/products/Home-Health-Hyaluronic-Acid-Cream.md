<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic for old farts like me!!</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Did not help my dry skin at all.  Might be OK for others.....did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I guess it was good, I didn&#x27;t see a difference in one jar.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer but I don&#x27;t see any significant change in my skin</li>
    <li> The product that my dear friend needs to take care her face issue problems.</li>
    <li> Really- the product is rancid! It is not expired according to label but smells bad. If this is a &amp;#34;chemical smell&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t want it on my skin so I stink but smells like something that has turned over time like bad oil.</li>
    <li> This product works great for moisterizing the skin. It leaves my face feeling smooth and I like how it feels</li>
    <li> best face cream ever :)  i&#x27;ve recommended it to friends &amp; have reordered it a couple times now. i love this stuff, it works.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream! It has helped my skin so much. My acne and spots are almost gone and my skin feels and looks so soft. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I had never used this cream but I have found I like it a lot! Makes my skin softer and I can tell the difference!</li>
    <li> The cream itself is light and not greasy - seems to work ok. What I don&#x27;t like is that, because it&#x27;s unscented, it has a terrible scent so I wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
    <li> Terrible smell but promptly delivered</li>
    <li> I really like this for a night cream.  My face is very soft and smooth in the morning.  Most of the other night time moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried haven&#x27;t worked as well.  It&#x27;s a little too heavy for day time use, but I just use my Neutrogena for day time.  I&#x27;d like it a little better if it had a fresher scent - it smells pretty much like buttered popcorn - not really the scent I&#x27;m looking for to retire for the evening, but the scent subsides pretty quickly so it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me.  It&#x27;s a very good price for the amount of product, and I&#x27;ll buy it again because it does work well for keeping skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for a nightly moisturizer. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Paraben free. It&#x27;s got the ingredients that I like, such as Vit. A, C &amp; E. It&#x27;s great. I love it. Reasonable price for 4 Oz. of cream. My skin is oily &amp; acne prone. For this type of skin, I prefer to use it for the night time, otherwise if I use it in the morning &amp; put on my sunscreen afterwards, my skin looks oily. Not that bad. If I&#x27;m home &amp; not exposed to the sun, still I use it in the morning but if I have to go out I prefere not to use it. Or may be I need to change my sunscreen. If I use a different sunscreen, my skin might look less shiny. All in all, It&#x27;s really hydrating. A real good moisturizer, as I expected. It&#x27;s a good product, I believe. It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I definitely order this product again after I run out of it. I&#x27;m happy that finally after all my research about different products, I found this cream. Thanks to Home Health compay for making such a good stuff !!!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing cream I have ever purchased. I&#x27;ve been used it for 4 years now. Used to get it at mothers market in Orange County now I love far and amazon is great! Great seller always get it fast a quick. Turned all my friends and family to it. My sister in law swears by it during pregnancy when her skin was drying out. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer that layers on evenly and makes my skin feel like I gave it a glass of water to drink. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best moisturizing products I have ever used and it is reasonably priced.[[ASIN:B000Q97ZS0 Home Health Moisturizing Cream, Hyaluronic Acid, with Restorative Hydration Complex, 4-Ounces]]</li>
    <li> The cream is good, although it feels heavy, do not add fat to the face, the smell is not pleasant, but it disappears after a few minutes to apply. Good quality and product portion of the price paid, would buy again!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this cream at night I noticed how smooth and moisturized my skin was the next morning. As others said, it is light enough to be used as base for makeup. I do agree the smell is a little on the yuck side but nothing that bad. I do think that it has made my skin look nicer although I do doubt the anti aging hype with hyaluronic acid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and really do like it.  I mainly use under makeup.  It moisturizes your skin just enough.</li>
    <li> I am a celiac and even though they say gluten cannot be absorbed through the skin I am always concerned about touching my skin and then eating something and having a reaction.  I wash my hands a lot to avoid this from happening and my hands have become extremely dry and old looking.  After some looking around i found this wonderful lotion and  it is GLUTEN FREE!!  I have been using this product for a little over a week is wonderful!  My skin is so supple and soft I could not be happier and my hands look much younger already!!!  The product came promptly and I will definitely order this and other products from this seller!  Definitely a good deal too!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product....HOWEVER,  the jar was partially OPENED and it was all over the shipping package and some was definitely wasted. Money down the drain....... I wish I could get a new FULL jar of.... :-/</li>
    <li> thought I would try something that wasn&#x27;t too heavy on my face and that wouldn&#x27;t break my skin out.  This worked great.  As a matter of fact I was just recommending this project to a friend 3 days ago.  My complexion looks better and my face is not soooo dry as it is winter</li>
    <li> This product claims on the front label to be a Hyaluronic Acid cream. But read the list of ingredients. It contains Sodium Hyaluronate, not Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sodium Hyaluronate is the salt of hyaluronic acid and works differently. But it is beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;The topical application of skincare products containing sodium hyaluronate--the salt of hyaluronic acid,\\&quot;should not be confused with [hyaluronic acid] in some topical cosmetic products... Rubbing such products on the skin will not stimulate collagen production.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Hyaluronic Acid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HA is the naturally occurring and widespread component found within the extracellular matrix (ECM) within bodily tissues, especially those of the face. Originally extracted from rooster combs, it is now produced as a reactive byproduct of benign bacteria and is identical to the substance found within the skin. Its water-binding and water-attracting attributes fill up the spaces between the connective fibers collagen and elastin in the dermis. When injected into the face, HA functions to hydrate and separate the skin, holding onto water and supporting all that makes the face plump and voluptuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Sodium Hyaluronate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium hyaluronate has a smaller molecular size as HA (making it especially penetrative), and is able to hold more water than any other natural substance--up to 1,000 times its weight in water!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to these to attributes, when applied topically to the skin it can reach deep down into the dermis to combine with, maintain and attract water. It also promotes skin/blood microcirculation and nutrient absorption, and helps maintain normal metabolism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all both are good. I think Hyaluronic Acid is best and am not please when a label leads people to believe that is what is in the product.</li>
    <li> This cream is smooth, fragrance neutral, and contains no parabens, petroleum, fragrance, colors etc. Great! I agree with other reviewer that it should have a safety seal on it. But mostly Im confused by the fact that neither &amp;#34;Hyaluronic Acid&amp;#34; nor any concentration information for it appear anywhere in the ingredients label. Hu? Are you kidding me?</li>
    <li> This cream is luxurious smells wonderful and really works my new favorite and will stick with it!!</li>
    <li> Product was delivered very quick. Looking forward to start using it and hopefully seeing results.</li>
    <li> I try to find something not sensitive and it can work with my other product, but this one is little greasy, I prefer something much light and moist.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s OK, no big deal. has an odd odor.. very light feeling on your face. nice this time of the year. not greasy or oily at all.</li>
    <li> used it for almost a month....doesn&#x27;t really feel like a moisturizer....not sure if the retinol is effective...since only used it for a month...but won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> It did nothing, very disapointed .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for feel or smell</li>
    <li> This is my second order.  They seem to have made some improvements.  The color and scent are where I noticed the improvement.  I have eczema so this product does not irritate my skin.  By scent I mean there is none where the first order it smelled like french fries when applying.  My skin is soft and plump.  The product goes a long way for me.  I need a 1/2 a dime size dot to cover my face.  It does not feel greasy. I like the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my aging facial skin but I wasnt seeing the results I wanted after using the cream for about a week other than moisturizing my skin. The wrinkles around my eyes and lips were still there. So instead of throwing away the product I thought I would try this on brown moles I&#x27;ve had for years on my abdomen from a pregnancy. I had them checked out by a dermotologist and he said try applying a moisturizer to them or he could remove them. I wanted to try the moisturizer first so I try this product on them. The jar is almost empty after about a month and the smaller moles are fading away!!! I am ordering a second jar and will continue applying the cream until they are completely gone, hopefully.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to find a &#x27;made in America&#x27; product.  I couldn&#x27;t tell by the Amazon page if this was or not, but I took a chance - it is.  Second thing I really liked about this product was the ingredient list.  If you read a lot of ingredient lists as I do, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised that you can understand what is in this jar.  The only negative I will say is an &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; aroma.  It doesn&#x27;t have much scent at all, but what it does have reminds me of something I might have found in my mother&#x27;s beauty supplies.  Other than that, it is very rich and creamy.  My skin seems to soak it up quickly.  It is too early to determine exactly how effect it will be on smoothing out wrinkles, but so far it rates as a very good moisturizer in my book.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks. I have extremely sensitive skin so I am picky about what I put on my face. Usually I just moisturize with a bit of coconut oil, but my skin is oiler than usual in my 20s so I was looking for something new. I use HomeHealth facial gel cleanser which was recommended to me by my naturopath. That has worked great for me for over a year, which is why I looked into a moisturizer from the same brand. That being said, so far it has worked great. No miracles or anything, but my skin feels good, not greasy, and well hydrated. I do agree with other reviewers about the smell (not a huge factor for me though). Minus one star because the packaging was actually awful. There was no seal, no plastic or anything that demonstrated the container hadn&#x27;t been tampered with. I am not sure if they have a reason behind that, but it is really off-putting. I think I would buy this again, but hope that HomeHealth fixes their packaging to be more sanitary.</li>
    <li> Never have I loved a face cream more than this cream! I have oily skin, and this cream doesn&#x27;t allow my normal &amp;#34;oily sheen&amp;#34; to come through, even on a hot day. Plus it appears that this cream &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; my face, something the expensive creams that promise to do just that don&#x27;t! I was so impressed with it that I took it to my aesthetician to look at the ingredients. She indicated it looked to be a well-rounded cream, but the ingredients aren&#x27;t medical grade and probably more watered down than the creams she sells. But, this cream is also a fraction of the price of hers (and I tried hers - I like this much better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance added so it does smell a bit medical. And it does come without a seal (something I really wish the mfg would fix).</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended this cream and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years. I think it&#x27;s the best moisturizer out there. I do wish they would package it in a squeeze tube though.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream but I don&#x27;t think is has a high enough concentration of hylauronic acid for my needs.  It is great in combination with other products and it is truly fragrance free, which is rare for skincare products.  Overall not a bad value.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  I can feel a differnce in my skin. Feels softer and dewy feeling.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I discovered this product on Amazon.com. I had never heard of it before, but when I read about the details of the product, it sounded like a product that was especially geared for people that have skin like me. I have very sensitive skin, so I avoid using skin-care products that contain fragrance. This particular \\&quot;Home Health\\&quot; cream is very sensitive-skin-friendly! On the side of the label, it reads: \\&quot;No Parabens, No Petroleum, No Artificial color, No Fragrance, No Animal Products, No Gluten.\\&quot; It is hard to find skin-care products that don&#x27;t contain some of those aforementioned elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a remarkable change in my facial skin since using this cream...My skin seems firmer and softer. The ingredients in this cream that help improve your skin&#x27;s surface are the following: Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamins A, E, B &amp; C, Green Tea Extract, and Grape Seed.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this cream many times over and it arrives in perfect condition, sealed tightly and works wonders on my skin (like those way more expensive &amp;#34;miracle anti-aging&amp;#34; creams).  The container lasts about 2 months and coupled up with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, your skin appears smooth and flawless.</li>
    <li> It tingles a little when you first apply it but it really makes my skin look beautiful!  It makes my skin look young and healthy!</li>
    <li> They honored their commitments</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now. I like it and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff, it lives up to expectation, great price for the amount of cream in the jar, would buy again</li>
    <li> I love this product it is truly meeting my expectations. I will buy another one when im done with this one.</li>
    <li> this is the core ingredient of all hydrating creams. this a steal. keeps your skin supple and hydrated. no need for any heavy chemical with anti aging proclamations. this does the job beautifully.</li>
    <li> Smells a little old maybe?  Nice feel after applying and doesn&#x27;t break out skin on wife&#x27;s sensitive face.  I don&#x27;t know about purchasing this on the net though.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet if there has been any correction in my completion but I am enjoying this Moisturizing cream. The smell is on the medical side, but not bothersome. We&#x27;ll see as time goes on if I order again.</li>
    <li> I would of liked something better.I didnt get the results I read up on this item.There are cheaper creams that work the same. sorry.</li>
    <li> just reordered this cream again.  This is the only cream that keeps my facial skin moisturized in the winter months.  I use it all year around, but especially appreciate it in cold weather.  Hope not to ever be without it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin so I was skeptical when I ordered this cream.  Not only is this product affordable, It makes my skin feel very soft and no hives or pimples so far!  I really like this product and will buy it again..</li>
    <li> i spent tons of money on cremes,&lt;br /&gt;im 60 years old,&lt;br /&gt;nothing, nothing compares to this one !!!&lt;br /&gt;i love the feel of it on my face,&lt;br /&gt;  it seems to absorb quick &amp; non greasy,&lt;br /&gt;it kinda smells like chalk,  but that doesn&#x27;t bother me  as it goes away,&lt;br /&gt;I was using Garnier for 3 months &amp; its REALLY greasy  ( the night creme that is )&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this a whole month now &amp;  So Far, soooo Good !!!&lt;br /&gt;stay tuned in a month perhaps to edit more &amp; hopefully ill still Love it as good as i do now !!!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer just wish it had a little more Hyaluronic Acid in it as the name states.  The reason I bought it because I thought it was going to be mostly Hyaluronic Acid but it is way down on the ingredients list.</li>
    <li> Decades ago I remember hearing a leading dermatologist claim that it didn&#x27;t matter whether you paid $5 or $50 for a moisturizer, they all did the same thing, seal moisture into the skin. Over the intervening 30 years moisturizers have become more effective than the Jergens Lotion mom applied nightly. HHMC (Home Health Moisurizing Cream) does not contain parabens, which many believe might cause endocrine disruption, developmental and reproductive toxicity, allergies and immunotoxicity. However it does contain my top 3 ingredients for an effective, age defying cream: a form of hyaluronic acid that can be easily absorbed topically, vitamin C, that is more efficiently absorbed topically than orally &amp; vitamin A or Retinol, which is essential for skin health. To make this product even better, it&#x27;s reasonably priced. Does it get any better than this? Oh yes, it does... it&#x27;s unscented, so you can add whatever therapeutic oil (or not) that you like to make it your own. Go crazy, buy two &amp; give one as a gift to someone you love!</li>
    <li> Good cream, nice and light.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I plan on buying this product for the rest of my life. Great transaction. Super fast delivery. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the hyaluronic acid - but it feels pretty sticky on my face compared to the Watts Beauty HA I&#x27;ve been using.  Actually it&#x27;s VERY sticky. I like a nice refreshing hydrated feel but this feels pretty awful. If the ingredient list was not so impressive I&#x27;d be giving this a one star review. I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> It really does the job like it says. my skin feels moisturized all day and I no longer feel tight and dry after washing. try it and you&#x27;ll love&lt;br /&gt;it; I do.</li>
    <li> apparently my wife ordered this on my account so i cant give any first hand knowledge but i can say that i havent heard her complain about it so i assume she likes it... while at the same time i havent heard her praise it so i have to assume it was just okay.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the fragrance. Texture feels like my mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;cold cream.&amp;#34; Tried adding essential oil fragrance but it didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
    <li> This product is not packaged well.  It doesnt have a protective seal and leaks all over the container during shipping.  It seems very unsanitary for a product that is to be used on the face. Returned the product and will not reorder.  I did however purchase Home Health Hyaluronic Acid Rejuvenating Hand And Body Lotion 8 OZ and have been using this on my instead.  Packaged better.</li>
    <li> These work well in our application and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a good product that meets expectations.</li>
    <li> I am on my third jar of this cream.  It is wonderful!  A little goes a long way for me.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this cream twice now and I love it.  It moisturizers without being greasy.  It lives up to the advertisements.</li>
    <li> this cream seems very oily to me, I carry it with me for a spare- I went back to using avon</li>
    <li> best moisturizer i ever used! I have purchased numerous high end moisturizers to no avail... this product worked immediately. My skin absorbed the cream instantly.</li>
    <li> WE like this product but it does have a smell like play dough, so my daughter says.. She doesn&#x27;t like it, but I still am using it with results.</li>
    <li> I just keep buying this product.  Absolutely love it and well worth that cost.  It makes a great facial moisturizer and fine lines really diminish.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years also and I recommend it all the time.  People always ask e what I use on my face as they like my skin.  Great product</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It absorbs in to the skin quickly. It is light and non-greasy. This is a bargin, quality ingredients for the money!</li>
    <li> Have used it for years. Keeps skin moisturized and helps with wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Yes is smells a bit funky but it&#x27;s got some sort of magic in there. The effects are crazy quick and very smoothing. I use it on my hands at night. Turns back the clock and makes you love your hands again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. I can&#x27;t say anything specificly wrong with it but it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold enough hydration for me over the long haul. I think it&#x27;s difficult to find the right combination of skin creams and serums so trying something that gets good reviews and doesn&#x27;t break the bank isn&#x27;t a waste even if doesn&#x27;t do anything miraculous.</li>
    <li> a good product at a bargain price.</li>
    <li> with twice daily use there is a noticeable skin change to the dermal and sub-dermal layers.  Wrinkles diminish and flatten out for the best moister there is for skin.</li>
    <li> My package arrived, I opened it up, and applied. I love this stuff. I was having issues finding something that wouldn&#x27;t break me out but would hydrate. My skin is so soft and acne free! I&#x27;ve put this on, waiting about 10-15 minutes and applied make-up. I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I&#x27;ll keep using this as long as they&#x27;re making it. A little goes a long way. I can tap my clean fingers in the product and come out with more than enough for my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/11/13 update: So since using this I broke out once. I waited about a week and tried using it again. Now I&#x27;ve broken out in tiny little skin-colored bumps mostly around my mouth and skin elsewhere is uneven in texture. Since discontinuing use of this product my skin has slowly been returning back to normal. I have no idea what it is that&#x27;s in this product but my skin hates it. I have since started using Seventh Generation Boosts (Revitalizing and hydrating) added to my moisturizer. Those seem to be working better instead.</li>
    <li> I love this product, results are very precise, and very smooth texture. I love how the skin turns, like ageless.</li>
    <li> My skin is much improved after using this.</li>
    <li> My holy grail moisturizer. I use it every morning and night. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD MOISTURIZING CREAM. WRINKLES LESS NOTICEBLE</li>
    <li> This is the best value in a true moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found.  It really does draw moisture to the skin, plumping fine lines and creating a soft, even, dewy finish.  After I apply the cream, I wait a couple minutes and spritz lightly with a mist of water and a little aloe.  I use it twice daily and it has really softened the fine lines and gives my face an even tone to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To receive a 4 oz. jar of something that actually works instead of getting half as much of so many others that cost twice as much and end up in the back  of your cosmetic arsenal because they don&#x27;t work makes this product an excellent value.  I wish Amazon carried more of this company&#x27;s products.  I&#x27;ve used several over the years and they&#x27;ve all been very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream.</li>
    <li> This screw top lid can be just lifted on/off without twisting. So the product leaked out during shipping and drys out. This is just the start of the pore, pitiful, lack of quality. It dose not contain the Hyaluronic Acid that is in the slightly more expensive ($5) creams; it doesn&#x27;t hold in moisture as other brands do,  I would never waste my money of this again!!!!!  Not even good enough for my heals.</li>
    <li> Too heavy. Will try in winter</li>
    <li> With slow delivery have only been using this a short time...would be interested to know the strength of the Hyaluronic Acid in this product as there is no indication of this on the container. Product had leaked in transit but credit to customer services for refunding some of the price. A shame that shipping is so expensive as this would be the only thing preventing me from ordering more.</li>
    <li> The cream seams to sit on top of your skin. I would think that it would have to go into the skin for it to actually work. As of yet, I haven&#x27;t seen any kind of change in my skin. But, I haven&#x27;t used the product for very long. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this would help my face, I tried it for a few weeks and my face only got worse. I have sensitive skin on my face and the cold dry weather had made it very dried out and lined. I ended up with red, and splotchy looking skin that would burn.I had to discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> I use it night and morning.  I t appears to help. I should have started using iit many years ago. you can&#x27;t wait too many years  ,or mother nature takes over.  I&#x27;m glad { found it when I did.</li>
    <li> Product is ok. Nothing outstanding. Is as described. Haven&#x27;t noticed improved benefit with daily use. Mild HCA</li>
    <li> Very good not greasy makes skin feel nice. I really like it as my skin is very sensitive and some creams burn but the Hyaluronic Acid is very mild and soothing. I also use it on my hands and elbows too. It is a very good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I ordered and received promptly the &amp;#34;Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Cream&amp;#34;.  I have used this product already, and LOVE the results, but I do not take kindly to misleading ads, leading one to believe that you will receive TWO jars, when only one will be shipped.  Please CORRECT THE AD.  I DO LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Very good for oily skin!  love the product.  Would highly recommend!  Product shipping could be better.  Product was not secure in box did not stand upright so there was a little that leaked onto packaging</li>
    <li> When my local store stopped carrying this product I was initially glad to see I could order it online.  Unfortunately, the product had been incorrectly stored - either too long and/or in extreme heat - and was rancid by the time it got to me.  The inconvenience / cost of shipping it back and getting it replaced was greater than the original cost of the product, so I just chucked it.  Too bad, the product was my favorite face cream.</li>
    <li> This cream works really well on my very dry hands and feet, I would certainly recommend it! It feels light, absorbs easily with no greasy feel at all, and only has a very light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Softens skin extremely well.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream was just okay.  It&#x27;s very loose and thin, wasn&#x27;t please with this product.</li>
    <li> It is not greasy, it seems to firm the skin.</li>
    <li> I had bought this to mix with my vit C and discovered that this works better then my olay. I even stopped using it for a month and went back to my old product. this is the best stuff I have ever used on my skin.</li>
    <li> The crème goes on smooth and non-greasy but it isn&#x27;t anything really special.  Expected more improvement in skin. Still have the same wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It works, fine lines are disappearing. Skin feels and looks great. I use this with Dr. Oz&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skim-Potent Anti Aging Serum.</li>
    <li> la crema venia esparcida en la tapa.</li>
    <li> Received in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Rubbed this stuff all over the bunions on my feet, even the parts covered in foot fungus and jungle rot, and it restored my 80 year old feet so they look like they are 70 again.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, I have been using it for years and will continue to use it indefinitely! I love the amazing ingredients and the fact that there is nothing bad in it. It has no scent and absorbs quickly with no greasiness. I highly recommend this to any woman or man who is fighting aging because it really helps!</li>
    <li> It´s the best cream that i have ever used. My skin feels smoother and brigther. The only complain that I have it´s about the lack of packing seal. It´s important because it preserves much better the product and custumers will recieve them as fresh as the seller send them. Try to fix this little mistake, and the sell will be duplicate!</li>
    <li> I love it because it makes my skin soft. I have very dry skin and this helps very much especially during the winter season.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for long time ago and I really love this cream. smoothing and soft. fast shipping. highly recommended. Woman: do not spend to much money in face cream. I think that cream that cost $15.00 dollars do the same that cream that cost over $150.00 and even $50.00.  Only read in the back part the ingredients and you can realize that you are doing rich the brand. In other words you are paying the name.  You can save money and they do the same job.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, I&#x27;m beginning to see an even skin tone, my age spots are fading&lt;br /&gt;and it is not at all greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used moisturizers since my late teens and never have I had such a poor product. My eyes and neck began to show more age than ever after using this product for over 3 months. ..........................NOT A GOOD DEAL....Would never purchase again!!!! .....Few weeks since stopped using product and skin is soft and supple again. Back to store products.</li>
    <li> So, I can&#x27;t get over the fact that there is no protective covering over the cream! Honestly, it was kind of gross. It had a sku label over it but once you remove that and open the jar, it seemed like someone else had it, returned it and now I have it! The contents were sloppy and not filled to the top (semi -used??). Very strange. I just don&#x27;t feel right using it. I would not buy again. Oh and the smell is not pleasant! Had my co-workers sniff it and they said it smelled \\&quot;stale\\&quot;, lol! I hope I don&#x27;t get the cooties! Health before Beauty!!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing.  I love any products with hyaluronic Acid, keeps my skin feeling soft and subtle.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin.  Why would I use something that says dont use on children?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve never bought this if I knew what the label said!</li>
    <li> I am on my third jar of this cream.  Hyaluronic acid is known for its benefits to retain moisture &amp; is usually much more expensive than this brand.  This is a generous size for a very reasonable cost.  It will last for 3-5 months, as you don&#x27;t need to use much of it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to help my skin but I had horrible rashes when I put it on so maybe my skin is too sensitive</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to get a moisturizer not expensive to use in the body. I think that some dark spot in my hands are fading a little. I need more time to have a real confirmation. In the meantime, I purchased two more to send to my sisters in Cuba. The smell is a little weird, yet it is not a great problem because I use it at bedtime and the odor vanishes after a while. I think it is a good inversion and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> For years, I have been using moisturizer from the &amp;#34;Big Box&amp;#34; stores.  Now, I can&lt;br /&gt;enjoy the benefits of hyaluronic acid without paying for top shelf products.</li>
    <li> Returned, product&#x27;s color way off &amp; pre opened!!</li>
    <li> I use this product both day and night. Works well under my make-up, etc. Leaves my skin feeling very soft, but not greasy. Would recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
    <li> The ingredients and texture of the cream were what I wanted the only problem is it has an unpleasant smell</li>
    <li> works just as I thought it would... I don&#x27;t have a lot more to say about this product as I haven&#x27;t had time to see if it works</li>
    <li> This product is great for dry skin. I use it as night cream and I see a big difference right away. My skin feels smoother and looks brighter. It does have a mildly acidic odor but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It works better for me than some other brand name products. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was my aunt who told me about this product. I used it as a moisturizing cream last year and it worked just fine.</li>
    <li> great prodcuct not greasy works great with the derma roller</li>
    <li> Have bought this twice now and will again!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.</li>
    <li> I use it the Beauty Essence Neon Orange High Frequency D&#x27;Arsonval Acne Skin Spot Remover Beauty Therapy.  I put it on first.  Works good.  My wrinkles are not as deep as they were.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product is not irritating at all.  I use it mostly on my face, but also use it on a few places where my skin is dry from eczema.  It is very soothing.</li>
    <li> Ordered because of all the good reviews. Was even more pleased because product came shrink wrapped AND also had an inner safety lid too. It does not smell good; but product is absorbed right away and the smell does not linger. My 50+ skin is looking and feeling much more hydrated than any other product I have tried. My lips are also no longer dry either.  I recommend this cream highly.</li>
    <li> I chose the Home Health Moisturizing cream, Hylauronic Acid because of the ingredients.  I have not complaints at all. My face actually feels hydrated. I don&#x27;t feel the dryness I had before. This is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Best cream on the market.  Keep it coming.</li>
    <li> Incredibly fast shipment. Great product and fairly priced. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for dry weather. I have aging skin (mid 40&#x27;s) that&#x27;s Tzoned and I do notice a great difference in texture and hydration when I use this cream during winter season. It&#x27;s not a miracle cream but it does make some difference. I use it along with Argan oil and homemade vitamin c face tincture.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer. It seems like my skin is better moisturized in the morning when I use it at night and I don&#x27;t need a daytime moisturizer. However, I can&#x27;t stand using it because it burns my eyes! I would get it again if not for the burning.</li>
    <li> i love this cream, but the container I received had been opened.  it makes me a little nervous to use something that has been open</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s supposed to contain hyaluronic acid.  If you just check the list of ingredients, you&#x27;ll see there is NO hyaluronic acid contatined in this product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good moisturizing cream that seems to smooth out the skin and wrinkles. I have used several of these but this one was a good price and seems to help. I have only used about 1/2. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I researched a lot of skin care items and this one has proven to be everything I had hoped for.  My skin looks a lot better since I have been using it, softer, clearer and healthier.  Having said that, the one down side I see to it is that it has no sun block in it at all and you have to be careful to include one in your skin care when you go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing a lot of people had noted as negatives was that it would come without being safety wrapped and appeared (sometimes) to be half empty.  I have ordered this three separate times now.  When the order was fulfilled by AmericaRx or Zulera, it came individually shrink wrapped and the packaging was safe and effective.  The last time I ordered it, it was filled by Nutricity, and all they did was dump the bottle in a box.  I&#x27;m not sure the lid was even on tight when it shipped.  It didn&#x27;t look lilke it had been used or anything like other reviewers noted, but while I would order this product again, I will try to order it from a provider that I know packages it properly.</li>
    <li> feels very nice. Good size.</li>
    <li> I have been using hydration complex moisturizing cream, alone with the hyaluronic acid sermon for 3 days now. And I have had an amazing experience with these to products working together. My skin feels refresh and and very healthy. I like the way my skin looks in such a short period of time. I will definitely continue to use both products on a daily basis as my skin care routine, the results are unbelievable...</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer that is quickly absorbed and non greasy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> high quality product which leaves great satisfaction in their use and price-wise is accessible to everyone reason that I recommend is widely purchased by anyone interested</li>
    <li> I use this every day under foundation. It has no fragrance or sunscreens, so does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell had a slight rancid smell to it. I also didn&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;made it a little red everytime I used it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin cannot use it everyday.  Love the vitamins in it!</li>
    <li> Terrible cream! Hurts my eyes. Hyaluronic acid nowere to be seen in the ingredients!</li>
    <li> Packaging wasn&#x27;t great and its a little looser then I would like but seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve said before that this is one of the best creams I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used them all!! Truly does what it says it does and my skin feels amazing. The woman who gives me a facial every now and then said that my skin seemed very hydrated. The only issue is the packaging, I&#x27;ve written to the company and since they have not responded, maybe they will read this. I find it a bit gross that when you take your cream out of the package and open the jar there is NO protective plastic peel off seal. As soon as you open the jar the cream goes everywhere leaving me to wonder who&#x27;s hands were in it last. The protective peel off seal makes the consumer feel like the product has not been messed with or touched. Also, there is no expiration or disregard date. I hope they do something about this</li>
    <li> It is not greasy.  I see a diminishing of  dark spots on my face.  I use it on my face, neck and hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hyaluronic Acid for a long time and I think it really has helped my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t have all those other chemicals in it...no paraben so I am very happy about that.</li>
    <li> I thought this cream worked as well as  more expensive brands. I use it on my neck and throat. And décolleté. The improvement to my skin Was noticeable after only four days. I plan to buy this product again. And excellent value.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, oily, acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is light, it goes into your skin super fast and most importantly for me, no breakouts. It has kept my skin soft and clear. The jar is a good size and it lasts a looong time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50+ years old, and I&#x27;ve used expensive anti-aging creams for the past 10 years on my face, neck and hands.&lt;br /&gt;I began to read of the benefits of hyaluronic acid added to face creams, so after searching and reading reviews on several brands, I decided to give this one a try. It gave the largest amount (4 oz) for a reasonable cost giving me a longer trial period to gauge results.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it twice a day now for about a month, and have not even used 1/2 of the jar. I have to say that I personally am very pleased with the results! I notice the pores on my face have reduced in size, as well as the lines on my face and neck. My skin tone looks much more even and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;There is no fragrance added, which I&#x27;m glad of..there is a vitamin type of smell, but it is faint and fades after application.&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be aware that there is no sun protection in this, but if you wear other makeup/moisturizer that has SPF over this cream, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use this product in replacement of the expensive anti-aging creams I&#x27;ve used for years, thus saving me money, and I feel the more natural ingredients in this will be better for my skin in every way over time.</li>
    <li> Great product, not oily, just perfect and the seller delivered promptly</li>
    <li> Love this , had some dry places on my face and it has cleared up</li>
    <li> Using this great cream for facial land neck areas, followed by Argan oil.  My skins feels so wonderful.  Good delivery time as usual.</li>
    <li> Alright, having heard about the magic potion called Hyaluronic Acid, I wanted to try one and see what is it all about. I ordered it, got it on time and applied the cream for almost 1 week on my face, around my dark circles, on forehead etc. Bottomline, the dark circles start fading, the area starts getting moisturized and I can say within a week that it does have some effect. I will post an update in 5-8 weeks from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside is the smell..which is acidic. If you want to know how it smells like then it is the smell of a thinner reduced down by 10 notches. Better, try and buy Loreal Anti-Wrinkle Cream with Hyaluronic Acid and thats how it smells like. No big deal thought as the potion is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another downside is the packing. there is no seal on the packing and you cannot know how many hands have touched it before you. This cream is effective but the packing makes it very risky if you are hygiene sensitive individual. If the company does not changed its packing on this material, I would recommend buying this from someone else as the risks of infection are far higher than the ability of cream to moisturize the skin. I read here that one of the customers had even written to the company but they never responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather pay 10 bucks extra rather than get a disease due to the cream being possibly touched by many hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline...cream is effective...does the work...packing is a no no..in some countries you may not be able to sell this off the shelf due to the lack of packing and safety standards applied towards packing. If the company is listening, they should immediately recall all the packs, puts seals on the packs and then reintroduce it.</li>
    <li> Bought this to clear up very dry skin and flakes, did not work as well as I thought, but then nothing else I&#x27;ve tried has either.</li>
    <li> I needed hyaluronic acid for under the eyes. I use this at night before going to bed. I have noticed a big difference in my skin since using it.</li>
    <li> Very good product for reasonable price.  I do wish it was packaged in a tube dispenser to  help keep it germ free.</li>
    <li> The price is cheap, which is good. But this cream is too sticky and hard to apply. I used it for several days and throw it away.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks</li>
    <li> This seems to give me the right moisture but for some reason it along with any other moisturizer causes tiny breakouts overnight and throughout the day. I use this twice a day. When I don&#x27;t use moisturizer, I break out less but then my skin is dry and flaky. The breakouts are just really tiny and on the surface. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again though.</li>
    <li> First jar received had rancid odor so customer service at Nutricity was accomodating and agreed to send a  replacement jar.  I received a replacement jar and it was disgusting!  It was a used, unsealed jar containing about a tablespoon of product at the bottom of this messy jar!  I will not pay to return, but I am through with this company and product!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this twice now. I love it !! For women who work out, this will NOT burn your eyes when you start to sweat.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for its ingredients, such as hyaluronic acid, vitamin A, E, B and C and other ingredients as well. I use this in conjunction with another moisturizer such as coconut oil because my skin never feels hydrated enough with this cream alone. I don&#x27;t think there is any moisturizer or face cream on the market that will get rid of wrinkles, however you may be able to reduce the amount of wrinkles which is naturally occurring with age. I have been taking care of my skin since I was in my 20&#x27;s. I am in my 60&#x27;s and I am satisfied with my skin at my age. This is my own opinion. I think this moisturizer is still a good product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product had a VERY rancid smell, so I had to discard it immediately.  The expiration date was 02/2017, so the only explanation I can come up with was that it was stored in a temperature range that caused this.  I had never purchased this product before, so I have no previous experience to compare this to</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing cream.  Greatly reduces wrinkles &amp; fine lines. Have used it before &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is like a mini facelift in a jar!  I have sensitive skin and this cream does not irritate my skin in the slightest.  I hope other people try this moisturizing cream and enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  It dried out my skin so much it made my face feel wrinkly.  I don&#x27;t consider myself having sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve never tried others like this though.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much it meets expectation</li>
    <li> my husband and i both use this cream and i like it, not too heavy. i put it on prior to using my foundation.</li>
    <li> When I received this cream (12 days after ordering), the jar was not sealed and appeared to be either partially used or partially spilled. (The jar was approximately half full, and the threads of the jar and lid were coated with cream.) Finding this unsanitary and unacceptable, I followed Nutricity&#x27;s return instructions. I paid the return shipping. Today I received this response from Nutricity: \\&quot;We have received the order that was returned to our facility. I want you know that this specific product does not come with any safety seals.  This product was shipped out exactly as we received it.  As such, we have determined that this product was indeed unused at the time it was shipped out to you. Please know that we are unable to accept returns of personal care items, as stated in Nutricity&#x27;s and Amazon&#x27;s returns policies. As such, we will not be able to issue a refund for this order.\\&quot; I never tried the cream. This was a $20 loss. I will avoid Home Health products and Nutricity as a seller.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin.  I try many different moisturizers, but refuse to pay some of these outrageous prices.  This one works well and is reasonably priced.  I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
    <li> Hope it works. Doesn&#x27;t smell good</li>
