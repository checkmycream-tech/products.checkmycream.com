### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It works great!</li>
      <li>The Razorba works great!</li>
      <li>My best advice is to pick your razor and then get the cheapest Razorba for that style handle.</li>
      <li>works great.  </li>
      <li>But for its design, ability to perform its intended purpose and comfort of use, it is a great product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>BUY \\&quot;MANGROOMER\\&quot;, IT IS GREAT.</li>
      <li>It takes me about 15 minutes and the results are very nice.</li>
      <li>Thus the wise win before they fight, while the ignorant fight to win.”</li>
      <li>Non-slip handle is so nice to use in the shower!</li>
      <li>A good buy.</li>
      <li>IT IS THAT GOOD.</li>
      <li>A good thing to also get is the brushes for applying cream.</li>
      <li>And the results&lt;br /&gt;werent good.</li>
      <li>Good product for the price.</li>
      <li>Why do I have to have so many words, if it works great</li>
      <li>For the love of god, save your money!</li>
      <li>FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY.</li>
      <li>This is compatible with a lot of the popular razors that can be found at almost every drug store, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>It takes some getting use to when using for the first time, but does the job very effectively.  </li>
      <li>this product is probably okay.</li>
      <li>It works much better.</li>
      <li>Best tool to use to remove back hair!!!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten much better at it than when I started.</li>
      <li>so I can do it a day or two before going to the beach without worrying about how I&#x27;ll look, and I like the feel of shaving better than waxing.    </li>
      <li>Get the War if you want to keep up with the latest Gillette and Schick offerings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The design is good in that the angle is just right.  </li>
      <li>However it is much more user friendly and usable.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was easy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no yoga master, it was easy for me to get my musclular build around and shave.</li>
      <li>I did was took the Pepsi challenge and went high and far to get all the products to make the best decision and answer some of the questions</li>
      <li>It works well in that it holds the razor securely and is fairly easy to use.</li>
      <li>Knowing now that it doesn&#x27;t actually fit my razor the way Gillette designed my razor to be used, I think the War Hammer is over priced.</li>
      <li>Simple, durable and works great with my Gillette Fusion razor.</li>
      <li>But there is something available on amazon to do that</li>
      <li>I use a different brand that works great.</li>
      <li>Any shaver will fit in this.</li>
      <li>My Fusion Power, with the end cap and battery removed of course, was mounted securely.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe the 5 star ratings of this product on Amazon are legitimate because not one of them mentions that you have to take your razor apart to fit it into the Razorba handle.  </li>
      <li>The received for the razor handle would probably fit any razor make/model.</li>
      <li>Great tool for shaving your back.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the Razorba War Hammer</li>
      <li>If you need a back hair shaver then this is a great choice.</li>
      <li>I bought the Razorba War Hammer specifically because it claimed to fit the Fusion Power, my preferred razor.</li>
      <li>The product did not hold my Gillette razor very well at all, nor was it very easy to manipulate the razor once I had attached it.</li>
      <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
      <li>so it is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service!</li>
      <li>Razorba on the other hand worked great.</li>
      <li>Whatever works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also popped in a plastic spoon into this thing and used it as a pretty darn good back scratcher.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d buy the cheapest one first and if it didn&#x27;t fit, then return it for the right one.</li>
      <li>Now I did A LOT of research into what products will allow me to shave my own back.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s pretty sweet.</li>
      <li>Yes the angle is right.</li>
      <li>After 3 months I still dont know how to save at the right angle with it -</li>
      <li>Its plastic inside (the inside that holds the razor)ripped right off.</li>
      <li>If you use a good razor you will have success with this product and be less hairy because of your effort.</li>
      <li>Very good compared to other back shavers like Mangroomer.</li>
      <li>The other 2 cheaper models are probably just as good, but more limited in the types of razors you could use.</li>
      <li>I could not resisted to get another one for our lovely vacation home next to the lake</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it should.  </li>
      <li>EXTREMELY overprices for what you get back a good deal for what you can do with it!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>First thoughts out of the box was it&#x27;s super high quality.</li>
      <li>Theoretically this would give you a better shave, your favorite face razor used on your back, only I haven&#x27;t been able to really make it work.</li>
      <li>/&gt;nearly any razor and no small parts to break like the mangroomer and is a nice low tech</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m starting to think the only good reviews are by the company.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the ability to shave as good as you xblade razor, but will shave your back hair close enough unless you are a porn star.</li>
      <li>After I bought the first Razorba (the classic) for my husband to use..</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re left with a cheap AA battery operated nose trimmer.</li>
      <li>I wasnt expecting much from a trimmer.</li>
      <li>Plus plug in a razor for more wet shaving options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
      <li>AA batteries didnt make it seem like a real shaver.</li>
      <li>shaving with a straight blade \\&quot;scraper\\&quot;</li>
      <li>my back is silky smooth.</li>
      <li>handles which don&#x27;t fit, especially if you want to use one of the vibrating razors.</li>
      <li>THEY REALLY HAVE ALOT OF NERVE</li>
      <li>Simple, solid design design, nicely weighted.  </li>
      <li>Razorba War Hammer Back Hair Shaver is HOT red :)</li>
      <li>I had some help trimming the hair on my back, took a nice hot shower to make the hair softer, lathered up, stood in front of the bathroom mirror, and holding my hand mirror in one hand and the War Hammer in the other</li>
      <li>Plugs in easy, shave quick wet or dry and they just updated the design making it pretty much indestructable.</li>
      <li>The War Hammer, Silencer, and Classic all</li>
      <li>I upgraded from the Classic to the War Hammer and like it a lot.  </li>
      <li>I was able to shave my entire back in a matter of minutes.    </li>
      <li>Even after shoulder surgery that has limited my range of motion, I am able to reach every inch of my back with the Razorba.</li>
      <li>I got it to use the new razors with.</li>
      <li>One time money well spent and I am enjoying to use it to shave my husband back hair or of cause... he can do it himself.</li>
      <li>This product gives you a fast fast shave because of the big shaver blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Those who are skilled at winning do not become afraid.</li>
      <li>COST CONSCIOUS then pickup the Razorba Classic (Blue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Is the long mega stepped reach useful?</li>
      <li>You cant use the better razors on it because the hole is too small.</li>
      <li>The extra weight makes it easier to use and the razor gripper is much enhanced -- now my razor never slips and turns in the gripper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So while my use so far is with an unpowered Fusion Power, I am looking for another style razor.    </li>
      <li>Razorba is simple and straight forward.</li>
      <li>It provides just the right angle to get to the hair on the upper part of your back.</li>
      <li>What I do is go over it quickly every other day or so, that usually gets most spots regularly.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s back is hairier than they or their significant other wishes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Mangroomer seemed like it would give you a decent enough shave.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s two main back shavers-</li>
      <li>Nobody shaves their face dry with a straight razor or scraper.</li>

    <li> I CANNOT BELIEVE I SPENT THIS MUCH MONEY FOR THIS PRODUCT. I AM SUCH AN IDIOT! DON&#x27;T YOU BE AN IDIOT. DONOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IF FOR SOME REASON, YOU MUST HAVE THIS PRODUCT, BUY THE CHEAPER ONE. IT IS A NIGHTMARE TRYING TO SHAVE MY BACK WITH THIS PRODUCT. IT WILL TAKE YOU FOREVER AND IT IS MESSY AND IT WILL NOT WORK ON LONG OR THICK BACK HAIR[[ASIN:B002MUAP5G Razorba War Hammer Back Hair Shaver]]. IT IS TOTALLY NUTS. BUY \\&quot;MANGROOMER\\&quot;, IT IS GREAT. I BOUGHT 3 MANGROOMERS, JUST IN CASE THEY STOP MAKING THIS PRODUCT. IT IS THAT GOOD. THEY REALLY HAVE ALOT OF NERVE SELLING A PRODUCT MADE OUT OF RESIN FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY. \\&quot;I AM SUCH AN IDIOT\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It takes some getting use to when using for the first time, but does the job very effectively.  Saves lots of time!</li>
    <li> This is solidly built and performs as advertised. I&#x27;ve been  using razorba products for years starting with the blue  model. I got it to use the new razors with. A good thing to also get is the brushes for applying cream.</li>
    <li> Great tool for shaving your back. Simple, durable and works great with my Gillette Fusion razor. Based on it&#x27;s design, I doubt actually need this more expensive model versus the older ones (\\&quot;Classic\\&quot; or \\&quot;Silencer\\&quot;), but that&#x27;s just my instict. The received for the razor handle would probably fit any razor make/model. I&#x27;d buy the cheapest one first and if it didn&#x27;t fit, then return it for the right one.</li>
    <li> I am a hairy man; I don&#x27;t like being one; my wife isn&#x27;t a big fan of that fact either. Now I did A LOT of research into what products will allow me to shave my own back. I read hundreds of reviews about a ton of different products and based on that research I decided to try my luck with the War Hammer. The day the package arrived at my house I had some help trimming the hair on my back, took a nice hot shower to make the hair softer, lathered up, stood in front of the bathroom mirror, and holding my hand mirror in one hand and the War Hammer in the other I was able to shave my entire back in a matter of minutes.    Don&#x27;t listen to reviews saying that the War Hammer or any other Razorba doesn&#x27;t give them a close shave. If they had paid any attention, they would have seen these products allow you to choose the razor you wish to use. If you use a good razor you will have success with this product and be less hairy because of your effort. The men who insist this product isn&#x27;t worth buying are just plain wrong. I recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s back is hairier than they or their significant other wishes. Buy it today, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> After I bought the first Razorba (the classic) for my husband to use.. I could not resisted to get another one for our lovely vacation home next to the lake ;) Here...come Razorba War Hammer Back Hair Shaver is HOT red :) The Razorba works great! One time money well spent and I am enjoying to use it to shave my husband back hair or of cause... he can do it himself. Non-slip handle is so nice to use in the shower! I give this one 5 stars or 6 if I can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to think the only good reviews are by the company. Ive had mine sitting in the closet for quite some time. Hell, if anyone wants it ill give you it for free. Its a piece of crap made out of plastic. It cut me me up. Its plastic inside (the inside that holds the razor)ripped right off. You cant use the better razors on it because the hole is too small. I use a different brand that works great. I wont say a name so you think I&#x27;m a representative of a company. For the love of god, save your money!</li>
    <li> I upgraded from the Classic to the War Hammer and like it a lot.  The design is good in that the angle is just right.  It has a low up-keep and doesn&#x27;t require you to worry about parts breaking or rusting.  This is compatible with a lot of the popular razors that can be found at almost every drug store, which is nice.  Heck, I already owned a compatible razor.</li>
    <li> Just as the description says !!!! works great.  This is the only reason I don&#x27;t leave feedback.  Why do I have to have so many words, if it works great that&#x27;s all I need to say !</li>
    <li> It works well in that it holds the razor securely and is fairly easy to use. I still have some trouble getting to all areas of the back, took me longer to get all the spots and feel like I have to go over spots multiple times. Haven&#x27;t quite got it down yet to get it all done in one shot. What I do is go over it quickly every other day or so, that usually gets most spots regularly. Find it ironic/stupid that the directions tell you to use shaving cream (yes, I know there&#x27;s a tool but still). I just wet shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> Probably like you, you&#x27;re trying to make a decision on which back shaver to get. The reviews, features, and noise are making that decision difficult.&lt;br /&gt;What I did was took the Pepsi challenge and went high and far to get all the products to make the best decision and answer some of the questions&lt;br /&gt;regarding these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WAYS TO SHAVE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s two main back shavers- Mangroomer and Razorba. The rest are redundant, dubious, and a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ManGroomer: Dry electric trimmer shaving&lt;br /&gt;Razorba : Wet razor shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Razorba Sum 3 Power: Dry or wet electric trimmer shaving. Plus plug in a razor for more wet shaving options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving with a straight blade \\&quot;scraper\\&quot; as one such dubious product proports is ludicrous. People shave their face with a electric trimmer, or&lt;br /&gt;wet safety razor, or wet with a straight edge for extra danger. Nobody shaves their face dry with a straight razor or scraper. C&#x27;mon people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mangroomer seemed like it would give you a decent enough shave. I wasnt expecting much from a trimmer. And the results&lt;br /&gt;werent good. It just didnt work for me. A lot of effort for naught on this product. The shave is not close (what trimmer is) and running off a&lt;br /&gt;couple AA batteries didnt make it seem like a real shaver. It just wouldnt cut and I was afraid it would shutdown mid cut/grab. I think for&lt;br /&gt;some thin minor hair this product is probably okay. Is the long mega stepped reach useful? NO, I&#x27;m not shaving my butt?!?! Take away this&lt;br /&gt;handle and you&#x27;re left with a cheap AA battery operated nose trimmer. I gave it a second chance and tried it in the shower and it stopped working. I&lt;br /&gt;returned it to the store the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razorba on the other hand worked great. In your hand you will feel the heft and the quality of this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Clean and close shave. Yes razor shave is closer than a trimmer. Yes the angle is right. Yes the reach&lt;br /&gt;is enough. Did I need to be a contortionist? No. Dont shave side to side? Yes, you could get nicked. Just like your face. Shave up and down? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Clogged razor? Sometimes yes, but same thing happens if I let my beard go. A build up means it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions. Took a shower, lathered on shaving cream, popped on razor and shaved. I found checking progress in mirror was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy. I&#x27;m no yoga master, it was easy for me to get my musclular build around and shave. I got the shaver brushes, but others have used lotion&lt;br /&gt;applicator brushes or even back brush. It doesnt matter, lather the way you want to. Whatever works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also popped in a plastic spoon into this thing and used it as a pretty darn good back scratcher. It&#x27;s very solid and if you need something in home defense&lt;br /&gt;this packs a serious punch, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razorba is simple and straight forward. Unlike the over priced and over hyped mangroomer that breaks and jammed after a couple uses. Note mangroomer&lt;br /&gt;puts a card inside the box saying please dont return it, call us instead... geesh. The Razorba has no batteries to wear down and is durable, adapts to&lt;br /&gt;nearly any razor and no small parts to break like the mangroomer and is a nice low tech solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DECISION MADE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR ANY BACK HAIR PROBLEM get the Razorba. Figure out which razor you will use with it and get that model. The War Hammer, Silencer, and Classic all&lt;br /&gt;performed well. Get the War if you want to keep up with the latest Gillette and Schick offerings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR CONVENIENT WET SHAVING and SPOTTY THICK AREAS that trim out nicely get the Razorba Sum 3 Power. It&#x27;s big shaving head does the job in or out of the&lt;br /&gt;shower. This product gives you a fast fast shave because of the big shaver blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE AND COST CONSCIOUS then pickup the Razorba Classic (Blue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE TO PICK ONE AND COST IS LESS OF CONCERN pay the extra bucks for the Razorba War Hammer (Orange).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR ME (Thick hair and some spotty areas) I found out, as another reviewer put it, this is not brain surgery. I enjoy the Razorba War Hammer the most.&lt;br /&gt;No electrical parts to break, just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Get a Razorba, use it for a week and you won&#x27;t need anything else. Or, buy a razorba and mangroomer test it, review it. You&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;come to the same conclusions as me, you will return the mangroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER REVIEWS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maxim Magazine gave the Razorba the highest marks.</li>
    <li> Tried a less expensive version first but being able to use a pro glide razor made a big difference so it is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe the 5 star ratings of this product on Amazon are legitimate because not one of them mentions that you have to take your razor apart to fit it into the Razorba handle.  And then the thing doesn&#x27;t work and is flimsy.  Customer service is non-existant.  I would rate this product 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Works like you&#x27;d expect.  An extra long handle for your razor so you can reach the middle of your back.  You still might want a couple of mirrors so you can see what you are doing.  EXTREMELY overprices for what you get back a good deal for what you can do with it!</li>
    <li> To difficult to use. Blade contact is difficult to maintain. Recommend the Bakblade over this. Theoretically this would give you a better shave, your favorite face razor used on your back, only I haven&#x27;t been able to really make it work. The setup is off, trying to keep the blades on your skin is difficult at best, it&#x27;s just awkward. The weight of this device far outweighs your razor and it is just odd. Before you drop the 35ish $ on this look at the Bakblade. All sorts of faults there also, non pivoting head, single blade, etc... However it is much more user friendly and usable. Doesn&#x27;t have the ability to shave as good as you xblade razor, but will shave your back hair close enough unless you are a porn star.</li>
    <li> “Those who are skilled in combat do not become angered. Those who are skilled at winning do not become afraid. Thus the wise win before they fight, while the ignorant fight to win.” ~ Zhuge Liang (Shaving your back with the War Hammer is an effortless victory)</li>
    <li> The War Hammer is a blessing.  I will not have to worry about being embarrassed any longer when i take my shirt off in the summer. I wont have to have my girlfriend shave my back any longer.The only hard part is putting shaving gel on your back. But there is something available on amazon to do that but I haven&#x27;t purchased it yet. Any shaver will fit in this. The inside of this is a rubber sleeve that holds the razor handle. Single guys, which I am now, here is your life savor.</li>
    <li> Got this along with the SUM 3 and I am not disappointed. Ultra-close shave using mach 3. Works like a charm. Have done it dry or wet when needed. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> After 3 months I still dont know how to save at the right angle with it - but I wing it and I get it done.  it work just the angle of the hold is off or odd.</li>
    <li> Returned after one use. The product did not hold my Gillette razor very well at all, nor was it very easy to manipulate the razor once I had attached it. I recommend you consider the MANGROOMER Ultimate Pro Back Shaver instead of this product. It works much better.</li>
    <li> I bought the Razorba War Hammer specifically because it claimed to fit the Fusion Power, my preferred razor. But when the instructions state to remove the battery cover and battery, the \\&quot;power\\&quot;, then you&#x27;re basically left with only a Fusion handle and an over-priced razor blade. So while my use so far is with an unpowered Fusion Power, I am looking for another style razor.    Any review that claims this doesn&#x27;t work isn&#x27;t reviewing this item, they&#x27;re reviewing the razor they chose to use. The Razorba is only an extension so that you can get your razor, whichever one you prefer, to all the areas of your back. And for that it is successfull. Even after shoulder surgery that has limited my range of motion, I am able to reach every inch of my back with the Razorba. I&#x27;ve done waxing before, and my back always breaks out afterwards, and within a couple months I look like I need it again. With this I can shave as often as I want to, my back is not breaking out so I can do it a day or two before going to the beach without worrying about how I&#x27;ll look, and I like the feel of shaving better than waxing.    The Razorba itself is a solid piece of injection molded plastic with a flexible insert to hold the razor. My Fusion Power, with the end cap and battery removed of course, was mounted securely. There was no concern about it falling out or rotating in the handle.    Knowing now that it doesn&#x27;t actually fit my razor the way Gillette designed my razor to be used, I think the War Hammer is over priced. The other 2 cheaper models are probably just as good, but more limited in the types of razors you could use. But for its design, ability to perform its intended purpose and comfort of use, it is a great product. My best advice is to pick your razor and then get the cheapest Razorba for that style handle.</li>
    <li> If you need a back hair shaver then this is a great choice. Plugs in easy, shave quick wet or dry and they just updated the design making it pretty much indestructable. First thoughts out of the box was it&#x27;s super high quality. A good buy.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it should.  Simple, solid design design, nicely weighted.  Best tool to use to remove back hair!!!  I use it with my disposable.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. It provides just the right angle to get to the hair on the upper part of your back. The length and angle however make it awkward to get to the lower part of your back and along the upper part of the shoulders. It&#x27;s also, in my opinion, over priced for the simplicity and materials used.</li>
    <li> I finally took the $70 plunge and upgraded from my previous Razorba. And it&#x27;s pretty sweet. The extra weight makes it easier to use and the razor gripper is much enhanced -- now my razor never slips and turns in the gripper.&lt;br /&gt;I now use the Razorba about once a month and I&#x27;ve gotten much better at it than when I started. It takes me about 15 minutes and the results are very nice.</li>
    <li> Very good compared to other back shavers like Mangroomer. I have been using that, before going for Razorboa, and was disappointed because it took lots of time and effort to shave my back to totally smooth finish. I am using Fusion blades with Razorboa and with few strokes my back is silky smooth. My only complaint would be the quality of grip on handle. It should have been made of rubber instead of same plastic like rest of the product as they are charging premium price on it. Other than this I would highly recommend this to men who hate their back hair and want some quick solution.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but I needed it. It works great! Does the job you expect it to do. The only problem is, the razor companies all now have &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; handles which don&#x27;t fit, especially if you want to use one of the vibrating razors.</li>
