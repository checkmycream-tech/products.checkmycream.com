      <li>It came in perfect condition ready to use also includes metal sticker things to place on back of products that don&#x27;t have it.</li>
      <li>, shipping was quick and easy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. Fit a lot of eyeshadows and included magnets.</li>
    <li> First super fast shipping from this company , it literally took two days for my order to get here.  ( I ordered on a weekday). It came in perfect condition ready to use also includes metal sticker things to place on back of products that don&#x27;t have it. this would be great for those of us who have tons of single shadows, blushes, powders. You just depot them place metal sticker and place them into the palette .</li>
    <li> Read a lot of reviews on these palettes to store ur PRO pans, work well with Makeup geek product, MAC must add Magnet to secure in Pallet, which u can no longer see name of shadow. somewhat expensive....</li>
    <li> Not as large as I thought it would be, but its good quality. I like that it comes with the metal discs so you can attach them to your shadows.</li>
    <li> I love Z Palettes in general. I recently brought the extra large one to hold all my recent makeup geek shadows that I have purchased as well as the other eyeshadows that I have depotted.  This one is a perfect size that holds all of them.  It&#x27;s perfect for travel since I have all the shadows I need in one place and can use for multiple looks.</li>
    <li> Great but it arrive broken  :(</li>
    <li> Not nearly as large as I expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. I just have to find the time, and method to depot all of my eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great but it doesn&#x27;t bring enough magnets to insert all the pods. It literally only brought around 10. The picture clearly has more 10 pods inserted.</li>
    <li> You amaze yourself by the sheer number of eyeshadows you realize that you have when you de-pot them and place in these Z-pallettes. The greatest feature is that you can see/use all your eyeshadow/powder/foundation/blush in ONE container. Such space savers these are!</li>
    <li> I love this palette! I just keep needing more of them and I always come back to buy this one! Shipping was fast and it comes packed nicely.</li>
    <li> quick shipping, as described</li>
    <li> Fits all my makeup geek eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> Love the palette but mine came scratched :( major disappointment. I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning it.   (UPDATED TO ADD: I contacted them and they will be sending me another one)</li>
    <li> Love the size...I will be buying more :D</li>
    <li> This is a great size! I own a medium size, 2 larges and 2 of the extra large Z palettes. I wish i would have just gotten the extra larges!</li>
    <li> Will MakeUp Geek Eyeshadows Fit In Here ? Foiled &amp; Regular ? How Many ?</li>
    <li> The last two questions I answered but  in the Z Palette didn&#x27;t come with anything in it.So the product in it is makeup that I purchased and put in the palette</li>
    <li> Awesome palette, need to get more. Very spacious for my depotting as well.</li>
    <li> I love the size of the Z palette for my sigma beauty eye shadows and blushes. I love the see through lid. I currently own 3 z palettes, love the magnetic feature. I will definitely re purchase more z palettes in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this Z Palette and will be buying more! Very sturdy</li>
    <li> Great to have all your eyeshadows in one place and able to see what you have.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Love how I can see what&#x27;s in the palette. Fits my Makeup Geek.</li>
    <li> Love this palette!  Was able to depot Smashbox palette that I purchased years ago and had not been using into this extra large z palette.  Now that I can see the eyeshadows that I have I use them more.  I have bought a few more to depot other eyeshadow palette&#x27;s as well.  I love that this palette is magnetic.  Lots of space in this palette!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it 4stars just because the round metal stickers it comes with are too big for my eyeshadow pans. So I had to buy extra square ones.</li>
    <li> Item received arrived broken... huge inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I love the x-large palette compared to the large.  It just makes more sense to spend a couple more bucks for a larger version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palette comes with tons of magnets to use with pans that may not be magnetic.  No commitment to the placement of any items and easily transferable to smaller palettes for travel as needed.</li>
    <li> I thought that they would be a bit larger but I made them work for me!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Holds my depotted shadows.</li>
    <li> Love it its worth the money for such a large pallet will purchase a couple more</li>
    <li> The glue on the case is coming undone. I am hoping that it doesn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
    <li> Amazing products. I&#x27;m very excited.</li>
    <li> Love this palette! Fast shipping !</li>
    <li> Looks and works great. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> I had 3 huge Urban Decay box palettes that were taking up too much space and this Z palette holds all of them. I like how you can see through the top and how it stays tightly closed</li>
    <li> I love it I was able to fit 35 coastal scents hot pots in it and I am so glad I ordered it, shipping was quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Love this size. Fits up to 6 full size powder pans. Way easier than flipping thru multiple compacts on a job.</li>
    <li> This palette holds a ton of different products. A makeup lovers dream for sure!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I own two of these palettes and I am planning to purchase more. I pressed a bunch of mineral shadows and popped them in to one of these palettes and now, I am actually using the shadows, instead of them languishing in a drawer because I didn&#x27;t like messing with all of the little jars and mess. My other palette holds some of my depotted shadows and blush. This is a fantastic product. Every makeup lover needs a stack of them!</li>
    <li> I love my Z- pallets they&#x27;re great but a little bit expensive!</li>
    <li> I love how there is so much room! It has made my extreme eyeshadow collection more manageable!</li>
    <li> Love these palettes. It will hold 35 pans, and I intend to fill &#x27;er up! Comes with extra magnets that have adhesive just in case for depotting shadows from other palettes. Magnetic closures keep my goodies safe, and the lid can bend backwards. Wish there were other design options for extra large cases. I still love mine!</li>
    <li> Did not hold most of my mac refill pans.</li>
    <li> Great! Perfect gift for my syster!</li>
    <li> Great quality product! Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> My z palette came with a ding on the corner , like it was drop and it hit the corner of the palette.</li>
    <li> Well packaged,  well priced.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. I was able to condense all of my makeup into 1 of these large palettes. No more picking and choosing which colors to take with me when I leave town. It actually takes less space now and I get to take them all! :)</li>
    <li> I really like how I can see my shadows through the palest without opening and how thin it is too.</li>
    <li> My beloved z palette. This is my 3rd one- wish my other two were this size. Holds all my MAC and MakeupGeek eyeshadows. If you want to get organized and de clutter your makeup area. I highly recommend z palettes and buying shadows in the pan or de-potting your current stash.</li>
    <li> I love it! Everything looks nice and is sturdy. Keeps my makeup all in the same place and safe</li>
    <li> Not at all I thought the makeup was included</li>
    <li> This will hold 34 Makeup Geek eyeshadows and the only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars was because it only holds 9 more than the large z pallette, but costs $10 more. I bought the bigger one for better organization and storage and somehow missed the cost difference.  I will stick with the large ones.</li>
    <li> Perfect for organizing my stash. Prompt shipping. Just as described.</li>
    <li> I was able to fit 19 large rouges in this extra large Palette. If you have pots cluttered around or you want to make your own palette, this is the way to go. You can arrange in any way and in the best way to fit in a lot of items. Buy it!!! It travels well, my rouges survived a 6 hour plane trip with no problem, however I would suggest that you ensure it is cushioned, so nothing cracks the plastic barrier on the top.</li>
    <li> Great product, just arrived damaged with lots of scratches. Don&#x27;t feel like going through the headache of returning such an inexpensive product but please check your merchandise before you ship it out. Otherwise awesome product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Found THE BEST dupe to this product!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/03/z-palette-dupe-mac.html</li>
    <li> Just what I expected! Perfect!😊</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bigger than I expected. Not what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Handy for organizing, but needs to supply more magnets.</li>
    <li> Step daughter loves it!  Holds a bunch. Not chintzy and good weight.</li>
    <li> Great product, I only wish they made these extra large palettes in something other than black.  Love, will by more as needed!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Love the size.  Fits a lot.  Sturdy and has a great magnetic closure.  Feels like it is made well and will last.  Now, I just have to fill it up with more makeup!!!  I just started buying Makeup Geek cosmetics that come in a pan and this is perfect for it.  For those of who love depotting your makeup, this is great way to hold your collection.  Highly recommend for the makeup lovers out there!  Makes me feel quite professional!  :)</li>
    <li> palette is great, magnets suck. about 1/3 of the magnets didnt stay on, but i just got some magnetic metal and cut my own, dont get aluminum or stainless steel, it has to be a magnetic metal to work. but the palette is great! its very thick, durable, and stay shut. i will be repurchasing for sure!!</li>
    <li> Z palettes are so wonderful. Makeup packaging takes up so much room and these palettes allow you to de-pot and save a lot of space. De-potting can be a bit of work, so be sure to watch some tutorials first. The bottom is magnetic and most makeup pans will be able to stick, but this comes with some metal pieces to affix to the bottom of your pans if they aren&#x27;t magnetic The lid also has a light magnetic closure to keep it from flying open and has a translucent window to see inside which is great if you have multiple of these.. Almost all of my makeup is in Z palettes now! You can really fit a lot in this size as well!</li>
    <li> She loved it so thumbs up from me</li>
