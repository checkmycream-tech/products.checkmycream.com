      <li>I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed as the wig due to be received this week is for a very special event and is my favorite!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very good quality and is thick and full.  </li>
      <li>It has way more blonde up front and the part on top makes it look funny</li>
      <li>you can clearly see the seam in the top part.</li>

      <li>Will be nice and cool for the summer, doesnt tangle as much as other wigs.</li>
      <li>It feels VERY real</li>
      <li>racing stripes on your dad&#x27;s hot rod, and a stripper.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s smooth, and soft, and it looks just like the pictures.  </li>
      <li>Would be more likely to wear as costume.</li>
      <li>Pretty, but streaks tend to be &amp;#34;skunk&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Follow up, after wearing this out for the first tme, i ran into 3 women for some selling of items, all strangers.  </li>
      <li>it is well made and feels exactly like real hair.</li>
      <li>Feels soft and is full</li>
      <li>highlights are much thinker in person.</li>
      <li>I try with a brush very lite to fix.</li>

      <li>now my hair wants to fall out so offen.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something stylish to try in lieu of my massive natural curls.</li>
      <li>I am still waiting for one more wig I ordered which is supposed to arrive this week which is much slower than the other 5 wigs which were ahead of estimated time.  </li>
      <li>Very soft.</li>
      <li>but wish you had these in longer wigs with the exact same colors!</li>
      <li>This was a huge hit with a few if my clients!&lt;br</li>

<li> This hair looks way fake like plastic almost was very disappointing and will never use it because it is stupid</li>

    <li> This was a huge hit with a few if my clients!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sexy wig and looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;Good price as well</li>
    <li> It is so soft and light, and believable. Will be nice and cool for the summer, doesnt tangle as much as other wigs. Follow up, after wearing this out for the first tme, i ran into 3 women for some selling of items, all strangers.  All 3 said, \\&quot;i love your hair!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> the wig color are ok but not what it looks like in the picture looks alot different than color in picture</li>
    <li> The length is as shown but the highlights are so blunt it&#x27;s comparable to a skunk, racing stripes on your dad&#x27;s hot rod, and a stripper. I will save this for fun after dark.</li>
    <li> I absolutely am in love with this wig  and this wig has been a blessing it is well made and feels exactly like real hair. The shipping was a little slow but the wig was packed with extreme care and I am so happy with it my family was so shocked when I had it on they thought I got extensions and it&#x27;s so comfy!!!  The adjustable strap is awesome!</li>
    <li> i bought this wig and when it arrived it was not even close to what the picture looked like the color is more of a gray not copper you see the netting thruogh it not of good quality I think that at least a partial refund would be nice ..</li>
    <li> you can clearly see the seam in the top part. it looks terrible and the way the highlights are done they are big chunky highlights exactly the same on both sides and it makes it look SO fake. dont waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and no one can even tell it&#x27;s a wig :) I would definitely recommend this to everyone and anyone</li>
    <li> This wig was pretty good. The style of it was exellent and went on well. A bit thick in the front and sides and thin in the bottom.It would show the mesh if you tried to put it up in a clip. Hair itself was good, but not as soft as others I have tried. Could see it being itchy if you wore out for an evening. Ended up giving it to a nieghbor who looked good in it.</li>
    <li> came on time (though it was long since shipped from China).&lt;br /&gt;The style looks nice on me. I can wear it for a change. However, the middle line and highlights look quite unnatural. You cannot see it on a picture. Doubt if you can do anything about it. I tried to mix the strips of hair from both sides, but it doesn&#x27;t quite work.&lt;br /&gt;not so soft and not so natural. You will be bothered with the hair in your eyes quite soon with no ways to manage it. But you can buy it and have a very attractive outlook. Perhaps with a hat... it will be perfect then...</li>
    <li> the only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s always in my face. I though it would hang to the sides like in the pic. I have to use  Barrettes to keep it out of my face. other than that great color and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> it looks nice in the photo. but wait. see my hair is thining. and I have not got it cut in over 2 months. now when I look in the mior it looks like I just go it cut. my hair is different lengths and short. now my hair wants to fall out so offen. I need  this wig. I bought others hoping it will work. well I got this on dec 3rd.2013. and I look at it nice. put it on nice. daughter even but it up for me. nice. but the down fall of this. I see the line in middle of the head. and the back of the hair was short in some places and mash up knots. I try with a brush very lite to fix. but did not work still. I stll saw the short pices in back.i even try to blend hair in. did not work. I wanted to send back. but the seller is from china.why to far. so now I can not use it. i gave it to my 3 year old for halloween next year. 1 or two times on Halloween ok. but not 3 or 4 times a week. . please do not wasit your money. try the  one with banes. it may work better. go buy a different wig.also hair stared to come out. just with my hands though it. save money. go some where else..</li>
    <li> my girl friend loves to wheres the wig  it help here feel good and it fits her face will you will love where it</li>
    <li> This is ok. I was looking for something stylish to try in lieu of my massive natural curls. The colors are WAY brighter in person than in the picture and it does look pretty fake. Was hoping for better but my kids love playing with it so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Really stripy.  Front part doesn&#x27;t blend well with your skin and there aren&#x27;t bangs to blend in.  Texture is nice but I ended up giving it to my daughter for dress up.</li>
    <li> This hair looks way fake like plastic almost was very disappointing and will never use it because it is stupid at least the kids have fun with it I guess</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I don&#x27;t like how it falls to the front and it looks like a wig...:/</li>
    <li> Pretty, but streaks tend to be &amp;#34;skunk&amp;#34; like.  Would be more likely to wear as costume.</li>
    <li> Had way too much blonde than brown.</li>
    <li> its ok. not for me. highlights are much thinker in person.</li>
    <li> This wig is so beautiful and looks and feels so natural.  I&#x27;ve ordered 14 wigs for my work and also my social life and I love this company and the quality wigs they sell at a great price!  The highlights and lowlights are fabulous as well as the manufacturing.  If you are looking for a wig or wigs THIS IS THE #1 SELLER TO PURCHASE FROM.  If you have questions they are prompt on answering your emails.  I am still waiting for one more wig I ordered which is supposed to arrive this week which is much slower than the other 5 wigs which were ahead of estimated time.  I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed as the wig due to be received this week is for a very special event and is my favorite!  All and all the wait is worth it and the seller is wonderful to work with.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about this particular product.  The reviews all said it was good, but I had to see for myself.  Well, I will never go back to any other company.  I was VERY pleased with this wig, and can&#x27;t wait to order more.  It feels VERY real, it&#x27;s smooth, and soft, and it looks just like the pictures.  Can&#x27;t wait to get another one soon.</li>
    <li> I love this wig!  I got it for a mannequin that I have and I seriously wish this was my hair!  It&#x27;s very good quality and is thick and full.  Nicely styled and nice to touch.</li>
    <li> The shipment was fast and I enjoyed opening up the pkg, my true enjoyment was of course putting it on. The feel is like my own hair. Very soft. Love the colors and I am a happy customer :)</li>
    <li> Well it looks way different then the photo. It has way more blonde up front and the part on top makes it look funny but if you turn it to the side it looks great. Feels soft and is full</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig!! Compliments were given all night last. You can&#x27;t even tell its a wig! that I LOVE!! The quality was GREAT! I look forward to purchasing more styles !! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love this wig :) it&#x27;s so soft and I love the colors. Overall this is a great buy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, just looking at it but wish you had these in longer wigs with the exact same colors!</li>
