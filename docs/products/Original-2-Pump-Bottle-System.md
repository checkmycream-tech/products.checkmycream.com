<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week or so, but so far I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This is about the only stuff that works as advertised.</li>
    <li> My bad breath is gone! My dentist noticed that my gums have improved also. His question &amp;#34;what have you changed&amp;#34; and the response was Smart Mouth Advanced!</li>
    <li> I got this product for my elderly Dad who was really having a bad problem with his breath.  We have tried a myriad of mouth washes and mints-nothing worked!  Smart Mouth really did the trick!  I have him on a monthly subscription so his new bottle is there right when he needs it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Smart Mouth, it definitely has helped with my problem of bad breath, I have been using for the past 2months and will continue to use it,,,,,</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I am a doctor so I&#x27;m often close to my patients.  I used to hold my breath when looking in a patient&#x27;s ears.  Now I feel like I&#x27;m good to go!  It does take a little getting used to with regards to the after taste.  It really does work at least 10 hours.  It may work 12 hours but I haven&#x27;t put it through the tests.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This stuff works.  Leaves my mouth feeling very fresh and my breath is good all day.  I did not experience it to be any more &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; than listerine advanced formula.  It does have a numbing sensation for a little bit afterwards,  but I am telling you, best mouthwash I have tried so far!</li>
    <li> SmartMouth mouthwash is very good indeed. It works as described, and apart from an unusual after taste, it is everything you would want from a mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that you do not need to use 4 pumps from each bottle; I typically use just one pump from each bottle, stretching to 2 if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, using SmartMouth for a maximum of 30 seconds is also sound advice. Anything longer will only make the after taste worse. Regarding the after taste, I have become used to it and think of it as a reminder that the product is working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d already known I&#x27;d love this before buying it here, having used it for years.  It was simply that from Europe, Amazon would be the cheapest fastest way to have it shipped via APO.  Shop around if you buy it stateside, since prices can vary widely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fairly unique and long-acting product buys me pretty much around the clock neutral breath and helps me avoid the gingivitis I&#x27;m prone to.  No alcohol, either, which is unhealthy for gum tissue long term.  I will say that my wife prefers the original formula since this one (&amp;#34;Advanced Clinical&amp;#34;) appears to have a mild amount of peroxide added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d add is that you can use far less than the recommended amount and still get positive results.  I use two pumps each from each bottle and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff.  My breath which is usually reeky was fresh as a baby&#x27;s.  My girlfriend kissed me, deep, for the first time in months.</li>
    <li> Works great, just wish it lasts longer for the price</li>
    <li> This is a good product. While it is not 100% effective against coffee, onions, garlic, etc., it certainly does make one&#x27;s breath much fresher for about 10-12 hours.</li>
    <li> won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> Works great! I wish they were bigger, they ran out within a month.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s not as good as the ads on TV, it really is the best 24 hr mouthwash I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> The best MouthWash I have ever used...it does last 12 hours...</li>
    <li> Does work to help get rid of bad breath, but leaves mouth dry.</li>
    <li> I think this works well to prevent mouth odor. But then, in my case,so does a less expensive non-alcohol rinse.</li>
    <li> The flavor was pretty bad. It burned for a prolonged period in my cheeks. After it burned for about 30 minutes after spitting it out I rinsed with water several times for relief. Also, it seemed to numb my tastebuds rather than freshen my breath. A few things cause me to think this is a scam product. 1) The grammar on the product&#x27;s box is poor, 2) there is an excellent consumer review that is identical on several websites as if the manufacturer reviewed themselves several times, 3) and the supposed amazing results promised from this product contrasts suspiciously with the fact that many pharmacies and department stores do not carry it.</li>
    <li> As a coffee addict...this product is the ticket.  Product is easy to mix.  Just swish around about 30 seconds...be sure to rinse. Great product.</li>
    <li> I use this after flossing and brushing and actually wake up with fresh breath and a clean feeling mouth. I think the instructions have you using way more than what is actually needed though. I don&#x27;t use the little cup that comes with it. I just pump 2 pumps of each straight into my mouth and swish, pumping the green liquid first, because I don&#x27;t like the taste of the clear liquid on its own. Miracle product.</li>
    <li> has completely eliminated my morning breath. Girlfriend noticed</li>
    <li> Hubby had bad breath for some reason.  Tried all kinds of mouth washes and nothing worked.  Smart works great --bad breath is gone as long as he uses it  and we use the tooth paste also.  Another great product.</li>
    <li> Our 10 yr. old son was having trouble with awful breath didn&#x27;t respond to any pre or post brushing mouthwash we tried.  Most washes burned his mouth and then only lasted a very short time.  I was about to ask our dentist for help when I saw a commercial for Smart Mouth on TV.  It has been a miracle!!! It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t burn as much as others.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the expense. I wish they would make a 32 oz. size so it would last longer.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m impressed....</li>
    <li> It works great! Its quite effective</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is as amazing as everyone says it is - I use it once a day in the morning after I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth and scraped my tongue and my breath is fresh ALL day.  If I use it at night it kills morning breath too, but I find that using it daily every morning is sufficient.  However, the real reason I&#x27;m writing this review is to rave over how amazing this is for healing canker sores.  I get canker sores pretty regularly, probably about every other month, and often I will get several at once.  Nothing has ever helped significantly with the pain.  Over the counter numbing liquids work for short periods of time, but they are ridiculously painful to apply, and if the canker sore is way in the back of the mouth or something, it can be next to impossible to get it in the correct spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to notice that this mouthwash helped significantly whenever I started to get canker sores.  First off, this mouthwash hardly stings upon contact with a canker sore.  Usually anything, even WATER, will cause a me lot of pain when in contact with a canker sore, but I barely feel a thing when I&#x27;m swishing this around.  I feel a very slight stinging, but nothing to write home about.  After swishing, I would notice that my canker sore wouldn&#x27;t hurt as much.  It would still hurt SOME, but not enough to notice unless I was thinking about it.  I would be able to eat normally without worrying about food touching the canker sore, I didn&#x27;t have to brush my teeth extra carefully to avoid hitting it - basically, I noticed that although I could still FEEL the canker sore, it was causing me significantly less pain, and this effect would last for hours - much, much longer than any numbing liquid ever lasted.  If I swished in the morning, I wouldn&#x27;t start to feel the pain from the canker sore again until pretty late in the afternoon, maybe even early evening.  The bizarre thing is that it isn&#x27;t as if the mouthwash numbs the sore - at least not the way other numbing agents do, where you can hardly feel the side of the mouth that you&#x27;ve put it on.  Your mouth feels totally normal, but somehow the pain from the canker sore is significantly decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, if I swish several times a day when having canker sores, they go away much quicker.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll forget and only swish once a day and the pain will come back, but if I&#x27;m diligent about swishing at least twice a day (preferably 3 times) for the duration of a canker sore, not only will I feel minimal pain, but it takes much less time for a canker sore to heal.  And one of the best parts about using this to treat canker sores is that it doesn&#x27;t matter WHERE the canker sore is in your mouth - the mouthwash can get into every nook and cranny easily!  If I get a canker sore on the inside of my cheek, I will lay down on my side after taking the mouthwash so that the liquid can sit on the canker sore for a good 30 seconds or so.  Unless your canker sore is on the roof of your mouth or something, you can easily position your head in a way that the mouthwash can be on the canker sore for a longer period of time than just swishing, and I think this does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy to have finally found something that works to heal canker sores and significantly reduces the pain associated with them.  I actually noticed that on the newer packaging, they now advertise on the box that this can treat canker sores, and I don&#x27;t think I ever noticed that on the old packaging.  I only wish there was a simpler way to pack these for travel.  The pump leaks when not upright, so you&#x27;d have to save the caps if you do want to travel with them, or decant them into two smaller containers.  Only a small gripe though, otherwise this product is perfect!!!</li>
    <li> It works, but I don&#x27;t like the after taste. Their toothpaste is better.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this product which I heard about on one of the Dr. shows on TV.  They said the worst smells emitted from the body came from the mouth, and this products was named as the one that really works to eliminate the bacteria that causes the odor.  So I gave it a try.  It really works!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best mouthwash I have found that really lasts.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. It has zinc in it, so I&#x27;m hesitant to use it all the time but it really works.</li>
    <li> Has totally solved my breath problems after trying just about every toothpaste and mouthwash on the market. Tips: 1) Make sure you buy the &amp;#34;2-bottle&amp;#34; system 2) Don&#x27;t swish/gargle too much longer than the recommended 30 seconds  3) Try using 2 squirts from each bottle insted of 4 squirts from each--you don&#x27;t really need that much and it will last twice as long.</li>
    <li> This has become another must-have, we all need fresh breath anytime, anywhere.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t use this product, though my husband has for a couple years now. He says it has a very mild flavor, nothing like Listerine. I can say that I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in his halitosis (kisses are better...&amp;#60;3 ) and the results of his dentist visits have also improved. We&#x27;re definitely sold on this product !</li>
    <li> Have used for weeks.  tastes great and I like the portable ones also.</li>
    <li> Cancel my subscription.  Too strong for my mouth.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mouthwash for about a week and I gotta say, I&#x27;m impressed with how long my breath stays fresh.  I use it twice a day like the instructions read and it works.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is not good.  I used it as directed for several months but ended up developing thrush on my tongue (in other words, a microbial imbalance in my mouth due to die-off of beneficial bacteria and growth of too much yeast).  In addition, this mouthwash causes an aftertaste that negatively affects the taste of food for several hours after using.  I&#x27;ve found that there are other mouthwashes that work much better and are more reasonably priced, as well as more convenient to use (1 bottle versus mixing 2 solutions).  I&#x27;m much happier with Listerine Naturals in herbal mint, which causes lasting fresh breath and hasn&#x27;t resulted in thrush for me.</li>
    <li> All other mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried just mask the smell of bad breath but this formulation really kills the odor making bacteria and is long lasting. I swish before brushing as well as after.&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 bottles that you pump two squirts from into a cup, swirl to mix the chemicals and rinse. Only downside is its hard to find at Grocery stores and takes up a bit more room on your bathroom countertop.</li>
    <li> Only mouthwash my husband and I use.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.</li>
    <li> Love it great product</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash for it&#x27;s long lasting fresh breath effect. Please read the instructions though as you need to floss and brush your teeth and then use this to expect the results.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the pricing is high compared to any &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; mouthwashes, but hey...it does the job and most conventional mouthwashes don&#x27;t !!</li>
    <li> Works well sometimes but not all the time.  Mouth does feel clean after use</li>
    <li> Had a bad taste that I could not get rid of no matter how much I brushed and rinsed. This fixed it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I wish more people would use it..</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I used to hate using Scope or Listerine. They were so strong-tasting, and only lasted about an hour. When I heard Chuck Woolery advertising Smart Mouth, I bought some, and am totally sold on it. It really does last all day, and I don&#x27;t have to keep a box of breath mints in my purse any more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this product five stars, but the first container ALWAYS runs out first. I&#x27;ve bought five packages of this stuff, so I know it&#x27;s not a fluke. I&#x27;ve even used less of the first bottle. So frustrating to not be able use all the product.</li>
    <li> I worry about my smoker&#x27;s breath in the office...this stuff takes care of it!  My mouth feels clean all day!</li>
    <li> Keeps my breath fresh and clean throughout the day. I prefer it over other mouth wash products on the market.</li>
    <li> Used the product exactly as directed. No negative results like some are reporting . . . just no results at all. Certainly not worth the price.</li>
    <li> 2 squirts of each formula at night is all you need.  I heard that doing it 2x upsets the balance of bacteria and can affect blood pressure/heart health so I am doing it just once a day and getting great results.  This also makes the bottles last longer.  I highly recommend this product to anyone having problems with bad breath.  It&#x27;s a thing of the past for me.</li>
    <li> This product changed my life. I had the worst breath imaginable, so bad even my wife stopped kissing me. I started using this 2X a day and the results were quick and dramatic! Not only does my breath taste fresher, but I have noticed people stop turning away when I talk too. I highly recommend this to anyone with breath issues.</li>
    <li> Not the biggest fan.  especially when you can get the same results much cheaper.  The chuck daly commercials sucked me in.</li>
    <li> Smart mouth works kills bad breath</li>
    <li> Works like no other mouth wash we have ever used. Definitely kills morning dragon breath  I will set it for automatic shipments.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Works like its supposed to work.</li>
    <li> This product really works great for my husband and we were happy to see it on Amazon.  We had tried other products and this seems to give all day freshness.</li>
    <li> Like the way it helps with bad breath. Mouth feels a little dry right after using it. Glad that it doesn&#x27;t burn like mouthwash with alcohol in it</li>
    <li> SmartMouth Advanced Clinical Formula Activated Mouthwash is simply the best.  If everything else ever tried has failed, SmartMouth will change all that.</li>
    <li> Yuck metallic taste - I followed the directions and used squirts from both bottles and it was disgusting! The lingering taste was awful. Whatever was activated - it wasnt worth the bad taste and the only immediate result was the immediate need to brush my teeth again!</li>
    <li> best mouthwash so far</li>
    <li> Great product at a fantastic price with lightening fast shipping!!  Great seller!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Just a little disappointed that when I received the order, it was 8 oz each. The way you are selling it stating 16 oz, I was under the impression 16 oz each. For the price I paid and the ounces, I could of bought it from Walmart cheaper :(</li>
    <li> I have had bad breath for over a year.  I have checked with my Dentist and my Doctor and no issues were found.  Dentist said all was healthy and perhaps I should try brushing my tongue.  Mr Dr said he saw no issues , sinuses were clear etc.  I tried this product and the issue with bad breath has been gone for more than 6 months.  I use it regularly, in the morning and evening after brushing and sometimes during the day after items like coffee or cheese.  The product comes with a measuring cup to mix the two solutions in but I have found that just two squirts from each pump does the job and uses less product, thus enabling the more than twice a day usage.  I have signed up for auto delivery as intend to use it always.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash really works and if I use it in the evening the next morning my mouth does not have bad breath. My gums are pretty bad, so I appreciate having a mouthwash that is easy to use and not irritating to my sensitive gums and sensitive teeth. I like it well enough that I have a subscription to it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Always have fresh breath.  A little &#x27;fiddly&#x27; mixing each time but manageable.  Pricey but comparatively decent rate on Amazon.</li>
    <li> They should sell refills so you can reuse the bottles and reduce plastic waste.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash really works against bad breath. I like it because it does not burn. I use it twice a day. Once in the morning and before bed. Great product.</li>
    <li> These mouthwashes make your mouth taste like you&#x27;ve been sucking on a penny for about half an hour. Also, I don&#x27;t understand why my mouthwash would have to be colored with D&amp;C Yellow #10 and FD&amp;C Blue #1. They put the abrasives sand (hydrated silica) and titanium dioxide in the toothpaste. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s to clean my teeth nice and white before I dye them with the mouthwash or what. But the toothpaste also has the same dyes in it. I don&#x27;t understand why artificial colors have to be added to my toothpaste and mouthwash. I&#x27;d send all this stuff back to Amazon if I hadn&#x27;t started using it already. It wasn&#x27;t inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Really like this mouthwash.  I don&#x27;t think it works for 12 hours, but it tastes good, and covers up smoker&#x27;s breath for a good period of time.</li>
    <li> This seems to help the best with our son&#x27;s halitosis better than any other product we&#x27;ve tried....and we&#x27;ve tried a lot! We receive this on Amazon&#x27;s monthly subscription service which is convenient and save a few $$ in the long run.</li>
    <li> A: this is the cure.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant palatability.  Once-a-day use, 12-hr fresh breath.  Works immediately and my daughter tried it.  She had no foul breath the next day on, as she cont&#x27;d use.  This box will last about a month with 1x/day use (4 pumps ea. in a supplied med cup, swish briskly for 30-60 sec.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this works.  I swish with this at night and in the morning I still have gross breath.  The flavor is not great either, definitely not as good as Scope or Listerine.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I am 76 years old and have suffered from halitosis all my life.  I have tried special toothpastes, mouthwashes, mints, and even a different brand of mouthwash that had to be mixed to be activated.  Some of them didn&#x27;t work at all, and some of them lasted up to about twenty minutes.  However, none gave me the result I wanted until I tried SmartMouth.  The box says it takes up to a week to be fully effective, but I could tell an amazing difference after just one rinse.  I wish this product had been available years ago.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
    <li> Been using Smart Mouth for some time and just discovered it contains Saccharine. An Artificial sweetener that&lt;br /&gt;I have not used in decades...because of all the bad reviews on it.  Extremely disappointed in Smart Mouth now.  Will NOT purchase this product again and cancelling my Auto Delivery.</li>
    <li> On my latest order my Solution bottle was barely half full and I really didn&#x27;t notice until I had used it several times,  and then I realized that there was a difference in the amount of the solution.</li>
    <li> I actually LOVE the product - it works!  But - I used the product exactly as directed and after 2 weeks, I was left with about half a bottle of solution 1 and an empty bottle of solution 2.  Now I can&#x27;t use it and I feel like I was robbed of my money.  This sucks, because I really love the product.  I feel hesitant to buy it again because what if the same thing happens?</li>
    <li> I gave this five stars because it works for me and is convenient to use.  I also use their toothpaste.  One minor issue I learned by mistake is that if the bottles are left in an area near a window with a lot of summer sun coming in, the green bottle appears to leak.  It actually is not leaking but being pumped out by a thermal process.  No big deal just keep it out of direct sun light.  Would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> These are a miracle worker. Best ever.</li>
    <li> This seems like one of those late night infomercial products that promises the moon and then sadly under delivers. But it&#x27;s not! In fact, it does everything it is said to do. 12 hours of fresh breath? Check. I have tried a dozen mouthwashes but nothing lasted for more than an hour or so. This one really, really works. In fact, I&#x27;d say that the only thing I don&#x27;t need is as much of it as the directions state: they say 3-4 squirts per treatment but I get away with 2 squirts and that still gets me through 12+ hours with no problem. Works like a charm. If you are hesitant, don&#x27;t be. This stuff works.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that REALLY works!! I use it once before going to work in the morning, and it keeps my breath fresh all day! I wish this was available when I was in my twenties!</li>
    <li> good product so far...&lt;br /&gt;is it normal after use, mouth is dry ??&lt;br /&gt;is it ok to use long term ???&lt;br /&gt;usage: morning and night daily ??&lt;br /&gt;price is on the high end.&lt;br /&gt;will recommend if price is lower.....&lt;br /&gt;thank ;you.</li>
    <li> This works, It has two bottles that you mix maybe  (1oz together)?  It is alcohol free and leaves breath free for 12 hrs.  You can do it in the am and in pm,  24 hrs of fresh breath :  )</li>
    <li> Getting away from the run-of-the-mill mouthwashes has been hard, but you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;m pleased with this one!</li>
    <li> Brought this product for my husband, he couldn&#x27;t find it in regular stores. He is certainly happy with the product and we will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> this product really does work and you can feel relaxed knowing that your breath will be pleasant if used as directed</li>
    <li> I do not think the mouthwash works as good as advertised. &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; odor is reduced, but my mouth definitely does not feel fresh after several hours.</li>
    <li> Great product even though it&#x27;s somewhat expensive.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and I have recommended it to many of my friends.  It really does keep your breath fresh for 12 hours, and you don&#x27;t wake up with dragon mouth!  A must-have in my bathroom and purse!!!</li>
    <li> works great to eliminate bad breath and gives your teeth a nice shine</li>
    <li> My husband and I tried this.  Neither of us is impressed.  Neither of us can tell a difference.  After about 30 minutes from using it, we both had the bad breath back again.  We would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> An excellent mouth wash that will leave you breath fresh and clean all day.  I also recommend using it at night.</li>
    <li> Good idea, and I was really looking forward to no morning breath.  I did not realize that you have to use it twice daily for at least two weeks before you see any results. Is that mentioned in the advertising?  We are left to assume that it is instant.  All that aside----it tastes HORRIBLE!  You are supposed to swish 30 seconds.  I only lasted 15. I even scrubbed my tongue with the towel trying to relieve that awful taste.  I will not be able to use it. Maybe I can find somebody with worse breath and no taste buds. I have to give it to somebody. Cannot stand waste.</li>
    <li> This really does work just as advertised. I have used mouthwash for years but nothing comes close to this product. It&#x27;s more expensive and you have to buy it more often but the extra price is for breath security. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Pricey but works great.</li>
    <li> Im a natural skeptic, but this really does something on the physiological level; I did notice that for about an hour after use that my sense of taste is distorted but,hey; the trade off is worth it! Now, if I could talk OTHERS into using it so I would not fall victim to the morning breath of colleagues....</li>
    <li> I totally recommend it. Everyone in the world should use this!</li>
    <li> Works better than I thought it would. For me, no unpleasant or lingering after taste. I will most likely buy this again as so far it has been very effective.</li>
    <li> It works. Check with the BBB if you have any questions about it working for 12 hours. It is the only one that passes that test per the BBB.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle! My husbands breath is 100% better when he uses this. It lasts all day and it is the only thing that has ever helped him.</li>
    <li> Use it at least twice a day along with brushing and flossing. The result is very little plaque to clean by the dental hygienist. Recommend use it along with Trident Xtra Care for all around maximum health for the teeth and gums. I don&#x27;t use tobacco, so my results may vary from those who do.</li>
    <li> Works but...major cotton mouth! Ever talk to someone kind of dehydrated, and they have gross whiteness in corners of mouth? That will be you! I looked in mirror and so embarrassed. Now if I use, I find myself constantly rubbing mouth corners in case it&#x27;s there. I have since cut dosage in half (2 squirts each instead of 4) it&#x27;s better for ME and will last longer. I would buy prob buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend after a dentist recommended it to help keep his breath fresher for long periods of time since he works longer hours. this product is no longer available in stores in our area. He likes the flavor, keeps his mouth fresh for hours- exactly what he wanted and glad that it worked. Maybe ordering the other flavor to see which one he likes best :)</li>
    <li> Dreaded morning breath is cured! We heard of the claims on QVC, but who believes those people? Not me! Luckily, my in-laws believe everything the see on QVC and made the purchase. So while the wife and I were visiting for the weekend, we gave it a try. And it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions call for 4 squirts of each. However I&#x27;ve found that 3 squirts of each is just fine. I initially tried 2 for a long while, but it was hit and miss. Lastly, I only use this a night time. In the morning I rotate between my other washes. I use an off brand anti-cavity fluoride like Act, and another off brand wash like Listerine. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with unfresh breath for a number of years.  My problem wasn&#x27;t extreme (ie. Halitosis) but from time to time I would have breath issues.  This product really does last 12 hours, and if used before bed results in no morning breath.  It does require mixing two solutions immediately before using but there are included push pumps that are quite easy to use.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I feel as if my breath is fresher after using it for only a week! I hate the fact that it&#x27;s 2 bottles that I have to mix together but I&#x27;m just thankful for fresh breath! So whatever I have to do to get there I will!</li>
    <li> I travel a lot for work so these fit perfectly in my travel bag and I have great breath throughout the day at conferences.</li>
    <li> This is a really good mouthwash, the only one that really works against coffee breath, garlic, onions and the other delicious food that just happens to smell disgusting... The only issue with it, as others have mentioned, is that it has a metallic aftertaste to it. I&#x27;m not a fan of that part, but it&#x27;s still better than letting everyone smell your breakfast, so thumbs up. :)</li>
    <li> I was not impressed by this mouthwash at all.</li>
    <li> Leaves a weird feeling in your mouth afterwards but I would rather leave a weird feeling in my mouth than a weird smell in that boy-next-to me-at-the-bar&#x27;s nose.</li>
    <li> I find that I don&#x27;t use it because of the peroxide taste and it makes food and drink taste different right after use. That goes away but as I said....it stops me from using it regularly like you are supposed to. Instructions say that you have to use it for a while before the long term benefit kicks in. I&#x27;m just going to use it up, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Was not real impressed with this product. To pump a mouthwash from two different bottles is a little cumbersome for me. The taste of the mouthwash does not have a minty fresh taste. Would not recommend at this time.</li>
    <li> it works......it&#x27;s that simple</li>
    <li> works as advertised!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It Works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Very timely, product was exactly as described.  It actually does work as described, will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash was recomended by my dentist and I see why. It has helped tremendously with sensitivity and when used befoer bedtime you do not wake up with dragon breath. The only problem I can see is it wouldn&#x27;t be very practical for travel.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This does actually work! They say in the instructions to use 4 pumps of each of the formulas, I only use 2 and it still works perfectly. This helps me save 50% and makes it last double the amount of time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, although I just started purchasing it from Amazon. I cannot say enough good things about this product. I use it every day, and I no longer feel like I have to worry about a problem I&#x27;ve been chasing with gum and mints for years. I feel so clean after using SmartMouth. Not to be corny, but I don&#x27;t leave home without using it.</li>
    <li> Just purchased my first smart mouth advanced clinical and was very happy! It came on time,it worked like a dream. I never had such a fresh mouth in fact I am ordering another one right now! It does as advertised and I find that you do not need recommended amount to keep your mouth fresh! Finally found a miracle cure for morning breath. I recommend anyone who has had bad breath to buy this product you will never have bad breath again!</li>
    <li> My wife says it is a miracle.  Works great</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a pretty good recommendation, right? However, it left my mouth in a constant state of oddness. There was a lingering taste and a very mild numbness that never went away as long apps I used this product.</li>
    <li> makes everything taste weird after use and has artifical colorants</li>
    <li> arrived as ordered.l  product delivers.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical that SmartMouth would work well, but I noticed a difference from the very first time I tried it. Now, I&#x27;ve been using SmartMouth for a year and still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, I&#x27;ve also discovered that 2 squirts does just fine (opposed to the 4 squirts mentioned in the directions). Not only do 2 squirts work just as well, but it also makes it easier to swish IMO, and has the additional benefit of doubling the mileage of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have also mentioned feeling a dry mouth situation after using the product. I noticed this as well, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad and goes away in just a few minutes for me. I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to have discovered SmartMouth. It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Really works!  Though I&#x27;m very susceptible to respiratory &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34;  i haven&#x27;t had any since using SmartMouth.  I think it may keep the &amp;#34;bad bugs&amp;#34; from multiplying ..</li>
    <li> This stuff really works when it comes to keeping you from getting bad breath shortly after you brush your teeth. I just use this and put it in my mouth instead of using toothpaste. While it&#x27;s in my mouth I use my electric toothbrush and do my regular brushing. It&#x27;s actually saving me money to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The only small downside is that for about an hour after I use it, if I eat anything sugary it will taste really bad. That eventually goes away but drinking my morning orange juice isn&#x27;t quite as refreshing if it&#x27;s after I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product with caution.  While I think it serves as an effective way to control bad breath, it can have its drawbacks.  My son used it as directed, twice a day,morning and night and developed &#x27;thrush&#x27; which is a yeast infection in the oral cavity.  I believe that it is so effective in destroying bacteria in the mouth, that it actually kills off all the good bacteria too allowing for an opportunistic infection to develop, like thrush.</li>
    <li> I heard about this from Adam Carolla. Expensive, but probably my favorite mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I bougjt this for everyone in my family and we all use it.  Helps with bad breath and can really tell that there is less plaque build up especially on the backs of my lower front teeth.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. Fresh breath all day and in the morning when used just before bed time..</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product. My husband has had a bad breath issue for over 40 years. I was in the dental field and tried to help him there. No change. I then transitioned into the holistic health field and again tried to tackle this issue. There was never any improvement even though he has excellent dental health and a very good diet. Regular mouthwashes just &amp;#34;minted up&amp;#34; the bad breath. This is the first product that has actually given him fresh breath with no other odor to cover it up. His mouth smells clean and fresh. I am happier than he is, I think. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> There is a buildup after awhile...not sure if it&#x27;s plaque or something formed by the combination. It&#x27;s noticeable between teeth and on the back of the front teeth. It may just be this formulation, I don&#x27;t remember it happening with the original. Except for that, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> This product is recommended by my oral hygienist.  I really like it and feel that my mouth is very clean and my breath smells great for a long time.</li>
    <li> Al; the above items worked out grate.Will order other items as thery come up.Keep me posted of any new items I might like</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in two days and the product works great.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really works for a full 12 hours, but it definitely seems to work.</li>
    <li> I hesitate to grant SmartMouth five stars for one reason; cost. This product is the singular most reliably effective out there- period. I&#x27;ve tried it all. Get it, and the only thing you&#x27;ll regret is you won&#x27;t need it. You won&#x27;t need it because you won&#x27;t have any money left for a date.</li>
    <li> I take a medication that gives me dry breath. Smart mouth does work but I find it too expensive to continue buying.</li>
    <li> I was recently at a medical event and two doctors suggested that I try this mouthwash system.  They both swore by it.  I can honestly say that it works.  I have just finished my first 2 bottles and I noticed a marked difference after about 5 days.  It&#x27;s easy to use - just like any other mouth wash - and I enjoy the refreshing taste.  It&#x27;s citrus-like.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is an A+ product</li>
    <li> Saw an ad for this, and figured that I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m a 50-year-old that smokes &amp; has constant dry mouth due to medications. Tried for 5 out the recommended 10 days and gave up as it made everything taste terrible even hours after using. Even a glass of water (my city always wins awards &amp; I use a PUR filter) was something that I began avoiding. Back to Listerine &amp; Tic Tacs!</li>
    <li> I have used this for at least 2 years.  Mostly reliably.  I am an individual who gets alot of tartar build up, no matter what I do in terms of brushing, flossing, even waterpik.  It is genetic, my body just seems to make it and other family members have same thing.  So I have and use a dental scaler, which I use about once a week, primarily on the backs of my front bottom teeth.  When using this rinse I noticed that the tartar came off MUCH EASIER.  It just kind of crumbled.  Versus needing just the right angle and force and scraping.  There is no doubt in my mind this is true.  I can&#x27;t explain it.  Not sure what zinc ion therapy is.  But this is my experience.</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash EVER!  I stumbled on this brand in Walmart and decided to give it a try because Listerine shredded my inner lips and burned my gums, I&#x27;m guessing from the alcohol.  This mouthwash has lived up to it&#x27;s name and works great.  Love the flavor, too!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash may be &amp;#34;activated&amp;#34; whatever that means, but it does leave and odd tase in your mouth. It seems that the two ingredients that you mix together are comprised of a taste component in green and a clear liquid, really dreadful tasting, that I&#x27;m hoping does something miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is certainly different than the mouthwash I&#x27;m used to, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any more effective. I&#x27;m determined to finish the bottles and update this review if I feel differently, but as of now I&#x27;d have to say that it&#x27;s just and odd tasting concoction that may not be any more effective than what you&#x27;re using now.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say, I&#x27;ve struggled with bad halitosis all my life. People would stay away from me when talking and the only thing that helped throughout the years was to constantly chew gum. After discovering this via a radio ad, I tried it and it changed my life. my wife says it saved our marriage. This works!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! No burn.  Helps with halitosis but must be patient.  Not a one-time thing, it will take daily flossing and use of the mouthwash for a couple of weeks.  Significant decrease of doggy-breath the next morning - I appreciate it, esp. when significant other&#x27;s breath can wake me up in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product, it really works. I have really dry mouth and I know that causes bad breath. So I use this along with the Smart Mouth mints.</li>
    <li> It simply works. Like magic.</li>
    <li> Thanks Adam Carolla! Smart Mouth is sooooooo great! So much better than any other mouthwash! I do the Adam Carolla thing and brush my teeth with it. The directions say 4 pumps of each bottle (its a 2 part/bottle system) but I just use 1 pump from each and I&#x27;ve never had fresher breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth thanks me, my wife thanks me - and I&#x27;ve noticed other people are more interested in what I have to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say hello to smart mouth and longer more confident make-out sessions!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it does what it says it will. I always have an extra box on hand as I don&#x27;t want to be without it.&lt;br /&gt;Always fresh breath.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  Use as directed.  But I also cut the &#x27;dose&#x27; in half and it is just fine.  Passes the &#x27;wife&#x27;-test, for certain!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to do the 2-step dispensing and if it was at a lower price point for the amount that you get.  I have had dragon breath my entire life and when I finally realized it at 17, I started chewing gum non-stop for years!  I&#x27;m older now and lazier and don&#x27;t feel like keeping gum in my mouth all day every day so I&#x27;ve been a little conscious of my breath, saving the gum for staff meetings and one on one incidences at work or with my boyfriend.  I did once ask my boyfriend if I had the dragon breath and he said no, but I don&#x27;t have any official feedback on what this mouthwash has done for my poor friends/family/coworkers - however, I can feel fresher breath, all day.</li>
    <li> I used the original TriOral toothpaste and mouthwash for years. They were excellent products and were effective in treating halitosis. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t make this same statement about SmartMouth. I was able to completely eliminate halitosis with TriOral, but have not been able to achieve this same result by using SmartMouth products. I am extremely disappointed. I hope that the original toothpaste and mouthwash formulas become available again soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******** 3/7/2013 ********&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t express enough how disappointed I am that the company replaced it&#x27;s TriOral products with the much less effective SmartMouth products. Worst product makeover ever. I foresee that this company will lose most of it&#x27;s faithful TriOral followers in search of a better treatment.</li>
    <li> All i can say is THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!!!  No other mouthwash/rinse can do what smartmouth does. For me, results were quick and effective.</li>
    <li> Comes with two different bottles that you mix when using.  The product does keep my breath cleaner for a longer period of time, long after regular mouthwashes (including the ones that burn) stop working.  The only problem is that it is pricey, but it does work unlike any other mouthwash I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I have the worse breath, I brush twice a day and even floss every day. This stuff works amazingly. I don&#x27;t typically use the recommended amount. One squirt of each and works just great.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised, promptly shipped. Recommended highly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, must buy</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product would give you 12 hours of fresh breath, but it does work wonders.  You only need two &amp;#34;shots&amp;#34; from each bottle as opposed to the recommended four, making the product last twice as long.  You can feel it changing your mouth chemistry immediately, something to do with PH I suspect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest… My breath was not desirable.  It was even terrible at times, but this product has really changed my life.  I saw it initially on Celebrity Apprentice.  I figured it was worth a shot since I had tried other mouthwashes and toothpastes and mints… but they only freshened my breath temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use half of the recommended dosage (2 pumps from each bottle) and swish for the recommended 30 seconds twice a day (I might do it again if I had a lot of raw onions or garlic too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t use the medicine cup that&#x27;s provided with the mouthwash.  I pump into my mouth without touching my mouth.  No one else uses the product in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few days but then my breath was completely neutral.  I didn&#x27;t really even have morning breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt much more confident when speaking with people.  I didn&#x27;t put a hand in front of my mouth or limit my words from embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  It&#x27;s a bit of a pain if you are going to be traveling since you are going to either take off the pump tops or you can push the pump down and turn it to lock its position (but you will waste some of the product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit expensive in terms of mouthwashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  This product is worth every penny.  There is nothing worse than bad breath.  Even if you have tried several other products and your situation didn&#x27;t improve, you should definitely give this one a shot.  I love it and I&#x27;m pretty sure you will too!</li>
    <li> I smoke 2-3 cigars on most days. I use before my Fiance&#x27; gets home in the evening, and sometimes in the morning as well. It works very well, as she doesn&#x27;t complain (except when I forget to use it). In addition, prior to using this product, when I woke up in the morning, I had a horrible aftertaste in the morning whenever I smoked the day before. This product has gotten rid of that. I tried several mouthwashes, and this is the only one that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add my routine. I use this product, I floss, I vigorously brush my teeth, and then use Listerine after brushing.</li>
    <li> best mouthwash around, packed well</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash ever. I can&#x27;t see myself using anything else</li>
    <li> This product not only made my breath bad but also made my mouth very dry</li>
    <li> How can I rate this wonderful product.  My husband had REALLY bad breath.  We heard an advertisement while on vacation.  I felt it was worth a try.  From Day 1 of using this product and the toothpaste, he has had no bad breath.</li>
    <li> The advanced version is about as good as it gets...Keeps my breath and mouth fresh...A life saver!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended it. It will leave your mouth with a tingling funny taste that goes away shortly. It works</li>
    <li> smart mouth works great for me. I have a lot of post nasal drip problems ( probably because of too much caffeine) so I always have a nasty taste in my mouth. This Smart Mouth is the best product at making my mouth taste fresh all day. I rinse in the morning and evening and this stuff really works amazing !!!! I highly reccommend</li>
    <li> This is a really effective mouthwash. Unlike alcohol-based mouthwash, this is long-lasting and not unpleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 solutions get mixed in a small included cup to activate it for rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;The instruction tells to do 4 pumps for each solution, but really only 1 or 2 are needed, depending on mouth size.&lt;br /&gt;For best result, swish the liquid between the teeth and gargle to get to the back of the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for treating the side effects of mouth breathing and dry mouth.</li>
    <li> Far superior to any alcohol based mouthwash.  It is as good as claimed.</li>
    <li> My husband always complains about my breath.  Now he doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> No more stink breath. Works all day all night as advertised.</li>
    <li> This was for my husband and he likes it fine. He thinks the amount advised to use is too much so he uses half at a time.  I&#x27;ve had no complaints since he began using it!</li>
    <li> I use this daily, and I don&#x27;t doubt that my breath is fresh, but at what cost?  So far, I cannot really taste food for most of the day.  All food has a strange metallic taste, or no taste.  I miss tasting my food.  :(</li>
    <li> I have this on auto delivery so I never run out...I like must better than any other! Very good mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I always relied on Listerine, but when I found SmartMouth, I must say the results are much better. Especially like the Advance Clinical Formula with the extra germ-killing, anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis ingredients, it has proven very effective for me. It is more expensive than traditional mouthwashes, but I find it is well-worth the extra investment.</li>
    <li> This is the only mouthwash that works without fail for a full 12 hours. You won&#x27;t even remember what morning breath is once you&#x27;ve started using this. I have used it religiously for years.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  It does exactly what it says it will.  It takes care of bad breath completely. We will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and can honestly say that it really works and is the best ....</li>
    <li> Helpful Hints&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Smart Mouth for over five years. I&#x27;ve discovered a few things along the way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) You don&#x27;t really need a full dose for the product to work. I only use two pumps from each bottle. It&#x27;s half as much, but it works as good as the amount the box says to use. Using half also makes the product last twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) For best results, make sure that you allow the rinse to cover the back of your tongue without swallowing the product while you are swishing. By coating the back of your tongue, you are making sure the product can work to eliminate odors from all the food and drink you ingest. You only need to let the rinse coat the back of your mouth a few times to do it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) This is important! Do NOT use for more than the 30 seconds as stated in the directions. I&#x27;ve read some comments from others about not being able to taste anything after using Smart Mouth. I had experienced this too, early on, until I realized that I was swishing much longer than 30 seconds. It&#x27;s easy to go over the time because you may not be watching the clock or maybe you go off and do something else while swishing. But you need to pay attention to the time. Once I made sure I spat out the rinse when the 30 seconds was up, I no longer had problems with taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and it works just as described. Used properly, this rinse can save you from embarrassing bad breath all day - even after drinking coffee, eating garlic and onions and it really does stop morning breath. I LOVE Smart Mouth and have recommended it to others more times than I can count.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Makes tongue numb. Called company they said Zinc could do that. They said take back to where was purchased . Ddidn&#x27;t really seem to care. Would not buy again. Also lost 12.00dollars as I have to throw away.</li>
    <li> best mouth wash ever!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and works well.  We use this mouthwash every day. It does prevent bad breath.</li>
    <li> this is one of my best purchases. i only use 2 pumps from each bottle in the morning. works great for me. my husband commented on my fresh breath and he noticed the improvement after i started using this.</li>
    <li> love this product.  totally takes care of morning breath and keeps breath fresh all day (rinse again after eating onions or garlic) ...</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash. It works!</li>
    <li> This stuff gets my mouth feeling totally odorless.  It&#x27;s a bit weird at first, but quickly became addictive.  I now walk around with NO fear of bad breath, and look forward to my next dentist appointment.  I suspect that DESTROYING all the bacteria will actually lead to better gums, but will know for certain in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Works well, not a total solution but part of a good oral hygiene  approach. Better than other brands...go for it</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I should&#x27;ve typed this up a while back, but thought I&#x27;ll do it now. When you use this on your mouth, it initially will do an amazing job.. killing almost all the bacteria in your mouth. The issue lies with the bacteria it has not killed. When these bacteria multiply, it will also have a resistance to the chemicals in this mouthwash; it loses its affect. This is the reason why this product only worked for about 3 weeks, then had no advantage over the normal Crest/Colgate mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this mouth wash for a few weeks now and it does do as it claims (at least for me). I will rinse my mouth with this before I go to bed and I wake up without bad breath. The first time it happened, I couldn&#x27;t believe there was no odor or any signs of bad breath in the morning. The negative is the extreme dry mouth it gives you after you rinse. The recommended 4 squirts of each bottle is a little too much. You can get by fine with 2 of each. I even did 1 of each and it was OK as well. I have to do further research on the chemicals used in this mouth wash. To achieve such a feat, I wonder if any of the chemicals have potential negative long term effects.</li>
    <li> my mouth was smelly and with this stuff it smells good for kiss kiss with lady faces. much fun were</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product when it was under the Tri Oral name.  He said it actually worked to rid the mouth of odor, not just mask it.  I was a huge Listerine fan until I discovered this.  Will admit that the taste is not the minty POW! you get from other mouthwashes, however waking without the dragon breath is such a gift!  For a quick refresher the minty mouth washes are fine, but to actually kick butt on the bacteria, I believe this works better.  Pair with a good tongue scraper and you&#x27;ve got a great weapon to slay the dragon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this through amazon and it never showed up. Amazon refunded me when I called and explained. Went to the drug store and picked it up for about $1 more, not much difference. This leaves a chalky feel in my mouth for several minutes and gives me the feeling that I need to spit. After a bit that chalky sensation subsides and I think it works quite well. It reduces bad taste in my mouth when I am out all day and can&#x27;t brush my teeth. It is not 100% but makes a noticeable difference. Works best in conjunction with all good oral hygiene practices: flossing, careful brushing, thorough rinsing.</li>
    <li> It works very well.  I use 2 pumps like the other review suggested and it works fine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year and a half and I have to say, it works as advertised.  There are many causes of bad breath, including chronic low grade sinus infection, acid reflux, dental issues or gum disease, and some medications (I am not a dr, but I have been working on this problem for years).  Mine was due to none of these things, apparently it was some very hearty bacteria that just refused to die with a swish of Listerine.  or two. or three.  This product was a HUGE relief and continues to work for me. It seems that people react differently, though.  It does leave an odd taste that goes away within 20 minutes, but I don&#x27;t experience the numbness or other negative effects others have reported. This product worked where every other product out there failed.</li>
    <li> I always had bad breath for as long as I can remember. I would brush floss and practice overall good oral hygiene but I always had a white film on my tongue which smelled. I have tried many products the most recent being Profresh but nothing compares to the results if Smart Mouth. It is the only product giving lasting results as advertised. I did alter the taste of drinks but it is a small price to pay for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; breath. It&#x27;s only been about 2 days but it truly works. Thank God for this products it is a life changer.</li>
    <li> The product is great and works as advertised.  I was very disappointed that I can no longer purchase from Amazon as a direct purchase (must be an add-on item).  The earlier order was purchased as a single item (2), and was as expected.  I made my most recent purchase from target.com, where it was available as a single purchase item.</li>
    <li> seems to work. Same active ingredient as crest pro-health (Cetylpyridinium Chloride)</li>
    <li> I always use this product in advance of a date. I am 70 years old and still in the dating process. Once you rinse with this product it will protect your breath for 12 hours. It even protects against \\&quot;dragon breath \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to rid myself of &amp;#34;Cigar Mouth&amp;#34; which is when you can still taste a cigar even up to 24 hours after smoking it. For this it works wonderfully. However, it worked so well, I now use it daily regardless of having smoked a cigar or not. It just leaves a clean taste in your mouth all day even after drinking coffee, or garlicky foods.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is great, was recommended by my dentist and it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I gave this a shot and used it as directed for a full week.  I noticed the saccharin aftertaste the first time I used it, but I figured after blowing hard-earned money on the stuff I&#x27;d hang in there to see if I got accustomed to it.  I didn&#x27;t, and I swear this stuff has killed my taste buds.  Everything tastes very strange.  Also, it sucks all of the moisture out of my mouth every time I use it.  I just poured more than 1/2 of it down the drain.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash for bad breath I have found!  Its the only thing I use and I have had no issues with bad breath since starting to use it, avfter having bad breath for many years.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says, it immediately eliminates ANY flavors you might have in your mouth. I drink coffee too and I am very impressed. This is like no other product out there. Scope and Listerine are CRAP that only mask odors for a limited time. This ELIMINATES them but I wouldn&#x27;t waste the money only getting this, you must get the amazing toothpaste with it too!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, being a long-time Listerine user, but I thought I would give it a try.  Wow, I am sold and now have permanently switched from Listerine to SmartMouth.  What I love is that not only do you not have bad breath, my mouth tastes clean and fresh - no more cottony, yucky morning mouth!  In addition, as someone who is missing some salivary glands (don&#x27;t ask) this did not dry out my mouth which many mouth washes tend to do.  I love SmartMouth - my husband does too which surprised me since he can be reluctant to try new things.</li>
    <li> I used this mouthwash for my granddaughter. She had the worst breath i ever smelled. Now that she has used this mouthwash her breath smells great. &#x27;&#x27; LOVE IT&#x27;&#x27;.  THANKS  CLARA SEIGLER</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, but I don&#x27;t like the feel of my mouth after I use it.</li>
    <li> Product works as described!</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that, like items offered in an infomercial or a late-night TV commercial, sounds too good to be true.  But darned if it doesn&#x27;t work exactly as advertised.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and it has eliminated both bad breath (brought on by garlic, among other things) and morning cottonmouth/morning breath.  I noticed another reviewer&#x27;s hint that I, too, discovered-- You will get the same result by using half the recommended amount.  This was confirmed when I purchased the travel packs, which I noticed use a dosage that is about half of what is called for on the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the product apparently isn&#x27;t available in a larger container.  I wish there were a refill size available, which would presumably lower the per-ounce cost.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a bit skeptical when I read the reviews about this product lasting 12 hours but my skepticism was relieved once I used it the first night.  It has a minty taste with a hint of hydrogen peroxide which does not make this the best tasting mouthwash, however, it is a small price to pay for how effective this product is.  You will notice results immediately and I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Not just fresh breath in the a.m. - but great checkups too !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True story. I missed my regular 6 month teeth cleaning and finally went, 2 days short of a full year.&lt;br /&gt;OMG ! Fastest teeth cleaning I ever had. My dental hygienist said and I quote: &amp;#34;whatever I&#x27;m doing, keep it up&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using SmartMouth Advanced for well over a year now and I&#x27;m just plain sold on it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing better than waking up in the morning and eager to kiss my girl - we both taste great. Just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  I only use if once a day.....two squirts from each bottle and it does the trick.  Much, much better than Tic Tacs, breath drops, mints, etc.</li>
    <li> One guy said that this product didn&#x27;t work for him. Only thing that I can imagine is that he eats poup</li>
    <li> Works great! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> It may work for its intended purpose but it REALLY screws up your sense of taste, and leaves an odd mouth feel, well in to the next day. I don&#x27;t know if I will continue with it. Maybe I will try a 10 second rinse to see if that helps.</li>
    <li> Tastes kinda bad but man it works GREAT.  My wife says i&#x27;m so kissable after ive rinsed.  She says it lasts too...after work still OK whereas with other mouthwash that was never true.  Only use 1/2 of indicated amount and only rinse for precisely 30 seconds.  More than that can cause &amp;#34;taste issues&amp;#34; as others have noted. Probably caused by the zinc.  Which oddly is used to cure people who have lost their sense of taste.</li>
    <li> Too many steps for a mouth rinse that doesn&#x27;t exactly leave you feeling fresh</li>
    <li> not bad.  i suffer w/dry mouth which causes bad breath.  this has worked the best so far. the only thing, more than 2 hours after using it, when i eat, the food has a strange taste.  i thought it was the food itself, but then i decided to not use the mouthwash then eat. food tasted normal.  next time, 4 hours after using mouthwash, food still tasted different.  not that it&#x27;s a horrible taste, just not the actual taste of the food. i prefer fresh breath over great tasting food!</li>
    <li> Leaves a bad taste for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have my taste buds back!  It&#x27;s been a rough week and a half.  I apparently am one of the few who cannot tolerate the taste of this mouthwash... or more accurately the after taste.  I think it&#x27;s the zinc.  From what I can gather all mouthwashes claiming to conquer bad breath have zinc.  It left a metallic taste that made everything taste bitter.  I didn&#x27;t even like my favorite dark chocolate and coffee... or even water.  Glad that&#x27;s over with.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product for those who can tolerate zinc.</li>
    <li> For medical reasons I have had continuous problems with gingivitis and was on prescription mouthwash for over four years.  Six months ago my dentist switched me to the Smart Mouth Advanced Clinical Formula that is anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis.  When I went in for my six-month checkup the hygienist was amazed at the improvement.  My gums have stopped bleeding and the color is normal instead of bright red.</li>
    <li> this mouth wash kinda has a strong taste&lt;br /&gt;but it actually works&lt;br /&gt;no more coffee breath&lt;br /&gt;it lasts for a long time&lt;br /&gt;its a must</li>
    <li> absolutely wonderful. No more coffee or smokers breath! Its like no one would know!</li>
    <li> I love it.  It really works great!  I can feel the cleanliness in my mouse and am more confident when I talk to people.</li>
    <li> I bought this mouthwash for my husband who LOVES garlic (but I don&#x27;t LOVE his garlic breath).  I thought this would be the solution.  It isn&#x27;t.  After using as directed, it doesn&#x27;t even touch his garlic breath.  Listerine actually works better (for about 15 minutes after use).  I am so disappointed.  The upside is that I tried this mouthwash and it works great for me as just a general mouthwash.</li>
</ol>
