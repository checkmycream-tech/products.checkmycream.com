      <li>Good quality however.</li>
      <li>Quality cotton at a very good price these are great for dabbing with Sea Breeze in order to clean your face.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re kind of sense and need to be pulled apart to be better</li>
      <li>Handy ziplock bag to keep them dust free.</li>
      <li>the hassle to return as easy as Amazon makes it,</li>
      <li>These cotton balls are just fine.</li>
      <li>Quality seems fine, they are just not what they are advertised to be.</li>
      <li>These are good quality cotton balls, soft on my face, dual duty for craft projects.</li>
      <li>They are definitely a jumbo size and are a good value for the price.</li>
      <li>good basic cotton balls</li>
      <li>These are nice cotton balls, but definitely not Jumbo.  </li>
      <li>Received what I expected, good description of product, arrived in the allotted time period.</li>
      <li>(It&#x27;s hardly worth</li>
      <li>They are very dense and work well for my purposes, but are by no means jumbo.</li>
      <li>This needs to be renamed as these are not jumbo and much too pricy for what you get.</li>
      <li>But, they are kind of small.</li>

    <li> This needs to be renamed as these are not jumbo and much too pricy for what you get. Unless you are looking for small cotton balls do not order these.</li>
    <li> These cotton balls are just fine. They are definitely a jumbo size and are a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Like people have said, these are normal sized cotton balls... definitely not jumbo.  Quality seems fine, they are just not what they are advertised to be.</li>
    <li> I JUST OPENED THIS PRODUCT UP.  THE THING I NOTICED IS THAT THE COTTON BALLS ARE NOT AS SOFT AS OTHER ONES I HAVE BOUGHT.  IF THIS CAN BE CHANGED, I WOULD CONSIDER BUYING AGAIN.</li>
    <li> They are pretty big but not fluffy. They&#x27;re kind of sense and need to be pulled apart to be better</li>
    <li> For Jumbo, I expected larger.  Good quality however.</li>
    <li> Anyone calling these \\&quot;jumbo\\&quot; should invest in a dictionary. These are smaller than my last bag of regular cotton balls. They are very dense and work well for my purposes, but are by no means jumbo. They are slightly larger than a quarter.</li>
    <li> Good cotton balls, no BS. Not sure what else to say about a bag of cotton balls, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> These cottonballs are not as JUMBO as you might think. I expected these cottonballs to be twice the size that they are. DIsappointed.</li>
    <li> good basic cotton balls</li>
    <li> I had despaired of finding cotton balls large enough for normal use.  These are big enough to hold solution and wipe across my face.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are good quality cotton balls, soft on my face, dual duty for craft projects. Handy ziplock bag to keep them dust free.</li>
    <li> These are nice and fluffy, but dense enough that they do not compact too much.  Now I need fewer cotton balls - I was using several smaller cotton balls at a time before finding these.</li>
    <li> If these are &amp;#34;jumbo,&amp;#34; I&#x27;m Dumbo!  These are not practical for cosmetic removal.  They are smaller than small.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These are also the best in my opinion. Quality cotton at a very good price these are great for dabbing with Sea Breeze in order to clean your face.</li>
    <li> These cotton balls are not jumbo!!!  So, that is false advertisement!  I only like them because they don&#x27;t seem to come apart like the ones I already have.  But, they are kind of small.</li>
    <li> Jumbo size as promised</li>
    <li> These are nice cotton balls, but definitely not Jumbo.  They are dense however. . I like Jumbo when doing my nails.</li>
    <li> Received what I expected, good description of product, arrived in the allotted time period. I would purchase from here again.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t jumbo, but they get the job done for my little fingers. Other than that, they are just a cotton ball, exactly what they look like.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the reviews, but no, I had to save a few bucks!  Now it&#x27;s likely I&#x27;ll have to use two at a time, so, no bargain!  (It&#x27;s hardly worth the hassle to return as easy as Amazon makes it, so I&#x27;ll make do.)</li>
