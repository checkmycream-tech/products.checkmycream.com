### Positive Reviews

      <li>Best part is that it glides on and dissolves almost instantaneously; does not make you look blanched out; and works.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best you can buy.</li>
      <li>It is quite pricey but it is the best I&#x27;ve used</li>

      <li>This is by far the best sunblock I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s most effective to block the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Effective, safe and not greasy.</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>the texture is amazing &amp; is a fantastic sunblock.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m pleased that it still stays transparent/lucent when i&#x27;m sweaty.  </li>
      <li>and MORE than a sunscreen at that-</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon was much more affordable than the Drs. office.</li>
      <li>This beats out many for ease of application &amp; does not feel sticky, but I noticed after showering I still had zinc oxide residue on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My favorite sunscreen for my face.  </li>
      <li>you will look better afterward, and that&#x27;s what mattered more to me.</li>
      <li>If that bothers you, you could apply some foundation on top of</li>
      <li>all I can say is, as a user, I&#x27;d rate it an A+ for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>and it is very water resistant, which is great in the summer in Florida.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and I really love it.</li>
      <li>(My favorite had always been the sprays, but a)</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re both really satisfied, and I bought myself a bottle of their sunscreen too.</li>
      <li>I love the way it feels so light on my skin</li>
      <li>Goes on easy, easy to wear under makeup.  </li>
      <li>MD SolarSciences works very well on sensitive skin and gives excellent protection against sun damage.</li>
      <li>The item ships very quickly.</li>
      <li>I really searched for a good sunscreen and thought this would fit the bill.</li>
      <li>It is, by far, that best product I have ever used for myself or for my son, and all three of my dermatologists highly recommend it...</li>
      <li>It goes on silky smooth and is easily rubbed in to coat the skin thoroughly and evenly.</li>
      <li>(any of them is fine.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky smooth it was and that it didn&#x27;t cause my face to break out at all.  </li>
      <li>It is so smooth and does not feel greasy.</li>
      <li>Great for kids, since there&#x27;s no long battle smearing it on - quick and painless.</li>
      <li>It is rated excellent and safe for children and adults by an independent sunscreen test site, and it is the only one he will allow me to apply to his face without a fight.</li>
      <li>What has worked is to apply about 30 minutes before leaving the house so it has time to settle in, apply makeup on top, or mix with lotion first.</li>
      <li>I liked it and use the new version.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>I bought this sunscreen based on the reviews (as well as the reviews of about 25 other products) and was initially 100% pleased and very impressed.  </li>
      <li>I like to apply a lot of sunscreen for adequate protection.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and fast, which is important when applying it to squirmy kids.</li>
      <li>I have had melanoma, and the dermatologist tells me that my 3 1/2-year-old son is more likely to  develop this condition, so I have searched for a product that I can wear and feel safe applying to his skin.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve tried many things on the market for my 4-year-old son&#x27;s sensitive, eczema-prone skin.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>Initially it felt kinda nice on the skin.</li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>used a chemical sunscreen first</li>
      <li>I first started using MD Solar Science products at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>It does leave a slight white-ish finish but still much better than most natural sunscreens that leaves you looking like a ghost, and it&#x27;s matted.</li>
      <li>Hunting for a good physical block that can be used daily is a chore!</li>
      <li>this REALLY</li>
      <li>Second, it is just as silky smooth as the mineral screen gel I used on my face.  </li>
      <li>He hates the scent of regular sunscreen, so I figured a fragrance-free would fit.</li>
      <li>I have tried numerous sunscreens, and this one is my favorite thus far.</li>
      <li>Mineral sunscreen that&#x27;s light, easy to apply, and leaves minimal white tint.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if there is a healthy sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t show or leave residue, but I may try the gel of this formula that has evidently been discontinued like this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>so I had high hopes for this product based on reviews I had read, and the list of ingredients.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s also quite prone to acne and sunburn, so we have to be really picky when it comes to sunscreen because we don&#x27;t want to irritate his already sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Plus, no cold aerosol feeling, which was a definite</li>
      <li>I have mild rosacea and extra sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth and NOT sticky to the touch like some other sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it was new.</li>
      <li>It was supposed to be new</li>
      <li>My esthetician recommended the mineral based sunscreen because I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Just remember to shake before using especially the first time.</li>
      <li>tend to be too dry, but this was creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;There is a white sheen to it.  </li>
      <li>and alack, my extra sensitive skin does not seem to like this product much.  </li>
      <li>and I would rather have it be a clear color.  </li>
      <li>It has too much liquid on it and a short expiration date.</li>
      <li>I use it on my face and it works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I had no problems with skin reaction to this product, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>offers</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s really a way to blend it in better, because the \\&quot;white face\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t even show up until later.</li>
      <li>Sun screen is important if you want to play hard out there.  </li>
      <li>and I have had a few skin cancer scares so the price is worth it to me.</li>
      <li>High SPF, slides on and sinks in without whiteness.  </li>
      <li>What it DOES include, however, is a smart little UV-detector card, like a sort of surprise in the package.</li>
      <li>This product is not thick like other sunblock.</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on very smooth and it doesn&#x27;t make my olive skin look ghostly or weird.  </li>
      <li>First, a little goes a long way.  </li>

    <li> Hunting for a good physical block that can be used daily is a chore! This beats out many for ease of application &amp; does not feel sticky, but I noticed after showering I still had zinc oxide residue on my skin.  I&#x27;m not sure if there is a healthy sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t show or leave residue, but I may try the gel of this formula that has evidently been discontinued like this product.</li>
    <li> I use this under my makeup or with no makeup at all.  It is creamy but not sticky or shiny.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes Just remember to shake before using especially the first time.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended the mineral based sunscreen because I have very sensitive skin and I really love it. It feels really nice on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave and oily film at all.</li>
    <li> I first started using MD Solar Science products at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  I started by buying the mineral screen gel (the yellow bottle) and using it on my face.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how silky smooth it was and that it didn&#x27;t cause my face to break out at all.  I hestitated to buy the mineral screen lotion as a body lotion because the tube looked small for the price and I always hate having to rub creams in instead of using a sunscreen spray.  But I decided to take the leap and buy the mineral screen lotion.  I am so happy I did!  First, a little goes a long way.  After a week vacation and using the lotion on me and my kids, I still did not run out of it.  Second, it is just as silky smooth as the mineral screen gel I used on my face.  (In fact, one day of vacation, I only brought the lotion with me and not the gel, and used the lotion on my face...it blended in nicely and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts).  My kids loved the way it rubbed in and didn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky like they feel when I use sprays on them.  Plus, no cold aerosol feeling, which was a definite plus so I didn&#x27;t have to hear my kids complain!  This sunscreen is amazing!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried many things on the market for my 4-year-old son&#x27;s sensitive, eczema-prone skin. Everything caused an itchy reaction - except this. Best part is that it glides on and dissolves almost instantaneously; does not make you look blanched out; and works. My son has an outdoor camp and a very fair complexion and we&#x27;ve had no sunburns using this product.  Great for kids, since there&#x27;s no long battle smearing it on - quick and painless. No smell either. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It is so smooth and does not feel greasy. I use it everyday under my makeup.</li>
    <li> My husband has skin cancer and has places treated on his face often.  His dermatologist suggested using Solar Sciences but it&#x27;s expensive if you buy it from her office.  This stuff works great and doesn&#x27;t wash off like some popular lotions...even after sweating or swimming.  The price on Amazon was much more affordable than the Drs. office.</li>
    <li> I have had melanoma, and the dermatologist tells me that my 3 1/2-year-old son is more likely to  develop this condition, so I have searched for a product that I can wear and feel safe applying to his skin. It is rated excellent and safe for children and adults by an independent sunscreen test site, and it is the only one he will allow me to apply to his face without a fight. It never dries his delicate skin, it lasts for hours, and it only requires that I use a small pea-sized drop for his face. It goes on silky smooth and is easily rubbed in to coat the skin thoroughly and evenly. It is not a bit greasy, nor does it contain nasty perfumes. It is, by far, that best product I have ever used for myself or for my son, and all three of my dermatologists highly recommend it... all I can say is, as a user, I&#x27;d rate it an A+ for sure. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This works well but is to thick and creamy.  It just sits in the skin and I would rather have it be a clear color.  I think I will go back to Elta sunscreen.</li>
    <li> MD SolarSciences works very well on sensitive skin and gives excellent protection against sun damage. It&#x27;s one of the best you can buy.</li>
    <li> Bought MD SolarSciences SPF 40 broad-spectrum sunscreen for my 16 yr-old son. He hates the scent of regular sunscreen, so I figured a fragrance-free would fit. He&#x27;s also quite prone to acne and sunburn, so we have to be really picky when it comes to sunscreen because we don&#x27;t want to irritate his already sensitive skin. I did my research online about broad-spectrum mineral sunscreen (which protect the skin from UVB and UVA radiation) and compared prices and safety information. Finally I chose this one. We&#x27;re both really satisfied, and I bought myself a bottle of their sunscreen too. If I could, the one thing that I would change is the availability for online sale...as I&#x27;ve noticed only select sites carry this brand. (That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5).     Overall, I think I&#x27;m going to stick with this brand from now.     :)</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this brand. Tried this one and another sunscreen. Both with disappointing results. Initially it felt kinda nice on the skin. Hours later pilling and peeling, drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company a few months ago to see if they had any suggestions. No answer. Disappointed in the company for their lack of professionalism to respond and in the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;It might work for oily skin as it will dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be new but I could tell it was missing some product.&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t think it was new.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  Very smooth, non greasy and great coverage.  I would recommend as a total body sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Found this sunscreen by looking through the EWG.or website for sport sunscreen w/o toxic crap.  This stuff goes on very smooth and it doesn&#x27;t make my olive skin look ghostly or weird.  I run -and sweat- a lot and i&#x27;m pleased that it still stays transparent/lucent when i&#x27;m sweaty.  No fragrance - thank god- and neat texture.  Amazon is the only place i can find to buy it and w/free shipping it makes sense.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous sunscreens, and this one is my favorite thus far. It&#x27;s not as thick as other physical blockers and not as greasy. A little goes a long way. I had no problems with skin reaction to this product, and I have sensitive skin. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The application on your skin says enough about MD SolarSciences SPF 40 Mineral Screen Lotion.    For years I&#x27;ve sold my soul to sunscreens that felt like I was coating my skin with white wall paint: sticky, stinky and oily.    This product is odorless, feels like a facial lotion on your body. I&#x27;m thinking \\&quot;Is this REALLY sunscreen?\\&quot;    But yes- it is! and MORE than a sunscreen at that- offers UVA/UVB broad spectrum sun protection, is 100% green, and doesn&#x27;t include nasty oils. What it DOES include, however, is a smart little UV-detector card, like a sort of surprise in the package. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sunblock I have ever used. You cannot tell you have it on. It does not feel greasy at all.  A little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really light on your skin and does a great job. I use it on my face and it works well for my sensitive skin. Would totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I wear this sunblock every day on my face &amp; chest. the texture is amazing &amp; is a fantastic sunblock.</li>
    <li> Being brown-skinned, using mineral sunblock can be difficult because of the white cast. I like to apply a lot of sunscreen for adequate protection. If I do that with this, I look like a ghost. What has worked is to apply about 30 minutes before leaving the house so it has time to settle in, apply makeup on top, or mix with lotion first. I like that it does seem resistant to water and sweating, but I&#x27;ll keep searching for my perfect mineral sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have mild rosacea and extra sensitive skin so I had high hopes for this product based on reviews I had read, and the list of ingredients.  Alas and alack, my extra sensitive skin does not seem to like this product much.  For one, the product is exceptionally emollient to the point of being greasy.  It also visibly reddened my face and throat.  I have had issues with titanium dioxide in the past, so it may be the culprit in this case as well, but without really knowing, all I can do is toss this in the &amp;#34;oh, well&amp;#34; pile.  Bottom line:  this might not be the best choice for you if your skin is very sensitive, or if you, like me, have rosacea.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy, easy to wear under makeup.  No breakouts or rashes from this sun screen.  Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen for my face.  High SPF, slides on and sinks in without whiteness.  Also rated very safe!  This is a keeper, I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is very good for legs and arms.  It is to thin to use around face and eyes. I have been using it for over one year now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth and NOT sticky to the touch like some other sunscreens. It does leave a slight white-ish finish but still much better than most natural sunscreens that leaves you looking like a ghost, and it&#x27;s matted. I just wish it cost less since I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen based on the reviews (as well as the reviews of about 25 other products) and was initially 100% pleased and very impressed.  It goes on smooth and fast, which is important when applying it to squirmy kids. (My favorite had always been the sprays, but a) my kids still seemed to burn occasionally and b) I still needed something for the face.) This stuff feels like silk! Unfortunately, I&#x27;m bumping a star because apparently, some time *after* application, a white film appears on the skin.  I hadn&#x27;t realized, and then I went to pick up my daughter from school and was quite startled by her face! And this has continued to happen. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s really a way to blend it in better, because the \\&quot;white face\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t even show up until later. I wonder if the gel makes any difference?</li>
    <li> My doctor wanted me to use this product but charges nearly double what I can get it for from this seller.  I love the way it feels so light on my skin and it is very water resistant, which is great in the summer in Florida.  I have ordered this several times and will continue to do so.  The item ships very quickly.</li>
    <li> Sun screen is important if you want to play hard out there.  Shop and compare but, product wise this is good stuff.</li>
    <li> Effective, safe and not greasy. Love this sunscreen. It is quite pricey but it is the best I&#x27;ve used and I have had a few skin cancer scares so the price is worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I liked it and use the new version.</li>
    <li> This product is not thick like other sunblock. It has too much liquid on it and a short expiration date. I ordered and sent it oversea so did not have a chance to return</li>
    <li> It was disconcerting to find that the mineral screen lotion contained aluminum.  I will not use any product that contains aluminum. Manufacturers need to listen to their consumers. This was money wasted.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I broke out all over from with product. I really searched for a good sunscreen and thought this would fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I like titanium dioxide in sunscreens.  I think that&#x27;s most effective to block the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get freckles in the sun.  I found that with a big hat and this sunscreen, I didn&#x27;t get freckles after a week in the Bahamas.&lt;br /&gt;I used a chemical sunscreen first (any of them is fine.  I used EltaMD UV sport), and then the titanium dioxide sunscreen on top.&lt;br /&gt;And I did reapply the titanium sunscreen over and over again while playing golf...  once every 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of MD SolarSciences sunscreen is smoother than some other titanium sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;Some tend to be too dry, but this was creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;There is a white sheen to it.  If that bothers you, you could apply some foundation on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;It does make you look a little white while in the sun, but you will look better afterward, and that&#x27;s what mattered more to me.</li>
    <li> Mineral sunscreen that&#x27;s light, easy to apply, and leaves minimal white tint. A bit pricey, but worth it. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
