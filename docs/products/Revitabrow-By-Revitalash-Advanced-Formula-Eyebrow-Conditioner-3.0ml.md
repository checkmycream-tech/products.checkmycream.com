<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> works great!  fills in sparse eyebrows after about a month.</li>
    <li> It works! Helps grow my brows. I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT , I DON&#x27;T USE IT. MY WIFE DOES.</li>
    <li> Amazing for eyebrow hair regrowth. I</li>
    <li> Still waiting for my skimpy eyebrows to fill in.  This is my second attempt.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube.  I am a little disappointed that my eyebrows aren&#x27;t really getting darker.  But it does help some at least better than they were to begin with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing results after 4 weeks...gonna use the whole supply and see if anything happens. Just not impressed, as of yet.</li>
    <li> I actually use this on both my eyebrows and eyelashes. What it&#x27;s done to my eyelashes is phenomenally amazing and awesome. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments because it&#x27;s that noticeable and I&#x27;m extremely happy because it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. I curl and use waterproof mascara on my lashes every day so I&#x27;ve experienced some loss here and there. With Revitalash and brow, my lashes have gotten thicker and doubled in length. I seriously didn&#x27;t think it would get this long but it did. Sometimes my eyes are yellowish/brown from the usage but not consistently every day. It may just occur when I accidentally get some in my eyes. Great product without any side effects like Latisse. That irritated my eyes and left them extremely red every single day. I highly recommend revitalash and brow over any other product.</li>
    <li> I applied this product per the instructions every day. There was absolutely no benefit to using this product and it ran out after a few weeks</li>
    <li> Love this product...makes my thinning brows look lush and natural</li>
    <li> Fabulous! I barely had any eyebrows until I started using this product. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before, love it and it works!</li>
    <li> Been pretty consistent with nighttime use for almost a month but have not seen brow growth as yet.</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t much in the tube. It&#x27;s practically dry already.</li>
    <li> I am losing the hair on my eyebrows because of medication I have been taking for thyroid. This product was highly recommended. I read the reviews. One woman, who was also losing hair due to thyroid medication, said it worked for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for a month now. I do not see any changes. It has been a disappointment. I really wanted it to work. I feel like I threw my money away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give the company the benefit of the doubt, I did buy this product on Amazon, and it was through a secondary seller. Not from the original vendor. I don&#x27;t know if that had anything to do with it.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve had very sparse eyebrows with several bald patches my entire life due to genetics, and I&#x27;m addicted to this product! Works wonders for me!</li>
    <li> Honestly works as does the RevitaLash.</li>
    <li> Excellent. This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> This product definitely works for growing in eyebrows! Apply it daily and works right away. Great results!</li>
    <li> I am a 61 year old woman who began losing her eyebrows about 20 years ago, and thought I would have to use an eyebrow pencil for the rest of my life.  My daughter told me about this product after hearing Lena Dunham had used it.  I could not believe that after 8 weeks, my eyebrows indeed started to grow in!  My advice is to keep with it and don&#x27;t give up; you will see results!  This product really works!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell.  Don&#x27;t know if it works though.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Worked for me, and I am still very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are darker, and thicker.  I am  very pleased</li>
    <li> After two weeks the product appears to be working.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it really &amp; truly grows hair - my brows are so much thicker!!!</li>
    <li> I really like it and it works</li>
    <li> Works better than the 4 other ones I tried. You need to apply twice a day instead of once a day and be patient.</li>
    <li> I think it darkens the eyebrows more than make them grow</li>
    <li> The tube was completely bone dry !!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Seller was prompt.  thanks.</li>
    <li> I think the Revitabrow that I purchased must have been quite old.  It dried up within about six weeks whereas Revitabrow that I purchased from a salon lasted about four months.  Didn&#x27;t really end up saving any money at all!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my esthetician.  I have used it now for over a year and I have eyebrows  once again!  I had used a different product line and it didn&#x27;t work.  I honestly have been incredibly surprised that my eyebrows grew back.  I don&#x27;t need to use an eyebrow pencil or brow mascara to make &amp;#34;eyebrows&amp;#34;  I highly recommend this product even though it is very expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on the first tube and I actually see some new growth.  Since  I&#x27;ve used Lumigan for glaucoma and had the happy side effect of darker and longer eye lashes,  I&#x27;ve given Revitabrow a shot.  So far so good, fingers still crossed.</li>
