      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>Not only do my hands feel wonderful</li>
      <li>If I put lotion on hands and cover with liner intended for use with paraffin wax baths, I feels a lot better.  </li>
      <li>I have enjoyed my mitts</li>
      <li>The package came on time and my friend is enjoying the &amp;#34; spa treatment&amp;#34; in her home.</li>
      <li>Love having these at my home.</li>
      <li>LOVE THESE...</li>
      <li>Love this product..</li>
      <li>We all love them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Slather on some good lotion, stick your hands in plastic bags (large ziplocs work fine) and relax for 10 minutes!</li>
      <li>This helps wonderfully after long day doing hair.</li>
      <li>This product is worth every penny!!  </li>
      <li>I own a plant nursery and there is tremendous stress on my arthritic hands from watering, potting, shoveling, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Helps keep my hands soft and is a great asset to my healthy nail journey.</li>
      <li>she uses them on the lowest setting and finds them very comfortable; the higher settings were uncomfortably warm for her.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, there is a design issue; you cannot easily get them off if you put both Mitts on.</li>
      <li>, they look like a 20-year-old, well maybe a 40-year-old, especially with my beautiful nails which I do every 2-3 weeks with [[ASIN:B00KGLKYA4</li>
      <li>I think they would be fine</li>
      <li>Mine heat up quickly, within 60 seconds at the most.</li>
      <li>I did not find that to be accurate in the warmers I purchased.</li>
      <li>Appear a bit cheap.  </li>
      <li>but, we wear light gloves before placing hands inside.</li>
      <li>Look these heat packs, they work fantastic when my hands and swollen and aching with the change of seasons and my RA.</li>
      <li>However, they get VERY HOT very quickly.  </li>
      <li>These gloves are worth their weight in gold!</li>
      <li>I lean back on my recliner sofa, watch some good TV and enjoy my spa for 20-30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>These heating pads are quick and with a couple of disposable plastic gloves and some really rich hand cream, the set up turns into a beauty spa for the hands, too.</li>
      <li>The alternative method required 12 hours to setup the wax bath and 12 hours for it to cool sufficiently for travel.</li>
      <li>Hands don&#x27;t feel very good surrounded by stiff plastic.  </li>
      <li>Great heat levels and a true blessing for anyone with Raynaud&#x27;s Syndrome or any other circulatory problems of the hand.</li>
      <li>Lotion seems to sink in quickly and the arthritis responds to the heat.</li>
      <li>These get wonderfully hot, not sure they do anything for beauty, but they are wonderful for wrist surgery aftercare.</li>
      <li>I most highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Gets very hot.</li>
      <li>The mitts are a snug fit for a large man&#x27;s hands.  </li>
      <li>I use 2 plastic bags to put coconut oil or hand lotion in and use the mitts for 10 or 20 minutes depending on how much time I have available.</li>
      <li>I had an old pair from many years ago</li>
      <li>You have to make the time to sit with the mitts on for a 20-30 mins, the results are worth it.</li>
      <li>We decided that a regular heating pad that comes with a fabric cover is more comfortable and does not get too hot to the touch.  </li>
      <li>Since the price was right around $20, I hope to get a couple years use before needing replacement.</li>
      <li>Item exactly as described and super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and just like all of the reviews have posted.</li>
      <li>However, the fingertips get way too hot and almost burned him, even at the lowest setting.  </li>
      <li>Do not set it for the high setting!!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed for a do it yourself manicure.</li>
      <li>If you move your hands to the edge where it&#x27;s warmer, it&#x27;s so hot you will be burned.  </li>
      <li>She said they were comfortable and liked how they were long enough to cover her wrists and seemed to help her arthritis, but she said they got too hot, so she wraps her hands in hand towels before using now.</li>
      <li>For those of you who also have arthritis you will understand my frustration in not being able to open a jar or wring out a wash cloth, the simple and easy things we&#x27;ve always taken for granted.  </li>
      <li>Much too hot for my hands.</li>
      <li>I tried them and also felt that the fingertips were much too hot.  </li>
      <li>I turn mine on before brushing my teeth, so it&#x27;s ready to go when I get in bed.</li>
      <li>These absolutely save my hands.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I really like it yet, because I have to order</li>
      <li>They have really helped the pain, but I wish Conair would make a model with washable terry cloth inserts.</li>
      <li>I had carpal tunnel surgery and was really in a lot of pain while healing.  </li>
      <li>I have Heberden&#x27;s nodes that really respond well to heat.</li>
      <li>It takes some time to learn the ins and outs, such as proper wiggling or compression to get the right heat, but for it&#x27;s price, that&#x27;s a worthwhile trade off one</li>
      <li>Bath and Body Works true blue spa Look Ma new hands and</li>
      <li>Even at lowest setting (low, med, high), it feels very HOT.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Even at lowest setting (low, med, high), it feels very HOT. Not safe for kids, and adult needs to use it with care. In my opinion, there is a design issue; you cannot easily get them off if you put both Mitts on. Adding the &amp;#34;too hot&amp;#34; trouble, that is an issue.</li>
    <li> I bought these mitts for the pain and swelling in my hands from rheumatoid arthritis. They deliver a lot of heat on two settings. The only down side is that they are entirely plastic and you need to wear cotton mittens to avoid sweaty hands. This is a minor inconvenience, though. They have really helped the pain, but I wish Conair would make a model with washable terry cloth inserts.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband who has arthritis in his hands.  The warmth does help reduce the arthritis pain.  However, the fingertips get way too hot and almost burned him, even at the lowest setting.  I tried them and also felt that the fingertips were much too hot.  Also, the material is plastic and has no fabric cover on the inside or outside.  This makes the gloves feel uncomfortable and the plastic seems to get very hot to the touch at the fingertips.  We decided that a regular heating pad that comes with a fabric cover is more comfortable and does not get too hot to the touch.  After trying these gloves a few times we returned them.</li>
    <li> got these for my elderly mother who suffers from poor circulation and was miserable this winter.  now when I call her she won&#x27;t answer the phone because she doesn&#x27;t want to take these off!  At least that&#x27;s what she tells me......she uses them on the lowest setting and finds them very comfortable; the higher settings were uncomfortably warm for her.  she seems very happy with her Mitts!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom whose hands are very stiff and sore from arthritis.  She loves them!  Every afternoon after lunch, she sits and watches TV with her hands in the mitts.  It&#x27;s brought her a lot of relief.</li>
    <li> Using it for arthritic hands.  Works Great.</li>
    <li> My friends &amp; family are loving them. I rub their hands up with coconut oil, wrap them in saran and a wash cloth and pop them in the mitts while I give them a facial. They love how great their hands feel.</li>
    <li> This has been helpful for relieving the pain in my hands and wrists from acute arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome. Plus as a bonus I add lotion on my hands and insert them in the Pro Cozie Liners (sold on Amazon) before putting them in the mitts and get a spa moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Mother in law loved it</li>
    <li> Perfect for tired, achy hard working hands!</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described and super fast shipping. Look these heat packs, they work fantastic when my hands and swollen and aching with the change of seasons and my RA.</li>
    <li> All I hoped they would be . I have used them with Pariffin Gel to hydrate nails</li>
    <li> This heating pad pair works very well when my hands are painful. I have Heberden&#x27;s nodes that really respond well to heat. The hot wax method is expensive to keep heated and when needed, unavailable for an hour or more if not continuously heated.  These heating pads are quick and with a couple of disposable plastic gloves and some really rich hand cream, the set up turns into a beauty spa for the hands, too.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for Arthritic hands. Put pain lotion on, cover with baggies, and slip into the mitt&#x27;s. I wish they were longer, to cover up to the elbow, for carpal tunnel issues.</li>
    <li> Wow!!  This product is worth every penny!!  Have also bought and gifted 2 more- enjoying, too!  If you want to help increase circulation, highly recommend- but, we wear light gloves before placing hands inside. If you know somebody older, with arthritis, carpel tunnel, just cold hands...I&#x27;d give this a try-</li>
    <li> Kinda awkward to use.  And not quite the item I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Got them for a grandparent to keep hands warm. They use them all the time.</li>
    <li> Works great on wife&#x27;s hands. Hair dresser for over 20 years, hands giving out. This helps wonderfully after long day doing hair.</li>
    <li> My hands are horribly dry year round, to the point where if I don&#x27;t watch it I wind up with bleeding cracks. These gloves are the only thing that seems to help when my hands have gone South and are in need of some immediate relief. The fact that they feel wonderful is just an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband who suffered a traumatic hand injury and required 6 months of 4-5x/day therapy with massage and exercise.  Heat helped to relieve stiffness in his hand, so we hoped this would be what we needed.  However, the material is like plastic (very sticky, not easy to slide hand in and out) also was not large enough for a mans XL hand.  DISAPPOINTED!  Returned.</li>
    <li> Great product for cold hands caused by Raynauds</li>
    <li> The mitts do keep your hands warm. But be careful not to fall asleep with the highest temp on. The mitts get really hard and could easily burn someone&#x27;s hands</li>
    <li> I can see why some people claim it&#x27;s too hot and some not hot enough. The areas on the center are not very even while the sides are scalding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who use this product as is, will probably not think it&#x27;s very good. It takes some time to learn the ins and outs, such as proper wiggling or compression to get the right heat, but for it&#x27;s price, that&#x27;s a worthwhile trade off one learns after multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of advice, heed the package warnings and, it&#x27;s meant to be used with both hands at the same time. If you use it on a single hand, you may want to put a roll up towel into the other one. Otherwise it might break down from over heating. The design is sadly not very well tested .</li>
    <li> My wife likes them and they give her hands relief.</li>
    <li> Love having these at my home. Now I can moisturizer my hands and cuticles without going to a salon. It also helps by easing arthritis pains in my hands.</li>
    <li> Only had for one week but  PERFECT for a pampered manicure.  I have tough cuticles and hate soaking with fingers but with this I can put on hand cream and deep moisturize my hands while softening my cuticles!</li>
    <li> Works great for arthritis relief.</li>
    <li> Bought these electric heated Mitts for my wife who suffers from arthritis of both hands. Ordinarily she uses a wax bath at home to deliver the deep warmth required to ease her pain; but, when we travel it is too much hassle to bring the complete wax bath. This appliance takes up about a tenth of the space, can be packed in a suitcase instead of two boxes the size of large breadboxes and provides her with immediate consistent heat upon demand for as long as needed. The alternative method required 12 hours to setup the wax bath and 12 hours for it to cool sufficiently for travel. My only concern is the durability of this item. Since the price was right around $20, I hope to get a couple years use before needing replacement. Even if it lasts only a year, it will be money well spent.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE...where have they been all my life. Good for arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 for Christmas, 1 for my and 1 for my Mom and 1 for my step-mom. We all love them. Helps in the winter with dry chapped/ cracked hands. I used it in bed at night watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slather on some good lotion, stick your hands in plastic bags (large ziplocs work fine) and relax for 10 minutes! it does take about 5 minutes to heat up. I turn mine on before brushing my teeth, so it&#x27;s ready to go when I get in bed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product keeps hands warm and helps with my arthritis</li>
    <li> Works like it should. Gets hot and great to use during a paraffin treatment. Will buy for my grandma to help elevated some of her arthritis pain with the heat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech. These work great for removing gel polish!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my mom. She said they were comfortable and liked how they were long enough to cover her wrists and seemed to help her arthritis, but she said they got too hot, so she wraps her hands in hand towels before using now. If you&#x27;re sensitive to heat, I recommend a heavy pair of cotton gloves before using.</li>
    <li> nice and comfy, use it twice a week and you will see the results</li>
    <li> These absolutely save my hands. I own a plant nursery and there is tremendous stress on my arthritic hands from watering, potting, shoveling, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I deal with dirt, cold water, and stiffness in joints.  Forget about keeping my nails looking nice BEFORE I bought these gloves. Every evening after dinner I put cream on my hands, put my hands inside plastic bags (separate purchase) and sit for 15 minutes in the relaxing warmth of these gloves.  I cannot describe how good it makes my hands feel. Unbelievable!  There is an absolute noticeable difference in the flexibility of my hands when waking in the morning, and noticeably less swelling in the joints.  These gloves are worth their weight in gold!</li>
    <li> Appear a bit cheap.  Hands don&#x27;t feel very good surrounded by stiff plastic.  If I put lotion on hands and cover with liner intended for use with paraffin wax baths, I feels a lot better.  I need to put a pillow over them when using on my hands.  Without slight pressure, the heat doesn&#x27;t seem to be there.  It does have 3 different heat settings.  If I don&#x27;t cover with pillow, I have to use high.</li>
    <li> Oh My, What a relief it is for. arthritis stricken hands</li>
    <li> I returned these because on low they were to hot to handle let alone put my hands in.&lt;br /&gt;Even after a few minutes, they became burning hot</li>
    <li> Love this product.. Helps keep my hands soft and is a great asset to my healthy nail journey.</li>
    <li> Love these I use them with Bath and Body Works true blue spa Look Ma new hands and my hands feel wonderful afterwoods. I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and these help with the pain. I will be purchasing the ones for feet before the fall</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these mittens!!!!! Bought them to use as I have severe Raynauds.  They arrived sooner than predicted.  They are softer than the previous hand warmers which I love as my hands have several infected cuts and hurt constantly. I read a comment in a review that they took long to heat up.  I did not find that to be accurate in the warmers I purchased. Mine heat up quickly, within 60 seconds at the most. I highly recommend this seller great prompt service and great product.</li>
    <li> I have arthritis in my hands. these are comforting. I f they had a built in massage program,  I would be grateful.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and just like all of the reviews have posted. Great heat levels and a true blessing for anyone with Raynaud&#x27;s Syndrome or any other circulatory problems of the hand.</li>
    <li> This product is just like mitts used for a manicure.  My husband used it on his feet when they were cold.</li>
    <li> The only problem with it was no booklet telling me how to use it.  Finally worked out how to use them and they work great!</li>
    <li> Im a musician and these help to warm my hands up when its cold.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just as described! No complaints!</li>
    <li> for my wife who always has cold hands and feet. She loves it, but not the plastic feel inside.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for a do it yourself manicure. I actually avoid getting my manicures professionally done now as they don&#x27;t last very long for the price you pay. So weekly instead of spending the small amount for a basic manicure I take the time to do my own. These mitts are great from the health of my nails. I use 2 plastic bags to put coconut oil or hand lotion in and use the mitts for 10 or 20 minutes depending on how much time I have available.</li>
    <li> These mitts get very, very hot around the edges, and only lukewarm in the middle where your hands should be.  If you move your hands to the edge where it&#x27;s warmer, it&#x27;s so hot you will be burned.  I didn&#x27;t blister, but the side of my hand was still red the next morning (I used them at 9 in the evening).  I do not know if mine are defective or not.  I plan on returning them and trying another brand.  If you are buying them for young girl, I suggest trying them out yourself before giving them to her.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother as a Christmas gift. She loves the smooth skin she gets but also has found relief from winter arthritis in using them!</li>
    <li> These mitts heat up quickly and feel great on my hands.  However, they get VERY HOT very quickly.  I keep them set on low.  Would not recommend these for someone who is diabetic!!</li>
    <li> These get plenty warm. Lotion seems to sink in quickly and the arthritis responds to the heat.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the mitts!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I really like it yet, because I have to order/buy &#x27;hand liners&#x27; to use with this.  I don&#x27;t think I saw that instruction before I bought this, but upon reading the instructions, it says to put a hand liner on before useing.</li>
    <li> These are horrible! Uneven heating and can burn hands. If you put on cotton gloves underneath so you won&#x27;t burn hands the heat doesn&#x27;t reach your hands. Such a disappointment .</li>
    <li> It does the job the product says it will. What is hard is using this regularly. You have to make the time to sit with the mitts on for a 20-30 mins, the results are worth it. But patience is a commodity I could buy. I wish I could work or read wearing these, then I would give it a 5.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would be nice is if the cord was a little longer.</li>
    <li> I had carpal tunnel surgery and was really in a lot of pain while healing.  These work great at easing the pain, and with easing arthritis pain in my hands.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> These get wonderfully hot, not sure they do anything for beauty, but they are wonderful for wrist surgery aftercare. I also use them to take the winter chill off from Raynaud&#x27;s syndrome.</li>
    <li> GREAT for my arthritic hands.  Such a comfort!</li>
    <li> I purchased the mitts to help with the stiffness in my thumb from arthritis with the combination of the Rejuvenation Hand kit heating joints before using balls it is helping. Only one suggestion I would make the mitts a little larger as they just fit my hands or make the mitts in different sizes</li>
    <li> Much too hot for my hands. Even on the lowest setting.</li>
    <li> I discovered that I have a symmetric form of arthritis in my hands and wrists a few months ago and even though I take medication, it will never be cured. For those of you who also have arthritis you will understand my frustration in not being able to open a jar or wring out a wash cloth, the simple and easy things we&#x27;ve always taken for granted.  My greatest gift to myself EVER has been the Beauty Mitts.  Just like the spas use, I purchased a box of 100 store brand gallon size plastic bags for $2.88.  I slathered my hands in my favorite heavy cream [[ASIN:B000A6ZOHI Horseman&#x27;s Dream Vet Cream 16 ounce]], put the plastic bags over my hands and turned the heat setting to high and slide my hands into the mitts.  Heavenly!  I lean back on my recliner sofa, watch some good TV and enjoy my spa for 20-30 minutes.  Not only do my hands feel wonderful, they look like a 20-year-old, well maybe a 40-year-old, especially with my beautiful nails which I do every 2-3 weeks with [[ASIN:B00KGLKYA4 Set of 2 Pink Armor Nail Growth Formula Treatments, 0.50 Fluid Ounce]].  My hands look and feel divine.  I am only sorry I didn&#x27;t discover these Beauty Mitts much sooner.  I most highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Gave to a friend who loves it</li>
    <li> With Reynaud syndrome, my fingers often feel frozen. That&#x27;s the reason for the purchase. These heated mitts are wonderful. An added advantage is the softening of my hands by following the directions for Beauty Mitts.</li>
    <li> Gets very hot. I love them.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed my mitts so I bought some for a friend.  The package came on time and my friend is enjoying the &amp;#34; spa treatment&amp;#34; in her home.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife who has horrible arthritis in her hands. The heat works wonders for the pain.</li>
    <li> Heats well, would have like softer cover.</li>
    <li> Great for aching hands also!</li>
    <li> I think they would be fine but I got them for my husband and he would have liked them to have covers. So I sent them back.</li>
    <li> Do not set it for the high setting!!  You will burn your hands.  If you set it in low, the heat is sufficient enough for the job.  My hands did feel softer vs lotion, alone.</li>
    <li> Use these during facials and also as bed warmer.</li>
    <li> these are great, wish they came with the mitts, but I got some at the Dollar Store</li>
    <li> The mitts are a snug fit for a large man&#x27;s hands.  I had an old pair from many years ago that was a set for both hands and feet.  They were at least 3 inches wider.  My husband uses them for the arthritis in his hands.  Wish I could find a wider pair.</li>
