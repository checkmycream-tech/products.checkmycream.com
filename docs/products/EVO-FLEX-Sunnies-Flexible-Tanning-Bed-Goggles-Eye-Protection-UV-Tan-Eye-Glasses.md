<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wish I could have picked out the color as I received two purple...my least favorite color.&lt;br /&gt;My apologies if during the ordering process I missed the&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;choose color&#x27; option as I would have chosen pink and grey.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they arrived on time and are very nice quality, thank you!</li>
    <li> Worst pair ever! and they sent me an ugly color that&#x27;s not listed. Fell apart in tanning bed and when i tried to find for protection, my eyes fried. I had to go to the ER the next day and my vision has not returned fully. Have tried calling their support line and they yell at me in another language before hanging up. Cant believe this!</li>
    <li> Great. Exactly what was expected</li>
    <li> Great price and product came in. a carry case. Packaging and delivery service was perfect.</li>
    <li> They fit great! Very happy with my order</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured, work great, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, protects eyes, lovely colors, Pink is pretty. def would recommend....i wish at times i could see more thru the black peep holes, but its relaxing</li>
    <li> I have used different kinds of eye protection when tanning these are by far the most comfortable.</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about here.  They&#x27;re simply eye goggles for tanning and get the job done.  I didn&#x27;t have any light leaks.</li>
    <li> I bought these goggles to use the red light therapy machine at my gym.  They work well and cover my eyes the light is still very bright.  The only thing that annoyed me is the band is so thin and no matter how tight I tie the string they still come loose.</li>
    <li> better than the ones I had before, held up well</li>
    <li> Works great. Mine came with the string. I wish all things worked so well and cost so little.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work upon initial inspection. The string seems like it will break with just a couple of uses. Overall, a good product. Will consider repurchasing if the price point decreases.</li>
    <li> works just fine, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Has anyone ever received any color besides black?  Mine are black and no elastic band came with them. It would be nice to have color and an elastic band. But they do work.</li>
    <li> Happy they sent me the PINK Pair!!! They work perfectly, and I dont have to borrow the tanning salons.</li>
    <li> Darling little sunnies!  They are actually a very comfortable fit!  Perfect for protection!  Yes, just what i need!  Thank you for the incredible price!!</li>
    <li> If you tan a lot, I would pay a couple bucks more for a better pair of Goggles. These broke after one day, and thank you Amazon for taking them back.</li>
    <li> Only a wee bit too small for my eyes</li>
    <li> These are cheap, rather hard plastic glasses that sort of cuts into your skin, although not too uncomfortably.  The elastic ties are unable to hold several knots and will eventually unravel.  It would be better if the plastic was a little softer, so it would mold better on the face, and they use a different type of elastic tie.  Other than that, these do a decent job of keeping the light from blinding you.</li>
    <li> I would have preferred to choose the color.  I received 2 pair of purple (not my favorite color). But they serve the purpose I needed them for.</li>
    <li> I have used these each time that I have tanned and although I did get the purple one... It is one that no one else really sees but it does fit snug and definitely does it&#x27;s job. If you were to have to chose which one to buy, I would recommend that you buy this one.</li>
    <li> These do the job! I don&#x27;t use the strap, but they stay put just fine, and can even hold them with a &amp;#34;squint&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> used these on vacation - cannot use sunscreen near my eyes as it&#x27;s very annoying.  These little babies do the trick.</li>
    <li> These are as expected.</li>
    <li> These are fine as light blockers, I received a black one</li>
    <li> I dont want to tan my eyes!  Works as described</li>
    <li> the product exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> Ordered a confederate rebel flag.and I received a pow mia flag.what the he&#x27;ll guys.not even.close.</li>
    <li> Product is good but they put it in a case that&#x27;s too small for it and the case came broken.</li>
    <li> I like these they fit perfect I was just not happy that I couldn&#x27;t pick a color. I wanted pink..</li>
    <li> I  do not care for black but they had they would pick the color so  got into that one falls off.</li>
    <li> Lenses popped out of the glasses when bouncing around the gym bag - replaced with non-see through electricians tape lol. Buy many pair or treat these $2 beauties like fine china.</li>
    <li> I love these goggles. They are made of good material, durable, and nice feel when wearing them. I have no objections!!!</li>
    <li> We will never use these.  The plastic is hard and it digs into your eyeballs.  It leaves ugly red marks on your skin.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased if I knew they were one pair.</li>
    <li> So far, so good with these glasses. They are flexible so I seriously doubt they&#x27;ll break like the brittle plastic ones they are replacing.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Closing your eyes does not protect them while tanning. You need to wear sun glasses or these</li>
    <li> Not real comfortable! I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> I thought that they would be bigger...they squeeze my eyes a little. I know they are supposed to be smaller on your face but maybe I have big eyes or something...because they don&#x27;t fit well. They seem more like children&#x27;s tanning eye wear.</li>
    <li> I recommend them to all my friends that go to the gym. I don&#x27;t use them for tanning since I live in southern AZ but I do use them in the ultraviolet ray booth because they&#x27;re required but these are so tiny all I have to do is remove the string and with my eyes closed they stay put real well. They&#x27;re flexible, smooth, and inexpensive which makes me happy!</li>
    <li> These came just as described. They are just what I needed. I see no tanning light with them on! They fit my eyes perfect, the old sunnies just didnt cut it, they didnt form to my eyes at all. These work great!</li>
    <li> they are as describes. Little small for my big peepers but works :)</li>
    <li> Fits my eyes perfectly and came in a colour I like by chance. The bands come untied sometimes but it&#x27;s really easy to tie them back. The string is long so you can adjust it accordingly. When you close your eyes, no light is let through the goggles. They are tight around the eyes a little sometimes, but that&#x27;s to avoid getting tan lines on your eyes. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better at this price.</li>
    <li> I live in Seattle. Shipping took far too long. Product was good though.</li>
    <li> good quality, good price. just what I needed</li>
    <li> I have to keep adjusting them because these (the shape) dig into my eyes even if I loosen the string til they are about to fall off. But if laying still on your back, you can just rest them over your eyes.</li>
    <li> Good deal !!  The view from the lenses are not clear, but that&#x27;s what it is.  Thanks for Amazon for saving my time and money!</li>
    <li> Shipped quick, cheap &amp; works fine! Bought these be I started getting itchy eyelids from the cleaning solution they wash the goggles in! Not one issue now! FYI-there&#x27;s only one and you don&#x27;t let you pick the color.</li>
    <li> You may like the center arm I cut it off and it works great for me.  Stays on in the wind!</li>
    <li> I like the color choices that were available.  They fit good for the tanning booth.  I didn&#x27;t rate it as 5 stars because the elastic cord stretched out quite a bit quickly.  While it still worked, I had to tighten up the cord by tying a new knot in the string.  The price was very good though and would buy others if needed.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, and works well. Unfortunately I got the black ones since it was a random color, which was a bummer. I was hoping for the blue ones.</li>
    <li> I received the black one...love it.  Does just what it needs to.  I use a stand up tanning booth.</li>
    <li> String keeps falling off. But it&#x27;s great! I use em everyday in tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Works well for the few dollars it cost. I have never had any other tanning goggles, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. These work great though.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit  and good price.  Need to buy 3 other different  colors</li>
    <li> Good products. does as they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
    <li> Great seller.  Great price.  They&#x27;re small over my eyes but I have long eyelashes!  Otherwise, great product.</li>
    <li> High quality and very dark lenses. Will purchase additional pairs in the future.</li>
    <li> I received them just as promised and they were well made for the price.  Will buy another pair when I lose this set.  :)</li>
    <li> The gym that I work out in has a Total Body Enhancement unit and I love using it.  It&#x27;s better to have my own eye protection than to rent or purchase them at the gym.</li>
    <li> Works great! No lines</li>
    <li> Sunnies work fine, I dont use the strap because I tan in a lay down bed. Not a bad product. Descent price.</li>
    <li> Great!  I just thought that I was going to get three, but one is fine.  I still put a little cotton to cover the tinted seeing part, but it&#x27;s good to be able to remove it and see.  It covers the whole eye area very well.</li>
    <li> I love these, yet I didn&#x27;t get to choose what color I wanted and they took FOREVER to come in.</li>
    <li> Living here on the gulf coast, going to the beach is a pretty routine deal,  But finding a way to keep the sun out of your eyes is isn&#x27;t.  I got these so when I do lay out I can protect my eyes and not have the &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes that sun glasses give.</li>
    <li> I got a string w/ my glasses. They work just fine. I go in tanning beds where I stand and lay and I take off the string when I need to. I got the color purple and my roommate got black so it is totally random.</li>
    <li> they work ok although I felt they are uncomfortable.  I bought them to wear while using the Aurora Light Therapy System.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> These save your eyes in a tanning booth! Most salons will not let you use tanning booths without them. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Work fine and priced right with quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Only ine and lost that one.  Too expensive for only one.  Usually a dollar every where else.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money, came in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> These googles are as described. I ordered several pairs and they are all in good condition. A good value at the price offered.</li>
    <li> Nothing extraordinary, but did work.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly from seller. Great price for this product.</li>
    <li> I got the  Evo Flex flexible super sunnies tanning goggles to use with my Sirius SS-77 Aurora Light Therapy System. It works good and can be used for tanning as we&#x27;ll.</li>
    <li> these are very comfortable eye wear for tanning. the lenses are dark enough for your eye protection and also even helps you relax. i definitely recommend avid tanners to purchase this product if you want a pair of dark comfortable peepers to wear while tanning.</li>
    <li> Havent tried them yet but im sure they will work perfectly to protect my eyes and i love the color i got. purple is my favorite color.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that the order came with all of the goggles for the price. I bought my last pair for $1.00, wish I would have done that this time.</li>
    <li> My goggles were pink and very cute. They fit well and were good quality for the money. Overall a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use daily in the tanning bed. I was wanting some that were extremely flexible. These were not as much as I was wanting. However, the fit is great and the coverage on your face is minimal. The are perfect for tanning. These are actually better than the ones that I used at the tanning salon. I received the pink ones and the color is exactly as pictured.</li>
    <li> These really aren&#x27;t all that bad. I like that the cord doesn&#x27;t come already attached. These showed up on my way out the door to tan, so it was nice to not have to fuss with is. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about these is the bar across the nose. It&#x27;s thick, and it left a line on my nose after one session. I&#x27;ll probably fix that somehow, or order different ones. The best part of these was that the lenses are darker than other goggles I&#x27;ve used. I have light sensitive eyes, so that was nice. But the bar across the nose really bugs me.</li>
    <li> Theses goggles protect my eyes well from Sirius SS-77 Aurora Light Therapy System, but cut into the area around my eyes a bit.</li>
    <li> Item was exactly what i needed and for an awesome price! Wish it was one of the fun colors, but it&#x27;s not like any one sees me in the tanning bed anyway. Would def recommend.</li>
    <li> They block out the harmful light and protect your eyes. They feel weird at first and then you get use to them.</li>
    <li> Standard tanning goggles. Like I expected</li>
    <li> I ordered these to use under the light mask and they are the most uncomfortable goggles ever. I tried to use without the cord while laying down and they kept falling off because they are too top heavy and then I tried to use with the cord and they dug into my eye sockets. I guess they have to be small to not  get those raccoon eyes, but I have had other ones that are flatter and more comfortable. I would send back, but the cost of returns is not worth it. I also ordered two and got two pink instead of two different! My least favorite color. There needs to be a way to choose color instead of just sending anything.</li>
    <li> :Poorly constructed, elastic is too short and the cups dig into the eyes.  No Bueno!  (No Good!)  I pitched them as they were useless.</li>
    <li> Great tanning goggles. I get claustrophobic in the tanning beds, especially when I can&#x27;t see anything. These allow me to see inside the bed and still protect my eyes. Great fit. Good colors.</li>
    <li> Elastic that comes with this is crap.</li>
    <li> It is very good this product. The only problem, it is a little tiny for an adult face.</li>
    <li> These were just what I ordered. They fit beautifully and the did come with the elastic string. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> These goggles do come off easily, but they are good for things such as laser hair removal.</li>
    <li> Hopefully i didnt damage my eyes but they worked well so far</li>
    <li> Use these weekly. So much better than those silly stickers they are handing out now! Hello?? My eyelashes? I don&#x27;t want to put a sticker on them!!</li>
    <li> We have a home tanning bed. Our chihuahua chewed up our tanning goggles, so we went searching for an inexpensive replacement pair. Can&#x27;t beat $1.50 + free shipping! And they&#x27;re awesome quality! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Saved my eyes while tanning. My eyes approve.</li>
    <li> These are cheaply made! They broke the first time I used them! The lenses fell out while on! It was a waste of my money!</li>
    <li> I got pink and 2 day shipping. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Delivery was slow and they are very thick at the nose piece</li>
    <li> These are terrible.  They are so narrow that they barely cover the eyes and they do not stay on.  Not a good universal fit.</li>
    <li> it does the job, the rubber in the middle hurts my nose, not flexible enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what can you expect for the money you pay for this!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these on a Friday and received them the following Wednesday. They are way cheaper than buying them at a tanning place, and with free shipping you can&#x27;t beat it. I was looking for goggles with the option for elastic so I can use them in a stand up booth and these are exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> As pictured there are 4 pairs of goggles.  I only received one pair which for one pair it was extremely expensive.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected, so I was definitely pleased with that! I was going to order a different pair because I really wanted a pink pair, but these were a more reasonable price. They ended up sending me pink :) They work wonderful, fit good, and stay on. Would order again.</li>
    <li> they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. fit well if you don&#x27;t use the string that they send with them. if you do use it, it feels like the goggles are going to pop your eyeballs out of your head. not a good feeling. lol.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Super flexibe and comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the price. They are extremely tight which makes them very uncomfortable! I think they are made for smaller faces.</li>
    <li> What can i say - they keep me from burning my corneas. That&#x27;s all I could ask for! They fit great, and are comfortable.</li>
    <li> They are okay they bend which I like and don&#x27;t break nice string but that breaks easy as I now have to use a rubber band</li>
    <li> When i first looked at the post I thought I was purchasing a set of four super sunnies I was dissapointed when I got my package and only seen one went back to sight and must have read the ad wrong</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought a pair of these tanning goggles. They are a softer rubber rather than a plastic. Therefore they are less likely to break.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the pink ones ): but the blue ones work great! I have had mine for over 2 months and they still work as good as the first day!!</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, I&#x27;m completely satisfied</li>
    <li> They hold up, and do the job well.</li>
    <li> fits really good very flexable</li>
    <li> They work well but they aren&#x27;t comfortable.  On the other hand I have no basis for comparison as I&#x27;ve never tried another kind.</li>
    <li> The price is right and it arrived on time but too uncomfortable to wear. They don&#x27;t fit well and don&#x27;t cover the entire eye area.</li>
    <li> Picture shows they come with the string, but they do not have one. You can only put them on you eyes when laying down on your back.</li>
    <li> Great fit. Feel durable.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. They show these great colors, but you don&#x27;t get to choose. I ordered two pairs in hope that I would receive two great colors. Instead I received two pairs of ugly black Sunniest. If I&#x27;m paying for them then I should be able to choose what I want.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described super quick shipping. Don&#x27;t get to choose color but who cares.</li>
    <li> Best tanning glasses I have found. I buy a new pair each year!</li>
    <li> Comfortable for the price.</li>
    <li> These are equally useful for outdoor tanning as well as indoor tanning. The strap is adjustable so you can get the perfect fit and the goggles allow you to see well enough to adjust your position and apply lotions, etc. I have been using them for several weeks so far and I have no complaints. They were affordable and fulfill their function perfectly! I even received a color that I enjoy, though being able to pick one would be nice as well.</li>
    <li> These are pretty uncomfortable.  I could handle that, but the idea that you can see through the little holes is ridiculous -- they&#x27;re tiny and very dark, so nothing&#x27;s really visible. If you&#x27;re just getting them to cover your eyes then they&#x27;re fine.</li>
    <li> So glad that I got them. They work great and are dark. I am very satisfied. Would buy these again.</li>
    <li> I use this when I used my light machine - perfect and doesn&#x27;t hurt my eye</li>
    <li> works as designed.  Should last a long time</li>
    <li> Love it! Fits like a glove</li>
    <li> I suffer from extreme chronic dry eye syndrome. I use eye drops at night with the Super Sunnies over my eyes. This hydrates my dry eyes and I wake up refreshed with no dry eyes!  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Excellent eye protection with durable quality. It comes with a stretchy tie that you can adjust. I definitely recommend it for all tanners, they are a lot better than those eye peels that they provide at the salon! And it&#x27;s very cheap to boot. :)</li>
    <li> very helpful I use my when I go to the beach great product</li>
    <li> There is not too much someone can say about sun tan goggles.  They work, they are comfey, and a quick delivery.  Good buy for me</li>
    <li> These tanning goggles arrived promptly &amp; work just as advertised.  No racoon eyes and are comfotable to wear.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Good quality, non breakable plastic, can wear with or without elastic. This is a good price for solid, basic, and functional goggles.</li>
    <li> I tan at my gym and they NEVER have goggles in the tanning room so I decided to buy my own. These are perfect. They are super comfortable and adjust to all face shapes. I love that they come with an elastic band so you can wear them in the stand-up tanning beds. Function is important to me not the color of the goggles so these are awesome and at a very affordable price. I bought my roommate some as well. AMAZING product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for tanning, but now I can see that they have many more uses... I am talking about concealing your identity. On late nights in Los Angeles, when the smog is relatively low, you can see a masked figure. Yes, it is I, Overly Tan Man. I prowl the streets at night, searching for ghostly white people to protect. I am the hero that Los Angeles deserves, but doesn&#x27;t need. These goggles are ideal for protecting my eye-dentity. 10/10. The streets are safe... for now.</li>
    <li> These were purchased with very little thought in mind other than finishing the cheapest goggles.  They were cheap and turned out to be very good quality, too!</li>
    <li> The goggles came with a string, which doesn&#x27;t always happen when you buy these at the store.  I am satisfied with the quality.</li>
    <li> No complaints here. Quality and not damaged. Wear them daily</li>
    <li> these super sunnies do the trick...whether in the tanning booth or on the beach. the extra dark lenses are high quality, durable and blocks those harmful UV rays and leaves your eyes relaxed and fresh</li>
    <li> The product shipped in four days and you get what you see in the picture. Shipping was free which I was happy about. You tie the string onto the goggles yourself so that you can measure and cut the string to fit around your head. They are the standard tanning goggles that you would see at any tanning salon. I bought these because they don&#x27;t provide them at my gym, where I use the stand-up tanning beds. They allow me to still be able to see without being blinded by the harmful UV rays, and seem to stay on pretty well. I didn&#x27;t want to bother with those adhesive \\&quot;Wink Ease\\&quot; eye stickers(plus they look creepy, and are expensive), and I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend more for some fancy goggles that I will only be wearing for 10 minutes at a time. Thank Super Sunnies! By the way, I got purple, my favorite :)</li>
    <li> These goggles only worked for me layng down without the strap, any pressure from these things because of using the strap is too unbearable because they are not wide like swimming goggles that fit around your eyes, they are very narrowly shaped and unless you have small dotted eyes like winnie the pooh any pressure while these are on will be uncomfortable. shipped very quickly from suppersunnies vendor and was well packaged would still recommend after advising about non strap use.</li>
    <li> I use it for my tanning bed. Does what it suppose to do. But feels a little sharp.&lt;br /&gt;It works.</li>
    <li> For a gal with fair skin, I was a little nervous about tanning, but I&#x27;m so glad I started, and my goggles came just in time.</li>
    <li> I bought these after discovering I needed a pair since I got rid of my other pair. They came fast - as described. I am not too crazy about the fit but they worked great when I used them.</li>
    <li> What an overpriced piece of eye-gouging crap!</li>
    <li> Good coverage product</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. I had found some in local stores and the price was double what I paid here. The only thing I was unsure about when ordering was what color i would be getting?! I wanted purple and happen to get purple so it worked out for me.</li>
    <li> I use these to tan in a stand up they fit nicely and r small enough to avoid those white circles you get from some goggles</li>
    <li> Great tanning goggles. Love how they are rubber so they don&#x27;t crack in half like others. Just wish you could pick the color you want.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I expected.  Little plastic covers for your eyes just like they give you at the tanning booth.  Nothing special...but they will do the job!</li>
    <li> These put unnatural pressure on the eye balls.  These goggles are uncomfortable and I am concerned about the potential for eye damage.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with these because they put an unnatural pressure on the eye balls. As other reviewers also stated, these goggles are uncomfortable. The elastic is too short and the cups dig into the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Very effective at keeping the sun glare out of my eyes when sun bathing.</li>
    <li> great for tanning in the sun or sunbed.</li>
    <li> They are much more comfortable than the hard plastic and fit so much better and they don&#x27;t leave a ring around my eyes.</li>
    <li> &#x27;nuff said. Just a little squishy on my eyeballs. Works great for the seven minutes I&#x27;m in the tanning bed, but not comfortable.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and seems to do its job fairly well (bought to use with Sirius 77 Aurora Light Therapy System).</li>
    <li> Great product.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in googles.  You should definitely try these googles yourself.  I love mine.</li>
    <li> This item seems to be of good quality.  However, the fit is awkward and the elastic strap could be stronger.  I use it at my physical therapy practice with some of our Infrared and Ultraviolet (UV) treatment options.</li>
    <li> Top quality rubber, adjustable nose band, comes with elastic band for stand-up tanners. Wish I could have picked my color, but it&#x27;s a great product even if I didn&#x27;t get the pink I wanted!</li>
    <li> They serve their purpose but it&#x27;s hard to see through them. I&#x27;ll be in the tanning bed and want to see how long I have and have to contort my neck all weird angles to see the control buttons on the bed. Other than that, good price... Flexible and standard quality goggles.</li>
    <li> Good low profile eye protection.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Very dark, very good eye protection in the tanning bed, more comfortable than some I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    <li> These work really will for indoor and outdoor tanning. I have used them for both. Very flexible, and fits nicely.</li>
    <li> Cheap but uncomfortable</li>
    <li> They are good enough for the price. I use them at home.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly and in good packaging. Works well</li>
    <li> These goggles are as expected and do the job.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use these for our afternoon cat naps and they work just fine at keeping out the light -- much better than the eye shades one gets from airlines, for example, which allow light in from the edges. The strap needs to be adjusted properly to keep the goggles on, without pressing them too tightly against the face. The reason I give them 4, not 5, stars is that even with the strap adjusted, they&#x27;re not the most comfortable things in the world. A little felt along the inner edges might do the trick. Still, they&#x27;re the best napping eye shades we&#x27;ve yet come across.</li>
    <li> These goggles are flexible not like the older hard plastic one that sit too stiff on your face. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the lense is yellow it is probably a good thing but I don&#x27;t like to take my goggles off to see a text it will take some getting used to😉  the soft texture is so great would buy again.</li>
    <li> The image shows 4 goggles so I thought it was for 4 pairs at this price. My fault for not reading fine print. I would not have ordered if I knew at the time of purchase that it was for 1 pair. They are sold for less at my tanning salon.  You get two stars because you sent my favorite color. PURPLE. Thank you universe for a small favor.</li>
    <li> I admit to hating this things but these are at least made of a little softer material than my last pair.  They make it possible to watch TV while doing a light treatment on my face so that is my main need for using them.</li>
    <li> These super sunnies are so tight and small  . I do not care what you do to make them fit ..they do not. I was very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with these goggles. They&#x27;ve not caused marks around my eyes (I do not use the string) and have done the job that they are supposed to do. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and effective.</li>
    <li> k, these are not the best, but will do :)</li>
    <li> Very timely, product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I bought my wife a pair of these and they have held up for the past year. As long as you triple tie them they will not come loose and if they do, there is plenty of cord to fix the problem. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that you do not get to choose your own color.</li>
    <li> Perhaps bought for unitended purpace, noth the less, eye outlet is too small, visibility almost zero. Maybe designed for tanning bed only where person would have their eyes closed</li>
    <li> These do not fit over the eyes because the eye covers are deep and oblong and are not flat enough to cover the eyes.  I threw them away.</li>
    <li> The nose pare that connects the two sides sticks out too much for me.</li>
    <li> Basically these are very dark, narrow sunglasses.  Most of the time they&#x27;re effective, but facing the sun with a clear sky with my eyes closed, it is still uncomfortably bright.  I covered the lens with duck tape.</li>
    <li> You get exactly what you ordered</li>
    <li> These are high quality &amp; the fit is perfect, i love them I use them when im laying out in my pool, there so small they dont cause racoon eyes.</li>
    <li> Wanted my own eye wear for tanning and this was a good price and fit well. Good adjustable strap on the back.</li>
    <li> This product is good. I would buy again if the vendor continues to sell this same make and model. Length requirement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad i got these they are as described and are a lot more comfortable than the plastic ones...  must buy.</li>
    <li> These came timely and were exactly what we expected. Perfect for tanning at our health club before our trip to Mexico. They even put in a purple one, which is my favorite color. Just lucky I guess.</li>
    <li> I ordered from Salon Supply Store. The Eye wear came on time and is exactly what I was looking for. (I got purple - Which was a bonus, but I would have been happy with any color!) These goggles are pretty comfortable and I have no bad things to say!</li>
    <li> Nice flexible rubber material. They are very comfortable and have great coverage. I work nights so I was pleased when I received a black pair. They block out more of the sunlight so I can snooze while I get my daily dose of vitamin D. I&#x27;ve had round, plastic ones in the past and these are definitely an improvement.</li>
    <li> cheap product and very uncomfortable</li>
    <li> I love my super sunnies. Not only did I get a purple pair but I also got them like two days later. Plus they weren&#x27;t super expensive and they do a great job at keeping the light out of my eyes. I am actually about to order my sis in law a pair too. :)</li>
    <li> I got these to protect my eyes from the infrared LED lights I use, and I think they are definitely good at blocking out any kind of light(rest assured these are better than sunglasses; i can barely see with them on), but unfortunately, the rim rests--and pulls--right on the most delicate area of the eyes, so I REALLY dislike wearing these--even when I just rest them on my eyes they feel as if they&#x27;re pulling (they are made of hard plastic and not flexible at all).  I dunno, I guess maybe tanners don&#x27;t care about this sort of thing (or perhaps it&#x27;s that they wont use them as frequently), but I don&#x27;t want exacerbated under-eye wrinkling.... They are the only pair of tanning googles I&#x27;ve ever had so I can&#x27;t say if the fit is normal or not, but I can only hope there are better designs out there than this.</li>
    <li> Kind of cheap, and flimsy. Good for the price though. hard to see out of.</li>
    <li> Does what it promises. It is very comfortable and does a great job!!! I got the color pink and was VERY happy with my purchase.</li>
