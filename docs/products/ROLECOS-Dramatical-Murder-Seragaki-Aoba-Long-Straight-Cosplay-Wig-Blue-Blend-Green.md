      <li>have a more detailed review here: http://tamakatx.blogspot.com/2015/01/amazon-review-aoba-wig-from-kadiya-l.html&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;party&amp;#34; part, with the change in color is pretty smooth, with some nice blending.</li>
      <li>It came in really early, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super soft and the length and color is great and</li>
      <li>I really love it so much!!</li>
      <li>off, the color is almost 100% accurate.</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t want to read it, just know that I go on about how amazing it is haha</li>
      <li>/&gt;Indoor light:</li>
      <li>I ordered this one since it had such great reviews and was still under $20, plus was on Amazon prime meaning I wouldn&#x27;t have to wait for it to ship</li>
      <li>This wig is so full and easy to comb.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture , it&#x27;s better .</li>
      <li>to my surprise it was exactly how the picture was and was really cute.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>I was so excited for this wig to come</li>
      <li>Very high quality, it came in just 5 days, and is extremely comfortable :3</li>
      <li>My daughter has enjoyed many hours of fun fixing new hair designs/looks with it</li>
      <li>It got here right on time!</li>
      <li>I love my Aoba wig, its soft and perfect color and its pre styled so a little hair gel</li>
      <li>I love this wig so much</li>

      <li>Overall, I freaking love this wig, but I wish I could wear it more often.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>The back puffs perfectly but the wig itself doesn&#x27;t have gradient effect like Aoba&#x27;s actual hair.</li>
      <li>this quick at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more layered on top than my last one also.</li>
      <li>The color is extremely accurate and pretty.</li>
      <li>but regardless it shipped fast and was easy to style.</li>
      <li>I do think it would need a bit more styling to achieve the necessary fluffiness in the photo, but it&#x27;s easily achievable with this wig</li>
      <li>I have about 10 wigs, and this one by far, is my absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true to color and length and is very soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>And it was delivered over two weeks early, which is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Beautiful soft wig,,looks just like the picture, nice and thick too:3 High quality</li>
      <li>The light blue/light green additions were shorter than expected but it was still perfect!</li>
      <li>It got to my house so fast!</li>
      <li>natural light-</li>
      <li>It fits well and turned out exactly as seen in the photo.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The only downside is that it shed a lot but other than that it was pretty good!</li>
      <li>Came super fast and is con ready.</li>
      <li>and wow just super super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It looks like my own hair, unlike other  wigs that you can tell it is one.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s pretty much pre-styled.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured, and doesn&#x27;t really need to be styled at all.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t need much styling, super soft!</li>
      <li>The colors aren&#x27;t exactly the same, the blending is different, but it still looks amazing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is a fun one and it is great in role play.</li>
    <li> Very cheap-feeling and difficult to restyle.</li>
    <li> This wig is AWESOME. It came in really early, which was a pleasant surprise. It looks very close to the picture with some styling, but looks perfectly fine without product which is perfect for beginner cosplayers. The colors aren&#x27;t exactly the same, the blending is different, but it still looks amazing. It parts on its own. Very nice wig.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Very high quality, it came in just 5 days, and is extremely comfortable :3 It came with a wig cap too</li>
    <li> I love this wig so much it&#x27;s so perfect</li>
    <li> this wig is great !! It&#x27;s pre-styled and cut , all you have to do is brush it and BOOM you&#x27;re Aoba . It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture , it&#x27;s better . The picture makes it look like there&#x27;s two separate colors beside each other but it fades to the light blue just like Aoba&#x27;s . It&#x27;s also the cheapest I&#x27;ve seen , I really reccomend .</li>
    <li> Okay I adore this wig, its perfect. But OH MY GOSH is it hot to wear like WOW it could double as a freaking winter ski hat! This is because the &amp;#34;business&amp;#34; part of this electric blue mullet is really thick. Which is both good, cause there is not way anyone will see your wig cap, but also bad because it may cause difficulty styling and an over heating head. For me, it didnt need very much styling at all, besides snipping the bangs a little. The &amp;#34;party&amp;#34; part, with the change in color is pretty smooth, with some nice blending. Overall, I freaking love this wig, but I wish I could wear it more often. If you&#x27;re meaning to cosplay Aoba, try to keep it in the winter, or else you might end up suffering from over heating.</li>
    <li> this wig is perfect i had if for a while now and its still holding strong even after i have put it into multiple ponytails and brads. i would surely give the link to any one who needs a aoba wig. wait i already have like 15 different people XD.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my boyfriend&#x27;s Aoba cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to be uploading photos soon!&lt;br /&gt;We wanted a wig that was dark enough but still had a good resemblance to that of Aoba&#x27;s. After reading the reviews we decided on going with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller: TES5 Studio&lt;br /&gt;Customer service: 4/5 - I contacted the seller before buying and they gave me a satisfaction guarentee! They agreed that if I was not fully satisfied with the wig that I would be able to send it back and recieve a full refund. (Though sending it back would cost too much which is why I lowered the rating.) Otherwise it was great customer service and they replied within 1-2 days! So I took the chance and I ordered it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: 5/5 It was amazing for China! I ordered June 1st and it arrived to it&#x27;s destination (California, United States) by June 13th. I did have a tracking number, so that is always a plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thickness: 5/5 It was pretty thick and the wig cap was not visable. Wefts were fully in place and it was styled! I do think it would need a bit more styling to achieve the necessary fluffiness in the photo, but it&#x27;s easily achievable with this wig so I don&#x27;t see a problem! The bangs were great and didn&#x27;t need to be trimmed or styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too shiny either! It was fairly soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length: 5/5 It reached his shoulders. The light blue/light green additions were shorter than expected but it was still perfect! The length was perfect as well, it reached just underneath his shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;In natural light- It was just as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;Indoor light: Same as above! Just as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase! It was an amazing quality wig and well worth the price! I would buy from this seller again and I highly recommend this wig.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend any wig from L-email, they always have aazing quality. Just check all their wigs and ratings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest talking with the seller before purchase, it will ensure that you recieve best service.best service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and has all the rights colors</li>
    <li> Really thick and pretty! Doesn&#x27;t  shed or tangle. It&#x27;s a bit shiny but that can easily fixed. Recommend to any Aoba cosplayers!</li>
    <li> I have about 10 wigs, and this one by far, is my absolute favorite! Its so smooth and silky, and it doesn&#x27;t have that nasty shine some wigs have. I really love it so much!! I highly recommend this wig ^^</li>
    <li> It got to my house so fast! It was amazing! &amp; the product looks exactly like the picture, good job.</li>
    <li> This is a great wig for Aoba cosplay! I am in love with it! It got here right on time! It looked just like the picture too!</li>
    <li> The wig is great! It&#x27;s true to color and length and is very soft and easy to manage. The only downside is that it shed a lot but other than that it was pretty good!</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my first wig because it was such crummy quality, so I took the risk and bought this one. Oh my god, I was so not idsappointed.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the color is almost 100% accurate. Aoba&#x27;s hair color kinda varies between photos so thats why I say almost. It feels like real hair and is the perfect thickness and length, and it brushes very well. It&#x27;s super silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;And the best part, it&#x27;s basically styled!&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t contain my happiness when I opened it and took it out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;It took about 1 week and a half to get here, which is normal to me since it shipped from China.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely 100% going to purchase from this seller again, cause I&#x27;m beyond impressed.</li>
    <li> I have bought many wigs from other places and I don&#x27;t think I will anymore.. This wig is so full and easy to comb. It looks like my own hair, unlike other  wigs that you can tell it is one. Just a little comb out with your fingers and it untangles with ease. Hardly any fallout. Will be buying more from this company.. Not as thick on bottom but that is ok with me. I still give 5 stars..</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price! Very thick but in a sense maybe a little too thick. The back puffs perfectly but the wig itself doesn&#x27;t have gradient effect like Aoba&#x27;s actual hair. not super shiny considering its a wig. You cannot buy this wig without knowing that you are going to have to style and trim it to make it optimal for cosplay so just keep that in mind. I don&#x27;t really have any other complaints with this product, I would definitely recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I received this item today. It came in the mail fast (only took about 8 business days) and the wig was indeed just like what it looks like on the picture. Very satisfied. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it along with the rest of my costume.</li>
    <li> Beautiful soft wig,,looks just like the picture, nice and thick too:3 High quality</li>
    <li> I am honestly impressed as hell. My last Aoba wig was ok, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay up in the back no matter what I did. I ordered this one since it had such great reviews and was still under $20, plus was on Amazon prime meaning I wouldn&#x27;t have to wait for it to ship overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And...Daymn! I took this out of the bag and *POOF!* the back went up with no product at all! I&#x27;m almost giddy! It&#x27;s more layered on top than my last one also. I agree that the bangs will have to be trimmed a bit but other than that this wig is con ready!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lovely wig it just sheds it little and the bottom color is a bit off from the photo, but regardless it shipped fast and was easy to style. In the future if needed I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the wig! I recommend to anyone wanting to cosplay Aoba(:&lt;br /&gt;I have a more detailed review here: http://tamakatx.blogspot.com/2015/01/amazon-review-aoba-wig-from-kadiya-l.html&lt;br /&gt;But if you don&#x27;t want to read it, just know that I go on about how amazing it is haha</li>
    <li> Came super fast and is con ready. The color is extremely accurate and pretty. Great Aoba wig!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and amazing quality especially for the price, definitely reccomend</li>
    <li> I love my Aoba wig, its soft and perfect color and its pre styled so a little hair gel and that&#x27;s it. :D I can&#x27;t wait to cosplay as him now!!</li>
    <li> Got here fast and looks great! Very accurate to the character.</li>
    <li> This wig is great!! The hair on top is nice and thick and the long hair is really soft. I especially love the gradient of blue, it looks just like Aoba&#x27;s hair. And it was delivered over two weeks early, which is fantastic!</li>
    <li> For the price I was worried it might not arrive the way it looked on site....to my surprise it was exactly how the picture was and was really cute. My daughter has enjoyed many hours of fun fixing new hair designs/looks with it &amp; I would buy from this site again, for sure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got to say I was very satisfied with the outcome. It&#x27;s thick and soft as well as somewhat pre-styled. You mostly just have to trim the bangs. It&#x27;s wonderful quality overall. It fits well and turned out exactly as seen in the photo. For anyone looking to cosplay Aoba or just wear for fun, I&#x27;d say this would be a good choice!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Super thick and long! Wayyyyy better than I was expecting:)</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig like a week ago and wasn&#x27;t expecting it to get here this quick at all. I&#x27;m going to a con all weekend where I wasn&#x27;t planning on doing an Aoba cosplay (because I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have the wig in time) but now that it&#x27;s here i can! It&#x27;s super soft and the length and color is great and it&#x27;s pretty much pre-styled. I really love it, there&#x27;s not much work that needs to be put into it at all and wow just super super fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am amazed and pleased with this wig.  It&#x27;s exactly as pictured, and doesn&#x27;t really need to be styled at all.  It looks great and feels great.  Would definitely suggest this wig to anyone working on an Aoba cosplay. &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came extremely fast, considering it came from China.  Customer service was also very friendly and on top of things.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for this wig to come and I definitely was not disappointed! The wig is high quality and I love the color. Thank you for this amazing product~</li>
    <li> Beautiful wig! Didn&#x27;t need much styling, super soft! Of course it did have that just bought shedding, but I ran my fingers through and a lot of it came out. Would buy again in a heart beat</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this wig and it came super quick to my house with a free wig cap, which is even more awesome.</li>
