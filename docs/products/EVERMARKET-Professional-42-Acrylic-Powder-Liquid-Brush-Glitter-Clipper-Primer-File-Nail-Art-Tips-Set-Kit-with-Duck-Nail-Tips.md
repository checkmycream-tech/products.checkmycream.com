### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for a beginner.</li>
      <li>Which was a great thing for</li>
      <li>If you are looking to experiment on doing nails then go ahead and get this but don&#x27;t expect for it to be a great product.</li>
      <li>so I was happy about that</li>
      <li>Everything was great except my polymer the containers were melted from the liquid but beside that I liked everything else</li>
      <li>but it is a good set for beginners to get used to doing the acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>I really liked the glitter</li>
      <li>I loved it its sooo cute</li>
      <li>Otherwise everything was okay.</li>
      <li>I honestly love how they work and you have to be a pro</li>
      <li>I could have gotten better quality product from Walmart.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t include the primer or the nail molds and the acrylic tips break easily and started falling off after 2 days.</li>
      <li>but over all it came very quickly</li>
      <li>So cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Overall great, fun purchase</li>
      <li>None of this was true for me.</li>
      <li>but I am excited to use this to do nails for fun.</li>
      <li>Everything came in it the products are great and what I expected and came fast</li>
      <li>so you have to really wet your brush in order to get a a good consistency.</li>
      <li>Some of the powders were opened everywhere but worth the money anyways</li>
      <li>Got here pretty quick.</li>
      <li>so I normally am pretty good with using them and having them stay on an average of 2-3 weeks</li>
      <li>So I really can&#x27;t give this a good rating because I&#x27;m not able to use it.</li>
      <li>Everything came on time just some of the color power wash full and the acrylic powders is not the same in the picture.</li>
      <li>these didn&#x27;t even last a full week.</li>
      <li>Products were decent size and you get a lot for the money you&#x27;re spending.</li>
      <li>Everything was so tiny and after using the acrylic powder which dries up quickly</li>
      <li>I disaponed because the clear acrylic spread to the whole box and everything</li>
      <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t returned it was because I was too excited to learn how to do my nails and didn&#x27;t want to wait another 2 weeks to get a different product.</li>
      <li>They must have changed the way the pack it because everything was packed in really tight and secure.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m only giving this a three mostly because the items are really small</li>
      <li>The nails are extremely poor quality, and many of them are deformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You get barely any pink or white powder, and the acrylic doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
      <li>I purchased this kit to learn how to do my own nails as I was getting tired of going to the nail salon every other week.</li>
      <li>None of the products were wrapped and protected so half of the glitters and powders were spilled , all the nail are cheap and white tips, the powder containers are  tiny and only half actually has powder .....</li>

    <li> Some of the powders were opened everywhere but worth the money anyways</li>
    <li> Mine didn&#x27;t come with the duck tips :( but I am excited to use this to do nails for fun.</li>
    <li> Everything came on time just some of the color power wash full and the acrylic powders is not the same in the picture.</li>
    <li> When I ordered it, it said \\&quot;guaranteed arival by June 23rd\\&quot;. It got here the 24th. I know, I know, its only one day late. But my birthday was June 23rd and this was a gift from my husband. We were hoping it would be on time, so I could do my nails for my birthday dinner. Nope, didn&#x27;t happen. It wouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal if the arival date wasn&#x27;t GUARANTEED. Also the glitter acrylic powder doesn&#x27;t work. And it spilled all over everything. The acrylic liquid also spilled. The nails are extremely poor quality, and many of them are deformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does work, with effort and experience. However I would never recommend thidls to anyone. I could have gotten better quality product from Walmart.</li>
    <li> Unable to do the acrylic nails because the all of the nail glues came dried up and the nail clipper came in broken. So I really can&#x27;t give this a good rating because I&#x27;m not able to use it. Otherwise everything was okay.</li>
    <li> I received my products earlier than expected. Which was a great thing for I was suppose to receive my package May 11th. Everything in the picture was also in my package. The only issue I had with product is that a little of the clear acrylic powder spilled out. Other than that I cannot not wait to use the products on my clients and I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dominique</li>
    <li> It came with a lot of stuff but the acrylic I got wasn&#x27;t a lot in each container. And I didn&#x27;t get the round thing with molds of flowers.</li>
    <li> The glue liquid and powder containers are a lot smaller than pictures but it is a good set for beginners to get used to doing the acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> I honestly love how they work and you have to be a pro but I&#x27;m only giving this a three mostly because the items are really small and I thought that I was getting everything like in the pic but over all it came very quickly so I was happy about that</li>
    <li> Got here pretty quick. I read some of the old reviews about the glitter being spilt everywhere and the clippers broken. None of this was true for me. They must have changed the way the pack it because everything was packed in really tight and secure. Products were decent size and you get a lot for the money you&#x27;re spending. Overall great, fun purchase and I would shop here again.</li>
