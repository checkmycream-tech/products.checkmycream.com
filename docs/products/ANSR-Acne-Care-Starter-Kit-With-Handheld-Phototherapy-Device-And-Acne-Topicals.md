      <li>Its truely amazing the difference you will see in a couple months time.  </li>
      <li>I would also recommend using a nice moisturizer to prevent over drying.</li>
      <li>Even the most unsightly acne you have to ignore, just exfoliate face with a good cleansers (the ones that come with this product</li>

      <li>More than I care to</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I did make one interesting observation.</li>
      <li>The idea was to see if there was any notable difference in the number/severity of breakouts on the two sides of my face over the two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result?</li>
      <li>Once ive used ANSR my skin has been getting better.</li>
      <li>More zits means more creams &amp; cleaning pads, which means more money shelled out to these crooks.  </li>
      <li>If you want healthy skin with no side effects or surgery, buy the ANSR.   </li>
      <li>Whether or not you have pimples, the ANSR is a phenomenal product.  </li>
      <li>i broke out more all over my jaw line and my neck and my forehead.</li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>more thing:</li>
      <li>so thought I&#x27;d give the latest gimmick..</li>
      <li>and before i used it my face was better than after i used the ANSR.</li>
      <li>So when I saw this I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not</li>
      <li>interesting tidbit: my device had a \\&quot;non-FDA approved device\\&quot; sticker on it.  </li>
      <li>-Cystic bumps are not bumpy any more and are on their way to gone.  </li>
      <li>He mostly snickered.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>The instructions inside are a bit wanting, and they could have gone into much more detail.  </li>
      <li>but whenever you start to treat acne you always break out more after 2-3 weeks as treating brings more to the surface.</li>
      <li>As I plan to use this product indefinitely, I hope to experience even more</li>
      <li>It does seem to be an effective blue/red light therapy device.  </li>
      <li>You can not pick at your acne and expect it to get better though.</li>
      <li>This was surprising since we did not expect what really looks like a LED flashlight to do this!</li>
      <li>lights are super bright, so I couldn&#x27;t even watch TV during the treatments; even when I closed my eyes, the lights were very bright  </li>
      <li>This was a great product to test if light therapy works for you, but if you know it does, I would get a bigger better device.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in fine lines yet, hopefully this will occur with longer use.</li>
      <li>I hope I don&#x27;t sound like an infomercial.  </li>
      <li>There is no need to purchase &#x27;refills&#x27; for the light device</li>
      <li>it is a fairly cheap system.)</li>
      <li>I actually got a compliment from a person who knows my age,and who told me my skin looked great.</li>
      <li>I also ordered the LED Skin Rejuvenating Light with DPL Therapy .  </li>
      <li>However, looking at ANSR&#x27;s website showed that there are a number of studies for red/blue light acne treatment -- but I couldn&#x27;t find anything that discussed whether the ANSR beam mirrored the devices used in the studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But within 6 days after using the ANSR light, the problems have disappeared.  </li>
      <li>I was recommended light therapy once</li>
      <li>product here claims to do all that through its cream treatments and light therapy device.  </li>
      <li>ANSR seems determined to cover its bases by giving you both light and cream treatments.  </li>
      <li>So far so good, but it says you can&#x27;t expect results for 60 days.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know how this product would work on a young person,but for an old coot like me,it works wonderfully well.</li>
      <li>However, the light has produced significant results for me.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s the light therapy that is unique, as I haven&#x27;t seen that approach before.  </li>
      <li>After reviewing the Quasar, Light Stim, and a bunch of other LED skin related devices, the ANSR seemed to be the most reputable product at the best price.  </li>
      <li>I noticed more pimples at first, but even then the redness was gone over night.</li>
      <li>At first, I think I saw more acne.</li>
      <li>but IT IS WORTH IT!</li>
      <li>you have the occasional light break out, the Beam would probably work fairly well.  </li>
      <li>Just remember to clean the lens.</li>
      <li>Okay, I bought this a few years ago and it was great.</li>
      <li>Finally there is this brilliant series of products and a light treatment device that have completely cleared my skin.</li>
      <li>Finally, I have found a product that I think is as good as Proactiv.  </li>
      <li>Some discounting would help earn this product the full 5 stars.</li>
      <li>But, if you have more aggressive break outs like I do, it probably won&#x27;t work very well for you.</li>
      <li>So you know, outta the box you get a super duper special soap to be used before you use blinding</li>
      <li>I had found that this system cleared up regular acne and for the most part kept everything in check without over drying, and it worked for the most part.</li>
      <li>The other products (wash, cream, etc.), seem nice - pleasant scent, etc., but they contain a \\&quot;proprietary combination of natural ingredients\\&quot; called Aurazin -</li>
      <li>What I might change from here on forth is to use alcohol wipes to clean the lense of the product right before</li>
      <li>The technology is good, and blue light therapy does work, but ANSR really needs to take the time to prove that their device works as well.</li>
      <li>WOW!!!!!  </li>
      <li>First you cleanse your face, then you add the special cream (either day or night depending on when your using it)</li>
      <li>And the light was also very drying to the skin.     </li>
      <li>But he thought at the levels of light produced by the ANSR that it wouldn&#x27;t make too much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
      <li>Maybe, but I&#x27;m a lot more comfortable when a medical device has to go through a formal study to show both its safety and efficacy.  </li>
      <li>This is good for spot treatments, but for whole face coverage, get something bigger.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
      <li>Not to sure how they developed this</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost compared to going to a doctor and paying for treatments there.</li>
      <li>I have seen the result&#x27;s with my own eyes for years, as countless clients come in for weekly sessions.</li>
      <li>and sore spots are greatly reduced, and for once my skin is looking porcelain instead of just pale.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product to have overall healthy skin.  </li>
      <li>After several days of use he was able to see a significant difference which encouraged him to continue using it as suggested.</li>
      <li>On the right side, I applied the topicals, but didn&#x27;t use the electronic device.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracle right away.  </li>
      <li>Right off the bat</li>
      <li>Right there that oughta tell ya something.  </li>
      <li>light therapy has been approved by the FDA, even if this particular device has not.  </li>
      <li>How can a little light that fits in the palm of your hand possibly be effective?  </li>
      <li>and I love the effects enough that the time commitment is worth it.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ive just bought the ANSR photo-light therapy product about 3 days ago. Within those 3 days ive already ahve seen a difference.Ive tried everything proavtic, neutragena, and went to this site called (...). None of them worked. I dont have sever or moderate acne to start off with but when i do get one it seems impossible to get rid of. I feel like the acne i get is immune to the products because ive tried so many different creams and what-not. I also have what looks like pre-mature pimple that dont seem to be getting larger but also doesnt seem to be getting smaller. Once ive used ANSR my skin has been getting better. Not one pimple has shown and those stubborn little ones are diminishing. I use the day and night cream and that helps alot. People have said they havent seen much improvement in the scars left from popping the pimples but mine does seem to be healing up a bit. Although the blackheads on my nose havent seemed to improved the acne is going away.Considering its only been 3 days and there is a huge improvement in my skin i would totally recommend this product to whoever is out there.</li>
    <li> I have used this device consistently for about a month and I have seen little to no improvement.  The cleansing cream is like so many other products and I am not certain the light provides any value.  If I had retained the box, I would have returned it with in the 30 days.</li>
    <li> Finally, I have found a product that I think is as good as Proactiv.  The kit comes with a scrub, a skin-penetrating phototherapy device and two gels -- one for day and one for night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, you put on the scrub, leave it on for twenty seconds, and then rinse and dry off your skin.  Then you use the blue phototherapy light first,  then the red light, each for five minutes.  Then you rub in the day gel.  Your regular makeup goes on over the day gel.  At night, you remove your make-up with your usual cleanser, then repeat the whole procedure with the scrub and the phototherapy devices, except that after the light in the evening you use the night gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a few uses, I felt  that my skin was clearer, cleaner, and smoother.  I could see a definite decrease in acne and blemishes around my nose, and on my chin, cheeks and forehead.  It didn&#x27;t really help with blackheads, but it did not make them worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give this product the full five stars is because the product tends to dry my skin a little more than I would like, and I don&#x27;t feel as though I have a good handle on how to control the dryness without interfering with the acne-fighting components in the kit.  If the company would address this dryness problem in its next kit, I would have no problem giving it the full five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, I have tried virtually every acne system on the market, and I really like this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I would recommend this system highly.  The light is supposed to take away and kill dead skin cells and penetrate the skin layers more deeply.  I believe this.  The results speak for themselves.  I will keep using this system.</li>
    <li> I got my wife this device and after using it for a while, here is her feedback:    Pros:  - The PREP face wash made her skin feel smoother and cleaner.  - The battery charge lasts up to three cycles which means it only needs to be charged once per day.  - The device is small and easy to carry in a purse.    Cons:  - It takes  too long (10 minutes) to complete a treatment cycle in addition to the time for the prep wash and day/night cream .  - It made her skin very dry.  - She developed a large number of small pimples after using it.  - The manual is too limited. It does not have any information on how long the product should be used before seeing any improvement.  - The cream tubes are too small and in no time you will need refills which make it very expensive.  - It is not FDA approved    She highly advises against purchasing this product.  She recommends Zeno instead because it provides a focused treatment, the results are visible within 24 to 48 hours, and it takes only 2.5 minutes per treatment.

    <li> First, let me start by telling you that I am an Esthetician. Skin care is my world. For a long time I was looking into investing in an at home LED light therapy system. Most cost between $400-600 and need to be plugged into a wall outlet, so they can be difficult to use. I am a firm believer in LED light therapy. I have seen the result&#x27;s with my own eyes for years, as countless clients come in for weekly sessions. About 2 years ago I was suffering from the worst breakout of my life and my wedding was just 6 months away. I had tried topical products as well as antibiotics and Acne med&#x27;s but nothing got me the results I wanted. I started using the Beam only and within 6 weeks my skin had completely cleared up and has remained clear ever since. I took about 2 weeks for me to see solid results, although the first time I used it I felt better. The blue light killed the bacteria in my acne while the red light sped up the healing process. This resulted in fewer breakouts that healed faster and were less painful. I did glycolic peels every 3 weeks in conjunction with the daily Beam use and found that despite the long term severity of my Acne I have no pigmentation scarring and very little pock scarring. I continue to use the beam to fade my scars as well as prevent breakouts. I never used the topical treatment products because I have extremely sensitive skin and worried they would be irritating.  As for the lack of FDA approval, I would not be concerned because the process for seeking approval is long and tedious and I would bet that the makers of ANSR are in the process of getting the Beam approved. I would recommend this product for people who suffer from consistent inflammatory acne breakouts. They will see the best results. I would also recommend using a nice moisturizer to prevent over drying.</li>
    <li> I was intimidated by the sticker on the product highlighting the fact that it&#x27;s not FDA approved, so I didn&#x27;t actually use the beam device.  The other products (wash, cream, etc.), seem nice - pleasant scent, etc., but they contain a \\&quot;proprietary combination of natural ingredients\\&quot; called Aurazin - I wondered why, if the ingredients are natural, they couldn&#x27;t be listed.  I like to know what I&#x27;m putting on my skin.</li>
    <li> So I have done a lot of research on this product and finally decided to buy it, given that it is the cheapest of its kind and has both the red and blue light. I have had severe acne all over my face ever since I was about 12. I have tried literally everything. Proactiv, murad, neutragena,antibiotics, meds, everything. So when I saw this I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not but it is unlike any treatment I have ever used so I decided to go for it. I am so glad that I did! In the month that I have been using it I have seen about 80-90% of my acne disappear. Now it&#x27;s not completely gone, I still get the occasional pimple but when I do get one they are gone way faster than ever before, they used to hang around on my face for days or even weeks. Now with using this they are gone in a day or two. It&#x27;s amazing! This has been a godsend for me. I say, if you have acne, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this! I&#x27;m so glad that I did. It does take a while, it&#x27;s ten minutes twice a day to use both lights, but if you&#x27;re like me it is well worth getting up ten minutes early to do this treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every product under the sun for acne. I&#x27;m 20 now and still have the monthly flair-ups. I was interested in the this product because it was a new form of treatment as opposed to creams and stuff. I used this product religiously for three months, then kinda dwindled on the fourth. In the first few months there was some improvement. The acne was getting smaller and fewer. But as time passed I think my skin adjusted to the treatment and it returned back to it&#x27;s previous state. Over all I&#x27;m a little disappointed that I did not get the results I was excepting. And the light was also very drying to the skin.     Now I believe my skin problem is an internal hormonal thing. This product probably serves well for those with external issues. If your acne is hormonal, this is probably not the product for you.</li>
    <li> This device is good, but seeing the improvements is a slow process.  Don&#x27;t expect miracle right away.  I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks now and my face is slowly clearing up.  Do expect for pimples to surface drastically for the first week or two.  Then it&#x27;ll go away on the third.</li>
    <li> I purchased the ANSR light about a month ago and I am so happy that I did! My breakouts have stopped and my scaring and red spots are going away too! For a year I struggled with acne and tried so many different products. This is the only thing that has given me results where I can rest assured.</li>
    <li> Bought the ANSR system for my son who has some acne issues. After several days of use he was able to see a significant difference which encouraged him to continue using it as suggested. Well worth the cost compared to going to a doctor and paying for treatments there.</li>
    <li> So far so good, but it says you can&#x27;t expect results for 60 days. It&#x27;s been easy to use and the products don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin -- which is great for me! My skin seems a bit better, but nothing that few days on any new routine haven&#x27;t shown. I hope to report something great soon!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product to have overall healthy skin.  I really don&#x27;t have acne, but my I do have blackheads on my nose and I have extremely blotchy and discolored skin.  Occasionally I do get a pimple here and there.  I am a 33 year old male.   I did about 12 hour of overall research on photo light therapy with LED lights and concluded that it was worth trying.  After reviewing the Quasar, Light Stim, and a bunch of other LED skin related devices, the ANSR seemed to be the most reputable product at the best price.  The ANSR Acne kit was purchased along with \\&quot;the Dermawand\\&quot; and \\&quot;New Color Ray Photo Rejuvenation Therapy Photon Led Device Anti-aging\\&quot;.  The new color photo ray is basically the same technology, it offer 2 colors of LED lights, red and blue.  The new color photo ray was only $40 and I was hoping it would be as effective as ANSR, so I could return the ANSR.  ANSR proved to be a superior product.  Even though it only has 4 diodes, 2 blue and 2 red, the intensity of the diodes are very strong, significantly stronger than New Color Ray.   Within a few days I noticed significantly improved skin pigmentation, a decrease in overall pimples, including the blackheads on my nose, and an overall healthy glow and clarity.  I also noticed a decrease in pore size and overall wrinkles.  My skin is producing collagen in abundance.  I did not use any of the topical products that came with the ANSR kit, nor am I going to use it.  These products contain Salicylic acid.  I have pigmentation problems due too many glycolic acid products and overall topical exfoliants, all recommended by dermatologists.  The Dermawand is going to be returned with the new color photo ray.  Whether or not you have pimples, the ANSR is a phenomenal product.  If you want healthy skin with no side effects or surgery, buy the ANSR.   Take into consideration that today is my 14th day with the ANSR device.  I also ordered the LED Skin Rejuvenating Light with DPL Therapy .  I have not received it yet, it has 164 diodes of red and infrared.  As per the LED studies infrared light penetrates the skin at 880 nanometers, red penetrates at around 660 nanometers.  I&#x27;m interested in this product because it has infrared and it is a panel with the LED diodes, you just have to sit in front of it.  It has more overall coverage, and its more expensive.  If the makers of ANSR were to have a similar product I would have purchased it too.  I place the review of this product once I start using it.  Overall, I love the ANSR device and plan on continuing to use it everyday.  I have not told anyone, with the exception of my wife, of my use of the ANSR device.   Friends and coworkers have told me that I look rested and my skin looks healthier.  I hope I don&#x27;t sound like an infomercial.  I am very skeptical of any type of products especially one concerning my skin, which a number of dermatologists have only made worse with chemicals.  I hope this review helps you, whomever you are.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I stopped using this after a few months. It&#x27;s really time consuming and I stopped seeing improvements after the product that came with it ran out. I&#x27;m not convinced that the light was behind the improvements at all. Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous Review:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 5 weeks. When I had started writing this review I literally went back to my records to look up when I had actually gotten the product because based on the results I have experienced, I could have sworn that I had been using it for three months or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the basics, I am a 25 year old female who has had severe acne since early childhood. I was on Accutane twice which worked but as you may know, the results only last up to 5 years and my acne has since come back full force. I have tried a variety of topical \\&quot;programs\\&quot; including Proactiv, Clinique&#x27;s acne line and AcneFree. They didn&#x27;t control my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one week of using ANSR (both the device and the skin products) I noticed a difference. My face did dry out some (which has since subsided) but the skin began to clear immediately. Within two weeks my husband and coworkers noticed and started complimenting me on my skin. I get a pimple every so often but it clears up within two days or less. This is compared to having three to five large pimples and many other smaller pimples all going at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read several medical research papers about the acne-reducing effects of the blue/red light combo and am so grateful that it is available in such an accessible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A challenge for some (other than the price) may be the amount of time and discipline required to use this product consistently. I have a routine that works for me and I love the effects enough that the time commitment is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am a little disappointed with how little my scarring has faded but then I remind myself it has only been five weeks. The scarring has noticeably faded but is still obvious and present. As I plan to use this product indefinitely, I hope to experience even more fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I was extremely hesitant to try another \\&quot;miracle cure\\&quot; especially one that cost this much money - but IT IS WORTH IT! I highly recommend it so someone who is disciplined enough to use it consistently for the time period specified.</li>
    <li> This came up on the Vine newsletter just a week before my annual dermatologist visit.  Seemed like I would at least entertain him, so why not?  First, I&#x27;m a 52-yo guy who has never totally escaped acne.  I&#x27;ve been on one course of Acutane, which has knocked down the problem -- but it&#x27;s still there.  OK, enough about me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the blue/red LED light source (the ANSR beam) on one side of my body for four days, leaving the other alone.  I did use their \\&quot;goop\\&quot; on both sides.  My acne got a little better, but I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between the two sides.  My little one-person study was stopped after my dermatologist&#x27;s visit; I&#x27;m now on \\&quot;real\\&quot; medication to knock things down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what did my dermatologist have to say about it?  He mostly snickered.  He did say there was something to the specific wavelengths (and showed me a brochure for an intense in-office treatment that uses blue light).  But he thought at the levels of light produced by the ANSR that it wouldn&#x27;t make too much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interesting tidbit: my device had a \\&quot;non-FDA approved device\\&quot; sticker on it.  Since I can&#x27;t believe the thing could do any harm, I suspect this means that there hasn&#x27;t been an FDA study to show the efficacy of the device/treatment.  However, looking at ANSR&#x27;s website showed that there are a number of studies for red/blue light acne treatment -- but I couldn&#x27;t find anything that discussed whether the ANSR beam mirrored the devices used in the studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what do I really think?  It&#x27;s supposed to take 2-4 weeks to show a difference, and I&#x27;m now on a regular course of treatment for a recent outbreak.  So, I can&#x27;t tell.  Do I think it would work if I stuck it out?  Maybe, but I&#x27;m a lot more comfortable when a medical device has to go through a formal study to show both its safety and efficacy.  So I guess I&#x27;d have to recommend folks stay away for now -- not because I know of anything wrong with the product, but only because I can&#x27;t find objective info from anyplace that tells me it&#x27;s worth the money.  It&#x27;d be great if something like this did work, however, so keep checking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;m not a health professional -- so just take my review as coming from a fellow sufferer.rom anyplace that tells me it&#x27;s worth the money.

    <li> I am wary of products that are not FDA approved.  As someone who works in the Clinical Trials industry, testing medicine and medical devices for safety and efficacy before they go to market, I know that there is really only one reason to not seek FDA approval: The product doesn&#x27;t work.  There is probably nothing dangerous about it, because if so the threat of lawsuits would more than overshadow any potential profits.  But no one can sue for lack of efficacy, especially when no specific claims where made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that blue/red light treatment does work, and can be highly effective in destroying the bacteria that causes acne.  Generally, applications of three successive days can have dramatic effects, killing as much as 99% of the bacteria.  Constant usage over a period of months can eliminate all of the bacteria, although 10% of users will see no effect whatsoever.  In clinical trials that have been done, home light boxes such as this one have proven to be just as effective as more expensive  dermatological treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is general information, and what does it have to do with the \\&quot;ANSR Acne Care Starter Kit\\&quot;?  It does seem to be an effective blue/red light therapy device.  The amount of creams you are required to use muddle things up a bit, as it is unclear if the acne is being eliminated by the light therapy or simply having the symptoms cleared up by the acne cream.  ANSR seems determined to cover its bases by giving you both light and cream treatments.  The instructions inside are a bit wanting, and they could have gone into much more detail.  How long for each affected spot?  When can I expect to see results?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue light therapy has been approved by the FDA, even if this particular device has not.  With the approval of the therapy, several companies are trying to cash in by rushing their devices to market without the long period of clinical trials, and this means they are going to be hit or miss.  Redness and dry skin are normal side effects of blue light therapy, and are not unique to this device, something that would need to be pointed out in an FDA approved device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would recommend hunting for an FDA approved device, which should come to market soon.  The technology is good, and blue light therapy does work, but ANSR really needs to take the time to prove that their device works as well.ght therapy, and are not unique to this device, something that would need to be pointed out in an FDA approved device.

    <li> I have been using this system for just about a month now. The experience has been a good one.&lt;br /&gt;I am 60.And if anyone out here my age experiences an occasional zit,then you know that it just happens and there isn&#x27;t much we can do about it.Until now. I would get about three or four a week,for unknown reasons,because I keep my skin clean and use light make-up cover.But I began using this product and I am down to maybe one zit every couple of weeks. I actually got a compliment from a person who knows my age,and who told me my skin looked great. I haven&#x27;t heard that for quite a while.It felt good.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: My pores seem to have been refined after using this system of skin care. I keep looking in a close-up mirror because I can&#x27;t believe my skin looks so good. At 60!!&lt;br /&gt;Also:the instructions do advise to cut back a little on the number of applications of the zit cream because it may cause dryness.It did,just a little,and I cut back. But I discovered that it wasn&#x27;t really dryness:it was dead skin being sloughed off my face,and now my skin is as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this product would work on a young person,but for an old coot like me,it works wonderfully well.I can&#x27;t imagine that it wouldn&#x27;t help younger folks.geeze...I do sound like an old coot.</li>
    <li> I ordered ANSR Acne Care with no expectations that it would actually perform as advertised.  After all, I remember the electrolysis gizmo that promised to kill hair at the roots, and the electronic gizmo that promised to scare away all bugs for miles around.  And those are just for starters! How many gizmos have I bought that sounded great and failed miserably?  More than I care to remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here&#x27;s this little plastic light thing that promises to kill bacteria on the skin.  How&#x27;s that again?  How can a little light that fits in the palm of your hand possibly be effective?  I don&#x27;t know how -- but I know that it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some time, I&#x27;ve had a problem with acne that arises from constant contact with my glasses.  I&#x27;ve washed both glasses and skin religiously.  Nothing.  No results.  But within 6 days after using the ANSR light, the problems have disappeared.  Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you compare the price for this kit with the price of a single visit to a dermatologist, you may decide to try the kit.  No, it&#x27;s not cheap, but compared to multiple visits to a specialist, it&#x27;s worth a try.  Perhaps, like me, you&#x27;ll find it a valuable asset.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of how this would work, after all, there is a wide rage of ratings and like most products it works for some people and not others. But after doing some research into light therapy and other products I picked this one to try.    First off, I have cystic acne along my jaw/chin and stubborn deep pores and blackheads along my cheeks and nose. I use a clarisonic  face scrubber and neutrogena acne wash and toner, followed by olay active hydrating beauty fluid. (Except for the clarisonic it is a fairly cheap system.) I had found that this system cleared up regular acne and for the most part kept everything in check without over drying, and it worked for the most part. I still had bumps along my jaw and stuff across my cheeks and nose, but it wasn&#x27;t breaking out all the time. However I am pale by nature so all of that stuff and old acne scars looked very bad on me.    But being that I still had those problems I was always on the look out for something that would help more, especially as an aspiring actress. This is it. I&#x27;m done. I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another product for my acne, because this works. I&#x27;ve only had it less than two weeks (using only the light, not the products that came with) and here are my results:    -Cystic bumps are not bumpy any more and are on their way to gone.  -Pores across cheeks and nose are shrinking.  -Stubborn acne that was in those pores is being pushed out and looking great.  -Skin texture is softer, smoother, and less pitted from scarring.  -Redness and sore spots are greatly reduced, and for once my skin is looking porcelain instead of just pale.  -Scarring seems to be fading.    Overall: I recommend this to anyone, whether you have a system that works or not. Just remember to clean the lens. And if you have a system that works, just buy the Beam and charger not the set.    EDIT: Okay, I bought this a few years ago and it was great. But it took a long time since the lens was so small, eventually the lens cracked, youcouldn&#x27;t use it while it was plugged in, and the batter life tanked. I upgraded to a hand wand with a bigger light lens, a long power cord and no battery. It had no time limit and was much easier to use. This was a great product to test if light therapy works for you, but if you know it does, I would get a bigger better device. This is good for spot treatments, but for whole face coverage, get something bigger.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d wait four months before writing a review on this. I purchased this in April with high hopes. I used the lotions with the beam product.  At first, I think I saw more acne. I thought my skin was purging. Okay. I used the day and night ANSR lotions that came with the package. The ingredient that it contained was Salicylic Acid, which isn&#x27;t too surprising. I felt like the makers of ANSR threw those in as a safety net in case the beams did not work too well. The day and night lotions were actually quite drying on my skin, so I decided to skip some days and use it sparingly or only at times when my acne flare ups were bad. After two months of using this product, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin. In fact, during the biggest monthly flare ups, I thought that my diligence in using this product would somehow lessen the flare ups in the coming days. Not so much. I felt like whether I used this product or not, my skin flared up and healed the same way before I purchased and used this product.     The directions said to put the beam in direct contact with the skin, so I did. I honestly think that this somehow transferred bacteria to other parts of the skin, causing new flare ups. On days when I concentrated the beam on spot areas, I expected to see some results. Not so much. in fact, it might have gotten worse (again, due to bacteria transfer?)     I stopped using the ANSR a month ago because I didn&#x27;t see any improvement. However,  I may start giving it another go because I hate to admit that I lost money on this product. What I might change from here on forth is to use alcohol wipes to clean the lense of the product right before and after I used it. Maybe I&#x27;m not cleaning the lense head enough and I&#x27;m the one causing the bacteria to transfer to other areas of my skin.     I will update this review after another fresh start and see if my opinions remain the same.</li>
    <li> Wow, what&#x27;ll they think of next?  Acne care&#x27;s gotta be a big boomin&#x27; business when anyone can pretty much release anything at anytime to prey on those with skin issues.  Right off the bat so everyone knows, this product IS NOT FDA approved.  Right there that oughta tell ya something.  I grew up having pretty bad Acne in my teens, now not so much, but I still have my occasional out breaks over the winter months.  I&#x27;ve recently had a nasty cluster erupt so thought I&#x27;d give the latest gimmick.. er, I mean \\&quot;ANSR\\&quot; a shot.  Can any Amazonians out there guess what my results were?  If you guessed trivial, you&#x27;d be wrong, there was nothing trivial about it.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned the stuff just doesn&#x27;t work.  So you know, outta the box you get a super duper special soap to be used before you use blinding (lawsuit waiting to happen in a box)light thingy, plus a cream to be used during the day &amp; one to be used at night.  I did everything the instructions told me to (probably lost some eye sight function in the procees) for a couple days &amp; not only did things not get better, it actually probably made things worse.  In my opinion the skin care business is a complete racket.  All these \\&quot;specially made\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;clinically proven\\&quot; products out there have only ever made things worse &amp; that&#x27;s how they get you.  More zits means more creams &amp; cleaning pads, which means more money shelled out to these crooks.  Do youself a favor if you&#x27;re looking for the ultimate cure &amp; leave this stuff where it belongs, save your money &amp; put this junk in the garbage.  Complete waste of time, money &amp; life.  Save yours &amp; completely skip this most recent from the so called \\&quot;Skin Care\\&quot; industry.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ANSWER TO FIGHTING ACNE! After trying all sorts acne cleansers and treatements, I was recommended this product and it has been a miracle. You can not pick at your acne and expect it to get better though. Even the most unsightly acne you have to ignore, just exfoliate face with a good cleansers (the ones that come with this product are great)and use this product.  Its truely amazing the difference you will see in a couple months time.  It only works if you stick with it.  Although it takes awhile for acne to clear using this product you will notice a difference in the smoothness of your skin after just one use; as time goes on you&#x27;ll notice acne blemishes reducing and scars &amp; other inperfections to minimize. The more you use this product the quicker you&#x27;ll see results, I recommend using it atleast twice daily. If you use this product religously, it WILL WORK WONDERS!</li>
    <li> This products did not worked for me at all. i broke out more all over my jaw line and my neck and my forehead. I have used this products for about two weeks and before i used it my face was better than after i used the ANSR.</li>
    <li> The [[ASIN:B001K7IITC ANSR Acne Care Starter Kit]] did not work for me.     The first step, the ANSR: PREP Face wash : all this did was make the skin on my face flaky and dry. It didn&#x27;t help my acne at all    Step 2 : the ANSR: BEAM. The Blue and Red lights are supposed to penetrate the skin and fade redness and scars and destroy acne causing bacteria. For me, All The beam did was give my face a [[ASIN:B0012C7TKY Sensual Seduction]]. When I applied it to my face, the next day, my pimples were actually bigger.    Steps 3/4 : The Night and day treatments. This was the only portion of this kit that worked. All you do is apply the treatment to a pimple to have it go away. It pretty much does what [[ASIN:B001G7PPCY Clean &amp; Clear Invisible Blemish Treatment]] and/or [[ASIN:B001E96OO2 Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment]] does, which is eliminate pimples and blemishes overnight.     To sum it up, save your money. This doesn&#x27;t work too well. Plus, 3-4 steps to get rid of acne is just too much work</li>
    <li> I have hereditary over-active oily skin and have been plagued with break-outs almost my entire life. Finally there is this brilliant series of products and a light treatment device that have completely cleared my skin. It&#x27;s like a miracle.   Well packaged,well designed, with clear instructions,the scrub and the two products,one for day and one for night,along with the blue light/red light (small, rechargeable (charger included)) device are easy to use and in just a few short weeks have made a real difference in the texture and look of my skin. Stop spending a fortune on dermatologist visits(I have) and order this incredible system! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> First off, I personally do not care that this is not FDA approved. Since when does the FDA look after our well being versus fattening their wallets with harmful drugs that are \\&quot;FDA approved?\\&quot; Oh please.    Second, I wasted more money on the Zeno which did absolutely nothing on my hormonal cycstic acne.    I have tried everything, the pill (made me fat but worked for a while), Proactiv (also worked for a couple months), a cocktail or oral anti-biotics, Retina-A (worthless), Tazorac (my face peeled, acne stayed). In other words, I just gave up and decided to spend my money on makeup to hide my acne rather than try to treat it.    I was recommended light therapy once but given the price tag, I never tried it. So when I found this I decided to give it a try. My husband and I could share it and get our money back if it didn&#x27;t work.    So we&#x27;ve been using it for 5 days now and I totally notice a difference. My discolorations from previous acne have lightened and the number of pimples has significantly decreased. And I don&#x27;t even use the products, although they are paraben-free which is nice.    I don&#x27;t get how some some reviewers are saying they are not sure if it works, yet they only have \\&quot;a few pimples.\\&quot; Um, if you have barely any pimples to begin with why are you using this?????    Bottom line - I consider it a miracle for my face. I don&#x27;t have to take any drugs and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> The batteries are rechargeable, the charge lasts about 3 uses. I have a lot of cystic acne and it does help clear them up faster than not using it at all. It does work better on regular acne lesions.  I tried another product that used red lights but didn&#x27;t see any results so decided to try this. I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to know whether it will help with lines. The cremes do not cause breakouts, I just wish the tubes were larger. One of the other reviewers noted they broke out more after starting touse it but whenever you start to treat acne you always break out more after 2-3 weeks as treating brings more to the surface. After that the acne should start to improve so it may take 6 weeks before you see any effect. There was a sticker on the device saying it wasn&#x27;t FDA approved.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using the product for almost 1 month now. I&#x27;ve stopped using the creams as I wanted to see what effect just using the unit would have. I haven&#x27;t had any excessive drying of skin. The initial breakouts I was having with starting to use the unit have now cleared. I&#x27;ve had a few small acne lesions develop but they were gone within 1 day. The thing that has impressed me is I haven&#x27;t had any cystic lesions occur the last 2 weeks and usually by now I would have another. I have used the unit at least once a day but twice a day on the weekends. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in fine lines yet, hopefully this will occur with longer use.</li>
    <li> I gave the ANSR kit to a friend with skin troubles. After the first few weeks, she was optimistic, but after about 6 weeks of use, it was a disappointment. Here&#x27;s what she had to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ANSR Beam Therapy Light seems to work best if you have very mild break outs that are close to the surface of the skin.  I have rosacea and have deep cysts and pimples and the ANSR Beam didn&#x27;t faze them.  The light doesn&#x27;t penetrate deep enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the occasional light break out, the Beam would probably work fairly well.  But, if you have more aggressive break outs like I do, it probably won&#x27;t work very well for you.</li>
    <li> I have now used the RED light in the beam for 12 months (10 minutes a day) and the amount of comments I receive regarding my young looks are simply astonishing.  People ask me all the time...\\&quot;what are you doing\\&quot;.  My answer.....The Beam!    I have not used this product for acne (blue light) so I will not comment on this application.  However, for reducing wrinkles and lines in your face. WOW!!!!!  It works.</li>
    <li> While I would rather not draw attention to my recent skin problems, I would like to share my experience with the ANSR if it will help another acne-sufferer.    My acne condition: cycstic with redness.     I actually had the Tanda (another light therapy device) but it was almost $100 more expensive than the Tanda. So, I ordered the ANSR to test it out and decide which device to keep.    ANSR PROS:  -more \\&quot;bang for the buck\\&quot; because it includes red AND blue light therapy   -small, ergonomic device  -this kit came with great smelling face wash &amp; creams (BUT, they were not effective on my skin)    CONS:  -the lights are super bright, so I couldn&#x27;t even watch TV during the treatments; even when I closed my eyes, the lights were very bright  -the ANSR website and instructions tell you to use a \\&quot;sweeping motion\\&quot; across your skin to get the light therapy across your skin surface, BUT, I actually think this was irritating my skin (transferring bacteria)  -I did not see noticeable results in 1 week&#x27;s use    Conclusion:  I have already returned the ANSR kit to Amazon (thank you Amazon for being customer-friendly!)  I will be keeping my Tanda device.    Let me know if you have any questions! Acne has been a very unfortunate experience these past few months, and I hope to be of help to someone.</li>
    <li> worked wonders on my skin - love it</li>
    <li> I bought this back in November after a friend saw it online and told me about it. I started using the topicals but then got lazy and only use them occasionally now. However, the light has produced significant results for me. It took a few weeks but I&#x27;ve really cleared up since using it, especially around my mouth and jaw. It was actually kind of crazy how fast it did work compared with all the other things I&#x27;ve used in the past. Now I&#x27;m not sure if ANY topicals work, from any company (we all know that Proactive is snake oil -- sigh).</li>
    <li> Had a few days to use this. My wife tried it as well. Not to sure how they developed this; however I was a little concerned when I noticed that it was not \\&quot;FDA\\&quot; approved, especially since it emits a very extremely bright light. I would be cautious about using it around the facial area, especially without some sort of eye protection. Considering the price they are charging for this unit, they should have included eye protection. Did not notice any real improvement over acne or other skin blemishes. It is obvious that it will not give you overnight results. So, at this point, until further research is available, I would not recommend this product, especially for the price it is listed for.</li>
    <li> I really liked using this product and I noticed results after the first use. This is a 3/4 step product. The steps take 15 minutes to complete 2 times a day. It was rather tiresome doing this, but the results are worth it.    First you cleanse your face, then you add the special cream (either day or night depending on when your using it) The you use the light, 5 minutes of blue and 5 minutes of red. You just sit there with your eyes closed (or a mask/patch over them and sweep it across your face.    I noticed more pimples at first, but even then the redness was gone over night. Normally I have red blotchy skin. I even have a horrible dark spot that that gotten alot lighter using this product.     It&#x27;s expensive to start but it really does work.</li>
    <li> I got one of these kits for audition. Now, I&#x27;m 40+ years old, so I don&#x27;t suffer acne the way I did when I was half that age. But there&#x27;s still always a small pimple or three around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I was intrigued by this kit, although, as a scientist, also quite skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit consists of an electronic device that emits intense blue and red light, and a few face cleaning products. The basic idea is this: You clean your face with an astringent, then you take the electronic device and expose your face for five minutes to the blue light, then five minutes to the red light. Then you apply one of the acne medications (two different ones, depending on whether it&#x27;s morning or night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been scattered reports in the literature that intense blue light can help kill the bacteria that are responsible for breakouts. I don&#x27;t find it impossible to believe that that kind of treatment might have some affect. That said, I do find it a bit hard to believe that the intensity of light generated by this device--which can be sold and used without any special eye treatment, for example, and which generates the light from a small rechargable battery--is sufficient to actually effect any substantive changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to the manufacturer&#x27;s website, you can find pictures that supposedly demonstrate that this protocol does work. What is unclear, however, is whether the electronic device actually works, or whether the heightened attention that one pays to their face when applying the whole regiment--particularly the topicals--is the key. Put more simply: It is known that if you keep your face scrupulously clean, and if you also apply simple non-prescription acne medications (such as the ones included with this kit), most people can significantly affect the amount of acne they have. So the question is: Does the electronic device, by itself, really add anything to the effects one could expect using the topicals?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test this, for two weeks I applied different regiments to the two sides of my face. On the left side, I used the electronic device only. (Applied once at night after taking a shower, and once in the morning after treating my face with an astringent [rubbing alcohol]). On the right side, I applied the topicals, but didn&#x27;t use the electronic device. Now, I don&#x27;t have a lot of pimples, but there are always a few here or there. The idea was to see if there was any notable difference in the number/severity of breakouts on the two sides of my face over the two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result? I discerned no reduction in pimple frequency or duration on the left side of my face (using the electronic device). On the right side of my face, the pimples that appeared did seem to go away a little faster, although again I did not perceive that the number was smaller. Thus, in this limited study, I saw no convincing demonstration that the electronic device was actually effecting any changes by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I did make one interesting observation. On one side of my neck, there was a small area of low grade inflammation that had been there for a while. Over the course of this experiment, it seemed to go away. Whether that was coincidence, or whether it is due to the \\&quot;red light\\&quot; treatment by the electronic device (which is supposed to speed healing/recovery), I can&#x27;t say. But I did find it interesting enough that the next time I encounter inflammation such as that, I&#x27;ll try the device again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, then, in my (admittedly) limited trial: The electronic device did not appear to reduce the number or duration of outbreaks, relative to a regiment of just using the topicals, and in fact the regiment of just topicals seemed to be somewhat better than the device alone. However, it must be kept in mind that the total number of outbreaks over the two week period when I tested this product was limited. One interesting observation is that a pre-existing area of inflammation treatedwith the electronic device did go away during the test period, suggesting that further studies to determine if this was a real effect or coincidence are in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, this is an interesting concept, but I remain skeptical as to whether it actually works.suggesting that further studies to determine if this was a real effect or coincidence are in order.

    <li> Been using this on a family member for about two months now so my review reflect this time period.  We&#x27;ve tried many, many, other treatment programs for acne including both prescription and various snake-oil products listed everywhere on the web.  None of them has ever had any real meaningful effects, and some (usually the prescriptive ones) lead to serious side effects.  So we were looking forward to using this new product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patient in this case is an adult female of 20 years of age with very mild acne flareups, but enough so that the issue becomes a problem that needs to be dealt with.  In her case, a lot of older scarring has taken place with pitting and redness.  A goal is to reduce those spots&#x27; significance all the while preventing new acne from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product here claims to do all that through its cream treatments and light therapy device.  The creams are what anyone expects from an acne treatment -- apply to face varying times of the day and expect results.  But it&#x27;s the light therapy that is unique, as I haven&#x27;t seen that approach before.  There is no need to purchase &#x27;refills&#x27; for the light device so recurring costs for this isn&#x27;t a problem.  The creams are rather pricey, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patient applied the creams at its recommended intervals and utilized the light therapy daily as specified as well. Applications were diligent since the patient was curious to whether the treatment would actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary of results:  After about a week of use, redness from old scarring decreased about 20% and continued to decline to approximately 75% after two months.  This was surprising since we did not expect what really looks like a LED flashlight to do this! But it seemed to have done its deed.  Pitting itself however did not improve at all. The treatment regiment also seemed to have reduced the chance of new acne forming into larger pustules; instead to entirely eliminate all trace of it quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patient overall did not find the treatment regiment harsh or difficult to deal with.  There was some discomfort with the oily feel of the cream that is applied on at night.  But the cream applied for day use does not have that quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it seems that this product does seem to help with redness and reduce the chance of new acne forming.  But it failed to reduce the pitting of old scarring.  The creams are expensive to purchase so there is some hesitation to whether we will be continuing to utilize the product in the future.  Some discounting would help earn this product the full 5 stars.ment regiment harsh or difficult to deal with.  There was some discomfort with the oily feel of the cream that is applied on at night.
