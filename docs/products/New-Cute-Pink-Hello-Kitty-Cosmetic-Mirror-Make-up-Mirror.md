<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice for an 8 y/o. she will get a kick out of it !!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and vey accurate product.</li>
    <li> This product was not what I expected. My daughter played with it for two days and now it&#x27;s broken</li>
    <li> Came out of the box broke</li>
    <li> It arrived way before expected, works great.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. It&#x27;s a great size and it&#x27;s Hello Kitty which is perfect.</li>
    <li> Cute, fast delivery, received as gift, handle with care, hopefully it last me a week.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror...it is a little smaller than i expected...but i love it....i just did NOT appreciate how it was shipped...the boxes were very crappy....inside the box was not even closed...there was no padding in between...and the shipping box was very thin, only being held shut by a sticker...i was surprised i received it in good condition!!!</li>
    <li> The customer service was great. This is small yet pretty and Useful. It&#x27;s the size of a hand held mirror. Be careful and place it somewhere where it won&#x27;t be dropped. I only say that because the company had to replace my first one because the back of it arrived in pieces. This definitely is great for individuals who adore Hello Kitty.</li>
    <li> Kelly kitty mirror came fast and exactly how it showed in picture. Very happy with it</li>
    <li> Bought for my eight year old.. she is constantly in my makeup, thought it would be cute.. more appropriate for a 3yr old... very small</li>
    <li> Not waterproof. Splash proof.</li>
    <li> If you love hello kitty you will like this it so cute . I don&#x27;t even use this it&#x27;s just on my desk .</li>
    <li> Great for the price, but very cheaply made. Any little kid would break this in a second. It sits in my office to remind me to smile through out the day.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect mirror for a Hello Kitty lover.  You can turn it around to use it as a decoration while the mirror is not being used.  Nice quality and a great price</li>
    <li> I love HK and this mirror is just adorable! I get compliments on it all the time!  Great gift for the HK fan in your life!</li>
    <li> It took a bit longer then expected but my daughter absolutely loved it..</li>
    <li> Good price but cheap material, my daughter broke it the day she opened it, i kept the mirror but not the base. I didnt want her to scratch or cut herself. ..didnt want to give 2 stars because it was cute</li>
    <li> The mirror stand broke easily and into very sharp shards!!!</li>
    <li> The mirror is cute but literally fell apart within minutes of gentle handling. My daughter was so sad.  Thank God for glue and duck tape!</li>

    <li> wat i got came in a old box with faded colors and it was open and like dented and jus looked used! and there was no way for me to stand it up cuz the flat bottom was not there, maybe it fell off? it would have been so cute if it cud stand up, i would give full stars then</li>
    <li> I really loved how fast it came and how the packaging was. I do recommend people buying this because it&#x27;s a great product!!</li>

    <li> A little cheap looking, but it is still very cute and would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Hello Kitty. Was very pleased.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved the mirror.  She is 11 and just loves doing make up but is still a little girl, so the Hello Kitty was a good match.</li>
    <li> Great for hello kitty lovers</li>
    <li> Our 9 year old granddaughter simply loves anything from &amp;#34;Hello Kitty&amp;#34;...This Cute Cosmetic Mirror will look very nice in her room to see just how beautiful she is everyday....Pop-Pop &amp; Nana loves her so much!!!</li>
    <li> Love my Hello Kitty mirror, seller needs to check description.  This for the bathroom, not for a car .</li>

It arrived much faster than the estimated delivery date and was shipped within 24 hours of placing my order.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for the Hello Kitty Lover in the office. It took a while to arrive but sooooo Cute it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for a Christmas gift on Dec 16th and was given the estimated delivery date at Jan10-Jan28. It surprisingly reached on Dec 24th just in time to be wrapped. It was given to my 6 year old cousin who absolutely loves it. It&#x27;s perfect her size. The base doesn&#x27;t stick though but not surprising for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a desk or a girl who loves playing dress-up.</li>
    <li> Really nice .... Just as the picture indicate . Mirror a bit smaller than expected</li>
    <li> my granddaughter will love this</li>

    <li> many compliments from office staff.  they are jealous</li>
    <li> I waited a long time to receive this item and the quality is equivalent to something I could buy at the Dollar store. Not happy with this at all.</li>
    <li> Personally, I find Hello Kitty revolting, but BFF Annie has a huge collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best I can say is that this was a very easy pick for a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> great item not cheezie.fast delivery,would buy from this dealer again</li>
    <li> This mirror is crap!!!! The box it comes in says &amp;#34;NEW MIRROR&amp;#34;. This thing is so beat up and scratched up. Its missing paint on the whiskers and eyes. Even the mirror itself has HUGE scratches in it. Size wise its perfect...everything else about it sucks! Don&#x27;t waste your money. The seller shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to sell this junk! Shame on you!</li>
    <li> bought as a birthday gift for my daughter. Can not wait to give it to her. Very simple cute mirror.</li>
    <li> Love it! Bought one for my daughter and one as a gift for another kid. Makes a great gift.</li>
