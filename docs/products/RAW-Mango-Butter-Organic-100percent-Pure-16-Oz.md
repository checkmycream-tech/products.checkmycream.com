      <li>I love that this is all natural and great quality and quantity for what you&#x27;re paying!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant, mild smell, that can blend into body butter recipes or my favorite, home-made sunscreen recipe with zinc oxide, coconut oil, palma rosa, and grapeseed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So now I am very pleased and plan on contacting them to purchase both the original and the re-shipped product.  </li>

      <li>Arrived on time and love the texture.</li>
      <li>I love using it on my hair and skin.</li>
      <li>This mango butter is fantastic!</li>
      <li>this is my favorite body butter</li>
      <li>Better than Coco butter.</li>
      <li>I am so much in love with this product.</li>
      <li>LOVE this.  </li>
      <li>Ok, not die, but you know.</li>
      <li>Thoughtfully packaged in a nice reusable 16 oz plastic jar, secured in not one, but two bubble envelopes, and tape galore, it arrived more than safely.</li>
      <li>This item was packaged nicely inside a 16oz plastic jar with a dome lid that was securely inside a plastic bag.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, smells great, easy to measure, very moisturizing!</li>
      <li>Yet, it quickly melts into your skin after a warm shower.</li>
      <li>So far im happy with products I ordered from Dr adorable</li>
      <li>Shea and illipe or very good for moisturizing and shine while the mango butter adds a softness to the hair that can&#x27;t be explained only demonstrated.</li>
      <li>but I received exactly what I ordered and was very pleased with the quality.</li>
      <li>easy to scoop out and spread on the skin.</li>
      <li>Quick service!</li>
      <li>a great big yes</li>
      <li>I did have a slight problem with the shipping and the arrival of the Mango Butter but Dr. Adorable Inc. took care of the matter very quickly and did a splendid job at customer service.</li>
      <li>also it is not as rich and greasy as shea butter.</li>
      <li>Hardly any scent, completely smooth and delicious feeling.</li>
      <li>It was nicely packaged and it came pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Not bad though, in comparison to cocoa butter, beeswax, and coconut oil smells.</li>
      <li>I love this butter particularly for summer lotions as it has an almost powdery finish.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
      <li>I put this mango butter on my face, neck, and chest before bed and when I wake up it has completely absorbed, my skin is soft and smooth!  </li>
      <li>the jar was very oily when it came - it was hot out - but it was wrapped well enough that no leakage occurred, and I&#x27;ve been delighted with the quality.</li>
      <li>Great, but hard to scoop out of the container.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering more for my next batch of body butter recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: if only it had free shipping!</li>
      <li>and the order that Dr Adorable expedited for shipment, when I told them I hadn&#x27;t yet gotten my prior order.  </li>
      <li>This is better than Shea butter, which have a musty scent especially the yellow one which most vendors add palm oil to.</li>
      <li>I will be trying some of their other products as well as ordering more of this mango butter!</li>
      <li>It is very creamy and smooth and comes in a really cute air tight container.  </li>
      <li>I really like this.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it much for the lotions I make.  </li>
      <li>This is really packed in the container.</li>
      <li>Real deal just needs to find a mixture or a carrier oil</li>
      <li>My hair much prefers this than shea butter</li>
      <li>I have bought mango butter elsewhere, but this was MUCH nicer.</li>
      <li>I also ordered a few other butters from this company and have been more than satisfied everytime!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Very moisturing,</li>
      <li>The consistency was good and no bad odor or anything wrong with this product.</li>
      <li>I usually melt it and mix it with olive oil and coconut oil and then whip it to a nice buttery finish.</li>
      <li>After melting the Mango butter and adding my oils plus sweet orange essential oil</li>
      <li>/&gt;There was a slight mix up with my order but Dr Adorable corrected the issue within a day and even let me keep the accidentally sent product.</li>
      <li>I got this mainly to use in my skincare regimen.</li>
      <li>The smell was very light as it should be and the texture was soft and extremely moisturizing.</li>
      <li>it was more like hand lotion and a little greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other mango butters but none were as soft and easy to work with as this particular mango butter.</li>
      <li>I had originally ordered a product, due for delivery03/04/14 that the USPS, had no record of.</li>
      <li>(I pictured it more like Cocoa butter, hard and to be melted)</li>
      <li>I like the color and consistency, but it&#x27;s completely odorless.</li>
      <li>I used it after my shower this morning, and my hands stayed soft even after I&#x27;d washed them a couple of times.</li>
      <li>and it did not keep my face feel soft; it didn&#x27;t stay hydrated.</li>
      <li>The mango butter itself was an off white color with no smell, and the consistency is a bit thick, but no worries it will easily melt just in your fingertips when your ready to apply it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really enjoyed making body butter with a little of this in it!!!</li>
      <li>It keeps my dry skin and type 4 hair very soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>This is my first experience with Raw Mango butter, so i am not sure what exactly it should smell or look like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very smooth and rich; this was my first experience with mango butter: its great!</li>
    <li> Great, but hard to scoop out of the container. I have to stab a spoon into it to scrape out.</li>
    <li> Read the previous reviews and I thought I would try it. Very moisturing, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. I had to add some essential olis to it.</li>
    <li> Great product made for some amazing hair products and lotions. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love this butter particularly for summer lotions as it has an almost powdery finish. Melts well and skin loves it.&lt;br /&gt;There was a slight mix up with my order but Dr Adorable corrected the issue within a day and even let me keep the accidentally sent product. What a nice surprise! I have used these products for about a year and will continue to do so as I have never been let down by the quality or customer care.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, smells great, easy to measure, very moisturizing! I will buy this product again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product!  I use it from anything to lip balms to whipped body butter to soap making.  Feels great on the skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it came in a small jar and I absolutely loved it. It was actually what cemented my decision to base all body butters off mango butter and decide against primarily using shea butter. I actually kept the jar and reused it too!</li>
    <li> a little gritty, but still experimenting with my creams</li>
    <li> This item was packaged nicely inside a 16oz plastic jar with a dome lid that was securely inside a plastic bag. The mango butter was of great quality. The smell was very light as it should be and the texture was soft and extremely moisturizing. I will be trying some of their other products as well as ordering more of this mango butter!</li>
    <li> It was nicely packaged and it came pretty fast. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it, there is a very faint buttery smell. This is my first experience with Raw Mango butter, so i am not sure what exactly it should smell or look like.</li>
    <li> Quick service! I use this butter for several different things; my hair, use it as lotion combined with several other oils. This is really packed in the container.</li>
    <li> I just wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.  There is no label with what is it; I know it is suppose to be 100% mango; but where is the label stating this.  When applied to my face; it made my face greasy.  I had to keep rubbing it in and it did not keep my face feel soft; it didn&#x27;t stay hydrated.</li>
    <li> At room temp, it&#x27;s solid and thick. Yet, it quickly melts into your skin after a warm shower. Throughout the day, it forms a moisturizing barrier to prevent dried skin from frequent hand-washing in the kitchen, or wherever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant, mild smell, that can blend into body butter recipes or my favorite, home-made sunscreen recipe with zinc oxide, coconut oil, palma rosa, and grapeseed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering more for my next batch of body butter recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of texture, it feels less greasy and dissolves into skin faster than coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: if only it had free shipping!</li>
    <li> Will order again...  Everything is as it should be here.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> So far im happy with products I ordered from Dr adorable</li>
    <li> I like to use this butter in conduction with illipe, and shea butter. Shea and illipe or very good for moisturizing and shine while the mango butter adds a softness to the hair that can&#x27;t be explained only demonstrated. Mango butter works best with shea and maybe kokum and/or illipe. I&#x27;ve purchased other mango butters but none were as soft and easy to work with as this particular mango butter.</li>
    <li> The consistency was good and no bad odor or anything wrong with this product. It arrived on time and in good condition. I have used shea butter before but this gives my hair shine that lasts for days unlike shea butter. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I use this for body butter and in my hair instead of shea butter. It keeps my dry skin and type 4 hair very soft and moisturized. I usually melt it and mix it with olive oil and coconut oil and then whip it to a nice buttery finish. There was really not a smell that I noticed either.</li>
    <li> Seriously how can one not love Mango butter</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! It came well wrapped in a 16oz plastic tub (which it can be reused for your own sugar scrub or body butter.) The mango butter itself was an off white color with no smell, and the consistency is a bit thick, but no worries it will easily melt just in your fingertips when your ready to apply it.  I got this mainly to use in my skincare regimen. I put this mango butter on my face, neck, and chest before bed and when I wake up it has completely absorbed, my skin is soft and smooth!  I have oily acne prone skin and this product doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout , in fact my blemishes heal a little faster! I love that this is all natural and great quality and quantity for what you&#x27;re paying!</li>
    <li> Mmmmm....mango-y... No, not really, it actually doesn&#x27;t have a noticable smell. Thoughtfully packaged in a nice reusable 16 oz plastic jar, secured in not one, but two bubble envelopes, and tape galore, it arrived more than safely. The butter has a similar consistency to shea, but lighter and easier to &amp;#34;melt.&amp;#34; Whipped it up with some mango essential oil, castor oil and glycerin (yes, I actually bought some), it makes a lotion/hair product to die for. Ok, not die, but you know.</li>
    <li> This mashes my hair feels wonderful. Especially after it&#x27;s been in a couple days. I can tell a big difference when I dont use it. My hair much prefers this than shea butter</li>
    <li> LOVE this.  Arrived on time and love the texture.</li>
    <li> My mango butter arrived in yesterday&#x27;s post. I like the color and consistency, but it&#x27;s completely odorless. I made a small batch of hair butter (mango butter, vitamin e oil, cedarwood EO and red thyme EO) with it last night. My hair wasn&#x27;t crazy about it; it didn&#x27;t really absorb into my hair the way shea butter and coconut oil do, and this morning my strands felt a bit sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, moisturize my face with just the mango butter and the vitamin e oil, and goodness does my skin love it! I used it after my shower this morning, and my hands stayed soft even after I&#x27;d washed them a couple of times. I can&#x27;t wait to use this mango butter in my homemade sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum:&lt;br /&gt;hair &#x3D; not so much&lt;br /&gt;skin &#x3D; a great big yes</li>
    <li> Great product. I did have a slight problem with the shipping and the arrival of the Mango Butter but Dr. Adorable Inc. took care of the matter very quickly and did a splendid job at customer service.</li>
    <li> Great butter, I mix it with others and get wonderful results.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I am so much in love with this product. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. After melting the Mango butter and adding my oils plus sweet orange essential oil it smell like icing on a red velvet cake. I could not wait to take a shower just to rub it on to my skin. This is better than Shea butter, which have a musty scent especially the yellow one which most vendors add palm oil to. Better than Coco butter. this is my favorite body butter and I will stick with it.</li>
    <li> The mango butter arrived promptly and was fresh and of good quality. I love using it on my hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Today both shipments came together.  I had originally ordered a product, due for delivery03/04/14 that the USPS, had no record of. and the order that Dr Adorable expedited for shipment, when I told them I hadn&#x27;t yet gotten my prior order.  So now I am very pleased and plan on contacting them to purchase both the original and the re-shipped product.  It was the postal service that was in error and I gave  Dr Adorable the bad review. I apologize for that. It is the fault of the USPS only.</li>
    <li> I really like this. Works great in my body butters and creams. I do think next time that I will try some deoderized to see if there is less scent. Not bad though, in comparison to cocoa butter, beeswax, and coconut oil smells.</li>
    <li> I add it to my body butter recipes and it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Was not sure what to expect at first but I received exactly what I ordered and was very pleased with the quality.</li>
    <li> Works great in my soap.</li>
    <li> This mango butter feels great on your skin! I&#x27;m very happy with Dr Adorable and their products. Items shipped promptly and are quality products.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Adorable! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really enjoyed making body butter with a little of this in it!!! Fantastic product!!!</li>
    <li> nice butter. easy to scoop out and spread on the skin. not as dense and grainy as shea butter. also it is not as rich and greasy as shea butter. no particular smell. very good moisturizer but if you want something hard core, go with shea. this one is lighter.</li>
    <li> Real deal just needs to find a mixture or a carrier oil</li>
    <li> I highly doubt this was unrefined raw mango butter (I pictured it more like Cocoa butter, hard and to be melted) it was more like hand lotion and a little greasy.  Still gave it 2 stars because I could use it, but I didn&#x27;t like it much for the lotions I make.  I wish there was a description on the packaging instead of just a sticker that said &amp;#34;mango butter.&amp;#34;  I would not purchase anything from this seller again since I don&#x27;t actually know what is in the packaging.</li>
    <li> Product itself was great. The container was oily all over the outside when it finally arrived a day late. It shipped right away and arrived late dueto usps. I used it to make body butter!</li>
    <li> This mango butter is fantastic! It is very creamy and smooth and comes in a really cute air tight container.  It arrived fast and in perfect condition.  I also ordered a few other butters from this company and have been more than satisfied everytime!</li>
    <li> I have bought mango butter elsewhere, but this was MUCH nicer. Hardly any scent, completely smooth and delicious feeling. No graininess, melts just beautifully into my handcrafted body and face lotions. I will stick with this brand from now on. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived double wrapped in a jar . . . the jar was very oily when it came - it was hot out - but it was wrapped well enough that no leakage occurred, and I&#x27;ve been delighted with the quality.</li>
    <li> Very good on skin. Takes time to melt it in hands, but my skin loved it :) to my surprise worked on stretch marks. they are still there, but not so visible.</li>
    <li> Yes I found it easy to use and it seemed good for the skin</li>
</ol>
