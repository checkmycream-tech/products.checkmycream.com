<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells fantastic and moisturizes deeply! LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> There is a J.R. Watkins cream or lotion for every room of your house. This lemon cream is nice to keep in the kitchen. When you apply it however you may become hungry for lemon cookies. It has a mildly sweet aroma and smells more like lemon juice than lemon zest. I was surprised that this is as moisturizing as the shea butter body creams. This has some good ingredients like apricot oil, shea butter, cocoa seed butter, coconut oil and jojoba oil. Definitely one of the best hand and body lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried. I use it mainly as a hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and conditions without feeling greasy!</li>
    <li> Does not leave you with that greasy feeling, smell stays with you all day. You can tell its natural. I will definitely be rebuying this product.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and is super thick</li>
    <li> The scent is delicious! I like the texture of this lotion better than the hand cream, which is much thicker and doesn&#x27;t soak in as well. BEWARE: mine arrived with a flip top, not the pump that was pictured.</li>
    <li> I really love the Watkins brand. Hard to believe how long the company has been around.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell...isn&#x27;t sticky. Recommend&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of lemon pie..yum</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product... having ordered it several times!  The scent is wonderful (like lemon creme pie); there are no harmful ingredients; and it works great!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of hand/body lotions, and this is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Quick delivery</li>
    <li> Yeah, this stuff is good. I started using it when I lived in a really cold climate. It&#x27;ll repair cracked, bleeding knuckles in about two uses. It smells like lemon cookies. So, as a guy, I only use it when I&#x27;m not going anywhere.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of lemons, and this smells like lemon cake! I use it mostly on my hands, but it works well for the whole body.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom, as I had used it in the past.  Love the scent and the product.</li>
    <li> Great, nice fragrance and creamy. Moisturizes well</li>
    <li> This product moisturizes well, does not contain gluten, and smells amazing. I smell like a lemon bar when I&#x27;m done using it haha.</li>
    <li> Great product , fair pricing and S/H ; prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> And it&#x27;s all natural.  What&#x27;s not to love?  The smell of lemon is very nice and even on a dry weather day, I need not apply more.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Smells delish and feels great on the skin!</li>
    <li> I saw this lotion at Target and thought I&#x27;d give it a try, you know, treat myself. I found it to be pretty pricey for what it is. I guess that&#x27;s due to the fact that it&#x27;s natural, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me. It felt like I had to try much harder than usual to rub it in. The smell is amazing, but I&#x27;m just not into the thick texture of this.</li>
    <li> Lotion is too thick, takes forever to absorb.</li>
    <li> This hand lotion, much like the all-natural soap, smells amazing and feels great. It is the perfect combination after washing dishes</li>
    <li> THIS CONTAINS GMOs aka CHEMICALS so so detrimental to your health! Nothing &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; about that. I loved this lotion...I had to dig until I found the truth. Finally called customer service.... &amp;#34;Where is the alcohol in your extracts derived?&amp;#34; The alcohol used in our extracts is corn derived. &amp;#34;Do you use GMO or Organic corn??&amp;#34; &amp;#34;No, nothing in it is organic.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a bummer.... i&#x27;ll stick to coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if &amp;#34;scrumptious&amp;#34; is appropriate to use when describing something that&#x27;s not edible, but that&#x27;s how I want to describe this lotion -- because it smells like lemon cake or lemon cookies -- or something lemon, and baked, and delicious.</li>
    <li> my gf loves this very thick hand and body lotion it smells like dessert a little bit and moisture lasts a while :)</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes you skin so soft and the lemon cream is clean fresh smell, yes I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my GF thinks its cute when my belly smells like lemons. I rub this on my belly and then she kisses me more, so you should probably buy it if you want something similar to happen to you.</li>
    <li> It works great, smells great, and was just what I needed for the cold winter weather.  l bet you will like it too.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The scent is fantastic and leaves your skin smelling and feeling wonderful.  Product received on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! !! It literally smells like lemon cupcakes. Yes,  people want to lick me, when I walk by. It&#x27;sfabulousfortheskin. I&#x27;m constantly getting asked what that is and where to buy it:-)</li>
    <li> I smell like delicious lemon cookies and my skin looks great as well. I love this lotion!</li>
    <li> Rich and creamy. Was hoping for a crisper lemon scent, but it smelled nice anyway.</li>
    <li> A delicious smelling and decadently rich cream that is a luxurious joy to use.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the way the lotion smells...and so does my family when I use it!</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions available.  It may appear to be greasy when applied but definitely absorbs into the skin.  good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> totally love this! it smells so delightfully lemony and has excellent ingredients as well if you read the ingredients, apricot kernel oil is number two on the list followed by other great oils  not fillers and chemicals  for some stupid reason the big chain pharmacy store that used it carry it.. no longer.. which is why Amazon is so important  these stores don&#x27;t have a clue they only make shelf space for big commercial brands which are always full of chemicals  smaller brands like JR Watkins can&#x27;t compete with the big industry brands  but so what that is why it is a better product  The lemon hand and body lotion just smells so yummy and it does hydrate..</li>
    <li> It seemed as though it had already been used and smelled like it came from a smoker&#x27;s house. Very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Best hand and body cream.  Love the scent so much!  I highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s a GREAT value.</li>
    <li> Great lotion,  Smells good and feels good.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer ever. Great smell. Not greasy. Simple ingredients.</li>
    <li> I discovered this yummy lotion about 10 years ago. I can&#x27;t always find it in stores. If you like the smell of lemon cupcakes, this is for you. I always get shivers of happiness when I open the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for so many reasons: it&#x27;s cruelty free, 99%natural, US made, and it smells SO GOOD! It makes my hands smell like lemon cookies. A little thicker than I like, and a teensy bit greasy at first but not intolerable, and once it soaks in it makes my skin incredibly soft. 5 stars, definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> Most people would not think lemon and lotion go together, but this definitely does.  I have recommended this lotion to multiple people and all but one of them continue to use it as their go to body lotion.  Very soothing and you don&#x27;t need a lot to combat dry skin.</li>
    <li> PROS: smell, natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;CONS: could be a little more moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells awesome, like lemon bars, nothing irritating to me about it, so I believe the label that this is \\&quot;natural\\&quot; fragrance.  It soaks in quickly enough and does not feel greasy to me.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this for post-shower body use as opposed to hand use.  I just don&#x27;t find it moisturizing enough to use after washing my hands with soap; I plan to try the hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try!  Smells great, feels great, priced competitively considering it&#x27;s ingredients list.</li>
    <li> Geat product, I bought it for my mom who is in her 70&#x27;s and she loves it.Great price and my mom is very happy with her gift.</li>
    <li> This is such wonderful lotion! It really heals and soothes skin and has the most pleasant light lemon scent! I bought some for myself and immediately ordered more for the rest of my family. It&#x27;s a new favorite!</li>
    <li> If you are ever having a bad day, just put some of this healing lotion on and it not only heals the outside, but makes you feel good on the inside. If you love lemon pie, you will really love this.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very creamy and moisturizing but you will smell just like sweet lemon bars. If you do not like sweet smelling aromas, this is not the lotion for you. I personally love the smell and use the lotion right after my shower. I do not towel dry myself, instead I use my washcloth to dry off and then moisturize with this lotion. Your skin will absolutely feel amazing.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion for scent, luxuriousness, and natural qualities. It healed the bottom of my feet from being cracked and dry. Great product!</li>
    <li> Smells like lemon bars, to the point where I can&#x27;t even stand using it anymore.  Hoped it would have smelled more like their lemon hand soap.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy!  Very hydrating</li>
    <li> Great lotion, wife loves it</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite treats for myself. It is so lemony and nice. It makes my skin feel really good and the smell stays with me for a good period of time. I love the lemon smell. I use this lotion on my hands several times a day and I can tell a difference in how they look and feel. My hands are a whole lot less wrinkly and dry feeling. This lotion is very good on my feet as well. I like to slather on this lemony delight and then put socks on before I go to bed. My feet are also improving in appearance. This is a very good product and I do recommend it. Delightful.</li>
    <li> Delightful scent! Wish there was a cologne or perfume spritz available as well.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell.  My daughter loves the scent of lemons in about everything, so I decided this would make a good Christmas present for her</li>
    <li> I use this at school as Listening Lemon Lotion. The kids adore this smell and are reminded that good choices lead to a better smelling life!</li>
    <li> For some reason, this lotion felt and smelled different than a sample I tried from a local seller (whose contant info I didn&#x27;t get and couldn&#x27;t purchase from at the time). This is ok, but I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells and looks like lemon frosting.  I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would want the feeling of sticky frosting rubbed all over their hands.  Also leaves a greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to rate this product five stars. It works for me and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;If I could add any improvements it would be to suggest a touch more lemon scent.</li>
    <li> I love the Creaminess and the perfect amount of lemon.  It also makes my skin feel fresh and soft.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Rubs in easily and fragrance is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> The lotion moisturizes well and lemon scent delightful.  I wish thebottle came with a pump</li>
    <li> I love the smell! It smells like lemon cookies but not overpowering. It&#x27;s a little greasy right after you put it on BUT once you let it dry for about 10 minutes it&#x27;s completely absorbed. It&#x27;s DEFINITELY worth the wait because the payoff is marvelous. I&#x27;ve battled with cracked and callused feet like most people do. But just after two days of using this lotion my feet are nearly healed completely! It&#x27;s good to keep a regimen of using the lotion. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker so you do have to keep using it to reap the benefits. Going a day or two without it doesn&#x27;t hurt. All in all I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. I&#x27;ll be buying again once I&#x27;ve run out.</li>
    <li> Lotion smells wonderful but got bitten by an insect ;-(</li>
    <li> This lotion is so creamy, absorbs completely, lasts through several hand-washings before need to be re-applied, and SMELLS WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> Really great lotion....could be better if not yellow colored...but no biggie its non staining.smells like lemons, lasts and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> The hand and body cream is the same high quality as the rest of the Watkins line.  My family has been using watkins for 3 generations to date.  We are about to introduce the 4th generation to it!</li>
