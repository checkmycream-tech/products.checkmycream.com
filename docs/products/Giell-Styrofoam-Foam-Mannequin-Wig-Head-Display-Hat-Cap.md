      <li>I&#x27;m even thinking of painting them :D</li>
      <li>Good product!</li>
      <li>I was happy with how it was delivered, there was no damage to either head.</li>
      <li>Worked out great for all my wigs and stuff.  </li>
      <li>Will work great for holding wigs.</li>
      <li>seller is great, and so is product</li>
      <li>I now have 4 wigs and these are great.</li>
      <li>I think this price point for 2 head is great and is a good size.  </li>
      <li>- I wouldn&#x27;t purchase if you want impeccable models.</li>
      <li>Loved it.  </li>
      <li>just what I needed, good price</li>
      <li>So if you are looking for a good functional styrofoam head that can be mounted onto a stand, then this is the head for you.  </li>
      <li>so it desnt fall over so easy!!</li>
      <li>A good felt tip pen works nicely.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my own fault for buying it,</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not too much to say about this except that is very handy for wigs, and I haven&#x27;t experienced the styrofoam shedding at all.</li>
      <li>Impeccable shipping - everything packed to fit the package...</li>
      <li>but I just wrap a folded hand towel around it first before putting on the wig, to fully expand the wig and then it is just great for styling.  </li>
      <li>I love these things.</li>
      <li>Only if it was sized at 22&#x27; I would have been very happy!</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s perfectly cute and adorable for display purposes, I had bought it because I needed something to hold the wig while I style</li>
      <li>I swear I recommended this to so many persons that I know.</li>
      <li>then I discovered that these cute girls look even better in hats, so I save closet shel space by adding hats…</li>
      <li>They are okay, but would have preferred the more feminine looking ones as pictured since the products I&#x27;m displaying are more for women and children.</li>
      <li>I do miss the old style manican type, where they had a face, but this item is great as is.</li>
      <li>I love this, though they showed up with quite a few dents I am still able to use them, happy with the price</li>
      <li>There are holes at the bottoms of these styrofoam heads for mounting onto a stand, so that makes them even more useful to me.  </li>
      <li>Great bargain for what I needed them for but only two stars because they were not as pictured.</li>
      <li>Masks sold quickly but now using for hats</li>
      <li>(the styrofoam is pretty light).</li>
      <li>Brand new right out of the box and the exact size I needed!!!</li>
      <li>I recieved more masculine looking mannequin heads.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>They are exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Got them faster than what y&#x27;alls delivery date, they are exactly what I needed</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I asked for and delivered on time.</li>
      <li>Love these cheap little solutions to one of life&#x27;s great problems (at least for me, but I  understand  for others as well).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I wish they were a little heavier since wigs just drag it backwards, but it still works great!</li>
      <li>Not only is this cheap, but you get two?</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s reason I paid so much for the price, for it to come on time (which it did).</li>
      <li>They work great and they haven&#x27;t failed me.</li>
      <li>I received two of this display heads to display the hats I make and they work fine except for the fact the head circumference is pretty small</li>
      <li>however, one had a huge dent in the nose, and the other had indentations as well</li>
      <li>Totally recommended this to my friend and shipping was very fast.</li>
      <li>I had a hard time finding this because it seems like most people used these for storage of wigs or hats.  </li>
      <li>The head stands well enough, as long as you don&#x27;t put too much weight on it</li>
      <li>As others have stated, the head is smaller than an adult head</li>

<li> I use it while making hats and wish the head was a little larger.</li>

<li> have them all over my house, but they seem to disappear into couch cushions or dark corners  </li>
<li> Now they look less like freaky pod people.</li>
<li> I use these for wigs and hats, they do serve its purpose,  they can topple if something too heavy is on them.</li>
<li> The heads are too small and the face structure does not have a smile but rather appears to be in a bad bad bad mood.</li>
<li> But they&#x27;ll serve their purpose of holding hats and scarves while I take pictures, and they weren&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
<li> Now I have a place for my expensive wigs instead of the floor.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m mad that both faces looks nothing like the picture it&#x27;s showing.</li>
<li> base needs to be a bit wider</li>

    <li> I should have expected it from the pictures, but the head is a bit crooked.  While it&#x27;s perfectly cute and adorable for display purposes, I had bought it because I needed something to hold the wig while I style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my own fault for buying it, but it&#x27;s disappointing not to be able to use a product like I wanted to.  The head stands well enough, as long as you don&#x27;t put too much weight on it (the styrofoam is pretty light).</li>
    <li> The heads are too small and the face structure does not have a smile but rather appears to be in a bad bad bad mood.</li>
    <li> Impeccable shipping - everything packed to fit the package...however, one had a huge dent in the nose, and the other had indentations as well - I wouldn&#x27;t purchase if you want impeccable models.</li>
    <li> I swear I recommended this to so many persons that I know. Not only is this cheap, but you get two? Totally recommended this to my friend and shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mad that both faces looks nothing like the picture it&#x27;s showing. That&#x27;s reason I paid so much for the price, for it to come on time (which it did). However, why didn&#x27;t they check to see if the faces matched. I needed them for my bday party on friday and I was going to paint the faces and put a wigs on them. Mine looked like this one: [[ASIN:B00AKHWTK2 A1Pacific 11 STYROFOAM MANNEQUIN MANIKIN]]  ... THAT NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR..</li>
    <li> Everything from delivery and product was great!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> They work great and they haven&#x27;t failed me. I&#x27;m even thinking of painting them :D</li>
    <li> I use them for craft shows, I make crochet hats and scarfs and I display them.</li>
    <li> Used for Halloween to make ghosts and they worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> this item gets 5 stars because the design is perfect for what it is made for.  Very happy. I do miss the old style manican type, where they had a face, but this item is great as is.</li>
    <li> These display forms worked well for my intended use of displaying bonnets which I inherited from family members.</li>
    <li> Great bargain for what I needed them for but only two stars because they were not as pictured. I recieved more masculine looking mannequin heads. They are okay, but would have preferred the more feminine looking ones as pictured since the products I&#x27;m displaying are more for women and children.</li>
    <li> I love this, though they showed up with quite a few dents I am still able to use them, happy with the price</li>
    <li> Standard styrofoam head.  I use it while making hats and wish the head was a little larger.</li>
    <li> I ordered these when I actually saw someone place a review about making a wig on this head.  I had a hard time finding this because it seems like most people used these for storage of wigs or hats.  I think this price point for 2 head is great and is a good size.  I was happy with how it was delivered, there was no damage to either head.</li>
    <li> So I knew what I was getting... Yep, they&#x27;re smallish. They came a bit smooshed too, one in the cheek and the other in the forehead. But they&#x27;ll serve their purpose of holding hats and scarves while I take pictures, and they weren&#x27;t that expensive.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and arrived quickly&lt;br /&gt;Used for display at our antique booth&lt;br /&gt;to show Halloween masks.  Masks sold quickly but now using for hats</li>
    <li> I use these for wigs and hats, they do serve its purpose,  they can topple if something too heavy is on them.</li>
    <li> I love these things. I wish they were a little heavier since wigs just drag it backwards, but it still works great!</li>
    <li> Love these cheap little solutions to one of life&#x27;s great problems (at least for me, but I  understand  for others as well).&lt;br /&gt;I can never find my reading glasses, although they are as necessary to me as…well, not quite oxygen.. but up there in the list of&lt;br /&gt;indispensables.&lt;br /&gt;I have them all over my house, but they seem to disappear into couch cushions or dark corners  when I need one.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought these, and perch reading glasses (and sometimes two pair) on the noses noticeably on a shelf or counter in every room.&lt;br /&gt;And then I discovered that these cute girls look even better in hats, so I save closet shel space by adding hats….&lt;br /&gt;Fun.&lt;br /&gt;And it works.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  Worked out great for all my wigs and stuff.  Now I have a place for my expensive wigs instead of the floor.</li>
    <li> just what I needed, good price</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I asked for and delivered on time. Brand new right out of the box and the exact size I needed!!!</li>
    <li> Foam heads were a hit at my halloween party with cheese cloth over the heads.</li>
    <li> Good product! There&#x27;s not too much to say about this except that is very handy for wigs, and I haven&#x27;t experienced the styrofoam shedding at all.</li>
    <li> It arrived quality and will be used often.</li>
    <li> I just received my two wig heads and I wanted to add something that other reviewers never mentioned.  There are holes at the bottoms of these styrofoam heads for mounting onto a stand, so that makes them even more useful to me.  So if you are looking for a good functional styrofoam head that can be mounted onto a stand, then this is the head for you.  As others have stated, the head is smaller than an adult head but I just wrap a folded hand towel around it first before putting on the wig, to fully expand the wig and then it is just great for styling.  For the price it is an awesome value for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> I now have 4 wigs and these are great. My husband says he is looked at every night. They are exactly what I needed. seller is great, and so is product</li>
    <li> Love it! Product as described.</li>
    <li> Got them faster than what y&#x27;alls delivery date, they are exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> Arrived prior to scheduled date! Item was as described.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Will work great for holding wigs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve drawn faces on mine already. Now they look less like freaky pod people. A good felt tip pen works nicely.</li>
    <li> base needs to be a bit wider so it desnt fall over so easy!!</li>
    <li> I received two of this display heads to display the hats I make and they work fine except for the fact the head circumference is pretty small so it doesn&#x27;t truly show how it will look. So I did have to modify it a bit. Also one of the head were slightly askew where it meets in the middle making it uneven but not really causing a problem. Only if it was sized at 22&#x27; I would have been very happy! Will not buy again...</li>
