      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a replacement to the near-mythical Proactiv shampoo and conditioner which may have been the greatest product to ever be produced.  </li>
      <li>Excellent Shampoo for Irritated Scalp.  </li>

      <li>So I am very glad I bought it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the purchase![[ASIN:B00A267TZG Zincplex Shampoo, Conditioner and Scalp Lotion Kit]]</li>
      <li>A sure 5 on 5!</li>
      <li>but I had really nice shiny healthy hair.</li>
      <li>It has made my scalp healthy once again.</li>
      <li>I shampooed with the ZincPlex Dandruff Healthy Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better.</li>
      <li>ZincPlex has really helped me with my dandruff and it smells great.</li>
      <li>As I read more and more of the favorable reviews, I think they may be staged.  </li>
      <li>Makes your scalp itch more and causes you to get scalp pimples.</li>
      <li>I get better results with dilluting Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar with water and putting it in a squirt bottle.</li>
      <li>Also, for the price, I thought I should have received more product.</li>
      <li>By the 5th application, my scalp is healthy again.  </li>
      <li>this shampoo and conditioner are pretty good..</li>
      <li>package came very quickly and the bottles were well secured.</li>
      <li>This is good shampoo and conditioner it helps my hair look healthy so far</li>
      <li>Everything I could find written about this shampoo said it was fabulous.  </li>
      <li>It didnt work at all, contain cheap ingrediants as SLS and etc not as i thought not recomended at all</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used head and shoulders and while that made my hair feel clean, it didn&#x27;t help with the dandruff at all.</li>
      <li>Every once in a while I get scalp acne and this stuff clears it right up!</li>
      <li>It works good for getting rid of red bumps on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Ive used other products, but this is by far the best</li>
      <li>, these are the only products I use on my hair, scalp feels better than it has in 5 years, will continue to use Zincplex, nice smell too, the shampoo is thick like a Gel, great products.</li>
      <li>It is very important to take the entire total 10 minute process to be successful.</li>
      <li>I did this the first time and noticed by that evening a significant reduction in the bumps in my scalp.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff, it says what it does and does what it says.</li>
      <li>I have never personally found anything that helps more than this stuff.  </li>
      <li>She has already decided this is helping her and sent me a check this week to purchase her another combo and a check to reimburse me for making the first purchase for her.</li>
      <li>really a rip off!</li>
      <li>When I first started it took about 2 weeks to get the results.</li>
      <li>I would just make sure I deep condition afterwords.</li>
      <li>First of all the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I am so very thankful for this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m just glad to have finally found something that works.  </li>
      <li>I used this product exactly as it describes on the bottle, every day.</li>
      <li>and I was able to begin living without constant itching/</li>
      <li>At this point I was willing to try anything.  </li>
      <li>A good waste of 40 bucks.</li>
      <li>Very pleased when all the other products didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
      <li>Hair feels clean and soft after using.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to help her get her scalp back healthy and prayed that this product would do that  </li>
      <li>After 30 years of trying other shampoos and remedies and almost at my wit&#x27;s end, I finally discovered this product which has thoroughly cleansed my scalp and has also left a beautiful shine to my hair!  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not worked for me at all and seems to have made my scalp more crusty and dry.  </li>
      <li>it felt as if each hair follicle harbored its own little infection.  </li>
      <li>I am seeing a huge improvement and would definitely recommend the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I am partially bald and have about 5 sores around the top of my head, that are reoccurring and don&#x27;t seem to want to go away.  </li>
      <li>This has really helped some of my problems.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cure the problem, but I can go much longer without getting so itchy.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo helps so much.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many different products but most showed very little effect.</li>
      <li>Only thing, Sodium Laureth Sulfate is the first ingredient so use when necessary then make sure to use conditioner after</li>
      <li>Since I discovered this shampoo about a month ago and began using it, neither the clogged hair follicles nor the dry patches give me any more problems - they&#x27;ve been cleared up completely!  </li>
      <li>I was desperate for anything to give me a healthy scalp and for the price I was exspecting something amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s important that you use the conditioner after the shampooing for without the conditioner the scalp does stay itchy and dry in spots.  </li>
      <li>Luckily as a man I could get a way with my only salvation--the buzz cut.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this product and say do not listen to the complainers some people are just that complainers...</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for this scalp condition.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really wash out the color that my professional stylist uses.  </li>
      <li>I think the website misleads people as their are no negative reviews on the posts.</li>
      <li>my scalp was super dry and itchy, and i used this about 3 times so far it has helped a bit..</li>
      <li>I had to go to my hair dresser to get a professional conditioning treatment</li>
      <li>I developed scabs on my head.</li>
      <li>Did not help and was too expensive, found cheaper that did a better job.was worth a try, so i did.</li>
      <li>My hair started thinning more as I would see a few hairs everywhere on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>Instant relief and a normal scalp in no time.</li>
      <li>I bought the two together and have found the conditioner has too much conditioning effect for my fine thin hair.</li>
      <li>It seems to be helping, although I really haven&#x27;t used it very long yet.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing to dry itchy seborrhea scalp.</li>
      <li>First I must say that these complaining people are either suffering from something other than what this product is designed to cure or they just do not know how to read directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also have recently purchased CLEAR Shampoo for Men with Biotin &amp; Zinc from Rite Aid for $4.99, and am using that too - alternating.  </li>
      <li>I sleep with it in my hair and the next day my condition was completely cured.</li>
      <li>I used it on my 4 year old son, who also had the same scalp condition, and his scalp improved after just one shampoo, too.  </li>
      <li>Rubbing a bit of eucalyptus oil mixed half and half with olive oil has also helped many get rid of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read some of the other peoples product reviews and some people were very upset and claimed the product did not work.</li>
      <li>And secondly the company offers a money back guarantee, but they don&#x27;t give instructions on how to get a refund and their website doesn&#x27;t leave valid contact information or a phone number.</li>
      <li>And for 64 year old grey hair, that&#x27;s close to a miracle to me!  </li>
      <li>My hair is completely damaged, frizzy and dry.</li>

<li> these bottles are extremely teeny in person and the shampoo is blue, not green) and seem to notice no difference.</li>
<li> After trying numerous hair products for relief of my excessively dry, itchy and flaky scalp, I tried Zinplex.</li>
<li> cleared pimples and big dry flakes from scalp.</li>
<li> The only problem is you have to wash your hair twice a day which is not realistic for me, but if it is for you, i recommend this.</li>
<li> I have always had thin, oilyish hair that looks greasy almost right away.  </li>
<li> So far, I&#x27;m about half way down the bottle, (side note:</li>
<li> the first time I used these 2 products I knew they were working, before my scalp ALWAYS felt crusty and unhealthy,</li>
<li> but rather towel dried my hair and applied the conditioner and left it in to dry.</li>
<li> The little white heads around my hairline vanish.</li>
<li> (no choice - to avoid the sun/cancer) and your head sweating into already partially closed pores.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been dealing with scalp issues for years on years. I never knew it was a condition until I looked it up and found out I wasn&#x27;t alone. I thought I was the only one to have crusty bits here and there. I searched the web and found that this shampoo system came up several times and decided to give it a try. I was desperate for anything to give me a healthy scalp and for the price I was exspecting something amazing. So far, I&#x27;m about half way down the bottle, (side note: these bottles are extremely teeny in person and the shampoo is blue, not green) and seem to notice no difference. I will finish it up but will not repurchase. So here I am again, searching the web for something else to solve me problem.</li>
    <li> First of all the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t work. And secondly the company offers a money back guarantee, but they don&#x27;t give instructions on how to get a refund and their website doesn&#x27;t leave valid contact information or a phone number. So, their guarantee is scam to get you to buy their worthless products.</li>
    <li> Everything I could find written about this shampoo said it was fabulous.  It was rated the #1 dandruff and itchy scalp shampoo everywhere.  But it&#x27;s not worked for me at all and seems to have made my scalp more crusty and dry.  I am planning to call the company and see about a refund.</li>
    <li> It stopped the red, itchy irritated skin but didn&#x27;t stop the dandruff, and my dandruff wasn&#x27;t that bad.  Also, for the price, I thought I should have received more product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a horrible problem with my scalp with itchy dry patches and something else like scalp pimples.  And to make matters seem worse it felt as if each hair follicle harbored its own little infection.  My head was a mess and because I was always in my hair picking or scratching, hair of course had broken off.  Since I discovered this shampoo about a month ago and began using it, neither the clogged hair follicles nor the dry patches give me any more problems - they&#x27;ve been cleared up completely!  I&#x27;m hoping in a short time the pimples will also be resolved.  BUT, when you use this shampoo and then the conditioner (both are essential) you have to REMEMBER TO APPLY THE PRODUCT TO THE SCALP AND MASSAGE IT IN AND LEAVE IT ON FOR 3-5 MINUTES BEFORE RINSING IT OUT.  This you have to do with both the shampoo AND the conditioner (both for the scalp problems)         It&#x27;s important that you use the conditioner after the shampooing for without the conditioner the scalp does stay itchy and dry in spots.  These two items have been a God-send to me.  After 30 years of trying other shampoos and remedies and almost at my wit&#x27;s end, I finally discovered this product which has thoroughly cleansed my scalp and has also left a beautiful shine to my hair!  And for 64 year old grey hair, that&#x27;s close to a miracle to me!  And my hands are no longer going up to check for pumps or dry spots and no more crawly feelings in my hair.  I am so very thankful for this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> This product seemed a little harsh on my hair.  However I will continue to use because I did notice some change in my scalp condition.  I would just make sure I deep condition afterwords.</li>
    <li> This was my second bottle purchase.  It works good for getting rid of red bumps on the scalp.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst shampoo I have ever tried. I have dandruff but I had really nice shiny healthy hair. Not after a week using this product. My scalp and dandruff are twice as worst. I developed scabs on my head. My hair is completely damaged, frizzy and dry. I had to go to my hair dresser to get a professional conditioning treatment and it&#x27;s still damaged. Mind you I don&#x27;t color treat my hair and I don&#x27;t use heat on it all the damage came in one week from this product.</li>
    <li> I got the items, used them EXACTLY as they say to, my issues got worse NOT BETTER.  When I tried to call the Co., about the 90 day guarantee, they NEVER answered the phone, I left 4 messages, NO REPLIES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in the process of filing with the Attorney Generals office of Consumer fraud.</li>
    <li> This is good shampoo and conditioner it helps my hair look healthy so far it hasn&#x27;t help my sores on my scalp just yet,but I&#x27;ll give it time</li>
    <li> Product did not make any difference whatsoever for my scalp or my hair</li>
    <li> because it didnt do anything! really a rip off! for a shampoo and a conditionner, and very small what you see is not what you got, very deciving!!</li>
    <li> My wife and I have tried the product , it did not produced the result we were expecting . Now another shipment has been sent without our consent !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed of such a way to do business .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yvan Fortin</li>
    <li> This stuff works GREAT for me.  I have always had thin, oilyish hair that looks greasy almost right away.  I have little oily bumps which drive me nuts.  This shampoo helps so much.  It doesn&#x27;t cure the problem, but I can go much longer without getting so itchy.  I have never personally found anything that helps more than this stuff.  I have colored hair and it doesn&#x27;t really wash out the color that my professional stylist uses.  I did find that it took out the temporary color that I used to do myself.  I&#x27;m buying it again today as I cannot stand the itch when I don&#x27;t use this stuff. Everyone&#x27;s different, but for me this is a miracle product.</li>
    <li> Did not help and was too expensive, found cheaper that did a better job.was worth a try, so i did.</li>
    <li> this shampoo and conditioner are pretty good.. my scalp was super dry and itchy, and i used this about 3 times so far it has helped a bit..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i need to do some other things too, dandruff is known to exist due to some imbalances in your body. The book by Ellen Tart Jensen which is called Health is your birthright, (she excellent btw has cured many peoples illnesses, look her up)&lt;br /&gt;It states for dandruff the following:&lt;br /&gt;Do a colon cleansing and kidney cleansing. Take two tablespoons of flaxseed oil, fifty milligrams of zinc and six hundred international units of vitamin E daily. Drink two cups of oatstraw tea daily (or capsules) and take horsetail herb. Rubbing a bit of eucalyptus oil mixed half and half with olive oil has also helped many get rid of dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Excellent Shampoo for Irritated Scalp.  I started out with what seems like infected Hair pores.  I shampooed with the ZincPlex Dandruff Healthy Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner.  It worked immediately.  The open sores started clearing up.  By the 5th application, my scalp is healthy again.  It is very important to take the entire total 10 minute process to be successful. Excellent product, I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;zi</li>
    <li> I purchased Zincplex shampoo &amp; conditioner to treat a scalp problem but it did not meet my expectations and I ended up purchasing a different product recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve suffered with a severe case that left red scabs and crust all over my scalp.  I had tried all the medicated off-the-shelf products, all the all-natural organic stuff.  Luckily as a man I could get a way with my only salvation--the buzz cut.  That is until I happened across this stuff.  At this point I was willing to try anything.  THIS STUFF WORKS!!!!!  let me repeat:  THIS STUFF WORKS, period.</li>
    <li> After trying numerous hair products for relief of my excessively dry, itchy and flaky scalp, I tried Zinplex. After one shampoo wash that week, I got immediate relief. After second wash, I noticed the flaking was gone and I was able to begin living without constant itching/flaking.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product exactly as it describes on the bottle, every day. The itching and bumps on my scalp did not improve at all and I am halfway through the bottles. A good waste of 40 bucks.</li>
    <li> Product was not full in the bottle and was taped so I am not sure if it is a previously used product and resold.  Product does work well though.</li>
    <li> don´t buy this product, it made my problem worse, i never had so much flaking and itching in my life.!!!</li>
    <li> This has really helped some of my problems. However, it didn&#x27;t help with the red and tender scalp. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has helped me a lot. Its soothes the itching and dries the scalp of weeping. The only problem is you have to wash your hair twice a day which is not realistic for me, but if it is for you, i recommend this.</li>
    <li> cleared pimples and big dry flakes from scalp. I thank you for this product. This is the second time I have used your product, worked well both times.</li>
    <li> When I first started it took about 2 weeks to get the results. But I did get very good results. Very pleased when all the other products didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> It didnt work at all, contain cheap ingrediants as SLS and etc not as i thought not recomended at all</li>
    <li> Sister loves her dandruff shampoo/rinse.  She&#x27;s had problems with flaking for years and has tried all kinds of dandruff products.  This one seems to be correcting the problem...it&#x27;s not gone but it&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for about a month now and it&#x27;s not working. My scalp is still itchy with bumps and it still smells. I thought with all of the rave reviews that these products were getting that I might&#x27;ve actually found relief from years of symptoms. I was wrong though that I feel like I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  Yes, I followed instructions. I would do anything to get rid of the acne on my scalp. I called the contact number on the Zincplex website, they don&#x27;t answer the phone, don&#x27;t return messages.  They  also didn&#x27;t answer my email. Not a good indication that I will get the money back, as promised.  So I am very glad I bought it on Amazon.  I may have a chance. As I read more and more of the favorable reviews, I think they may be staged.  Update: I finally got my money back by filing an Amazom claim. The vendor ingnored all requests for a return lable or return address.</li>
    <li> I use this for about a week once I get a breakout and it works wonders for my scalp. The little white heads around my hairline vanish. It also clears up any itchy red bumps on the back of my neck. I use the product as directed on the bottle along with a shampoo brush. I know everyone has a different chemistry, but for me this is the one. Instant relief and a normal scalp in no time.</li>
    <li> the first time I used these 2 products I knew they were working, before my scalp ALWAYS felt crusty and unhealthy, and I think thats why my hair grew sooooo slow, these are the only products I use on my hair, scalp feels better than it has in 5 years, will continue to use Zincplex, nice smell too, the shampoo is thick like a Gel, great products.</li>
    <li> I read some of the other peoples product reviews and some people were very upset and claimed the product did not work. Well I purchased the product based on other research i had already done.  First I must say that these complaining people are either suffering from something other than what this product is designed to cure or they just do not know how to read directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions state to leave the shampoo on your hair for 1 to 5 min after massaging well into the scalp. and do the same with the conditioner.  I bet they did not do this! I did this the first time and noticed by that evening a significant reduction in the bumps in my scalp. This encouraged me so i washed my hair again (you can per the instructions do up to 3 times a day) and this time i put the conditioner on and did not rinse at all but rather towel dried my hair and applied the conditioner and left it in to dry. I sleep with it in my hair and the next day my condition was completely cured. Now i have been battleing with scalp pimples or bumps for years and tryed everything from shampoos to washing my hare with listerine mouthwash. I have been to a doctor and multiple dermatologists without any success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and say do not listen to the complainers some people are just that complainers...</li>
    <li> This stuff works I have tried others with no luck. Only thing, Sodium Laureth Sulfate is the first ingredient so use when necessary then make sure to use conditioner after</li>
    <li> Very soothing to dry itchy seborrhea scalp. Hair feels clean and soft after using. Highly recommended for this scalp condition.</li>
    <li> I bought the two together and have found the conditioner has too much conditioning effect for my fine thin hair. I usually don&#x27;t use conditioner anyway so it was my mistake for buying the two together.  My hair started thinning more as I would see a few hairs everywhere on a regular basis. Started using this shampoo and just got in th e habit of leaving it on for 4-5 minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;It worked!! It stopped the hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this for my mom who complained of having  pimples on her scalp  also I have seen her picking in her head.  Shes has  had the product for almost a week and has been washing her head up to 3 times a day per the instructions.  I really wanted to help her get her scalp back healthy and prayed that this product would do that  she has also experienced some hair thinning.  She has already decided this is helping her and sent me a check this week to purchase her another combo and a check to reimburse me for making the first purchase for her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a replacement to the near-mythical Proactiv shampoo and conditioner which may have been the greatest product to ever be produced.  Alas, they discontinued it and this Zincplex does appear to be a decent replacement.  I&#x27;ve added it to my rotation and it seems to be helping a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came very quickly and the bottles were well secured.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo is no better than the crap you get in a hotel shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it... nothing else needs to be said.</li>
    <li> I was suffering from scalp itching and flaking problem since quite a few months. I tried various anti-dandruff shampoos and conditioners but none of them helped. Then, I tried ZincPlex Shampoo &amp; Conditioner and just loved the product. It has made my scalp healthy once again. A sure 5 on 5!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I have ever tried that actually works for my seborrheic dermatitis.  My \\&quot;dandruff\\&quot; was noticeably improved after just one shampoo.  It smells great, too!  The shampoo smells like oranges and the conditioner smells like spearmint.  I used it on my 4 year old son, who also had the same scalp condition, and his scalp improved after just one shampoo, too.  If this didn&#x27;t work for some users, perhaps it&#x27;s because they had a different scalp problem?  I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m just glad to have finally found something that works.  I can finally wear black again--after 22 years!!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist had recommended Zincplex for me because of several problems including bad dandruff and scalp acne (little bumps). I have tried so many different products but most showed very little effect. I am seeing a huge improvement and would definitely recommend the shampoo and the conditioner. Also they don&#x27;t smell bad like many of the products that I have used in the past. I am very pleased with the purchase![[ASIN:B00A267TZG Zincplex Shampoo, Conditioner and Scalp Lotion Kit]]</li>
    <li> Every once in a while I get scalp acne and this stuff clears it right up! Ive used other products, but this is by far the best</li>
    <li> Well...like everyone else that has dandruff, flaking issues, etc., I was hoping that this was going to be the miracle cure! Unfortunately...it isn&#x27;t. I have used this product for a few months and it has brought little or no relief. I get better results with dilluting Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar with water and putting it in a squirt bottle. That is the only thing that restores the PH balance to my scalp and stops the itching.This product is waaaaay overpriced. I think the website misleads people as their are no negative reviews on the posts. Not truthful. Anyway...give Jason&#x27;s Dandruff Shampoo a shot. It has helped me immensely.  Happy scratching! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an issue with dandruff, dry skin, and patches of dead skin for a few years up until I started using this product. I&#x27;ve used head and shoulders and while that made my hair feel clean, it didn&#x27;t help with the dandruff at all. I&#x27;ve also used Neutrogena T-Gel and that helped with my dandruff but it smelled horrible and all the warnings on the label honestly freaked me out. ZincPlex has really helped me with my dandruff and it smells great. I honestly can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff, it says what it does and does what it says. I have already recommended this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Makes your scalp itch more and causes you to get scalp pimples. Stay away buy nioxin seborrheic dermatitis shampoo and conditioner instead.</li>
    <li> I am partially bald and have about 5 sores around the top of my head, that are reoccurring and don&#x27;t seem to want to go away.  I&#x27;ve put up with these for years.  Not painful, just annoying, and hard not to pick/scratch them..  Dermatologist said it&#x27;s from the sun and not wearing a hat - WRONG - as I told him.  I ALWAYS wear a hat, while golfing and on the beach.  I&#x27;m not that stupid/hard headed.  My personal theory is that this comes from wearing a hat in those conditions (no choice - to avoid the sun/cancer) and your head sweating into already partially closed pores.  I read materials that state that ZINC seems to help these conditions, so I decided to give it a try.  I purchased these products - the bottles are VERY small - 8 oz. each - for this price (warning you - expensive).  It seems to be helping, although I really haven&#x27;t used it very long yet.  My head doesn&#x27;t seem as sore, less sores, and appears to be drying up and going away.  I also have recently purchased CLEAR Shampoo for Men with Biotin &amp; Zinc from Rite Aid for $4.99, and am using that too - alternating.  Will probably stick to that after all this Amazon product is gone, simply due to the cost - if it seems to be working.  I hope my Review here helps someone else - who may have a similar problem.</li>
