      <li>I hope to find more!</li>
      <li>I know of so many people who loved this product.  </li>
      <li>Great price  and well worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>I love the original packing, honestly why do manufactures have to change a good thing.</li>
      <li>My very fine lines were accentuated while wearing this.  </li>
      <li>Not the product for you if you are looking for very light coverage.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite product in the world.</li>
      <li>I love the price</li>
      <li>I love this concealer.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>so it blends better.</li>
      <li>I love this concealer.  </li>
      <li>So glad I got it</li>
      <li>This is my favorite Concealer</li>
      <li>So glad I was able to get this online.</li>
      <li>When I used the concealer, it blends well with the Simply Ageless foundation and does a very good job covering this lighter area.  </li>
      <li>I really think the warm of your fingers do it some magic.</li>
      <li>Ordering was easy and I received the product very quickly.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an oil based concealer of this kind.</li>
      <li>It goes on well and does not settle into fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and helps with fine lines.</li>
      <li>I found that the best way to apply this, is over heavily moisturized skin with my fingers after warming it well</li>
      <li>I was happy to find this product here because it was discontinued last year.  </li>
      <li>I received this free from Bzzz Agent to test.  </li>
      <li>it is a great inexpensive fix for facial flaws we want to hide.  </li>
      <li>I like to swirl my ring finger in the pot as to warm it up and gently pat it under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I originally gave this a 3</li>
      <li>and I was really excited to try it as part of a Bzz Campaign.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this concealer and did a product campaign on it when it first came out.  </li>
      <li>Love this product so much.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly...</li>
      <li>The CoverGirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Concealer is pretty good in the begining</li>
      <li>My eyes instantly look more away and concealed!</li>
      <li>exactly as described!</li>
      <li>Totally worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>I have tried different brands, but this one worked best on my dark circles.</li>
      <li>This product looked very promising</li>
      <li>I think the Olay product helps give these items a smooth, natural look.</li>
      <li>This was one of the cheapest ones I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, yet it really works well beyond my expectation!</li>
      <li>I will be buying more in the future if you still have them.</li>
      <li>I feel so much more confident without huge dark circles under my eyes and this little case lasts forever.</li>
      <li>This concealer really works.</li>
      <li>I pat for about a minute until its really blended in.</li>
      <li>I really felt the need to rewrite this review because I lost this product for a couple of weeks</li>
      <li>I did really like the product, the coverage and texture.  </li>
      <li>I tried them with reluctance and was very much surprised by the smooth, natural look they gave.</li>
      <li>I absolutely,  hands down love this concealer.</li>
      <li>Immediately on first use it almost magically makes the dark circles completely disappear.  </li>
      <li>but after you have it awhile it seem to dry up alot and does not go on as smooth.</li>
      <li>I received them in decent timing and each container was bubble wrapped for protection.  </li>
      <li>However, it does accentuate my wrinkles and makes me look older, which is not what I was going for...</li>
      <li>except it&#x27;s a lot lighter than my normal complexion and never tans.  </li>
      <li>I was fortunate enough to try this product out as a Buzz Agent, along with Simply Ageless blush, corrector, and foundation.  </li>
      <li>The Simply Ageless line of products is also very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I have tried MANY before, and this is the only one that works with my complexion and issues like dark circles.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and can provide natural looking medium to heavy coverage.  </li>
      <li>I had such high hopes, but ended up trashing it.  </li>
      <li>This is the only product I can use on sensitive skin areas on my face.</li>
      <li>I will start with the positive: it does cover dark circles well.</li>
      <li>It works well with my pale complexion and it has Olay serum built right in.  </li>
      <li>Hides dark under-eye circles really well.</li>
      <li>This concealer is not as thick as some, but the color duo sure does the work to cover dark circles.  </li>

<li> Unfortunately, this item has been disontinued by Cover Girl so this was the last place that I found it.  </li>
<li> The cream was so thick and heavy</li>
<li> oh and those late nights reading on the kindle.&lt;br</li>

    <li> The CoverGirl &amp; Olay Simply Ageless Concealer is pretty good in the begining but after you have it awhile it seem to dry up alot and does not go on as smooth.</li>
    <li> In the past I found correctors and concealers to create a caked and un-natural look.  These two products were sent with the foundation and blusher by Bzzzz.  I tried them with reluctance and was very much surprised by the smooth, natural look they gave. I think the Olay product helps give these items a smooth, natural look.</li>
    <li> Received this item as a BuzzAgent. Goes on smoothly and helps with fine lines. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough to try this product out as a Buzz Agent, along with Simply Ageless blush, corrector, and foundation.  This concealer really works.

My shade of concealer was actually 220, which is just a little darker, but worked well for me and I have fair skin.    If you need good coverage, this concealer does the job!

    <li> I received this free from Bzzz Agent to test.  Unfortunately, the color I was sent was too dark.  I did really like the product, the coverage and texture.  I would buy it in a lighter shade and use it with the Ageless Corrector.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this item has been disontinued by Cover Girl so this was the last place that I found it.  It is a little over-priced compared to the retail shelf price but it is a good concealer for under-eye circles, etc.</li>
    <li> Best thing EVER! I always use this with the dream mousse stuff.</li>
    <li> This was one of the cheapest ones I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, yet it really works well beyond my expectation! Good value!</li>
    <li> This product looked very promising and I was really excited to try it as part of a Bzz Campaign.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it did not deliver what was promised. I will start with the positive: it does cover dark circles well. However, it does accentuate my wrinkles and makes me look older, which is not what I was going for...&lt;br /&gt;I wasted a lot of time trying to make this work. I found that the best way to apply this, is over heavily moisturized skin with my fingers after warming it well so it blends better. Even then, I will not wear it in daylight, because, frankly my skin looks awful with it. I could just wear this in the evening, except it makes my skin around the eyes super itchy and uncomfortable, which is strange for something that is supposed to have serum in it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Concealer and I do believe they must have quit making it...and that upsets me!! Number 215 is what I have always used and no other touches it :( Please, bring it back!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly...exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and can provide natural looking medium to heavy coverage.  Not the product for you if you are looking for very light coverage.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this product here because it was discontinued last year.  I have tried different brands, but this one worked best on my dark circles. I ordered two to have a backup. Ordering was easy and I received the product very quickly.</li>
    <li> This concealer is not as thick as some, but the color duo sure does the work to cover dark circles.  It is moist and spreads with ease.  it is a great inexpensive fix for facial flaws we want to hide.  Great price  and well worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product for the over 30 eye darkening; oh and those late nights reading on the kindle.&lt;br /&gt;BTW: A little goes a long way with this product and blending is essential to proper application.</li>
    <li> Wish I could purchase again, but they do not make it any longer</li>
    <li> I love this concealer and did a product campaign on it when it first came out.  It is so remarkably close to my skin color I can&#x27;t believe Cover Girl/Olay has stopped making it.  Anyway, one of the purchases was a little over the old retail price and the other (as I don&#x27;t know which supplier we&#x27;re talking about) was grossly overpriced.</li>
    <li> Best concealer ever! Don&#x27;t understand why Cover Girl stopped making it. If you can find any, stock up. Cover Girl made a mistake taking this off the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male who battles slight dark circles under my eyes; so I&#x27;ve been using various brands and kinds of concealer for a few years. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used an oil based concealer of this kind. I usually use the brush on one&#x27;s.  Immediately on first use it almost magically makes the dark circles completely disappear.  The color matches my skin perfectly and it blends incredibly well.  Will definitely buy this again. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> Best concealer i&#x27;ve run across.  Acts a a primer for eye shadow on upper lids too.  Cover Girl please bring this back!!!</li>
    <li> Despite the fact that its really small thing you just need a little bit to cover that things you don&#x27;t like. So it will last reaaally long. Well, unless you&#x27;re a mime. Hehehe JK&lt;br /&gt;-My sister approves this review-</li>
    <li> I love this concealer.  It works well with my pale complexion and it has Olay serum built right in.  I cannot find it in the stores anymore, that&#x27;s why I ordered from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years!  I couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local drugstores as they have changed the packaging.  I love the original packing, honestly why do manufactures have to change a good thing.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I can use on sensitive skin areas on my face. So glad I got it...looks like it was only one left anywhere. Arrived on time perfect condition</li>
    <li> Does what an undereye concealer should so without cluming or drying out the skin. I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer.  CoverGirl took it off the market.  For what reason I don&#x27;t know.  I know of so many people who loved this product.  I am just happy I found it on Amazon.  I hope to find more!</li>
    <li> I use this almost daily under my eyes because I have dark circles under my eyes and It totally helps. I feel so much more confident without huge dark circles under my eyes and this little case lasts forever. Totally worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely,  hands down love this concealer. I have tried MANY before, and this is the only one that works with my complexion and issues like dark circles. I was heartbroken to find out it&#x27;s discontinued.  Once I found online that you carried them, and at a lower cost than what I paid in store, I became ecstatic!  I received them in decent timing and each container was bubble wrapped for protection.  Thank you!!! I will be buying more in the future if you still have them.</li>
    <li> Hides dark under-eye circles really well. I use it as a base under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I really felt the need to rewrite this review because I lost this product for a couple of weeks and I panicked!! I originally gave this a 3 but I had been applying it with a brush big no no! I had been using it under my mineral foundation every morning before work and it became my routine. Then one day poof! It disappeared and I was desperately searching for the little container and realized I don&#x27;t think I can live with out this concealer lol. I like to swirl my ring finger in the pot as to warm it up and gently pat it under my eyes. I pat for about a minute until its really blended in. My eyes instantly look more away and concealed! Don&#x27;t use a brush though. I really think the warm of your fingers do it some magic. :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother-this isn&#x27;t good stuff.  I just don&#x27;t think it covers up AT ALL....just not quality eye coverup-expensive for the worthlessness....</li>
    <li> this is my favorite product in the world. i can never find it in stores but it covers every blemish and it looks great not blochy blends so well!</li>
    <li> Love this product so much. Why did Olay stop making it. So glad I was able to get this online. Goes on nice and creamy and excellent coverage.</li>
    <li> This is really the worst concealer I have used.  I had such high hopes, but ended up trashing it.  The cream was so thick and heavy I felt like I was wearing spackling, even though I used a small amount.  My very fine lines were accentuated while wearing this.  It also bothered my contacts, which almost never happens.  My eyes felt like they were burning after 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> So creamy and great coverage, doesn&#x27;t crease at all. I love the price and I heard it will be discontinued so I gotta stock up! CoverGirl, I love you!</li>
