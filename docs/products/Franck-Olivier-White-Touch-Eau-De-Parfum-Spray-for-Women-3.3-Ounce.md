    <li> The best perfume ever!</li>
    <li> Not the original...dont waste your money like i did...gave them 2 star for fast shipping</li>
    <li> This perfume has a light floral/fruity scent. It is not overpowering nor is it offensively pungent. Just a great youthful scent!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. The smell is mesmerizing.  The price was exceptional compared to $60/$70 in stores and perfume outlets. I need to order another just to have. Thanks Amazon for an amazing fragrance at the right price.</li>
    <li> When I got my package a few minutes ago I thought it was a necklace I bought that said it should be here today. This perfume was estimated to show up 4-6 days from now! I ordered it two days ago and its already here! This is my favorite perfume it&#x27;s all I wear! I always get compliments and everyone wants to know what I wear but its my secret so no one can smell like me! The scent is hard to describe for me but I think every woman would love this! Its fruity and it lasts for hours! I don&#x27;t need to use half as much as I do with other perfumes and it actually stays on! Plus, $20 for a 3.3oz bottle is a total steal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so many compliments walking by people wearing this scent! It&#x27;s too light to me but because of these compliments I am buying it again and again!</li>
    <li> It is not to my taste, but the price was good. May be someone else will like it. Keep it</li>
