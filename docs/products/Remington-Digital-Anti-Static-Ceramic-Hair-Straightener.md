<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Thank You so much . It&#x27;s really amazing </li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY curly, frizzy, thick, long hair. This gets the job done every time. Much better than my last more expensive one, which fried quickly.</li>
    <li> This smells like plastic every time i turn it on  and it hasnt gone away yet and ive had this over a month. It does the job but the smell makes me sick, it smells like a plastic warehouse</li>
    <li> the best flat iron ever. i recommend everyone to get this. makes my hair look so good.</li>
    <li> Disappointed, Please indicate the voltage of the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice product, the hair is left very softly, my wife love it. I recommend</li>
    <li> This straightener is so great! I had cut my hair and was looking for a smaller iron plate and had a Remington for my last flat iron. I was a little worried when I saw the price that I would get a cheap knockoff or something but this is the real deal! Heats up really fast and does a really good job.</li>
    <li> This works well and was a good value. I have used it a few times and it does a nice job of straightening my hair. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend more on an expensive flat iron.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this straightener years ago, but it was stolen out of my gym&#x27;s locker room. I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one, because I think it&#x27;s the best straightener for the money. The price has gone up quite a bit since I bought it, but I still think it&#x27;s worth it. It heats up VERY fast, and I love the ability to set the digital temperature. I have very fine, wavy, frizzy hair, and it smooths my hair right out with one pass. It&#x27;s also slim enough to store and travel easily.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great!  It heats up quickly and does the job!</li>
    <li> Ok so I misplaced my wet 2 straight by Remington which was my everything and so..I was looking out for a quick fix...something good but not too expensive. Well I found it! This is soooo affordable ladies, and let me tell you, it works great! Leaves my hair super straight and shiny. Love the heat settings. I use 390. I like the color, the size. I&#x27;ve got nothing but good things to say...and if it breaks within a year...so what...I&#x27;m more than willing to dish out another $14. Some of these flat irons cost $100..not doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural, curly hair&lt;br /&gt;3b, 3c, 4a&lt;br /&gt;Dry, color treated&lt;br /&gt;Bra strap length hair</li>
    <li> Excellent !! I love this iron !! The product arrived in perfect condition aVenezuela</li>
    <li> This is my first hair straightner, so I really have nothing to compare it to. It does what it says it does. But be sure to use some sort of heat protectant before using heat products! I use pure argain oil before straightening my hair, and my hair is not damaged at all. Another good product to use is moraccon argan oil, it is golden yellow and smells amazing. It is cheaper than pure argain oil but works great. You can find it in CVS under a brand named Organix (they have a shampoo line called organix).&lt;br /&gt;This straightener, I recently discovered, can also be used to get wavy hair! look up some tutorials. Its really cool. :)&lt;br /&gt;Oh, my hair is thick, long, and starts becoming wavy towards  the middle length. Does that make sense?? Yeah, just some background on my hair for reference.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! CHEAP AND AWESOME :P</li>
    <li> love this product.  It  has adjustable temperatures, Its lightweight.  The way they have the cord, it does not tangle and become all twined up.  no complaints</li>
    <li> i love how it has a hinge lock. i still miss the last remington straightener, but this one works just as good.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend &amp; she loves it.... She said it does an amazing job with her hair.</li>
    <li> It has been a week since i have been using this flat iron and i am very happy with it. Heats up immediately and does exactly what i want it to do. I totally recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, however, this hair straightener is amazing! It straightens quickly and wonderfully. It heats up super quick and I just love it. The price makes buying the straightener even better! I have paid over $100 to get a straightener to make my hair look as good as it does from this one. Definitely would buy again!</li>
    <li> I plugged in the iron when I first got it to make sure that it actually worked. It&#x27;s default setting is 370 degrees and it heated to just about so after only a few seconds of being activated.</li>
    <li> My hair is already naturally straight, but I needed a straightener to help me smooth the kinks out of it whenever I sleep with my hair in a ponytail or in a bun. It doesn&#x27;t take that long to heat up, but it does burn. I don&#x27;t see how this is anti static because my flyaways were sticking out in all different directions. But I do recommend using a comb while straightening your hair because it will help a lot!</li>
    <li> Works great! Easy to use and heats up quickly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll update if things change since I just got it but so far it&#x27;s great! Gets super hot, super quickly, doesn&#x27;t grab stray hairs, locks closed for storing or travel. Happy with the purchase so far!</li>
    <li> Gift for my daughter. Heats up quickly and is gentle on her hair, not burning it.  It&#x27;s an affordable hair straightener.</li>
    <li> good enough for the price</li>
    <li> Works great. Hot enough even when on lower setting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to purchase HSI flat iron instead(much more expensive and has no digital feature) but glad That I purchased this instead!! I can&#x27;t complain with this price! will recommend this product to anyone looking for nice flat iron that can use daily.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is a bit smaller then the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past but it works well. There is a digital temp reader (temp goes up to 410 degrees) and a small plastic lock that keeps the iron in a compact &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; position when not in use.</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons they work really well.  I don&#x27;t even have to spend a lot of time on my hair for a great result.</li>
    <li> It has very nice features: digital indicator for temp, auto shut off after an hour, twisting base to prevent the cord from tangling, and it&#x27;s pretty thin so it&#x27;s (kind of) travel size. Plus the colors pretty too.</li>
    <li> Works very well though it did contain a burning plastic smell and my LCD light didn&#x27;t work but I can still see the numbers so that didn&#x27;t affect me much. Also it did not make my hair smell which I was worried about due to the smell coming from this straightener. Overall it is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for over 2 years and  I love it. No shortages or anything!  I&#x27;ve used it to make beautiful curls &amp; to get my hair bone straight.  The plates are sooo much longer than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve seen or used. Heats up in 15secs &amp;  cuts off after an hour,  so I never gave to worry when I&#x27;m rushing to school &amp; forget to turn it off.  It has a long swiveling cord.  I just love this l!</li>
    <li> Very quick to heat, caution: gets very hot.  I only set it to the lowest level and it flattens my hair easily.  great buy!</li>
    <li> I never planned on buying a flat iron.  Then I got my hair cut into a bob and realized that my large curling iron was nowhere near as efficient.  This straightener has worked really well for me.  I can&#x27;t imagine buying a more expensive version.</li>
    <li> Just okay. Not the worst I&#x27;ve ever used, but definitely not the best.</li>
    <li> For the excellent price, it does exactly what I need.  I would have given it five stars except the outside does get hot to the touch and it shuts off after an hour even if it is being used.</li>
    <li> Its OK, not heavy or substantial, but it has smooth surfaces so doesn&#x27;t catch and pull hair.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I have had this strengthener for a long time and it still works great!</li>
    <li> The product is good and useful, but I don&#x27;t often use not much because I always feel hot in my head. After I use it, i feel more hot. On the other hand I am busy and I have no time. Maybe it is good for teenagers. I am over 40 and health is more important for me.</li>
    <li> As far as I know there is nothing she would change. It works super fast and she likes the fact that the cord swivels so it doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
    <li> Made the best gift for a teenage girl ever! This blew the one she had out of the water and couldn&#x27;t wait to switch out to the new flattening iron. Of course the color put it over the top. Arrived fast and the packaging was in perfect condition for a gift.</li>
    <li> I have owned a lot of different straighteners and i think this one is better than some of the more expensive ones. Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Absolutely 5 stars! This product leaves your hair soft and straightened (bought it 3 weeks ago and still works perfectly).  Awesome price and totally worth the buy.</li>
    <li> My fourteen year old daughter and I are often in the bathroom getting ready at the same time due to our schedules. We both use hair straighteners and often needed to use one at the same time and would fight. I bought a second one so that we both have one availabe to use when we need it. Silly, I know. We do have a second bathroom, but it is soley used by my husband and is not fit to enter. The vaccines needed to be in that room have not yet been invented, but I digress.  I bought this one for me to use and I liked it because I have fine hair which seems to get static very easily. I usually have to spray it with Static Guard. Yeah.  I let my daughter try it as well and she likes it so much better than the old one because of the coating.  Her hair is super think and naturally curly so it takes her a lot longer to get her hair done.  Now she has confiscated this device. Whatever.</li>
    <li> I received my curler in the mail a few days ago and I love it! I was worried at first, since a lot of curlers may not do well with ethnic hair and I am a Black woman that uses hair relaxers to straighten my hair. This product straightens really well and since it is almost time for me to have my hair relaxed again, I already know that my hair will be even smoother when I use the curler after I get my hair retouched. I love the purple color and the fact that it is has a digital temperature setting. Please be careful as you set the temperature; if you turn it up too high, you could burn your scalp and your hair, and this curler gets very hot! I also love that it is affordable. Remington did a magnificent job with this product!!!! My only other hope is that this product is durable and lasts me for a few years. Most other curlers do not last long after heavy use and dropping them on the floor so many times.</li>
    <li> goodnight, the product arrived in excellent condition. thank you very much</li>
    <li> This thing is perfect as a second straightener at my office or gym. I Have a Chi at home, but let&#x27;s face it - no one wants to lug around their one and only straightener just for touch ups!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a weird smell at first, but that will go away with time. I think it might be something with which it was sprayed at the factory.</li>
    <li> The straightener feels cheap at first.. very light. But that&#x27;s now something i like about it. If i need to carry it in a bag, it&#x27;s slim and light enough to barely make a difference. It straightens my hair on the first try. No re-straightening needed for a while. I love how the digital screen and power button are on the outside. Some more pricey straighteners have the little box on the inside beside the plates. The power switch is found there. But the box pinches my hair and pulls. SO ANNOYING. So no pulling on this one. The only thing i would like is a slightly longer chord. But it doesn&#x27;t inconvenience me enough to lose a star. It makes up for that in quality. Definitely comparable to a high dollar straightener! I&#x27;m hoping these good qualities will last, but only time will tell:)</li>
    <li> I have tried so many flat irons and this is HANDS DOWN the BEST one ever!  I would order again and highly recommend.  I don&#x27;t know why it works so well, but it does!</li>
    <li> This straightener is a great value for a great price. I have been using this consistantly for several months now and this makes my hair perfectly straight and has not damaged my bleached blonde delicate hair. I have used so many other expensive straighteners like CHI costing well over $100 and they all broke and did not straighten as well as this does. I would deff reccomend this for only $15 this is a steal! You don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money to look like a million bucks :)</li>
    <li> Well i&#x27;ll be honest here, this is not a dual voltage product, so I had to buy a converter to plug it with , otherwise it would be dead in seconds. (My country uses 220v, not 120v) ...This makes it rather annoying and obviously also it is not a travel friendly feature!  Remington if you hear me, for gods sake MAKE ALL YOUR PRODUCTS DUAL VOLTAGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that little complaint, everything is perfectly fine!  This does not feel cheap at all, gets the job done perfectly, its so lightweight and easy to handle you really don&#x27;t need to be a professional to come up with great hair styling! specially as it is so easy to CURL hair with it too thanks to its rounded edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a wonderful product for an even wonderful price!  Even with the voltage issue I am still SO GLAD i purchased this baby!</li>
    <li> She says it heats up fast, &amp; don&#x60;t catch up in her hair, It doesn&#x60;t take her nearly as long, so I don&#x60;t have to wait on her as much!</li>
    <li> In my salon I go through flat irons and I must say this a good one. It gets close to the scalp and gets the hair straight, but most of all IT TURNS OFF AUTOMATICALLY, I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve gone home at night and not remembered to turn off the damn thing off.&lt;br /&gt;Great value the price is right!</li>
    <li> I like this hair straightener. I works well on my hair. It was a good price and seems to work as well as the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and works great I feel like this straightener is very cheap and it works amazing!!!</li>
    <li> The complaints others have made about the space in the middle are valid.  But, it works OK on my hair.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a month, then just stopped working for no apparent reason. I&#x27;m hoping Amazon will make it right and let me return it even though I bought it 35 days ago, they have a 30 day return policy.</li>
    <li> my daughter&#x27;s  hair sounds much better!!!</li>
    <li> This is a solid choice if you&#x27;re in need of something simple and inexpensive.  I had it overnighted to a hotel (thank you Prime!) after forgetting to pack my usual straightener, and now I just keep it in my suitcase and use it while traveling.  I like that it has temperature controls, and I haven&#x27;t had problems with the plates catching and ripping out hair (as many cheap flat irons will).  The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is that the cord is on the short side.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and have gone through 5 CHI irons in 9 years. Although I love CHI, it has become too expensive replacing them so often. I decided to find a cheaper alternative to use at the salon. This one had many good reviews and an astoundingly low price. I have been extremely pleased. It gets hot in a snap and shuts off in about an hour which will definitely extend the life.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible bargain! I used to only buy Chi flat irons, and have a nasty habit of accidentally dropping them on the ground, and have broken 3 of them, this way. I hated spending $80 to $90 on a new Chi. This Remington flat iron is everything that it claims to be. It heats up extremely fast, and works just as well as a Chi. I&#x27;ve had it just over a month, and I love it. A lot of times when an item is priced so low, I tend to think the quality is compromised, but this product is inexpensive and of good quality!! It&#x27;s nice to know that, from now on, when my clumsiness gets the best of me, I can buy this fantastically priced, good quality item.</li>
    <li> It burned my hair, &amp; turned it from grey to yellow</li>
    <li> Love this thing. sure, your hair smells burnt afterwards but i mean, its a freaken hair straightener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works perfectly fine! heats up quickly and works well for my hair. cant argue with that :)</li>
    <li> This product really does well and the price is great. I&#x27;ve considered buying the more expensive straighteners and am glad I went with this one instead. I&#x27;ve been using this for months now and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a really good flat iron at a moderate price. I am African American with naturally kinky/curly hair. My Conair worked great when my hair was chemically relaxed but couldn&#x27;t smooth and straighten my hair in its natural state. So I read all the reviews online for the Remington and seeing the price thought I could eat the $20(couldn&#x27;t wait so bought at Target)if it didn&#x27;t work any better than the Conair. Wow was I surprised! It heats up exceptionally fast, glides nicely over the hair, smoothing and straightening with only a couple of passes per section. For me that&#x27;s miraculous considering my curly hair only gets flat ironed twice a year! Using Garnier Fructis heat styling products in conjunction with the flat iron has made my hair really sleek, shiny, bouncy and beautiful. Happy Happy Happy!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It does a great job of straightening my thick, shoulder length hair that tends to be wavy/a little frizzy.  Great price, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter and she really likes it.  The temp adjust is nice.  It straightens her hair better than any other straightener we have had.  This is a great product to buy if you want salon quality results but don&#x27;t want to pay the price of a professional straightener.</li>
    <li> This is just right in terms of heat. I heats up quickly and you can turn the temperature down when needed.</li>
    <li> Good, but not GREAT.  I feel like my hair gets a little oily quicker than it normally would when using this.  Other than that, it&#x27;s quick to use, and does cut down on the static.</li>
    <li> Very durable and easy to handle no to mention really good price</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I have stick straight hair but that does not stop me from curling my hair with this flat iron. I love that it has a heat setting. The instructions tell you what setting to put the degrees on depending on how thick or thin your hair is. There is also a warm up feature that tells you when the straightener is ready for use! my sister and I have bought many flat irons and this is by far the best one we have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron for under $20. Even better than most $100 ones. The plates move to help reduce lines. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with static. Gets crazy hot, 410°, but i wish it went a bit higher, like 450° range. It thin too height and width wise so its easy to use for people with smaller hands. My absolute FAVORITE feature, it locks shut!! I don&#x27;t know how many times Ive burnt myself on a hot iron. Great flat iron. Great price.</li>
    <li> Work great, heats up fast. One pass on my natural hair and it&#x27;s straight.</li>
    <li> Bought this over 2 years ago, and it still works like day one. I love the color, which truly isn&#x27;t part in it&#x27;s effectiveness, but still worth mentioning. My hair is very thick, and this straightener has always performed up to par. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener to buy if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on the professional ones. I&#x27;ve tried 2 from revlon but never got the same results. Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> This not a miracle straightener like some of the reviews say. It is just like every other straightener I have owned thus far ( I can&#x27;t speak as to the \\&quot;anti static\\&quot; claim ). It gets the job done well enough, but the best thing about this straightener is that it literally takes just a few seconds to heat up completely. I have never had a faster heat up.&lt;br /&gt;Also none of the other reviews I have seen haven&#x27;t mentioned the curling capability for this straightener. The edges are round enough to curl hair as well ( just go slow ). You can look on youtube for videos on how to curl with a straightener.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener!  It heats up super fast and is so easy to use.  It does a much better job than my old one!  You can beat the price!  I love the way my hair looks and feels too!</li>
    <li> Este es un buen producto. Los trámites para la adquisición, envío y recepción se cumplieron con facilidad y oportunidad. Muy contento con esta adquisición.</li>
    <li> Using this hair straightener in addition to a grounded plug/prong adapter worked perfectly for our trip to Spain and France.  It automatically detected and adjusted to the European voltage and is also wonderful for my use here in the States (it&#x27;s both 120V/240V).  It is the first hair straightener that I&#x27;ve owned, that actually makes my hair straight!  I use this iron on my thin, fine textured, wavy and semi dried hair after applying John Frieda Weather Works (applied to wet hair prior to towel drying) and my hair stays straight even after a long night of dancing.</li>
    <li> For the price I was a little skeptical how this product would perform, but I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to pay the $150 - $200 for the most popular brand.  I was suprised at how well this product has performed.  It heats to 380 degrees in about 30 seconds and is light and easy to use.  At this price, it can go out every six months and I&#x27;m still ahead of the game.</li>
    <li> I like this items and thanks for accepted my return because my wife Bought anther one   in first i need it a gift for here .</li>
    <li> I bought this iron from Target a few months back. Everyone at work told me to buy a Chi but let&#x27;s face it: I&#x27;m not made of money. I really wanted a ceramic that wouldn&#x27;t pinch my hair and wasn&#x27;t cheaply plated because I&#x27;ve had the ceramic peel off before with lesser quality straighteners. I can honestly say that this iron works just as well with my hair as my friend&#x27;s 100 dollar Chi. Definitely worth the price. I can&#x27;t attest to how long it lasts, but if you need a quick fix, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I have a thin, fine, frizzy hair. and this lil&#x27; iron works wonderful for it, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it when I first made the order but I thought i ain&#x27;t got much to lose beside the 12 dollars, but I was wrong, it&#x27;s worth more than that I would say. And Iam only using it on the first setting which 370 and that&#x27;s too hot for my hair but my new lil machine didn&#x27;t burn my hair :)</li>
    <li> This straightener arrived just as described.  I liked it so much that I&#x27;m getting one for my sister&#x27;s birthday as well.  Good deal for only twenty dollars.</li>
    <li> So I made a big research before purchasing the flat iron, because it was the first time that I was purchasing a hair straightener. But I got lucky, I absolutely adore it! It straightens hair very nicely without pulling it and it also lasts for a long time. You can not only straighten the hair, but also make flips and curls and I absolutely love it. The only minus of the product was that he first time I turned it on, it had some plastic smell, but it quickly disappeared, so I didn&#x27;t even pay attention top it. It has nice little lock for easy storing, different levels of temperature, 360 degrees turning cord, LCD display and buttons lock and it also has a very affordable price. I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> The plates are about 4 and 5/16 inches by 1 inch. The lowest setting is 310 degrees. Cost around $16. My hair looks much better after I use this. Haven&#x27;t used my old one since.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had super-cheap straighteners, and I&#x27;ve had relatively expensive (50-75 dollar) straighteners. The cheap ones have ALWAYS held up better and longer than the expensive ones. My Conair straightener just died about a week ago, and so I went on the hunt for a new one. Everyone in my circle of friends RAVES about the \\&quot;Chi\\&quot; brand. \\&quot;Oh you must have one,\\&quot; they say.. so I looked on here. Found one... then found this. Read the reviews, thought to myself: \\&quot;Well, if it sucks I&#x27;ve only wasted less than $20 bucks\\&quot; ... I&#x27;m in LOVE WITH THIS THING!! My hair has never been so straight and smooth in all my life, and I have very thick and wavy (almost curly) hair. I love it. My hair is pretty again and I&#x27;m so so so very excited. For the price, you can NOT beat this. I&#x27;m almost considering ordering another one for years down the road when this one finally gives out.. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!!</li>
    <li> Works and is affordable. Both my sister and best friend has gotten one since using mine</li>
    <li> I bought the one I have (and very soon will be returning) at Target.  It had good reviews on Target.com so, I thought it was going to be fine.....Nope!  Its a horrible straigtener   Barley straigtens anything  Leaves my hair looking like straw...and for me that says a lot b/c I am always getting compliments how nice and shiny my hair looks w/o doing anything to it  So essentially this thing sucks  Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> I went with this one after looking over several in different price ranges,Im glad I  went with this one,seeing its easy to handle,and works fast,My hair stays sleek till I wet it,It holds great.I use silk in my hair,and that helps.My hair is curly,and tends to get frizzy puffy and drives me nuts at times,This helps where I don&#x27;t have frizz.And gives me a different look at times.I use it on 310</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for a few weeks now, and it&#x27;s okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. In fact I&#x27;m surprised that it has so many 5-star reviews. If I had to do it over again I&#x27;d order a different one. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t sit flat on the bottom. It falls over, burns stuff - it&#x27;s unstable. It&#x27;s rounded on the bottom and there is no easy way to situate it so that it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t really destroy frizz all that well. I have wavy, thick hair - not super thick, but thick - and am often dealing with frizz. My old 2\\&quot; straightener, which I&#x27;d been using for years and didn&#x27;t have ceramic plates, did a WAY better job all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It does pinch and pull hair a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The plates clamp tighter at the front end than the inside end, which means uneven styling and again, possible pulling/pinching. Perhaps this is due to the \\&quot;floating\\&quot; plates?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. A small complaint, but it always turns on to the same temperature - 370. I always have to readjust, it doesn&#x27;t remember the temperature I always use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. This is hardly a complaint, but I have had very little success in curling my hair with this iron. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a combination of some of these issues or what. Everyone uses straighters to curl hair these days so it&#x27;s not that uncommon, so just thought I&#x27;d mention it in case you were considering using this iron for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few good things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does heat up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The lock feature is convenient and if the bottom sat straight it would be even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It does, in fact, straighten hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightner...it gets hot pretty quickly and was not expensive at all for the quality.</li>
    <li> After my $50 dollar Remington broke after 2 years of frequent use, I was convinced that the only quality straighteners that existed were ones that were $50+, like the John Frieda and the Chi. Fortunately, I was very wrong. This straightener works really well, and the price is fantastic!   (I have long, med-thick hair)  Pros:  - Heats up quickly  - Shuts off by itself after an hour (you don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally burning the house down!)  - Cute color  - Straightens hair well, and doesn&#x27;t get caught in your hair  - Leaves hair with a smooth appearance  - The buttons are located in a convenient place so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn it off during use  Cons:  - Smells bad when you turn it on, but the smell goes away eventually   Overall, I definitely recommend trying this straightener! One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon thus far. Go for it.</li>
    <li> It works great, I&#x27;ve been using an old one (maybe 3\\&quot; wide) and this straightener works even better with a smaller surface. Very worth the money, and slides really well and doesn&#x27;t pull. Just be smarter than me and don&#x27;t burn your head! My old straightener didn&#x27;t get too hot outside the ceramic so I could get close to my scalp. The plastic on this one gets very hot so be careful. I will from now on!</li>
    <li> For years I have wanted to buy a Chi for my hair.  I have bought other hair straighteners, they have been fine but nothing like a Chi.  Until now!!  I use my friend&#x27;s Chi any chance I get.  Until now!!  It gives my daughter and my hair a beautiful shine plus straightens fast.  My daughter and I both have thick hair and it usually takes us about 10-20 minutes to staightener our hair.  She wasn&#x27;t going to do it one morning before school because in her words \\&quot;It takes too long!\\&quot;  I said, \\&quot;Go try the new one.\\&quot;  She came out in less than 5 minutes later smiling from ear to ear and her hair looked great.  It is the best straightener especially for the price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used some of the more expensive Remington hair straighteners before, and I think this works as well as they do! I usually pass it through my (wavy, Asian) hair for 5 minutes and then I&#x27;m done. Very lightweight and portable, and the color is not as garishly purple as the online photo suggests. (It&#x27;s more of a matte rather than shiny finish.) I took away a star because I did notice a strange burning smell coming from the iron. But then again, I&#x27;ve used this item only 10 times (or fewer), so perhaps that goes away with time. Either way, it works really well, especially considering how affordable it is.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003S516XO Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener]]&lt;br /&gt; My daughter is very happy with this product. I got the cheapest one I saw on Amazon and we are very pleased with it. It works great!</li>
    <li> this straightener is very easy to use and heats up and cools down quickly. the temperature is displayed in a readout which stops flashing when it has been reached.  I&#x27;ve only seen a few others that are even close to the (very low) price I paid.  what&#x27;s not to like??</li>
    <li> It was time for me to get a new straightener and i didn&#x27;t want to buy one of those expensive ones so i gave this one a try. It isn&#x27;t as good as my last straightener. It no where near compares to a Chi but yet it gets the job done. 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener. You can adjust the heat so it&#x27;s easier to avoid burning your hair. It also heats up in 30 seconds just like it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
    <li> no problems. very good price for such a nice straightener</li>
    <li> Its okay. Def not the best ive used. Didnt do much to help my frizz, but i need a trim so ill withhold judgement until after a haircut and a few more uses. It does the job though so no complaints. Especially given the price</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this product</li>
    <li> For the price, this hair straightener rocks. I&#x27;ve used it to straighten and curl. Although it doesn&#x27;t compare to high end flat irons, it does a decent job. I like it, but I have never loved it. I have to run this through a few times before I get the straightened look I want.    The worse part of this straightener in my opinion, are the buttons. My ON/OFF switch doesn&#x27;t work well, and I have to push the small bar with my fingernail very hard for a few seconds before it turns on, and forget about when I have to turn it off. It sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#x27;t. That is a total fail because when I&#x27;m in a rush for work or school, I don&#x27;t have the patience to sit there trying to find the right position to turn it off.    I say spend a few more bucks and get a nicer one.    Edited:  I was contacted by a rep who swiftly took care of my issue. It appears I was using a defected product, as the buttons on the new straightener works with ease. I&#x27;m impressed by the great customer service, and I stand by my previous review about this product doing a rocking job for the price.</li>
    <li> I will stick to my Chi.  Used it on a trip abroad as to not ruin my Chi and it wasn&#x27;t smooth on my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair straightener over a year but the connection became disconnected betweenthe straightener to the cord if pulled out of the wall plug too often. I am buying this one a second time because I love the quality but because it became ruined easily.</li>
    <li> Heats up quick, no problem with the display so far. I love the temperature settings. Helps with varying how straight you may want your hair. Very good for price. Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> absolutely love it! I had the Zapphire for years and it finally broke! this was inexpensive and works GREAT! i do my hair a lot faster than the Zapphire this is light and it heats up quick! I have long, thick wavy hair past my bra strap! LOVE it now I hope it lasts!</li>
    <li> It lasted me 2 years exactly and it just gave up on me yesterday lol. Will be looking into getting one the same kind...</li>
    <li> Very good straightener for the money.  Smooth, doesn&#x27;t snag hair, gets pretty hot.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I just bought this straightener and I highly recommend it! I have curly/wavy hair and it makes my hair straight no waves. You can also curl your hair with it! It was a good bargain for a good straightener! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this straightener I can assure you!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great price!</li>
    <li> must be good my daughter will fight you for it!!!</li>
    <li> I love it, I will never use anything else but Remington, my second one and I have such thick and puffy hair and at the end of me flat ironing my hair with this iron my hair is straight silky and no frizz at all!!! :)</li>
    <li> I had been researching hair straightners for the last month or so and I must say I was impressed with this product! I received it in the mail today and just finished using it because I wanted to make sure it worked! I was a little skeptical at first when I got it out of the box and picked it up b/c it was very light weight but it really does the job! I have had another hair straightner that was 2 inches by Remington and I must say it didn&#x27;t heat up near as quick as this one did. If your like me, I have really thick, natural curly hair and sometimes it takes me 3-4 times to get my hair straight which can be frustrating and very time consuming. This little gadget only took me a total of 5 minutes to straighten my whole head with shoulder length hair. :) It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like some of the other ones do and its easy to press together which is advantage for me b/c I suffer with severe arthritis. The temperature settings come as if you were setting the oven to cook something, 325, 330 degrees and so on, so be careful when you pick it up because it does get very hot as soon as you turn it on, it&#x27;s also small enough that you can take it with you if you are a person that does lots of traveling. Also, this makes your hair really soft and a little shiny and I have well water and I&#x27;m always looking for products that will soften my hair. So, if you are reading these reviews all of them hold true about the product and I&#x27;m a very picky/particular person when it comes to buying things, especially online! Hope this helps for those of you looking for a good hair staightner. :)</li>
    <li> This baby could give a Chi flat iron a run for its money. I bought it thinking I could use it just on bangs or for maintenance after getting my hair straightened, but it&#x27;s so much better. I have thick, tight, curls. I have to either blow dry or braid my hair the night before I want to straighten it and only a Chi could get my hair pin straight. I bought this flat iron on a whim, and it&#x27;s amazing. Gets my hair straight with a nice shine and little to no damage depending on whether I use a heat protectant or not. It also curls hair better than my curling iron ever could for when I want to add volume and texture to my hair after straightening it. This flat iron is simply amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron!  Heats up quickly and works well.  You can adjust the heat level, too.  A lot of bang for your buck!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I ordered this about a year ago and still works like a charm! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!! Great value!!</li>
    <li> love this! definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this little straightener. I bought it for a lot less in Target probably 5 years ago. To be fair, I went through 3 of them in about 2 years, but since I bought the third model, I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it in at least 3 years. I have noticed it is taking longer to heat up, and doesn&#x27;t feel quite as hot, so I may replace it eventually but I truly don&#x27;t mind, as most $100+ straighteners only last a few years as well. I have thick, wavy hair, so I use the hottest setting (410 degrees) and I only have to go over the same section twice to get it perfectly straight. I&#x27;ve never used this on wet or damp hair - I wash at night, let it air dry while I sleep, and straighten in the morning (meaning my hair is a MESS and this thing does the trick). Or, I blow-dry and straighten immediately - always a great result.</li>
    <li> Great straightener!!! I was looking for months to find an inexpensive straightener that it light and easy to use and i definitely find it. I have really long and thick hair and it takes me usually an hour to straighten my hair. I also like to curl my hair with the straightener and I have to say this product really does it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s really light and it heats up in 30 seconds. I am really picky when it comes to hair styling products but this one is the best flat iron out there and you can&#x27;t do anything wrong with that.</li>
    <li> Sorry, it is not a great straightener.  First of all it is not anti static.  My hair had even more static when I was done straightening my hair.  It did not go thru my hair smoothly.  I had to put it on the highest setting because my hair is hard to straighten and yet I had to go thru several times.  I guess it is ok for the price and maybe a backup but this not something I would tell my friends about or buy again.  I have had many straighteners and this is not one I would recommend.  It is average at best!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I have fine/thin hair that straightens easily. This works very well--heats up quickly and straightens fast. I think the anti-static is a load of crap, though. I also don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t sit flat--it wants to roll over.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat irons. I even love the color of them! As soon as I plug them up they get hot very fast. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Everybody always ask me where I get this straightner from and what kind and when I tell them they can&#x27;t believe it. I love it. It straights really well and curls really well and the curls actually last. The only thing with mine now is it doesnt go through hair as smooth as it used to and i dont know if cleaning it is the issue or what. But i love it. Way under prices IMO</li>
    <li> Heats up quick and straightens my hair almost like magic.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and being low on funds, I decided to try this flat iron out........it works very very good........just as good as my Hot Tools. From now on, this is my Hot Tool!</li>
    <li> i read the reviews of this item and purchased it from amazon.  i tried it right away with super curly hair, not even blown dry straight.  it worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> I love the colour and how it is so easy to use. Every time I use it my hair feels so smooth and it heats up pretty quick!</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say that I love this straightner!!! I am VERY picky about my straightner and I have only used Paul Mitchell and Chi. Everytime I buy a Chi, it breaks with in a year. Since my Chi broke a few days ago, I had to find a quick solution that was not near expensive. I read many reviews and decided to try the Remington S5550. I tried it today and could not be happier. It works just as good or better than my Chi and its a fraction of the price. I may only get this straightner from now on:) I have curly,frizzy hair when its not straighted and this works perfectly. If this does not do the job, than I am not sure if anything will.</li>
    <li> I loveeee this flat iron it makes fell your hair very very smoth, I have a weavy hair and it really works well, just remember use it only with clean hair because the iron burns the hair when is dirty and oily, but in general this is really good flat iron, it came on time, well packaged, all was great! I recomend it</li>
    <li> It a little over thirty days old and it will not lower its temperature. And, it is past the thirty day return.</li>
    <li> Great buy I would recommend to all...I love that it heats up really fast,,I caution to start at a lower setting if you have fine hair or just don&#x27;t want that high heat damaging your hair like me..Overall I am very pleased with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this was going to be a great straightener because it was cheap but it&#x27;s so far been my favorite! It heats up in a few seconds and is great! Its very easy to use and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim to see if I would like a flat iron.  It was just the right price and it had great reviews.  The others reviewers were correct this is as good as much more expensive products.  I even bought a second one for my sister after she tried mine.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best one I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;ve gotten ConAir &amp; Revlon, and nothing compares to this. Straighteners like the KQC and Chi have results like this, but not for the price. I recommend this to anyone, and trust me, it wont burn your hair. Plus, the color is pretty. :D This is the best straightener I ever bought. :]</li>
    <li> This curling iron has worked great for corkscrew curls, which I bought it for. The cord, once wrapped up, does make it sit off-balance, but it&#x27;s ok. Have not tried it for straightening!</li>
    <li> I got this a few months ago and I used it about 3 times it was horrible . I have another Remington hair straightener called wet to straight and it is amazing and I&#x27;ve had it for 4 yrs I bought this because I wanted a new one and there was decent reviews .. But like I said it was horrible and didn&#x27;t do the job . DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY .. I have curly hair that usually gets straight in 18 minutes this took forever</li>
    <li> My hair is soft with normal texture and good volume. It poofs up a little every time I wash it because of the humidity. I had a conair straightener before which did not do anything to my hair except heat it. The puffiness would still remain. I ordered this straightener as a trial reading its reviews because it is not very expensive. I am so satisfied with this product. It heats up very quickly and straightens my hair perfectly within 5 minutes. People have been admiring my hair a lot. It also makes it looks shiny and full of life. My aunt who has a CHI straightener asked me how I get such perfect pin stripe straightening cuz it doesn&#x27;t happen with her $100 straightener haha. On the whole a 5 star performance. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> First, thanks to all the other reviews that led me to this product. Next, this is WAY cheaper at Walmart (as of Dec 2014). I was on the search to replace my Chi iron that finally gave out after years of use. I originally set out wanting a GHD straightener like the one my stylist has. However, as we are now on a much tighter budget than in the past, I started looking for a less expensive option that still works. I received this for my birthday and this product works great! My hair is naturally curly and medium thickness. With this I can straighten (or curl) my hair with ease. It takes me so much less time than even with my chi. I am so pleased and hope it lasts. A couple notes... The straightener gets very hot. Mine came preset to 370 and that is plenty hot to straighten my hair. When using it, the outside of this product gets pretty hot too. Not a huge deal, you just have to hold it the right way if it bugs you. I also love the auto shut off feature! My chi did not have this. Overall, great product!!! No need to pay $100+ for a great flat iron. Like I mentioned, I have seen this for $15 at Walmart.com.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this straightener, and would honestly say that it&#x27;s the best one I have had without busting my budget for YEARS. It straightens relatively quickly, and gives that smooth silky feel I love.</li>
    <li> I bought these exact same flatirons from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Store and they work wonderfully and straightens extremely well.</li>
    <li> This works great for my blond hair. It&#x27;s lightweight, but it has lasted a while, although, I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> I was looking around for straighteners myself, but I found $90 a bit pricey for a \\&quot;good\\&quot; flat iron. I found the reviews on here very promising, so it was an easy choice. I found it for $15 at Wal-Mart. They had plenty to go around there and it was convenient. I am surprised at how lightweight it is so you can hold it for long periods of time and it&#x27;s easy to wield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about the small size makes me feel like it&#x27;s just so cute! It performs very well, especially for the price. It has 6 settings at 310°, 330°, 350°, 370°, 390° and 410°. The numbers appears on a blue LCD that blinks until the temperature desired is reached. The cord is long enough so you can move around freely and has a swivel to make things easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have thick, curly, long brown hair and it takes only 10 minutes to complete. I don&#x27;t expect to have extremely straight, glossy hair like they show in commercials and I definitely can&#x27;t achieve the look of someone who has naturally straight hair, so you probably shouldn&#x27;t either for $15. That said, it tames my hair and gets it relatively straight which is a feat in and of itself. I&#x27;ve tried a more expensive flat iron by Paul Mitchell at a salon and I can&#x27;t see much a difference. I might be doing something wrong as I&#x27;m a bit new in terms of beauty stuff as I&#x27;m somewhat of a tomboy, but I don&#x27;t think I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, if you want an economical flat iron that works well, this is your best bet. As long you&#x27;re not one of those people who is expecting miracles, you will probably be satisfied. I&#x27;m sure someone with thinner hair will have better results than I have had os that should be more incentive to get it.</li>
    <li> ***Update: the customer service reached out super fast. Despite what happened to my product, I updated my review to 4 stars for the good service! ***I bought this item in Sept 2014, and it stopped working in Feb 2015... I did not drop it or mis-used it. I simply used it a week ago and put it back, the next thing I know is it cannot be turned on anymore... I have no idea why a product can only last for 5 months....and I only style my hair every weekends (2 days/ week). Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was a little uncertain about buying this flat iron because it was so inexpensive. I am so happy I did. It works great and it cut my straitening time down 8 minutes!!!! That&#x27;s a good thing because now I can sleep in an extra 8 minutes. I also like how I can adjust the heat, I didn&#x27;t even have it turned up all the way and my hair was pin straight in one swipe. (I usually had to go over each section 3x)</li>
    <li> Honestly, its a very good straightener. It heats up in 30 seconds, straightens very nicely and is really light and easy to pack up. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and i recently got it cut short so its even curlier. Bother of my younger sisters have this one so i ordered the same and i love it. it gets hot fast, cools fast, and straightens great!</li>
    <li> With wavy hair, a flat iron leaves hair straight for todays looks. It heats up quickly, has adjustable heat setting and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> before I have selected this product, I have read the reviews of all other similar products and couldn&#x27;t decide which one to buy. I was considering convenience, safety, easy usage, good results and price. It was hard to decide. This product was not being reviewed as much as other brands but I decided to give it a try. I am very happy now to choose this one. It is light in weight, the ceramic portions are wide enough to hold large hair sections, makes the hair straightened very fast and I found it safe to use. I have a wavy hair and had no trouble making it straight. If you have a very thick and curly hair, you may need to do it couple of times but I think it is going to work and you will like it.     My husband generally not recognizes small changes on me but as soon as he saw me after I have straightened my hair, he has commented on that. He liked it very much.     The color of the straightener is also really nice and the price is super. no need to give lots of money to other products. I think you will love this one.</li>
    <li> I just bought this flat iron and after a lot of research and coming to the conclusion that a ConAir would be my best choice, I could not find any that weren&#x27;t a ridiculous price. So, I found this one and it was more in my price range. I was skeptical at first because it had not gotten good reviews that I had seen, but I took a chance, came home with it and tried it out and LOVE it! It is exactly what I was looking for, light , easy to use, and works great with my long (middle of my back) blond wavy/frizzy hair. I used a little heat protectant after drying and it did a great job! The only unpleasant thing I noticed was the smell but for just coming out of the package I figure this will go away on it&#x27;s own once warn in a bit. Plus the purple is cute! I love that it also has a lock and auto off and it does heat up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, give it a shot! I did! You won&#x27;t be let down!</li>
    <li> Hi, it works perfectly to me..I live in a country which must of the months are cloudly and with much humidity..., my hair looks beautiful...  Mega like and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair straighteners I&#x27;ve had, and if you&#x27;re on a budget this is a great one to buy. Its easy to know when it&#x27;s finished heating up, the digital readout glows and then blinks as it&#x27;s heating up, then simply glows when it&#x27;s ready to use. It also has a digital readout of the degree it&#x27;s set at so you can make sure you have the right setting for your hairtype. It heats up fast, and is thin and stylish looking. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and would recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES this</li>
    <li> I searched around for a cheap straightener to buy before going and buying this one, as it had the best reviews. I have to say, this straightener definitely went above and beyond my expectations. I love it so much! Definitely worth more than I paid for it, I think! It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair, and it took probably less than 5min to straighten my hair- it&#x27;s thick and medium length. definitely expected to be straightening my hair for much longer. A pleasant surprise for sure! If you&#x27;re unsure about it, go buy it- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for several months and only have used it sparingly, say 5-10 times. I tried to plug it in this afternoon, and it won&#x27;t turn on! I&#x27;ve tried multiple sockets, so I know it&#x27;s not the electricity. While it worked, it worked well. I&#x27;m so irritated it broke already though!</li>
    <li> Thank heavens for customer rating and review- it&#x27;s what sells me on a product these days. And everyone was rightabout this straightener! My hair is thick, frizzy, and down to the center of my back. Nothing had worked and i was going through irons like crazy!! Luckily though, i stopped by amazon to see wht others were purchasing and stumbled upon this device...WOW. My hair looks so nice, and i just woke up and my hair is still looking straight and sleek. This is my new fav iron and THANKS everybody for your feedback..Remington S5500 was an excellent investment and wht a great price, and colour.</li>
    <li> a very good strengthener, much better than my old Revlon (which has burned right before the day the Remington arrived). I can use it to curl my hair too.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old professional brand (read over $100) straightener finally met its maker. After years of travel and use I wasn&#x27;t ready to buy another $100+ straightener. People kept saying not to spend so much so I didn&#x27;t. So far it&#x27;s not half bad. Pros and cons:  Pros:   Price  Heats up fast  Auto shut off  Locks shut  Ceramic   Variable temperature  Cons:  The highest temperature of 410 doesn&#x27;t seem to match what my professional model did  Hair is slightly less tolerant of humidity when compared to how much it would tolerate it after using my professional brand  Requires more than one pass to straighten stubborn hair  Although it requires more than one pass I still rate this high. It&#x27;s good on hair and is worth the price. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a miracle worker ♡♡♡ I love it to death , omg it works well on my clients as well as my family when I&#x27;m working . Its a stress reliever because I don&#x27;t have to go over the hair as many times and a bonus is it instantly heats the package said a few minutes but once it turns on it heats up its lightweight it locks which is good for being around children I recommend this 200% I&#x27;m buying a second one just in case they stop selling .</li>
    <li> This ceramic hair straightener is everything everyone said and more.  I had an expensive $100 one and this is just as good if not better, love it!!!!</li>
    <li> By far the BEST i have used! i completely recommend it to all my friends and they have bought it too because of me, they love it too! its fast, doesnt damage your hair and it doesnt weight much... besides the big fact that it is cheap, it is GREAT!</li>
    <li> cable giratorio, temperatura turbo y ceramica anti estatica. cumple todo los requisitos requeridos de un producto de su tipo.  de un producto barato y efectivo.   Mi esposa lo recomienda. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington for long  now.. i tried this model for the first time..I have frizzy and thin hair.. So I am very careful trying any hair straightening,coloring products...I use the straightener once a week.. When I used this one , I was amazed to learn that it took me simply no time to get my hair straight as compared to the previous straightener I was using.. Its sleek, light weight, and does the job in no time and a complete value for money... You just need to know what temperature suits your hair and accordingly set it else you may land up spoiling your hair with frequent usage. I highly recommend this product for the first time user and for all those who don&#x27;t wont a big hole in the pocket because it delivers the same results as any expensive , professional hair straightener..</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two weeks. Awesome results. Heat fast, easy handle, no burning. I wished that I used it ten years ago.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for its price&lt;br /&gt;well worth every penny&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product to any one&lt;br /&gt;looking to purchase a hair straighter</li>
    <li> At the beginning of my hair journey in&#x27;10, I purchased this, thinking I&#x27;d know what to do and I&#x27;d do it well, well that wasnt the case. I Finally used it, no lie, 7/16/11 and \\&quot;omg\\&quot; is all I could say on 370 and one pass the whole way around my head, My hair was done. I am stretching my relaxer, possibly transitioning. My hair was beautiful, Still is after I applied my moisturizer mix [[ASIN:B00152F4OY Fantasia Leave in Treatment Moist Aloe Complex 12 oz.]] and [[ASIN:B001555G26 Fantasia Leave In Treatment 12 oz. Hair &amp; Scalp]]. And later on today my hair is still flowing and shiny, like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I am in love with this. Was going to give this flat iron away  but seeing the reviews on the [[ASIN:B003V3AZJY Remington S6500 Sleek and Curl Ceramic Pearl Multi-styler Hair Straightener, 1 Inch]]. I am so not interested. This one will do!!! O and no fly aways! Woohoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This iron started to snag my hair and definitely crack the last and final time of use and I was livid. The plates also started to wear off, leaving the silver residue in my hair. As I had hoped it wouldn&#x27;t happen, the iron really did worse than good. Thanks but no thanks.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money! I have been using it from past 6 months and it still continues to work fine. I&#x27;ve tried many flat irons before and had to return all of them because of poor results. Thereby I decided to get this one and got it from Walmart. Finally found my type...</li>
    <li> Only lasted 6 months.</li>
    <li> After 7 years my hair straightener broke, I tried to find the same one but couldn&#x27;t find it cause I didn&#x27;t know the name. I decided to try this one and I love it. Makes my hair really smooth and doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up.</li>
    <li> This is the best flatiron I have honestly ever owned. I&#x27;ve had this over a year now and it straightens my hair phenomenally. I have curly, fine textured african American hair that I hate taking forever to straighten and this does this trick and makes it so smooth. I literally can straighten my collarbone length hair in 20 mins.</li>
    <li> I have rather straight hair, so I haven&#x27;t had too many problems in the past with straighteners, however this one is much better than the ones I have owned in the past.  It heats very quickly, and does wonders to curl my hair.  I have never found a curling iron that can keep a curl more than an hour or two.  While the curl does relax after half of the day, I do still have curly hair at the end of the day.  I would (and have) reccommend this straightener to anyone.</li>
    <li> love this straightener! the price is perfect and the heat control is a nice feature and helps with different hair types! i would most definitely compare this to other much more expensive straighteners and put full support behind this one!</li>
    <li> I am african american with natural 4b typed hair. I wanted a cheap but good flat iron to straighten my hair once or twice a year. I received this in great condition. The packing was good. I haven&#x27;t iron my full head yet, but I tried it on a small piece of hair and I like the result.   After using this iron to do my hair, I have to say that although the result was good I hated the process. It pull my hair out, I I had to do many passes in order to fully straightening my ends. I will not be using this item again. For 20 bucks I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> this is really good. it is not too small but proper enough to use. The colour is really wonderful and the heat is good.</li>
    <li> One of the best straighteners you can buy. We didn&#x27;t buy one on here but we have this product. Very good. But, I find that ours is not anti static. Only downside.</li>
    <li> I like too much this iron even if it was my sister in law gift! Jaja I used it and it leaves my hair so soft and straight!</li>
    <li> Now, I haven&#x27;t tried CHI. So this may not \\&quot;the best out there\\&quot; but I LOVE this. I have NO complaints!! This works wonders on my thick hair. I&#x27;ve never had shinier, straighter hair before.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair straigth... although im not very curly, it leaves my hair really shiny and silky. It gets hot real quick, and it takes me around 25 min to straighten my hair (I have a lot of it, and long too)</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical about buying a product that was this cheap. But I have to say I love it! I needed another flat iron because my &#x27;indestructable&#x27; chi broke. I researched online and most products like this one were either really expensive  or so cheap that they weren&#x27;t worth a flip. I have short thick, wavy hair and this product straightens my hair in 10 minutes! I&#x27;m really pleased with it. I recommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> I really like this iron because when combined with heat protectors my hair feels light and it does not smell! It gets hot but not out of control hot! It functions and works properly! It&#x27;s just right for its quality!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and everything was perfect.</li>
    <li> my wife loved it!&lt;br /&gt;she said it was so easy to straighten her hair with this.&lt;br /&gt;she said it took a quarter of the time it used to take with the her old one.</li>
    <li> Works great. Heats up and cools down quickly.</li>
    <li> I am sure that an even better flat iron is out there, but for less than twenty dollars I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This is so much better than my last one.  I was concerend about it being only one inch since I have thick hair, but it is still very fast.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it. Said it works just as well as seriously more expensive &amp;#34;chi&amp;#34; straighteners she&#x27;s had in the past.</li>
    <li> Nice and perfect product.</li>
    <li> Okay... Seriously this straightener is probably the best investment I have ever made. So back in the day I was using the Chi and I absolutely loved it. But then it decided to stop working so I got this terrible conair straightener that just made my hair frizzy and dry feeling. So I looked on Amazon to see if maybe I could find a good cheap iron. I decided to buy this one because the reviews were good and I mean only $17? Even if it was terrible I was just gonna send it back. And most cheap irons don&#x27;t work on my hair because my hair&#x27;s really thick and curly. So I got the straightener and I tried it and I was so shocked! It straightened my hair so well, and it heats up in seriously 30 seconds. I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Bought for my teenaged daughter, loved so much bought another for myself have used multiple times and happy with the results every time.</li>
    <li> This straightener is great. I was thisclose to buying another more expensive Remington model, but realized the frills were not necessary. The basics are there like temperature control, automatic shut down, and even a lock, and it is also very comfortable to use. At this price, it&#x27;s a definitely a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> This product seemed super powerful at first, but killed my hair.  Beware! I regularly use hot irons, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any protection.</li>
    <li> works great, within 5 minutes all my hair is straight! it gets very hot fast. love it so far! The tip of the straightener get too hot, which makes it hard to curl tips of my hair, but that why there&#x27;s curling irons too.  For a straightener, it works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been mistakenly using ceramic-coated flat irons, eventually wearing off and basically using metal plates for my hair. The Remington has 100% ceramic plates and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner. It left my thick wavy hair hair silky smooth. However I&#x27;m giving this a four star b/c of the unpleasant steamy smell it stenches once you turn it on.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe as it is able to accept a wide variety of voltages.  Most straigteners (including the one typically used at home) are limited to 110V, making them not suitable for use abroad.  However, this one works in both the UK and mainland Europe (with a plug adapter, of course).  It&#x27;s also fairly small and the performance of this was pretty good -- especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener does everything it claims to. It heats up quickly to different temperatures, glides through my hair without snagging, and leaves it looking smoother. It is a vast improvement over the little travel straightener I have. My hair is relatively thin and straight, so this is all I need. I&#x27;ve used this straightener for several weeks, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the price and performance.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, straightens without over drying.  One side of the straightener&#x27;s metal part is \\&quot;floating,\\&quot; which helps the straightener glide over your hair.  This helps your hair come out smooth, without crease marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, but watch out on the packaging.  I cut my hand trying to get it open (not on the scissors, on the plastic.)</li>
    <li> Love these. Had them for one week now and my hair(Brazilian extensions) hasn&#x27;t been this straight with little to no static in a very long time. Highly recommended by ME. Lol</li>
    <li> Im so glad i purchased this after reading all the reviews i was like \\&quot;get it or not\\&quot; but most of the reviews was positive. So i was like OK i need to order mine also, so i did it:)&lt;br /&gt;Its faster shipping which is plus, and i try using it.. Oh my! i love it.. After straightening my hair, it feels soft &amp; shinny. Also i didnt take like 45 mins to an hour to do my hair exactly i want it. Done quick, heat up quick. Im a happy woman:) Thanks Remington for affordable &amp; good quality Product:) Im surely recommend this to all the ladies who wants to straight there hair quick &amp; make that glossy effect:) enjoy...</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this straightener. First of all, it&#x27;s slim. It&#x27;s 1 inch wide, which is enough to straighten my thick medium-length hair thoroughly, but precisely. It&#x27;s also hot enough for my hair thickness and texture. I use it at a 350 or 370 degrees temperature. It helped reduce fly aways and frizz. It&#x27;s visually appealing, and it&#x27;s AFFORDABLE. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more! It makes straightening hair a lot easier for me; it used to take at least an HOUR to straighten my hair, and now it takes 30 minutes, TOPS. I can also curl my hair with it, which makes it a great 2-in-1 tool. HUGE PLUS!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my mom who has short hair.  I style her hair for her.  It styles beautifully either straight or curly.  My only complaint is that the outside where the plates are gets very very hot.  Hard to hold on to that area without burning yourself.  I own a Solia for myself and it doesn&#x27;t get hot on the outside like this one does.  A wonderful product for the price for sure!!!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and does the job on my long and very thick hair.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend is very good and very responsible people who sell very, very good has a very good heating treatment is tot...</li>
    <li> Initially I thought about spending a ridiculous amount of money on a new flat iron. I decided to try this one out first and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price and the quality!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m new to the world of hair flattening, well, new to doing anything at all with my hair other than brushing it and sticking it in a ponytail. Recently decided \\&quot;Hey, I wanna look nice\\&quot; so I got my hair cut, I love those choppy Asian hair cuts that are so popular these days, thought I could pull it off, even though I&#x27;m white... blonde... and have extremely wavy hair. So, my formerly past shoulder, single length hair is now extremely layered and still past shoulder length, and turned curly from all the lost hair weight... Looked like Joe Dirt of Farrah Fawcett. Bought a Revlon flat iron, took forever to heat up, and several sloooow passes through each section  to get it even remotely flat, we&#x27;re talking 45 minutes to straighten my hair! Then that one started acting funky, either would not heat, or would only stay heated for a few minutes, yesterday after only 6 uses it died completely. So, considered giving up the ghost and going back to looking like a slob all the time, but found this Remington flat iron affordably priced here on amazon. Ordered with with the Prime 2 day shipping and it was here in less than 24 hours (sweeeet) just HAD to try it out immediately and it literally took under 10 minutes to completely flatten my hair, this is including the time it took me to read the instructions on it. So many pros to this flat iron! You can lock the buttons on it so you don&#x27;t accidently change the heat setting during use, the digital display flashes while it&#x27;s heating, when it stops flashing you know it&#x27;s ready. I used it set on 350 and it only took a single pass through each section. Another great feature is at the base near the cord is a lock so you can lock the plates shut during storage, less ricks of it breaking this way. I love this flat iron.  Also, if you&#x27;re a newbie to the flat iron world like me, there is so much more you can do with a flat iron than straighten your hair, check out BubzBeauty on YouTube, she has tons of easy, well explained/demonstratedhair tutorials.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good straightener if you don&#x27;t want to spend much. Even after having it for over a year, it works well enough, which is better than other straighteners I&#x27;ve had. The digital heat adjusting function on mine gradually stopped functioning, but that wasn&#x27;t a big problem since I only used one temperature anyway. Not the best thing around, but it does its job.</li>
    <li> BEST straightener I have ever used...and I&#x27;ve used a LOT of straighteners.  Usually it takes me about 20 minutes to straighten my hair after I blow dry it straight.  With this straightener, it had my hair straightened in 5 minutes while still curly!  I was completely amazed and shocked at how well it worked.  I love it so much that I&#x27;ve ordered two more for family members!  All the reviews are completely true. :)</li>
    <li> Something was wrong with the power to the hair straightener. I would turn it on and then the power would turn off. Sometimes it would take 3 hard presses of the on button before the power would actually come on. Returned this product due to this issue.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron and I was very happy with the results. Until it started to burn my hair after about 2months of use and then it just stopped working all together after about 4 months. I&#x27;m sooooo DISAPPOINTED!!! I know how to style and do hair very well. I use CHI products for my hair when styling and this flat just destroyed my hair and now its totally dead.</li>
    <li> First, a little about me:  I have very thick, coarse curly hair, and I&#x27;ve been straightening it for about 10 years now.  I started rough, with a terrible cheap straightener bought in a drug store, then with an expensive (2\\&quot; wide plates) one purchased by my mother, and most recently with a chi knockoff that did an adequate job.  I&#x27;ve been holding out for a CHI for a long time, asked for one for every major holiday, and always came up disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on this straightener, and figured that for $16 I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  Plus the reviews made this iron sound like it was BETTER than the CHI, so I had to find that out for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best iron I have ever used, and I am SO happy I never shelled out $100+ for an iron!  This iron gets my hair super straight in a very short time, it heats up to 410 degrees very fast, has an automatic shutoff if it stays on too long (I&#x27;m a repeat offender of leaving my iron on when I leave my house, then worrying all day if my apt is burning down), and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how soft and shiny my hair looks after straightening it.  Seriously the best iron you can buy for the money, and it&#x27;s a really pretty color purple to top it all off.  A+!  Have already recommended to all my friends, now recommending to the world.  Buy it, love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my 6 year olds hair. It works great.</li>
    <li> I just love it.... It makes my hair really silly and shiny  and I would highly recommend this😃</li>
    <li> My super fancy hair straightener conked out on me 2 days before I had to go out of town for a professional conference (although this was after several years of moderate use).   I did not have enough money to buy an expensive one, so I read the reviews on this one and took my chances.  This one is EVEN BETTER than the other one.  I am caucasian with really thick, wavy hair and this makes a very quick job of straightening my hair in the morning.  I really only have run it down a wide section of hair once!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Got it delivered super fast. The result was awesome and unbelievable at this low cost! My hair stayed straight and smooth for days until I washed them. Even if it lasts for an year I would be happy at this cheap price because I have heard it happen to Chi straighteners even after paying over hundred bucks. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Good and light weight</li>
    <li> What a bargain... works great, heats up quick, styles lasts all day. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This straightener is cool both of my daughters enjoy using them. Their friends want to use it as well thanks.</li>
    <li> I needed a new iron and couldn&#x27;t pass this one up! Can&#x27;t wait to give it a try. Love the color!</li>
    <li> Great straightener for the price! Like the digital temperature display, but wish there was an auto shut-off mechanism.</li>
    <li> I like this hair straightener, it feels a little rough on my hair the first time I used it compare to a better product, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine, and the resuts are good.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price!  Replaced a $200 flat iron with this and it works just as well as the expensive one!</li>
    <li> This iron is amazing and I love it!. price was perfect and I LOVE purple so thats an A+ in my book.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly hair and this iron does the trick in getting it straight and shiny. I am very pleased with my product. I highly recommend buying this product and get it while its free shipping! :)</li>
    <li> Works really well, almost as good as the super expensive ones and worth the 100+ dollars you save. I have natural really curly hair and it straightens very easily</li>
    <li> Shipping was so fast and it&#x27;s also work really well.&lt;br /&gt;I love the price the most. &#x3D;))</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron, super fast heat up, literally only took a minute, the heat is great I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it. Bought this flat iron about 2 years ago and works just as good as the day I bought it. Best $20 I&#x27;ve ever spent, if this one ever breaks, there is no doubt I&#x27;ll be buying the same one the next time.  I made the above review in 2011 and I am making this edit in 2016 with the same flat iron right next to me, still works beautifully and I have never been so happy with a purchase, seriously if you need a flat iron, this is the one.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I was so impressed with my experience, I felt the need to share -- especially for other black women who are either transitioning or have transitioned to their natural textured hair. I needed a new flat iron after my GHD began to sputter out, but I did not want to spend $100 on another flat iron (I had previously used a CHI before the GHD). I did my research, and got this Remington. I&#x27;m an African-American female with thick, curly hair, so I was skeptical that this product would work well for me. I was completely wrong. I could tell with the first swipe down my hair. The heat and the wide plates (I went with a 1 3/4\\&quot; iron) got me more smooth and silky than the GHD ever did in half the time. It looks like I have a relaxer, and, unlike the GHD, I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is going to puff up at the slightest hint of humidity. This was definitely a great purchase, a great value, and I&#x27;m so excited for summer now that I have a reliable flat iron.</li>
    <li> It does its job, but it really stinks. My sister&#x27;s straightener works just fine though, minus the burning smell, so I probably just got a bad one.</li>
    <li> All I can say is a must have! I searched Amazon for a hair straightener that wasn&#x27;t too much money, but worked very well and durable. I came across this one and it had great reviews and price, so I gave it a try. The shipping was fast and the product is GREAT! I have used it only once so far but I am very pleased. Heats up fast, and it only takes one stroke through my hair and its straight. It stays true to its word with no static. I&#x27;m happy I bought this product. If I had to compare it to another straightener it would have to be the CHI, only not as expensive.</li>
    <li> You can get  this item for 15 $ in wallmart store.....it is expensive here...you get for cheaper price in other stores like wallamart..</li>
    <li> We bought this to take to Europe because Amazon advertised it as \\&quot;Dual Voltage\\&quot;.  The unit is NOT dual voltage.  It operates on 120VAC 60Hz only.  We did some more research and it looks like most if not all of Conair&#x27;s units are dual voltage.  We did not use this hair straightener prior to returning it to Amazon, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s actual function.</li>
    <li> The best iron ever. It takes five minutes to curl the bottom of my long  hair. I get so much compliments at work. Just be careful to never touch the ceramics. I burnt my finger. the scar is still there. Maximum temp is 370 degrees</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t like this, I&#x27;ve had this straightener for years and I prefer it over some on my $100 ones. I have straight hair already so I use this as a quick de frizz and make my hair neat. My mother has curly frizzy hair and it works well on her hair too.</li>
    <li> The Remington S5500 Digital Anti static straightener is about $17 dollars at Walmart online!! Just checked to see if I was getting good deal, happy I did before I bought it here!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this hair straightener for my daughter. She is both African American and Caucasian, and has curly soft hair. I began straightening her hair with this product and was very surprised with the ease of using the product. I did need to run the straightener over some of the hair twice to be sure it was completely straight. Not only does the straightener do wonders for my daughters hair, but I use it often with my hair which is thick straight hair, and it does excellent at taming the frizz and getting those unruly ends to all face the same way. The straightener heats quickly and is ready to use in under a minute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener has been the go to tool in our house for a few months now, and I love it! The other thing I love about this straightener is that it works so great and is so incredibly cheap! I don&#x27;t know how long it will last me, but I would definitely not be upset if I had accidentally broke the straightener and needed to buy a new one, because it would not set the pocketbook back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this straightener!</li>
    <li> Truly no static, and heats up in seconds, I absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> I got this product after losing my other straightner in another state (left it at the hotel on accident). I really needed a straightener to give me a variety of hair styles available for my medium-length hair. Of course as soon as I turned this straightener on after plugging it in, it shut off. It has continued to do that every time I try to use it. It will charge for less than a minute and then it shuts itself down. I hate this product. Very, very disappointed. Shame on you people for selling such a crappy product.</li>
    <li> When I turn it on it makes my entire apartment stink like burning plastic, works great, but the smell almost made me return it.</li>
    <li> I love purple, so this product definitely caught my eye. The digital temperature LCD makes me feel like I&#x27;m using some really expensive straightener, but in reality it is so affordable. I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to ship to me, so I sucked it up, went to target and paid 3 bucks more for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight- any lighter and I&#x27;d tell you it was a toy. Features three temperature ranges for fine, normal, and thick hair. The swivel cord is nice and long. First the blue LCD keeps flashing as it tries to make its way up to 370. I didn&#x27;t adjust the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have noticed, it only takes minutes to do your hair. This thing is SO fast. I consider my hair normal/ easy to style and was attempting to use this straightener to put waves in my hair. It was so hot I had to work fast. Each strand was done in 2 seconds. I was scared if I took any longer the straightener would burn through my hair. At one point I left it for a second longer and steam came out. My hair was completely dry so that was definitely not the greatest surprise. Heat Protectant spray is a must!! Next time I will put it on the lowest temperature setting. The waves/curls turned out great, the plates didn&#x27;t catch/pull my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has buttons for you to adjust temp up and down, an off/on button, and a switch for you to lock the straightener closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the packaging is terrible. It&#x27;s made of strong plastic so the product is protected, but it&#x27;s a nightmare to cut through the plastic. My scissors were worn down. While the iron was heating, a smell akin to melting plastic arose. That is not good. I hope it&#x27;s only temporary- should have wiped the plates down. Lastly, the back of the straightener gets very hot. You may wonder why anyone would touch there, but it helps when turning your hair. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t just melt and break down on me. We shall see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this product multiple times over the course of a year, I am still very happy with it! The \\&quot;melting plastic\\&quot; smell has disappeared, and the plates still go through my hair smoothly without catching.</li>
    <li> Really good product and price..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bigger than I thought it would be but other than that it&#x27;s perfect. The actual iron is very long and fast to heat up and the rotating cord makes it very easy to use. Being able to adjust the temperature easily is also a definite plus.</li>
    <li> I never bought a straightener before, so I may not have a lot to compare it to.  For me, I didn&#x27;t want to spend crazy amount for hair appliances. I&#x27;m all for convenience and practical. I was pleased with my friend&#x27;s Remington hair dryer, better than my conair hair dryer so i stuck with Remington brand rather than Conair. Remington seemed to have a better design and make my hair look better.   It&#x27;s quick to heat up, makes my bed hair straight. I have asian thick hair and it can still curl it and give it some style. the swivel cord makes it easy to handle.   I am very satisfied with my purchase. i have looked for a month and read many reviews on other products. I am very pleased and I recommend everyone to use this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints, it does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> the straightener heats up within 30 secs from the lowest to the highest temperature. great sleek design. leaves my hair smooth. however, when i turn it on, it smells like something is burning and leaves my hair with that burnt scent.</li>
    <li> This flatiron is everything works like a charm</li>
    <li> wonderful works like those Irons that cost $25.00 in the malls. Love it!</li>
    <li> This straightener works uber well. It really is static free. Has a 30 second start up which is super efficient and pretty much everything listed in the info is true. It&#x27;s got different temperature levels which is great if you have damaged hair and don&#x27;t want to continue to burn it as much. It comes which a guide that suggests which temperature to use according to your type of hair. Works just as well and maybe even better than the more expensive irons. I highly recommend it. :) Thanks Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and does the job. Haven&#x27;t found any damage to the hair yet. Recommend to those who needs a quick ironing before work.</li>
    <li> Coming from someone with super curly hair, I was shocked that this actually get this job done for those days I get the urge to go straight. Definitly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great seller all is ok!!!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. It leaves my hair shiny and super straight. Do recommend!</li>
    <li> this flat iron is excellent for me.  i already have fairly straight hair that just waves a bit so i wasn&#x27;t worried about getting an expensive iron since it doesn&#x27;t take much, but with the high heat i think it would work pretty well for curly hair too.  the heat is adjustable (310-410 degrees) so when im smoothing out my hair i can turn it low and when im curling with it i turn it high and the curls HOLD and look fantastic. it heats up for me in literally about 15 seconds and the temperature reading blinks as it does so when it stops you know its ready.  the cord swivels easily so also make curling way easier.  only con is it does get a bit hot to the touch on the outside tip.  also its not quite as vibrant a purple as in the picture, but the other customer images show it pretty accurately.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron for my weave but not for my real hair. it works wonders on my weave it makes it shine and manageable.</li>
    <li> Its really nice, I like it. Something will last you long</li>
    <li> Works quick and very good in this cheap price!!!! Nice product of Remington:) specially 1 inch plate is perfect for my short hair....</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my girlfriend! I don&#x27;t see the point on buying a 50 dollar Chi coz this one does the same thing all hair straighteners are supposed to do!! It&#x27;s very very thin on the hand and she loves it to death!! It heats up really quick and has some functions like automatic off if not used. You can also lock it so it doesn&#x27;t swing ope. The first 5 times she used I remember smelling a burnt scent but it didn&#x27;t do that later on. This is a great product for its price!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item a couple weeks ago and have used it for about a week. Befor I settled on this flat iron I looked at all the ones available priced from 20-100. I had gotten my hair done by my sister who is in school from cosmotology and she used her flat iron and I loved it. Hers was called cricket. I used to have a babyliss that I got a great deal on and loved but It fell of the counter and broke so I settled for a pretty polka doted one from walmart. But honestly I wouldnt settle for anything but the best and I was skeptical about this one because I figured its cheap, So there must be something wrong. NOPE. I was wrong and my husband actually found this one online for me and said give it a try befor we go more expensive. So skeptical again we ordered it and it works wonders. I would deff. recommend this to anyone who is looking for a non expensive straightner that gives salon results.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have short hair, so this is just the right size and it heats up very fast, so you aren&#x27;t standing there waiting for it to get hot.</li>
    <li> Works great! Heats up fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other straightening irons before but this one is by far the best for the price. Don&#x27;t take that to mean if you buy a $150 GHD or CHI that you&#x27;re getting better performance. Quite the contrary, this straightener works just as well as the GHD styler used by my hair dresser. It heats up quickly and works even quicker. My hair is very thick and very wavy and I only had to run this through my hair maybe twice and the second time was to get the stragglies in my hair that refuse to be straightened even by an industrial dry cleaning press. I couldn&#x27;t recommended this more. My roommate also loves it and doesn&#x27;t use her Rusk straightener anymore!</li>
    <li> Gracias por el producto. Me llegò muy ràpido. Estoy muy satisfecho.[[ASIN:B003S516XO Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener]]</li>
    <li> Works great! Heats up very quickly and you don&#x27;t have to go over each section constantly. Compares to more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> This iron smells horrible.  I had hoped the smell would eventually go away but it hasn&#x27;t.  The plates are not very smooth and seem to catch on my hair.  After just a couple of months the numbers on the display have started to &amp;#34;short out&amp;#34; and do not appear clearly.  Sadly I have missed my window of opportunity to return this straightener.  I would not recommend this iron.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. My hair is just a little wavy and it&#x27;s the perfect tool for straightening or adding some fancy straightener curls. :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener to replace a Sedu product that I had been using for 6 years. I like how small and lightweight this straightener is, and I really enjoy the digital temperature setting. I&#x27;m an African American woman with relaxed hair, so I use this to smooth out frizz after blow drying and to add some shape to my hair (I keep it cut short in a bob). I like how close I can get to my roots with this straightener, and I can use a lower heat setting and still get great results. It heats up quickly and stays hot, and I do notice that it gives my hair nice shine. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair but the plastic gets very very hot</li>
    <li> I seldome write reviews untill I really think that the product is wonderful! and this is it!Compared to it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s almost impossible for you to find another one in another stores that has such a good quality. 1.i like its digital display of temparature. easy to read and adjust the temp. 2.my hair is colored several times and damaged.it&#x27;s anti-stactic funtion really help.even though in the pretty dry weather, you don&#x27;t have to worry about fuzziness.i&#x27;m a luzy person,so i really want a fast and convenient product. with this one, u only need to spend no more than 3 minutes to finish straightening!!and keep the style whole day! 3.it heat up very fast(30s).4.the connection between the device and wire is not fixed.it can rotate!!this is very important,because when you move ur device in different angles or from one hand to another hand,u don&#x27;t need to worry about the twisted wires.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact make/model last year as a Christmas gift for my oldest daughter (18). The girls are rough on their hair styling tools so I figured, for the price, it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try this one. That straightener is working GREAT!! So last week when my next daughter (16) broke her second cheapo straightener this year we decided to buy her one of these. So far, so good. She tells me she loves it! It heats perfectly, quickly and glides smoothly over her hair. This inexpensive straightener performs better and lasts longer than so many of the very expensive ones we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I bought two - one for my teenage daughter and one for me so when she goes out of town or to school, I am not left without one.&lt;br /&gt;This completely met the expectations and write up. I heats up quickly and stores easily too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener. I&#x27;ve had luxury brand straighteners and I would confidently put this guy up against all of them in a blindfolded contest to see which leaves your hair shinier, straighter, and with less damage.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the reviews I read here and I LOVE it!  It really is a great flat iron for such a wonderfully low price.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I Bought this straightener because it was inexpensive so i was kinda worried about the quality, but it works great. I love it! It works just as well if not better than my sisters chi!!</li>
    <li> I recieved super fast and let me tell you something,  I had that Chi flat iron and paid over $100 and returned it because it took forever to straighten my hair.  This gets hot fast and no effort to straighten my hair. It starts at 370 degrees and goes over 400 degrees.  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> My old straightener broke so I purchased this one quickly. I have been really happy with it. it heats up quickly and stays hot. I have semi thick curly hair and it works great. I would buy this again - especially for how cheap it was. Shipping was also incredibly fast.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up fast and straightens my hair in little time!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome value for the money!</li>
    <li> Works great! Got it within two days</li>
    <li> As the title of my review indicates, the flat iron comes at a very low price. However, the quality, size, color, and the effectiveness of the iron does not do the price justice. I mean I have used CHI, T3, Revlon, Conair, and Gold N Hot before. CHI and T3 ofcourse worked very good. Revlon, Conair, and Gold N Hot just didn&#x27;t work that well for my overly poofy straight/wavy hair. It didn&#x27;t make it shiny and silky. This iron is almost as good if not just as good as the CHI and T3 I&#x27;ve used before. Really nice...</li>
    <li> I love it really heats up!</li>
    <li> Works better than the more expensive brands...only complaint is it smells a bit of stale steam.  Otherwise, wonderful! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> love this. works great on my hair</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I plugged it in, turned it on and a few seconds later put my hand over it to see if it was heating up and almost burnt my hand that&#x27;s how fast it heats up!! I&#x27;ve used the same flat iron for years and kept getting my hair caught in between the plates somehow but with this iron i can straighten as fast as a i please without worries of ripping my hair out! Amazing iron for the price and i would absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great price and heats instantly. I use the lowest setting and it&#x27;s perfect. My hair has not been this straight in years!!!!</li>
    <li> Reasonable price and good value for someone who only needs a straightener for touch ups. It is the first one of these I ever used and it does the job when the hair just needs a bit of straightening. Cannot comment on individuals who need to straighten really curly hair. L</li>
    <li> The Remington S5500 not only works on DV, but is a 5 star-product for me and cost less than $20!     No frizz. Could pull off a salon sheen look with the some hair serum. Not heavy to hold and use. Takes about 10 minutes to straighten and add waves to medium length hair curly frizzy South Asian Indian hair. Hair stays straight for two days after.    Remington has once again stayed true to their reputation of not compromising on quality within the affordable range.    Happy hair styling!</li>
    <li> This flat iron gets too hot. (whoa - there is such a thing?)  My hair dresser said you shouldn&#x27;t go over 200 degrees or it will damage your hair....and this one doesn&#x27;t go below 310.  I wish it went lower.  I&#x27;ve used a cheap flat iron for years that didn&#x27;t get too hot and still worked on my thick hispanic hair, until it junked out on me.  This was cheap so I bought it.  It works well...I wish I had the option of using a lower temperature.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful for the price! It straightens just like my $200 straightener did, the only complaint is the auto shut off is more like 30 mins than 60. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m overall happy with this hair straigtner but it only lasts part of the day for me. I have naturally wavy hair that curls up more and more as time goes by.   When going over it  with the flat iron that is usually enough to keep it straight for the rest of the day but it doesnt always last the whole day. There&#x27;s also a sliding lock to keep the straightener closed when not in use - which would be great when storing it so that it is more compact and less likely to break.</li>
    <li> My hair type is thick (a lot of hair) Wavy 2A but is horrible to style. The smell was bad at first but went away. I loved how it straightened my hair (on the lowest setting) and even after shampooing it, it still kept a straightness to it. For hard to manage hair I originally LOVED this because it cut my styling time down significantly. BUT, after time I could no longer wear it wavy because I would straighten it daily. I did not read the advice about getting a heat protectant and now I have fried not fully straight somewhat wavy hair (not cute at all!).  I have not found a good heat protectant so have stopped using this until I find something to protect my hair (which has always been very pretty so I am now annoyed that I have fried hair). If you have fine hair FIND A HEAT PROTECTANT.  If you always want straight hair then it&#x27;s a good hair straightener.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Fast and powerful. I didn&#x27;t like the plastic smell when I opened it and it still here but It will fade away , at least I hope so.</li>
    <li> Works really well gets hit quick</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. My hair is curly and frizzy as well as extremely thick and this flat iron was better than the last one that was actually expensive! It also gets those little corners that tend to get frizzy fast. Definitely recommend I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I have only found 1 other straightener that will work on my thick, wavy hair and it was very expensive.  I bought this just to see if it would work!  So glad I did!!!</li>
    <li> let me start of by saying, i purchased this product because i have the remington heat defense blow dryer in purple also. this flat iron is the real deal. it heats up quick and it really straightens your hair. i have a short hair cut and it getts to the roots. takes the frizz out in 1 pull. i love this flat iron its the best one i&#x27;ve had. others i have own, dont do the job quickly. i wud have to go over my hair a few times to get it straight. so yes i wud reccommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it! Affordable and easy to use. Heats up fast. I use the lowest heat setting at 310 F.</li>
    <li> Amazingly, the product works perfectly, I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> its great! i ordered 3 in the past and now order 2 more! so chip and amazing&lt;br /&gt;dont miss this deal</li>
    <li> I own a previous one that I had for years it was finally time for a new love it !</li>
    <li> For 15 bucks this thing is AMAZING! Heats up fast and straightens really well! One down side its not smooth like ceramic when you&#x27;re curling besides that it&#x27;s AWESOME! :)</li>
    <li> I got this around Christmas time, loved it! Unfortantly left at a hotel on a trip. The dials are very nice, to be able to choose your heat setting. I used my Aunts babyliss for about a week, and I LOVED it. I&#x27;ll be getting one in a few months but this one is great for the mean time!! It is a nice sleek design, and the purple is nice. It goes up to 410 I think, and doesn&#x27;t take long at all to heat up. I have thick, somewhat wavy hair. It will clump together looking very stringy if I don&#x27;t straighten it. I don&#x27;t have insane curls or frizz/poof, so I don&#x27;t know what the result would be if you used this straightener- but if you have it at the right heat setting I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t let you down! The price is great. Deff. not one of those \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;... great great price. I do have bad split ends from my damaged hair, it doesn&#x27;t cause any.. but make sure to use a heat protectant, no matter how healthy your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helped your decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STARS: I only gave 4 stars because yes it is a great flat iron, but doesn&#x27;t really compare to the Babyliss I&#x27;m just in love with! But I would totally recommened it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The quick heating to 370 degrees make this tool so easy to use.  I have another that heats up to 300 and the 70 additional degrees makes big difference.</li>
    <li> Love the straighter!&lt;br /&gt;I have it now for a year and it&#x27;s still working... :)</li>
    <li> My first stab at using a ceramic hair straightener. This product is just great! My hair is shiny and has body after using this!</li>
    <li> I had my old cheap iron for about 4 years before it completley died on me. I looked for a nice, inexpensive replacement and this one fit the bill. It definitely heats up about 10x faster than my old one, and I love how slim it is so I can get up to the roots of my hair without it making an ugly crease or getting caught in my hair.     I&#x27;m sure tt is not the best on the market, but if I wanted some super advanced ion technology I would have paid $100 for an iron. This one does the trick and I am very happy with the price!</li>
    <li> Haha okay I fell in love with this straightner after one use! I have really really thick and long frizzy wavy hair and wow it straightnes soo fast and works amazing! I could throw my hair up and everything and i dont even get that ponytail crease or anything! It straightnes amazing! and it heats up sooo fast! I definately recommend from a 20 nminute process for doing my hair with another straightner..I take 8 minutes to do allll of my hair with THIS straightner! its my favorite straightner ever! I recomend 110%! (:</li>
    <li> Hair straightener is anything but anti-static. It makes your hair looks absolutely terrible. It is made out of a very cheap plastic. Every time you turn it on it smells like it is burning, and then gives your hair that smell as well.</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up really quickly. I love the digital control and how I can lock the temperature. It has a long sleek design that allows you to get closer to the root of your hair. Would reccommend!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener. It has amazing heat control, I have very fine frizzy hair and it lets me set the exact temp so I dont do any damage and my hair comes out sleek and shiny.</li>
    <li> Kept my frizzy hair straight and smooth all day!</li>
    <li> i was very apprehensive about this iron. i had been using a thick, big straightener. i didn&#x27;t think something so tiny could do a good job. i was definitely wrong. this sleek little thing lets you maneuver quickly. lets you get close to your scalp, and has a smooth glide compared to a rough pull that my old straightener had. i take about half the time straightening my hair with this little guy...</li>
    <li> The 2011 version of this product is NOT DUAL VOLTAGE! We ordered this based on the statement on the manufacturer&#x27;s site (and in the PDF user&#x27;s manual on the manufacturer&#x27;s site) that it is dual voltage, but the version we received is only 120V.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick and curly hair.  It takes hair stylists more than half an hour to straighten my hair, so you can imagine how long it takes me!  I used this straightener and was done in less than an hour!  There was no frizz and no crinkles anywhere.</li>
    <li> its purple its remington my favorite brand and its on sale lol my hair comes out nice and striaght.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price just as good as a chi.</li>
    <li> excellent hair straightener and is very safe to use for adults.</li>
    <li> It delivered really quickly, 2 days after I placed my order with Standard shipping. Anyways, it works great so far and is definately worth buying. I am Asian and I have combo hair, so I have both thick,course and super fine hair. On both so far, it works great.  I used to own the Bed Head Ionic straightener but the buttons were on right on the grip and it was a hassle using it. Compared to the other straighteners, here are the pros and cons:  Pros:  ~Heats up pretty quickly  ~SWIVEL CORD! you don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord getting tangled when you use it  ~Discreet LOCK button. Some pple complained about it not having a lock button, it does. it&#x27;s at the hinge so it&#x27;s not exposed.  ~3 buttons instead of a whole dial pad of them. Screen lights up as well  ~Little smell. The others I&#x27;ve used always had a bit of smoke and burnt smell on the first use.  Cons:  ~Design is somewhat bordering ugly. The pictures looks nice and shiny, but actually it has a very matte finish. It is very simple and plain. Personally I don&#x27;t care about it but some people do.  ~Limited choice of temperatures. The temperature settings are set, you can&#x27;t use anything in between the set temperature values they have (310,330,350,370,390,410 degrees)  ~Only goes up to only 410 degrees. The Bed Head Ionic one i had could go a bit higher.  Over all, I definately recommend this to anyone who wants to try it. It is seriously better than other straighteners if you&#x27;re on a tight budget. It&#x27;s worth being a straightener under 20$</li>
    <li> This product is with me for more than a year, Works very well !! Love this sleek straightener!!</li>
    <li> Heats up very quickly, but after use remains hot for a while. Maybe 30-40 minutes or so. Be careful. For the price, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This flat is the best flat iron there is. It&#x27;s beautiful, it&#x27;s ceramic and it doesn&#x27;t break hair like other flat irons</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener 2 weeks ago to use while I sent in my Chi straightener for the THIRD time.  I was looking for something very inexpensive to use for the 3-4 weeks my Chi would be gone and thought this product looked good after reading some reviews.  After it arrived and I tried it out I was amazed about how great it is.  I have bought several cheap hair straighteners in the past to bring on vacation and such but I have always been disappointed with how awful they are.  THIS STRAIGHTENER IS AMAZING.  I cant say that enough.  I actually don&#x27;t even care about sending my Chi in to be fixed anymore I am so happy with this one.  If you are looking for a great inexpensive straightener this is perfect!  It heats up quick, has multiple levels of heat (my Chi DOES NOT) and it is lightweight.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> My lady&#x27;s old S5500 finally gave out after years of use, so I secretly ordered up a replacement using Prime shipping -- surprise 2 days later, happy gal!  Excellent value, simple design, reliable.  She has super curly hair from her African heritage and this iron works magic when she wants to go straight! :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this to quickly replace my Sedu after it quit. I was very surprised with this flat iron and very impressed with how it worked. I have very thick coarse hair and this flat iron worked just as good as the expensive ones at a fraction of the price. It gets very hot and does a wonderful job at getting my hair straight and frizz free. I recommend any one purchase this flat iron and give it a try before buying the expensive ones. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, it&#x27;s works great on my hair. Does not leave my hair frizzy, it&#x27;s leaves my hair nice and straight.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. I have fairly short hair, and it catches all the layers. It only takes a couple of minutes, and I&#x27;m done! It also heats up very quickly, which is great when I&#x27;m rushing in the morning.</li>
    <li> These got me looking flawless😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍</li>
    <li> I am a black female and trying to find a flat iron that is good on my thick hair is very difficult, so I was a little skeptical about trying this product. After using it, I was very satisfied with the result. It normally takes me a few times to go over a section of my hair to get it straight but with this product I only had to go over it once.  My results are comparable to the the results of the Chi that I had previously owned but without the expensive price and its digital! The shipping was great, it got here the next day even though I did 2-day shipping.  Also, it does not come with a bag like some reviews previously stated.  All in all, I will definitely be purchasing this again!!  :)</li>
    <li> It was cheap and it works. For the price that&#x27;s all I can ask for. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Gets to full tempeture in less than two minutes burns hair easily but very good product shipped on time like it was said to be and extra speedy shiping with prime .</li>
    <li> Loved it I bought 3 of them</li>
    <li> I needed an inexpensive back up straightener for my overnight work bag in case I get snowed in.  I tried it out the other morning and it was just okay.  Since I&#x27;m not using it for daily use I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
    <li> Gets hot fast, straightens well but it does get give your hair that stupid line right where you first apply it if you don&#x27;t do it correctly. All in all, for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Love this, heats quickly and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener!! I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for about 8 years now so I&#x27;ve owned a few different straighteners over the years. This one was the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever purchased so that was a huge plus. I also love how quickly it heats up. I set mine to 390 degrees and it only took 30 seconds to finish heating. It&#x27;s great how it lets you know when it reaches the heat you want it to so you don&#x27;t have to keep checking every few minutes if it&#x27;s the right heat. So now to the actual straightening... I have really thick hair (my mom has thick wavy hair and my dad has thick curly hair so I was born with a nightmare combination of the two). It&#x27;s also pretty long but it only took me about 5 minutes to straighten it properly. I really only had to go over each section once which was nice and saved alot of time. I&#x27;m still in the honeymoon stage of owning this product so if there are any problems I haven&#x27;t encountered them yet. Keep in mind that it will smell funny the first few times you use it. That&#x27;s just the film burning off the ceramic plates and it won&#x27;t last past the second or third use. I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends!</li>
    <li> warms up quickly. easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really love this!!!  It heats up quickly and is very hot.  I can&#x27;t even use it at it&#x27;s hottest setting.  Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> This is great for thick hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase. I have naturally wavy hair that curls up at the ends but going over it once with the flat iron is enough to keep it straight for the rest of the day. There&#x27;s also a sliding lock to keep the straightener closed when not in use - which would be great when you travel. No regrets buying it!</li>
    <li> Hey man, it&#x27;s so cheap and it straightens your hair. Perfecto! Just please be kind to your hair and buy some heat protection spray.</li>
    <li> does the job . this is my first straightening of this size. i have a below chin length angled bob and thick asian hair. this does the job quickly. it&#x27;s not fancy, but it&#x27;s all i need..</li>
    <li> i love it! straightener is inexpensive, quick to heat up and fast to straighten my curly hair.  note: i have fine,curly hair and I use a hotter setting to avoid going over areas multiple times - I can&#x27;t vouch for how this would work on thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I got this in kind of a rush and just wanted to try it - one of those purchases where I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much, and I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros~&lt;br /&gt;This straightener gets the job done quite nicely - I have thick wavy medium length hair that&#x27;s very prone to frizzing, and just setting it to 370 (the default temp) got my hair straight in no more than one pass, gliding over perfectly. I was done and over with the straightening process in less than 15 minutes, and that&#x27;s just beautiful on my book! It also left it feeling incredibly soft and so far I haven&#x27;t seen a hair stick out - anti static working perfectly. It also has a nice little feature of auto turn off after an hour, which is amazing for a scatterbrain like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons~&lt;br /&gt;It does smell. Boy if it does! As soon as you plug it in and turn it on it starts to give off this weird burning smell. at first I was worried the cable was broken or something, but after checking it thoroughly I just decided it was the default smell and I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it. It&#x27;s not that bad once you get used to it, and it&#x27;s really no deterrent for me. It also heats up incredibly fast! While this could be point in favor, you really need to pay attention to the temperature you choose and where you lay it on as you wait, even if it&#x27;s for a brief moment - it heat up in matter of seconds (10-15) and I almost melted off my phone case. Oops! Lastly, the chord isn&#x27;t too long. It&#x27;s probably around 6 feet which isn&#x27;t too bad, but for someone who likes twirling around the room while doing their hair, it just fell short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it&#x27;s a terrific buy for the price (less than $20?!) and I am very happy with it. You really can&#x27;t compare it to a super high end brand, but I do recommend it for anyone looking for a handy straightener (curls nicely too!) for not very much.</li>
    <li> I had one just like this before and finally wore it out after years. I bought another brand that was more expensive thinking I would get a better product. WRONG!! I ordered another one of these right away. It works great.</li>
    <li> it gets super super hot in less than a minute i dont know if that is ok, im still using it with the less heat because i dont want to damage my hear, it works great, it says 2 years warranty lets see if thats true (i hope) thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> This iron was so easy to use. I didn&#x27;t expect it so be as good as it is because of the price. Its all very easy to do soft curls on the tips because of the shape of the iron. I literally have done my hair and it look good the next day or two with this iron. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> i love this flat iron it really works... all i did was wash my hair and let it dry by it self (no blower )and then i used the flat iron and my hair got so straight ...</li>
    <li> My own thinning white chevelure does not provide the ideal test-bed for this new product. However my journalist daughter Lucy Bryson has beautiful golden tresses, and she has kindly agreed to do the testing and let us know. It sounds pretty good to me, but Here&#x27;s Lucy (between quote marks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;These straighteners are a fantastic product for the price. Slim and compact, they heat up extremely quickly, making them a good buy for anyone who, like me, tends to do everything in a bit of a last-minute rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straighteners have quite a few nifty features, not least of which is the fact that you can control the heat setting very easily.  There is a digital temperature display, and you can boost or reduce the heat depending on your preferences. It&#x27;s advisable to use a hair protection product even at the lower temperatures, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another handy extra is the heat-proof pouch which comes with the straighteners, so you can store them straight away without worrying about burning or melting any surfaces or bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one gripe is that the lock and unlock feature on the straighteners is a little fiddly to use at first, but I did get used to it after a few days&#x27; use.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds all right to me.</li>
    <li> I had used a $75 Chi straightner i bought from Amazon before I bought this Remington straightner. My Chi had died on me after almost 4 years of use and I was ready to buy another Chi. But due to my financial crunch i looked for cheaper irons with good results. After reading the reviews for this straighter i decided to go for it and just buy it and hope for the best. I would say i&#x27;m very pleased so far with the product. My hair is longish, medium thick and has a natural wave to it but the straighter works really well at doing its job. It&#x27;s light weight and slim which is perfect for traveling. I&#x27;ve never owned a digital iron but so far I like controlling what temp to fry my hair. If i blow dried my hair before i can lower the temp-if i let it dry naturally i can up the ante to 410. It is possible to curl your hair with this iron-I&#x27;m just not very good at it. I don&#x27;t know if this straightner will last as long as my Chi but for the price i paid and the results i&#x27;m getting i wouldn&#x27;t mind if it lasted only a year or two. Besides i&#x27;d just buy another one at this price! I&#x27;m quite content!</li>
    <li> Awesome ceramic flat iron. Digital temperature that begins at 370 and heats up rapidly. The auto shut off after 60 seconds is very useful for me because mornings are often hectic and I always bolt out the door praying I unplugged or at least turned off my flat iron. The lock feature is also very handy because you can easily wrap the cord around it and throw it in your bag. Its obvious I&#x27;m in love, I&#x27;m hoping Remington and I can last a lifetime or at least a year! Lol</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much for a flat iron as I don&#x27;t regularly use one for my hair. I bought it because this was one of the least expensive on Amazon and I&#x27;ve had good experiences with the Remington brand.  Overall, this is a great value. The flat iron is slim and light; good for traveling. I prefer the digital display and the ability to control the temperature settings, and it heats up quickly. I have normal/thick hair and use it on humid days. This flat iron straightens my hair quickly - and just as well as the costly ones!</li>
    <li> Best Straightener ever!!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift I made to my girlfriend, she is so happy with it, she says it has a great quality and performance and it´s easily to use, likes the desing and control options. I can say that the material seems very durable and reliable. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have 3 teen girls that go thru Hair straiteners like crazy. Had the chi and other high end ones. But dont seem to last. This was a great little straitenter for a fantastic price. The girls LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straighter!!! I have EXTREMELY curly hair, my niece calls me a troll because my hair looks that CRAZY! I straighten my hair everyday and I thought I was killing my hair because it just didn&#x27;t feel good, but with this straightener it improved the way my hair feels and looks!! BUY it!! For $16 you really can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of the price, but it&#x27;s awesome.  i have thick hair too and it worked great.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I had owned a Remington wet to dry straighter and honestly hated it. I rarely straighten my hair, but when I do I want it to be straight. I have relaxed hair and with heat protection serum and not a lot of heat I&#x27;m talking 330 to 350 (This straighter goes to 410 degrees) I can get great results. My friend, who has a chi, has been urging me towards one as well, but I just can justify spending so much on a hair tool, because I own so many hair tools already. If you want a straighter that will give you great results for a smaller price, buy this one. You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> It is so light and with different temperature levels, so you can put it to the temperature that&#x27;s right for you and you wont burn your hair</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for this price. I updated my iron when I got a gift card and wanted something efficient yet affordable. This hits the spot ! Its light, smooth, and you can easily regulate the temperature. Highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> my hair is straight but sometime could be a bit messy, I thought i want to have a straightener and bought this. It&#x27;s kind of easy to use and instead of using it to straighten, I use it most of the time to curl my hair and it&#x27;s pretty easy and nice to use. I like the curls done using this. It is awesome to have this as a straightener and curler. Most valued for money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product it heats up super fast and you only have to pass the iron once no need for multiple times to get it super straight! I highly recommend this one. Good price and I like the color!</li>
    <li> I burn myself alot more with this hair straightner than my previous one. Seems to burn my hair easier also. There is also an odor when I put it on.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and frizzy and thick! This straightener gets really hot and straightens excellently! I love it, it is inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Nice,love it,the best I have bought .thank you</li>
    <li> i was expecting great and that&#x27;s exactly what i received, it works great,and i absolutely love this flat iron .!!!!</li>
    <li> I already own a Bio Ionic One Pass 1.5&amp;#34; flat iron and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results I get from using it. The reason I still purchased this hair straightener is to work as a substitute flat iron when I&#x27;m traveling, as it would cause me major stress to travel with the Bio Ionic incase it gets lost in baggage handling or something worse! Needless to say, this straightener had to stand up to some very high standards since I&#x27;m used to the results of the One Pass which is truly a man made miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the Remington S5500 looks good and heats up fast. The digital controls are easy to use and basic which is what&#x27;s required anyway right! I did find that there was slight pulling when I straighten my hair, but it was minimal and didn&#x27;t affect the results either. I did a side by side comparison of this flat iron and the Bio Ionic on either sides of a center parted hair style, and the results were very similar! I needed an extra pass with this straightener but that&#x27;s a small price to pay- ofcourse it will take me a little longer than the usual 15 minutes it normally takes me to get my mid back length hair straight. (I have thick, long hair but have perfected the art of getting it straight quickly). A good heat protectant is definitely very important to use with this straightener because of the pulling, but otherwise its a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent choice for a hair straightener. It heats up fast &amp; performs as advertised. I can recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was damage!! So I return it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Does the job. Takes a long time to heat up and turns itself off with the slightest jolt of even setting it down. Not impressive</li>
    <li> I bought this last week because my hot tools straightener broke. I was so sad because I thought that my hot tools was the best kind out there and it was so pricey so I knew I would never be able to replace it. So I was looking on here and I found this one and I liked the price so I looked at the reviews and everyone was talking about how good it was so I thought I would give it a try, I LOVE IT. I like it soooo much better then I did my hot tools, which did not even straighten my hair as well as this does. It makes my hair ro straight and it stays that way throughout the day. I will continue to buy this straightener throughout time because this one is by far the best one I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Remington makes great products</li>
    <li> excellent. 100 % recommended . equal to that offered .</li>
    <li> The cheap price would usually signal a very low quality item, however; this straightener is great even if it were $50 instead of $20.  Heats veryyy quickly and straightens very well.  I don&#x27;t have very curly hair so I cannot judge for those hair types but it is perfect for me.  It is cute and I really like the \\&quot;lock\\&quot; option to keep it together, it makes burning myself harder to do which is always a good thing.</li>
    <li> Needed something that is dual voltage for traveling. Cheapest option I could find that is a full size straightener. Works pretty well for being less than $20!</li>
    <li> This product works very well. It is a great little straightener for the price. I would deffinitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love it. It&#x27;s great for curling and flat ironing. The temperatures can get really hot but you can also control the temperature. I would recommend this product to other people.</li>
    <li> this straightener really gets the job done well and fast i love how it heats up so fast and after i finished ironing my hair it leaves it so shine</li>
    <li> I have been using this straightener for a few months now and I love it.  It was a great price and does a great job.  I have other, more expensive straighteners and find this one to be as good as any of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been borrowning my daughter&#x27;s straightener for past few months, and decided I wanted a straightener for myself, but was not willing the pay what my daughter spent on hers! So, I ordered this one as it had good ratings and was reasonable priced and it works as good as the more pricey one my daughter has. My only minor complaint is sometimes the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; button sometimes slides up accidentally so you have to move it back in place so the straightener opens (minor problem!)</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener i have had. It heats up really quick and it last forever I&#x27;ve had mine for about 4 years i think and it still works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I can only hope that the one I got was defective but I think overall the model itself is just way below normal standards. I have very thin, almost-straight hair that just needs a sleek smoothing over - this straightner couldn&#x27;t even do that! The outside of it became wayyy too hot so had to hold it awkwardly and I could only put it down on a pot trivet! Also made a terrible burning smell. I recommend avoiding this product!</li>
    <li> I have had a Chi for 5 or 6 years and it finally crapped out on me so I needed to replace it fast and cheap. I read the reviews on this one and decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did. I have very thin, fine hair and so the Chi was too hot for me but did a great job of straightening my hair. This iron straightens my hair just a well but without frying it because of the heat settings. I can put the iron on the lowest temperature of 310 and it does the job without damaging my hair. Also, this iron doesnt cause my hair to get all crazy with static like the Chi did and anyone with thin fine hair knows how easy it is to get static in it. Overall, this is an amazing product for the price!</li>
    <li> Worked okay for the first month and then started to deteriorate. The buttons got jammed very quickly which makes it a task to turn on/off or adjust heat. Recently it started smelling like burnt rubber every time I turn it on and it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair very well anymore. Next time I&#x27;m going to spend a little more money on something of better quality.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener due to the fact that it heats up real fast and I have really thick hair and it does a really good job. I used to have another one and it took me sixty minutes now it only takes me around 40. Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a guy (straight, not that it matters; just sayin) and have somewhat experience with straighteners before this purchase. One of the plates moves, the other does not. They don&#x27;t meet perfectly with a very light squeeze. Is this a problem?? Well, as long as you aren&#x27;t 70 years old, and decrepit with arthritis, you should be fine.. just squeeze a little harder?! Heck, there is even little places at the end if you look close that don&#x27;t get very hot, you can pinch those together too (be careful at high heat setting though!). I understand you ladies have MUCH more hair than I do so it might hurt your hand after a while doing your whole head. BUT, THIS STRAIGHTENER IS $17 PEOPLE! You expect it to be like the BaByliss Pro Nano (which is literally $100.00 more) for $17?!? This is meant for someone who doesn&#x27;t make a living off of the way your hair looks.. If you want a VERY nice one, spend the money for it.. Don&#x27;t get me wrong this works very well indeed. I only used the lowest setting and mixed a bit of pomade in my hair to style it and I LOVE IT. My hair just needs to grow more haha. If you want a straightener AND be able to afford to feed yourself and still be happy with the results, get this. If you want something that pinches perfect, goes wet to dry, wider plates; get a more expensive one? It gets hot and makes your hair straight, isn&#x27;t that what we all wanted?? Not gonna lie, I kinda like the color too, it grew on me lol. Oh, and yes it made a plastic smell when I first used it but I didn&#x27;t smell it after that first few minutes. I can&#x27;t comment on how long it will last, but I imagine as long as you don&#x27;t abuse it; it&#x27;ll last AT LEAST a year. Pretty sure everything you can buy in America has at least a 1 or 2 year warranty if its not snapped in half or the cord is cut. Don&#x27;t be dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t write reviews bringing down a product that hasn&#x27;t claimed to be in the rankings of the products &amp;#60; $100 more.. It&#x27;s like me doing a review on a BMW M3 and a HondaCivic saying the Civic wasn&#x27;t close in certain areas. -smacks forehead, duh!- Just because you wanted to save $20-30 bucks and didn&#x27;t like the cheaper version you ended up getting, it&#x27;s not the products fault; don&#x27;t get it one star jeeze. I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s perfect, but very nice. I would like the tips of the purple plastic to be half an inch longer for you females to have more room to pinch and hold the ends while you straighten your hair.</li>
    <li> Although there is a strange metallic smell that comes from the iron, it gets super hot and makes my hair pin straight in no time.</li>
    <li> Compact and very easy to use, gets the job done, try it out.  I like it a lot glad I bought it</li>
    <li> Not top quality but works well</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for easily straightened hair. Its a well made, and easily used product, especially for under $30! The only negative is if you have fine hair the heat doesn&#x27;t go lower than 310 degrees, which could really fry those with the whispy hair.</li>
    <li> After getting my hair chopped to a short pixie cut, I had a hard time getting my smooth with my old, made for long hair tools. Along with the Ceramic Ionic Round Thermal Hair Brush 3/4\\&quot; CI-20 by Olivia Garden and a hairdryer, this straightener, perfect for clamping onto even the shorter parts of my cut, gets my hair super smooth and I can even use it for a flipped out styles if I like. It warms up super quick and have several different heat settings. The price is right also - works as well as any pricier straightener would.</li>
    <li> Good price. Heats up very quickly and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it. I don&#x27;t have any problems with it so far. I&#x27;m not one to spend a lot of money on straighteners, but this is by far the best cheapo one I have tried so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener about a year ago from Walmart because my hot comb broke and I was desperate for something to straighten my hair at 10 at night. I made this purchase based off the reviews. In the past I have had somewhat bad results from straighteners and really didn&#x27;t want to use one but this was spectacular. It takes minimum time to warm up and it makes my hair look shiny, depending on what type of heat protection I use. For beginners this is the place to start. I am now stepping up a bit to HSI 1\\&quot; CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free 5 ml bottle of Argain Oil Leave In Hair Treatment because it would be better for my hair type, which is semi coarse African American hair, non relaxed. Purchase, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Okay straightener but has a nasty smell when used</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on this! It heats up super fast, and straightens really well. Love it!</li>
    <li> i love em but after two years its a rap...i got these in the yr of 2013 its 2015 they jus broke they just stop comming on u get wat u pay for thats all</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron for curling my hair and now I use it for both straightening and curling. I have thick wavy/curly hair and find that this flat iron takes the same amount of time or less than my last flat iron. I previously had a Chi and T3 Micro straighteners that both died. This one has proven to be just as good and it gets HOT so be sure to use a heat protecter spray with it. You also can&#x27;t beat the price! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite straightener, and I&#x27;ve tried many. I have constantly dyed, naturally curly hair, so it&#x27;s frizzy and poofy if I don&#x27;t do something, and this straightener helps tremendously. I&#x27;ve had it for over two years, and never once have I had an issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it set at 310°- that straightens most of my hair in one go and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair nearly as much as if I set it to 370°. My only complaint would be that when it&#x27;s on, it sometimes smells funny, but that may be residual oil and such from hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington S5500 last month.  The control switch to lower the heat stopped working first and then yesterday the on/off switch stopped working.  I am returning it today.  (Amazon was great about this!) I will not be buying a Remington product again.</li>
    <li> Ive bought a $200 flat iron but it does not compare to the quality of the Remmington. I highly recommend and it is very inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I am going on a trip to Germany and wanted to buy a dual voltage hair straightener that I could bring with me that would work in Europe so that I would not have to bring my expensive hair straightener and risk it getting ruined with a voltage converter.  The ONLY reason why I decided to purchase this straightener was because the product details said it was dual voltage.  However, after receiving and opening, the product states that it is 120V and therefore NOT dual voltage.  This was a complete waste of $30 (I also paid for 2 day shipping) as I cannot return since in order to open the package to find out it was not dual voltage, the original packaging was destroyed (it was sealed plastic, not a box). As it turns out, the Remington S9951 is dual voltage which I went out and bought at Target.  So if you are looking for dual voltage DO NOT buy this product.  Despite what the product description says, IT IS NOT DUAL VOLTAGE.</li>
    <li> I just received the straightener this week and have been for than pleased with it.  I love that it has various temperature settings.  I have thick, naturally curly hair and it does the trick to get my hair extra smooth.  The price is just another advantage!</li>
    <li> For the price, I am impressed! I bought this thinking that I would rather get this than buying a Chi, because if I broke it, it wouldn&#x27;t be such a loss. (I tend to brake things a bit to easly haha) This was super nice for the price (haha-rhyme lol) It has a nice heat level screen...using degrees. heats up fast..all around decent. the only problem is that the lock on it isn&#x27;t super secure, but some straightener don&#x27;t even have a lock on them so it is no biggy for me. Hope this helps! happy shopping(:</li>
    <li> Very good item.  Works well.</li>
    <li> My daughter needed to replace her old cheap straightener. This one is reasonably priced and seems to work well. Received quickly.</li>
    <li> i totally enjoy this flat iron. i glides on your hair. it works very well. it leaves your hair glossy and silky.</li>
    <li> Just recieved mine the other day and I was skeptical after reading bad reviews - but I think it&#x27;s deff worth the money. It&#x27;s made a drastic and totally SEXY change in my hair -- I mean my hair is already a lot nicer once I have switched to this straightener. It makes my hair soft, together, not frizzy, and it stays straight all night with no issue. My old straightener my hair would get frizzy and I would have to keep straightening later on.&lt;br /&gt;No need with this one. It&#x27;s awesome! Try it out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightener daily for about 6 months now. I had considered spending much more on a CHI straightener, but I&#x27;m glad I went with this one. So far it has worked perfectly and heats up extremely fast. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to two other people who purchased it and they are just as happy with it. You really can&#x27;t beat the price. My only complaint is that to turn in on/off you have to click a small power button. Sometimes I think I&#x27;ve turned it of when it&#x27;s actually still on (which takes a lot of power). I usually end up just unplugging it to be sure.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple wks back but just decided to use it. I av short-cut, relaxed hair and I normally use flat irons to curl (not straighten) my hair. BEST FLAT IRON I&#x27;VE EVER USED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s super e-z 2 use because it&#x27;s sleek n very lightweight, so your hand doesn&#x27;t get tired while using it. It heats up very quickly. I use it @ its lowest setting which is 310 degrees and it does an amazing job. My curls turn out beautifully w/ passing it just once over each section. I think I&#x27;m gonna order another 1 as back-up because every time I like a product it gets discontinued. Don&#x27;t hesitate, just buy it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This straightener works so well. It heats up quickly and gets very hot. I normally have to blow dry my hair before straightening it, because it is very curly and poofy. I did not have to do that with this straightener. It got my hair more straight than anything I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;m considering buying a backup in case anything ever happens to this one because it is so much better than the other three I&#x27;ve had in the past (different brands).</li>
    <li> I love it! It heats up fast and works brilliantly! I would suggest this to anyone looking for a straightener.</li>
    <li> I had wanted a chi, but after I saw that people compared this straightener to chi straighteners I thought I&#x27;d try it. So glad I did! Never had a super expensive straightener, but this straightens like I imagined an expensive one would! I love it! I use chi iron guard on my hair first which I think is also a big help and helps to keep my hair straight throughout the day. My hair even made it through the fog! I highly recommend this! Why spend the big bucks when you can get something just as good for a heck of a lot cheaper! By the way I have fine wavy hair that tends to frizz.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this straightener! I use it to curl my hair and its perfect-- perfect curls every time. I&#x27;ve tried straightening after I messed up my curls and it straightened pretty well too! It heats up fast and gets pretty hot. great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! It heats up very quickly and works perfectly on my stubborn hair. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for more than a year and I have to say that this is the best Saranne make iron I&#x27;ve ever bought in my life. I paid about $15 and it&#x27;s still in mint condition after a year of using it day in and day out. For the price that I paid and the length that it has last me so far it has been amazing. I will recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have spent quite a lot more on flat irons without the awesome results I get from my Remington. It heats up fast and can make my hair pin straight (a true accomplishment)! The best part is that my hair remains straight throughout the day even in Houston humidity.</li>
    <li> this product works exactly like the last hair straightener I owned except that it&#x27;s way lighter - that&#x27;s a good thing as my hair is waist-length.</li>
    <li> This does a very good job at straightening hair, but as others have noted, has a very strong and unpleasant chemical odor when it heats up.  This diminishes over time, but 5 months in (with pretty regular use) and it&#x27;s still there for mine.</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a solid item - works great (I&#x27;ve had it for 1 month) for now. Considering low price, I am more than satisfied. I am unsure how (the best rated) other hair straighteners are suppose to work, so I cannot compare it to something higher quality/price. There are always things you can find unsatisfactory about anything - so, considering the price and its functionality, The Remington S5500 digital anti static 1 Inch Hair straightener is great.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it more stars! I have medium length/thick hair. That is mostly straight but gets a wave, poofy &amp; staticy allll the time, especially in winter. I am not a fan of styling products or wasting too much time getting ready. I tested this out today &amp; it worked like a DREAM. Probably spent 1-2 minutes, no products, I didn&#x27;t even have to clip up layers! And I was done! And to think this was HALF the price of another one I was thinking of getting. Proves once again that costing more does not always mean its better quality!</li>
    <li> This straightner is awesome. I&#x27;ve had mine for I think 3 years now, and it still works great ❤️ I think I baught mine at target for like 20$👍&lt;br /&gt;Like in one of the review said, it doesn&#x27;t glide to well, but it will sure straighten that hair👍👍</li>
    <li> straightner works wonderfully. doesn&#x27;t pull hair or anything. my sister and cousin used it and fell in love. they wanted to take it from me but i said &amp;#34;no way, but your own!&amp;#34; in the end i just ordered two more for them.</li>
    <li> Product was just ok.  It did the job. Lite weight.  Something about it.  Just can&#x27;t pin point the problem yet.[[ASIN:B003S516XO Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener]]</li>
    <li> I got this around May 5 2012 and it just stop working today(10/30/2013). So for $14.00 dollars that&#x27;s not bad it got really hot quick and it was easy to curl my hair. So if you need a cheap flat iron that&#x27;ll do the job this is it.</li>
    <li> My sister had done research on hair straighteners and concluded that this one was the best - probably out of hair straighteners under $50.  She purchased it online, and after borrowing hers a few times, I had to get one too.  This one, under $20, is extremely economical and is a great product.  It heats up very quickly and reaches high temperatures.  If you know how to curl hair with a straightener, it&#x27;s good for that too.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing. it surpasses the capabilities of my $40 Conair wet to dry flat iron. it smothes hair flawlessly and it heats up pretty quick too. i wouldnt recommend using it hotter that 300-330 cuz it gets pretty hot. I love it i love it. it has a lock on it to keep it closed when not in use or even to allow it to cool after use. it has a swivel cord which is excellent. it was well worth my $16.77. the packaging i waaay too big though, i had it sent to my skybox and i had to pay extra freight because of the size of the box. so that was no good. but the product itself is excellent.</li>
    <li> Bought this many moons ago i love it love it loveit still got it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> There are better options out there. I lost my pricier Rusk flat iron that I bought ages ago during a move and needed something fast and for under $10 at the time I Bought it, with the overall good reviews, I decided why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a little over six months since I bought it and it&#x27;s time to retire it. The temp setting was twitchy, and towards the end the power button was worthless. Sometimes I could turn it on, sometimes I&#x27;d try a few times pushing it, pushing and holding, muttering at it-- and it may turn on. Half the time I had to unplug it since I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on and, the power button was no longer working consistently.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best straightener I have used.</li>
    <li> Great straightener.. Work good even with thick hair.</li>
    <li> It heats up to 410, my hair is wavy but not thick   When I saighten my hair it leaves it super straight I don&#x27;t think it would work with thick hair because its small.Its good for flippin the ends or adding volume around your crown heats up quick and I order this on Sunday at 2am and got it Monday at 10am really fast</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and a little wavy. So this is what my review is based on. If you have thick curly hair, you would probably be wise to invest in a more expensive straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temperature control&lt;br /&gt;Lock - so it stays closed when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is very long&lt;br /&gt;Price!&lt;br /&gt;The cord into the back of the straightener is curved at a 90 angle and will rotate so that if you set it on the counter the cord will hang straight down and not be in the way. However this doesn&#x27;t work with they way my bathroom is set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this for over 2 months and use it 2-3 times a week. It heats up super quick. 30 seconds or so. And it takes me maybe 2 minutes to straighten my fine wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic casing does not get too hot to touch and it doesn&#x27;t snag or burn my hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you get lines in your hair then you need to learn how to use a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roommate has a CHI flat iron and granted it is better. The plates are smoother and it is heavier and seems like it is just a better products.&lt;br /&gt;However not THAT much better to justify spending $90 - $100 when the Remington does just about as well.&lt;br /&gt;This also makes a great travel straightener as it is cheap, lightweight and rather sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy their first hair straightener.</li>
    <li> To start off, I haven&#x27;t purchased a new hair appliance in about 5 or 6 years before today, nor a straightener specifically in 7 or 8, so I understand that they all have changed in even their basic forms in just the past few years. I have looked at straighteners on and off for the last 2 years or so but I knew I would mostly want one now for my daughter. She is mixed and has very curly, very dry, and VERY frizzy hair, no matter what kind of products I use or what I do to it. (Although, on that note I also tried a new deep conditioning treatment for the first time, Pantene ProV for Curly hair, and that alone made her hair amazingly soft!) I generally go for blow drying with low heat to prevent damage, but doing just enough to keep it from being a tangled poofy mess as when left natural.   Anyway, before even using the new hair treatment I bought, I tested a few pieces before giving her a bath. I was IMMEDIATELY impressed. I couldn&#x27;t believe, in just one QUICK pass (and with little tension put on the hair), how it came out so straight, smooth, SHINY (her hair is never shiny without some kind of oil product applied), and with a great weighted \\&quot;hang\\&quot; if you get what I mean... just the way straight hair hangs differently than curly, with that flippy-ness to it. So, after washing/treating her hair and letting it dry, blow drying a little but just enough to speed up the drying process, I went through her hair in about a half hour. It takes so long with her because she&#x27;s 5 and no 5 year old sits still well at all. So, to me that was about a 100-150% improvement in time. It takes longer to blow dry her hair! And with my old straightener (What I believe to be Conair&#x27;s first steam straightener, a big bulky white one... anyone remember those?) it would take about an hour and it was hardly straight... the plates didn&#x27;t get hot enough anymore.  Anyway, I could go on and on about all the differences between 5-10 year old straighteners and those of today. I am surprised to see theseproducts actually getting BETTER (even among the cheap ones) rather than worse, like many other products. I have no idea how this compares to other similar prices or more expensive products, but if this is considered \\&quot;crap\\&quot; among them then it is still about 1000% better than those just a little older. But as far as inexpensive ones ($30 or less to me) go, after reading reviews before purchase I figured this one had to be at least decent.  I love everything about it! The digital temperature control (other popular ones I see have a dial on the inside of the handle and, though I figured it must still be way better than any of my \\&quot;one temp only\\&quot; appliances I still wanted digital if it was still inexpensive. It&#x27;s so easy to use and very well designed. I don&#x27;t have any issues with accidentally hitting any buttons, so, though I LOVE the fact they thought of a way to lock the temperature selection, I find I don&#x27;t even need it. I see complaints on reviews about the hinge lock... I don&#x27;t see a problem with it personally. I closed the straightener, pushed in the lock, and it doesn&#x27;t come open. I did have to push it in a tiny bit hard (and equally so in opening it again) to make that final click that says it&#x27;s secure, but it wasn&#x27;t anything irrational.   The plates are SO smooth on the hair! I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there but, again, if this is among the worse ones it&#x27;s still great IMHO. I didn&#x27;t have ANY snags in my daughter&#x27;s hair, and compared again to my old straightener I didn&#x27;t have to go as slowly down the hair or apply nearly as much tension to actually get it straight. I never had to run it through a section of hair more than once except for two instances, but both being a fault of my daughter where she moved too much and there was a line in the middle of her hair. One quick swipe through again and all was fixed. Also, despite her usually needing high heat, I achieved BEAUTIFUL results on her hair at the 350* setting on the finer pieces of hair and 370* setting on her coarser and more stubborn pieces, both temps being in the mid range.   I just love this straightener so so much! After experience with my OLD OLD straightener, I wasn&#x27;t planning on using it on myself (I have naturally wavy hair that stays well with very little styling), but I think I might play around with doing my own hair again! It is effective and efficient with minimal damage to hair, AND it is pretty on top of it (just a bonus!). And also MUCH lighter, smaller, and less bulky than older, less effective hair straighteners. Thank you for such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I switched to Remington after my Conair straightener lost its straightening abilities. I have extremely thick hair and this straightener makes my hair pin-straight, and reduces static! It&#x27;s a miracle worker &amp; will buy this straightener again once it gives out, which won&#x27;t seem to happen for a while.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend used to have an Andes straightener, likes this one much better. Heats up quickly, and fewer flyaways. Straightens very well on her medium/fine slightly wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great service!</li>
    <li> I like the features that this has, such as it will store closed, the automatic shutoff timer and the fact that it tells you when it&#x27;s heated. However, the plates are not uniform when shut. If you close them, the side closest to the end will be touching but as it gets closer to the other side (where your hand is) it starts to open slightly. This forces one to squeeze more so that this middle area will be closed tightly over your hair(especially if you have fine hair like I do). If you have ANY hair in the area at the end, it will be be squeezed even more, catching the hair. As you slide the straightener downward, those hairs get pulled. OUCH! This is my only complaint, but it&#x27;s a big one. Since this did get so many positive reviews, I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a quality control problem; I just happened to get a bad one. :(</li>
    <li> I have been using $100 hair straighteners for about 5 years now. I accidentally stepped on my straightener and broke it in half a week before my college graduation which I REALLY wanted to straighten my hair for. I couldn&#x27;t afford to spontaneously spend $100 on a straightener so I bought this one and I am actually very impressed and hope to continue using it for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is not thick but not thin and it&#x27;s pretty straight for the most part, but if I don&#x27;t straighten it, it gets kinks and also waves at the end that I don&#x27;t like. This straightener is perfect for my hair type, and gets the waves out and makes my hair pin straight at the lowest heat. Because the plates are cheaper than the ceramic or gold plates you get on the more expensive straighteners, I can tell that it is being more rough on my hair, but I always make sure to spray my hair with a heat shield and I&#x27;ve found no more significant damage to my hair than I would get before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for someone looking to save money yet get the same outcome from a hair straightener just to get the kinks and waves out of your hair, this straightener is PERFECT! I will never spend more than $100 on a straightener again, in fact with this one, I&#x27;ll never have to spend more than $20! :)</li>
    <li> This is the second Remington S5500.  I purchased my first one over a year ago for a trip abroad (my T3 was not dual voltage and I didn&#x27;t want bad hair in vacation pictures...too old to look like a backpacker.)  It heats up faster and hotter than my $200 straightener. It&#x27;s light and compact- so great for traveling.  It&#x27;s dual voltage in case you are going abroad.  It ended up being my everyday style go-to tool.  Until I left it at home and my mom decided she liked it too and decided to keep it. So I am getting another one since it looks like I am never getting mine back.  Happy Mother&#x27;s day, mom!</li>
    <li> I have only owned one other straightener, and it was a cheapie (Clairon?) from a mass retailer. It probably cost twice as much as this one and didn&#x27;t do anywhere near as good of a job. I was really impressed with this Remington from the very first try. My hair looked as professionally done as it does when I see my stylist and get a straightened blowout. I always thought I didn&#x27;t have the knack for straighteners, but it turns out I didn&#x27;t own the correct one. This product is awesome! Especially when you consider the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used mine with some shine spray from Garnier - not even the straightening spray (though I have that on order), just a regular shine spray. I felt like a movie star all day! Super shiny hair - no frizz. The two products together cost just under $20 and provide A-MAZ-ING results! You won&#x27;t be sorry you tried this. Such a cheap price and so easy to use!</li>
    <li> I love this tool! I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I do, my hair looks so great! I would recommend making sure you put some oil or conditioner in your hair before you hot iron it, helps spare split ends...</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews. It is great bargain. I love that it is narrow enough to use on my bangs. I also love that I can customize the heat settings as I don&#x27;t feel comfortable exposing my hair to very high temperatures. I have thin fine hair, so I can&#x27;t comment on it for thick hair</li>
    <li> I figured I&#x27;d try a cheaper straightener before spending a ton of money on one that might not be much better.  After using it a few times, I&#x27;d say its certainly a great product for its value.  It definitely gets super hot and is very capable of straightening my thick curly hair. However, it kind of feels rough and pulls a bit as I run it though my hair.    Considering I don&#x27;t straighten my hair that often, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and won&#x27;t be buying some super expensive flat iron any time soon, but I&#x27;d be concerned about damaging my hair if I was to use it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I think it may work for others --- just not for me.  Still left my hair frizzy and was too large for me to handle effectively.</li>
    <li> Waste of money stopped working on me and blue light didn&#x27;t even come on on the temperature settings</li>
    <li> I had my old remington straightener for 10 years. It didn&#x27;t break but it was so old that I wanted to get a new one in case it worked better. I of course purchased a remington again and I love this. I love that it is digital and that you can change the temp, my old one just had one setting.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! Since using this straightener, my hair is less frizzy and it takes a lot less time to straighten my naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! it is lovely small and easy for me to take out. I can use it very well to my hair.</li>
    <li> It worked really well for like two weeks and then suddenly, the hair straightener wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all and I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> This straightener does the job, it gets hot in five seconds, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it leaves my hair smooth and shiny, i have mix wavy-straight hair, so i dont really uuuuse it, i mean, i just do some parts so they look better, so i cant comment about how it works with thicker or curlier hair. Im not giving it five stars because it doesnt work well with wet hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my 14 year old daught she loves it .   it use to take her the night before and 2 hours to get the curl and to get her hair how she likes it because of her thik hair .   With this flat iron it takes her 20 mins to get her hair PERFECT this is a realy good flat iron for a good cheap price .</li>
    <li> Works great!  Love the auto shutoff feature.</li>
    <li> **Update: after only ~15 uses, had to throw this away. A part inside was toasted and put off horrible chemical smell/fumes, and iron started to overheat.**  Cheap doesn&#x27;t always equal low quality, but that does seem to be the case here unfortunately.  Pros:  It&#x27;s cheap It heats up fast It straightens your hair The little latch that &amp;#34;closes&amp;#34; the straightener is handy  Cons:  Build quality is sketchy - feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart Not sure if it&#x27;s the heat level or the quality of the metal plates, but this really fries my hair compared to other straighteners The on-off is finicky - you really need to pay attention to the screen to make sure it&#x27;s off, and be sure to unplug it. Temperature reading does not seem accurate  Threw away the original packaging or I&#x27;d be returning it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Heats up quickly, and does what it is supposed to do . Plus, the purple is very cute!</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail yesterday, and honestly I already love it. It heats up very quick, I love the adjustable temperature settings, and it doesnt pull my hair out of my head! It leaves your hair straight and not frizzy, its an amazing cheap straighter.</li>
    <li> Works very good. I like how smoothly it glides with the rounded blades.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest purchase I have made on Amazon thus far. I purchased this item a while ago and it has been working miracles ever since. It great on all textures of hair and leaves the hair smooth and shiny when using the right products. Its easy to operate and safe to use; automatically shut off after a certain period of time. Great price and Great Product!</li>
    <li> Ironing quality is good, but I think the quality of the product itself is a bit low, is made of a plastic that I do not think to withstand a drop, but the product was within expectations and a good price</li>
    <li> I just got this straightener and it takes twice as long to do my hair then my last straightener and I paid just about as much for that one that I did for this on. It doesn&#x27;t really straighten right either. I would save up the money and get something better if you ask me.</li>
    <li> I love this! Great product for a great price! It works on all types of hair, the digital display is perfect and it heats up hot super fast. I never need to use the top heat and I have super thick dark hair. I really love this straightener. the color is great, the way it straightens different hair types is great and the swivel cord is super nice. Definitely worth the price. I got it a couple of months ago and it has been used a lot but still works in perfect condition. Buy it</li>
    <li> heats up really very fast, turns off on its own, hot, ceramic, ive paid big money for name brand this and that but they didnt do the job nearly as well as this straightener did</li>
    <li> I believed the popular myth that you had to spend tons of money on a ceramic iron.  This product proved me wrong.  I am thoroughly satisfied!</li>
    <li> To start off with, my hair type is very thick dark blonde, with ringlets in front with a wide wave in the back, plus outrageous frizz. Humidity is a sworn enemy. To tackle these problems, I turned to flat irons years ago, but didn&#x27;t do the every wash/dry/flat iron routine until just over a year ago. Then I had a Cricket flat iron, a gift from my mother who paid a pretty penny for it, so that did the job. Not the best job in the world, since I still had some frizz and unwanted volume. Maybe it was the iron, maybe it was my technique, who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, just about a month ago, I was doing my hair when I grabbed the iron too close to the plates, burned myself, and dropped the iron and broke the ceramic plates. To replace it, I came on Amazon to check prices and reviews...and found this beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron, for the price, the power, the features, and yes, the color too, is the best iron I&#x27;ve owned. Hands down. I want to give it 4.7 or so stars, but can&#x27;t have partial stars to rate with, so I just gave it five stars overall. to make it easier, here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When it says \\&quot;30 second heat up\\&quot;, it really means only 30 seconds to heat up! When I turn it on, the screen lights up and flashes to indicate it&#x27;s heating before glowing solidly when done. 30 seconds is really all it needs, and I use it at 370 degrees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The plates are very long while only an inch wide. I have no problem with this as I can spread out my sections pretty thinly for the best results. It only takes 2 swipes minimum to the do the job right the first time. The only times I repeat beyond that is to go over the crown of my head and for the ends since they are the hardest to keep straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The temp controls are perfect. As for my old Cricket, I had a hard time fixing the temp the way I liked it since I could barely see the figures on the dial between the plates. The heating was inconsistent as it would need to reheat constantly after two sections of hair. With this iron, no reheating, only steady temp all the way. The temp is displayed on the screen with big numbers for easy viewing with bright backlighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This might not count as an actual pro to anyone else, but I love the color. I&#x27;m a fantatic for all things purple, and I&#x27;ll admit, that was a final deciding factor for me when purchasing this since it went with my other purple styling tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have very few problems with this iron, but I will say that they do exist. One is the smell. When heating, one does smell a vaguely burning smell from the plates. I&#x27;ve noticed this every time I use it, but maybe it will go away over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Secondly, your hair will smoke when using it. Again, every time I&#x27;ve used this iron, I have seen smoke and the hair is piping hot when released, so I recommend being VERY careful when handling your hair unless you want to be partially burned, depending on the temp used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lastly, my one true beef witht his iron is that the bottom of the iron is not completely flat. It&#x27;s rounded on both sides of the iron, so if one isn&#x27;t careful when setting the iron down, it may tip over onto something or the countertop. All I can say is be mindful of how you handle the iron, especially when you set it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really love this iron. For the below 20$ pricetag and the power it has, I am supremely satisfied. The smaller problems are easy to overlook in place of the benefits. Before, I had to douse my head in straightening sprays and creams, but still come out with a frizzy mess. With this iron, I actually get what I want in terms of manageable hair. It&#x27;s smooth, soft, very few flyaway strands, and sometimes I just can&#x27;t help but run my fingers through it to watch how it slips and slides like silk. Worth it, so very worth it!ly after two sections of hair. With this iron, no reheating, only steady temp all the way.

    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron. It straightens and produces curls and spiral curls. I love its sleek look. It is a definite must have for a flat iron.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, arrive in time, no problems.</li>
    <li> I love the straighten .. its hard for me to find one that I like and I used mine all the time :)</li>
    <li> best cheap straightener ever! makes hair smooth and keeps it straight all day, its by far better than any expensive straightener out there!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost 3 years now and it still works perfect! I love digital temperature and it heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing considering what you pay. It heats up in 30 seconds or less, and it&#x27;s narrow enough to use on short hair. It&#x27;s also narrow enough to make curls or to curl your hair under/flip your hair out. Overall--awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that after using this straightener maybe 3-4 times a week for about a month and a half, I started to develop a blister on my pointer finger. It seemed odd considering I didn&#x27;t use it every day and did not use it for long periods of time (no more than 5 minutes per time). I&#x27;m not sure what can be done about this, but it&#x27;s really a small complaint. Maybe they need to put hand grips on it?</li>
    <li> Does exactly as I expected -- straightens my hair!  It heats up quickly (literally seconds!) and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  Love the slender size as it makes it easy to work with.  It&#x27;s also small enough that you can curl with it!  And it&#x27;s long enough that you can straighten a lot of hair in one move.  I think I can straighten all my hair in 5 to 10 minutes, depending on style (I have shoulder-length hair).  The cord is long too, which is great!  The adjustable heat settings are really easy to use too (+ raises the temp and - lowers it).  Really couldn&#x27;t be easier.  I use it about three times a week and I love it.  P.S.  I&#x27;ve yet to have it get caught in my hair or pull any hair out.  It&#x27;s just so sleek and smooth!  It also doesn&#x27;t burn my hair (but I do use a heat tamer spray so that probably helps).</li>
    <li> Not really being an expert on hair straightener&#x27;s, and definitely not being very proficient with it yet, this product is good enough for me.  Sometimes I can get a very good effect with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because I was afraid to plug my 175.00 straightner into an adapter overseas due to the horror stories I&#x27;ve heard about straightners overheating. I set this one to 400 with my adapter and it straightned my hair just as good as my 175.00 paul mitchell. Other people have commented that the straightener stopped working after a few months, I wont be using this everyday so I would say it served its purpose and is a good backup to use for traveling. Cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> After seeing tons of fake/paid for Nume reviews on YouTUBE, I really did not know how much I needed to spend on a good quality straightener. I had a very expensive straightener which I misplaced so I did not want to spend a ton on another one. This little $15 machine did everything I wanted it to and for a great affordable price. I have medium thickness wavy hair, which goes down to my hips and this machine straightens all of it in about 15 minutes. I love the color too! Just goes to show you that you do not have to spend a ton to look good.</li>
    <li> Petite size and practical. It works straightening and curling.</li>
    <li> I was still using an old curling iron on my hair and had been reluctant to buy a Hair Straightener in case I couldn&#x27;t use it as efficiently.  When Amazon suggested that this product was sometimes purchased with the Revlon Rvdr5029 hair dryer which I was purchasing I decided to give it a try.  Well, I found out what I&#x27;ve been missing!  I just love this product.  It is far more efficient and much easier to use than the old curling tongs.  It heats up very fast and saves me time as it is so easy to use and very quickly and efficiently sleeks my hair.</li>
    <li> Let ME tell YOU. This is a wonderful flat iron/ straightener BUY IT &amp; that&#x27;s all I have to say. The only problem I had was taking it out of the hard plastic packaging, but that had nothing to do with Amazon, it&#x27;s how Remington packaged their product. A piece of the plastic dug into my flesh while I was trying to cut it open which made me VERY upset but this is a good straightener.</li>
    <li> the color is absolutely beautiful and i liked the control settings. it does get very hot and works wonders on black hair.</li>
    <li> The remington hair straightener is a very good product. It is very effective and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair which I was worried about.</li>
    <li> IT´S LIGHT, EASY TO USE, HEATS REALLY FAST, AND IT CAN BE GRADUATED TO YOUR PERSONAL NEEDS.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.Quality is ok. It is Good product.It  Does everything Like I expected. Nothing beats this price.</li>
    <li> I loved this iron its really nice nd works great it flatenes my hair great i just love it !</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the purchase of this flat iron. After much deliberation i decided to go with this iron because of its simplicity in design and easy to use functions. It works well with  my short hair and heat very quickly i also love the safety function where it cuts off if left on and forgotten. The price is very good also for the quality of this product, definitely a good buy</li>
    <li> I do not iron my hair often, but when I do this straightener works great. You simply press the button along the side to turn the heat on and it is ready within a minute or so. Be careful since it does heat up quickly.</li>
    <li> My Chi died, it was a gift. So not being able to replace I was miserable.  Bought what I could get by with and I was surprised.  I notice a small difference from the Chi but it does a great job for the price.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> works great and the package was good and it does my hair the way  i want it to do thank you so much</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great. It heats up very quickly within 10 seconds. The best thing about it is that is doesn&#x27;t fry your hair. It leaves your hair with a glossy look. It is bigger than what the picture actually shows. I was expecting something a bit thinner so I can curl the short pieces in the back and the sides of my hair. However, it still works great.</li>
    <li> meh, not very good quality. barely use wish i had returned.</li>
    <li> This brand is works great even more for the price!!!</li>
    <li> I love this! Was using a large curling iron but hair dressers used a flat iron, so I finally bought one. I always thought they were to straighten curly hair but I have fine straight hair. it just smooths it and curls the ends under ever so slightly. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works well for my fine, thin hair and tames the ends (a growing out perm) nicely.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair! Before this I was hopeless when it came to ironing! It was so difficult and so much of a hassle that I just ended up with sweat and tears! I bought this iron and it changed everything! So much more easier now and I like how my hair looks! Had it for three years and plan on buying another one only because like every iron it got dirty and Im too lazy to clean it! Honestly great buy!</li>
    <li> Considering quality and price, this totally deserves five stars. Some awful straighteners are sold for much more! It heats up very quickly and straightens well. I have used it to successfully curl my hair as well. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for several months now, I use it almost every day and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- gets hot very quickly, under 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;- tells you exact temperature, rather than low/medium/high&lt;br /&gt;- lots of temperature settings&lt;br /&gt;- turns off automatically after 20 minutes or so&lt;br /&gt;- sleek design&lt;br /&gt;- ceramic plates are supposedly better for your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-the only SLIGHT flaw in this product is you have to press down on the off button to turn it off. It will turn off automatically after 20 minutes thoug</li>
    <li> Bought this after my Chi broke.  Never going back to a Chi. This is better and way cheaper!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron EVER! I have spent money on expensive high end flat irons before in the past, and none of them measure up to this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a year now and I will never buy another kind as long as they keep making this one. I have natural African American hair, and this gets my hair so straight, I don&#x27;t have to flat iron it again for at least a week on wash day. If I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair I could go longer. Only con is that it could have a little better glide but it&#x27;s not a problem if you know what you&#x27;re doing. And the price is amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener for my grand daughter, she has moved into her own bathroom and wanted her own beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it. She likes how quickly it heats up, the anti static and color. Her hair is quite short so the one inch wand was the right size. It was the perfect gift.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this straigntner. It has an automatic shut off after 1 hour of non-use which is very convenient. It has a lock temp setting so it will automatically heat to your desired temp when you power on. The buttons are not easily pushed while styling so your not accidentially changing settings and temps. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for over 10 years (not everyday of course), but this is by far the best I&#x27;ve had! I can&#x27;t believe I only paid $16 on Amazon for this thing. I own a $130 Chi and I actually prefer this straightener over the Chi. That&#x27;s just my personal preference, I&#x27;m sure others might disagree, but to compare a $16 straightener to a $130???? THAT says something! JUST BUY IT!</li>
    <li> This little thing works just as well as the high priced ones! It only takes seconds to heat up, too! A must have!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for about 8 months and for the last month I have been fighting just to get it to turn on. It has a button you push instead of a switch. I have to push it for 10 minutes before it decides to turn on. Who has that kind of time in the morning. I&#x27;ll be getting another.</li>
    <li> For all those promoting this product to be as good as a CHI is absolutely ridiculous, and I would not compare this product to a CHI to ANYONE, NOT EVEN MY FAMILY MEMBERS!!!! I do not know what CHI others were using, but up until a few days ago I had in my possession the original CHI and I loved it! I would still have it today and it would be working just the same even five years later, had my dog not chewed the cord. Needless to say, I will be buying another CHI but from all the comments comparing this to a CHI I had to give this product a try for it being much more friendly to my wallet (PERK #1). However, the moment I plugged it a horrible smell arose, a smell close to plastic burning. My only guess is that it is the smell of a cheap product burning, and led me to the assumption it will not be lasting as long as a CHI! Did this product straighten my hair? Yes, and about the same straightness as my CHI (Perk #2), however, it was constantly catching my hair. Did the anti-static really work? Nope, not even close. I have very fine hair and that could have been my issue as it is an issue most of the time, but I bought this product with the intention my static would lessen. Despite the negative comments I have for this product, I will be keeping it for the time being. Reasons are because: one it does do the job of a straightener and two, forking out the money for a CHI does not fit my budget just yet. (**REASON FOR TWO STARS)&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can really emphasize to others looking to purchase this product, it is far from a CHI!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing straightener in the whole wide world!!! Took it right from the package, opened it, plugged it in.. didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a smell like other people said.  It just smells like anything else (hairdryer, curling iron etc. when it&#x27;s heating up) Heats up SUPER SUPER fast.. my daughter has coarse, really thick hair..and it would take me 20 minutes plus every morning to straighten it.. by sections.. it takes me MAYBE 5 minutes now.. I was going to get a professional straightener, because of the way her hair is, I knew I needed something better than what we had.. I&#x27;m SOOOO glad I read the reviews.. I thought..if it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m out 30 bucks.. This FAR exceeded my expectations of a 30 dollar straightener!!! It leaves your hair soft, straightens soooo good! It works like a professional straightener at a cheap straightener price!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on something expensive..because this honestly is the best one we&#x27;ve ever had!!! I would give it 10 stars if I could!!</li>
    <li> I am very glad I bought this. The temperature is variable, the size is small enough not to be unwieldy, the shut off and lock mechanisms are very handy.  It managed to straighten some very curly and willful hair into submission long enough for a couple of media interview where I had to impersonate a person more dignified than myself. Apparently hair-straighening is a big part of that costume.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible straightener.  It heats up in seconds, literally!  I love the fact you can control the temperature setting.  The width of the \\&quot;iron\\&quot; is great and works great for really thin hair (mine) and thick hair (my daughter&#x27;s).  My 25 year old daughter and I are very impressed with it.  She pushed and pushed for me to buy a Chi!  She hates to admit it but she&#x27;s impressed and amazed how great it works.</li>
    <li> Auto off feature is nice!</li>
    <li> Love it. Heats fast. Fried my hair first time using, but lower setting was perfect.</li>
    <li> I have another popular flat iron that cost me $125.  This one works better for a fraction of the price.  I never use my other one, now.</li>
    <li> works well, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel as soft and shiny as the Remington Iron with the pink crushed pearl plates.</li>
    <li> I NEED TO KNOW IF YOU CAN DAMAGE CLAIM WHERE THE WARRANTY BECAUSE I AM OF VENEZUELA</li>
    <li> I went to my local target and this was retailing for about $30 and I bought mine for half the price here on Amazon! At first it didn&#x27;t look anything special..but it took little effort to straighten my thick wavy hair. I suppose it&#x27;s cut down my straightening time in half! I also use it for curling/beach waving my hair.</li>
    <li> Birthday gift for my sister and its exactly what she wanted</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for over 5 years and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I do not use it daily,  however.  My hair is very thick,  has coarse sections and wavy,  and this iron gets it smooth and silky.  It heats up VERY quick and the temp can be set and adjusted very easy.</li>
    <li> Work well.. met the need for a straightener and at a low cost.</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes my hair look great, and is a good price I would say!</li>
    <li> It takes literally a minute or two to get the job done.  No more curler rolls needed.</li>
    <li> it can use only110v.&lt;br /&gt;I am confused becouse of Q&amp;A.</li>
    <li> It works okay. Heats up very quickly. Only downside is that if you don&#x27;t use a heat protectant it will harm your hair after a short time of using it. Still it&#x27;s a good investment if you dont want to spend $100 on a straightener.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and when I tell you this flat iron had my hair bone straight it was straight as if it were permed. I only did my edges so far but I love it already. I love the way it heats up quickly and I love that the plates are floating so it won&#x27;t do too much damage to my hair. Overall a good product I just wish I could&#x27;ve bought it in a different color.  UPDATE: My original flat iron was stolen and this worked so well the first time so I reordered it for about 4 dollars more because they price had gone up. Much to my dismay the flat iron keeps turning off without warning. It&#x27;s very annoying because I&#x27;m aware of the quality of the iron. Maybe I got a bad one; I&#x27;m still upset that it doesn&#x27;t work as it should. Went from 4 stars to 2.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Remington S5500. It&#x27;s low cost and performance makes this a best buy. After buying the first one and my wife loving it I bought another because other brands cost 3 times or more.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener when I forgot mine on a trip. Like others have said, it&#x27;s not the most expensive, but it works - I am suprised how well for the price. I have thick, frizzy hair and it only takes a couple passes through to straighten it. It&#x27;s quick to heat up, and quick to straighten. I&#x27;d say the only real negative is the smell - the first couple times I used it the straightener smelled like burnt plastic. It did die off after a while, but it is not a nice smell in the morning! All and all a great backup straightener for anyone - or a great primary straightener if you&#x27;re just looking for something to fix flyaways/ straighten bangs!</li>
    <li> This straightener does an incredible, quick job of straightening and styling hair for an amazingly low price.  I am so glad I read the Amazon reviews to see how well it compared with the hundred dollar straighteners.  Get it!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and works great.  Good product for a good price that can&#x27;t be beat.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have tried maybe once before to straighten my own hair but it took too long so i gave up.  I just bought this hair straightener recently and it took me less than 5 minutes to straighten my hair.  It took maybe 30 seconds to heat up (325 degrees) so fast! and it was very easy to use and my hair is so straight!! :) would definitely recommend and good price too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after reading the great reviews!  I just returned from a trip to Italy and I was so happy that I made this purchase.  It worked great and I only needed a plug adapter.  It automatically switches to the correct voltage.  It works better than my chi without a doubt.  I bought one for my daughter to use on the trip as well and she also thinks it is better than her chi!  My hair stayed soft and straight for the entire day....even with humidity!  I plan on using it at home from now on....bye bye chi!</li>
    <li> bought the Remington S5500 for its reasonable price and dual voltage usage. Have used it so far only in the US and it works great. I&#x27;m planning on bringing it with me to Europe. It is lightweight and heats quickly. I&#x27;m very happy with this item, would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have VERY fine, delicate hair--and not a lot of it. (It&#x27;s about chin length.) I&#x27;ve used a curling iron all of my life, but my new hair style (asymmetrical bob) simply wasn&#x27;t working very well with a curling iron. I decided to try a flat iron. And then I spent a LONG time reading reviews--trying to decide between this iron and another (better quality?) iron for about $40. Some of the lower reviews definitely concerned me when they talked about snagging hair, etc. But since I really didn&#x27;t have $40 in the budget for a flat iron, I decided to go ahead and try this one. Sure, there were some lower reviews, but there were also a LOT of 4-5 star reviews--and a piece of junk isn&#x27;t going to make that many people happy. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s been great! It gives my hair a nice, crisp look. There have been a few times when I pinched the iron too tightly that it snagged my hair at the very bottom, but usually it slides over my hair very smoothly and leaves a really nice hair style behind. :) The iron feels sturdy and the area where you&#x27;re supposed to hold the iron stays at a comfortable temperature. This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others, but there&#x27;s nothing that I find irritating about it or would want to change. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results I&#x27;m getting! (And it&#x27;s so FAST and easy to use!) :)</li>
    <li> This straight iron is a great deal for the price: it heats up very quickly and straightens very well (I have naturally curly hair). Plus, it&#x27;s purple! I found the lock to close it very helpful for traveling, and everything about it was very easy to use. My only complaint is that it has a horrible burning smell just by heating up. Other than that, I would definitely suggest this straight iron.</li>
    <li> I had read great reviews on this and I decided to try it. I had a you stye and it dint heat up enough for my type of hair. So I had to go over it several times before it was straight enough. So this is great because it heats up at the right temp or higher if you wish. It does also have a quick heat up and I rly do love it. I would definitely recommend it, also I love the color.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair, but after having kids, I got some curls here and there.  It makes my hair look frizzy, so I bought this straightener just to straighten the stray curly hairs.  This product is lightweight and easy to use and great for light use.  It heats up fast and I&#x27;m done in just a couple minutes at the lowest heat setting.  Again, I have mostly straight hair, but this helps to even everything out for me.  Not sure how it would work for someone with curlier hair.  Does the trick for me, though.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! It gets super hot, if you need a high setting! You can change the settings, which is nice. I love having a bigger plate so I can get a bigger chunk of hair each time! It&#x27;s worth your money!</li>
    <li> I got a remington hair wand and liked it so decided to go with a remington straightener too. Heats up very quickly and straightens very smooth and even. Very happy with it</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this hair straightener very much. It was good quality for the price. I&#x27;ve been using it regularly (at least once a week) for more than a year now. The swivel cord is my favorite part because I can flip my bangs up easily.</li>
    <li> I lost my old straight iron.  I didn&#x27;t use it that much because I felt like it fried my hair.  Not this one!  I leave it around 370 for my thin fine hair and it works awesome.  Heats up quick, straightens quick and leaves my hair smooth smooth smooth.  I love it.  I didn&#x27;t use my old one that often.  I use this one almost everyday</li>
    <li> getting hot really fast, works perfectly for me :)</li>
    <li> I like this product, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes paying less for good quality!</li>
    <li> Outstanding quality for the price. I have fairly fine, thin hair that generally styles easily but tends to get very staticy and doesn&#x27;t usually hold style well. With this straightener, static has been significantly decreased compared to my previous straightener. I also keep it on one of the low-medium settings (370-390) and it can go up to at least 410, and it maintains the style longer than my old straightener. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 3 months now and it&#x27;s working perfectly. It did have a bit of a weird smell when I first started using it, but the smell has dissipated (or I just got used to it), and it never really bothered me. It also heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> love it. I have not too thin or not too thick hair and it works perfect for me</li>
    <li> For the money this is a great straightener. It runs through your hair smoothly, heats up fairly quickly (about 30 seconds), and does a nice job getting the job done quickly. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that you can only lower the heat to 310 degrees. My hair is dry so I don&#x27;t like that high of a setting. It still makes your hair smooth and straight. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Heats fast. Love digital temps. Leaves hair polished and smooth. Easy to clean and has rotating cord. Good slim size for travel.</li>
    <li> Minimum heat setting is 340F</li>
    <li> Very good product and reasonably priced. Sevice was very good also.I would buy another similar one since it works so well.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t easily break</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have 2 other hair straighteners. I would give this 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have  a smooth ceramic surface. I would recommend the conair proshine hair straightener</li>
    <li> Love it. I have natural hair and this product does an amazing job straighten my hair out</li>
    <li> This is a great, cheap hair straightener.  I am Hispanic with very frizzy, curly hair.  I first blow dry a section of hair, then go over the hair with a straightener.  This straightener works fine for me.  It gets my hair straight, and smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because I was entering my first semester of college and I wanted a nice, reliable flat iron. I was first attracted by the nice purple color, digital display, the mostly positive reviews it received and of course the price. It was delivered in a timely manor and was packaged the way you would buy it in the store. Everything was going great with the flat iron. I loved the fact that I could control the temp setting and that it had an automatic shut off feature. I have relaxed African american hair and it kept my hair straight with minimal fly away and still allowed for my hair to retain its body and shine. The flat iron lasted me through the semester, but about three weeks after leaving for summer break it simply died on me.... I plugged it on and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Such a disappointment because I really loved this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a back up straightener (since I would not be able to live a day without one) and loved it so much that it has now replaced my expensive straightener I spent $150 for and I use it everyday!  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great reliable straightener!</li>
    <li> It worked really great, but the chemical smell this thing puts out is atrocious! After a week of enduring stomach aches immediately following using this on my hair, I finally put 2 and 2 together and threw this thing in the trash. No stomach ache since, so this iron must emit some chemical fumes?! Garbage!</li>
    <li> It works well so far and the grip of the plates seems even. I wish there was an indication that it was done heating up - like a beep or something - and it would be nice if the temperature display screen lit up to be easier to read. But for what it costs, it does the job well. The auto shutoff is a great feature, too.</li>
    <li> Burns hair, need to run it through hair at least 3 times to get mine straight. I guess if you have fine hair this is for you. Thick hairs people&#x27;s buy a Royale Flat Iron. :) That&#x27;s what I got and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightening iron for 4 years now, and I&#x27;m happy to report that it&#x27;s still functioning well for me. I have very thick hair and I use this very often, so I&#x27;m pretty surprised that it works at all. I&#x27;ve had about two hair dryers die on me in the time that I&#x27;ve had this flat iron. I&#x27;ve put it through a good amount of wear and tear, and the only thing I&#x27;ve ever noticed about it that has been a possible concern is a slight burning smell, but I can&#x27;t fault it for that since it&#x27;s probably gotten some hair stuck in it from time to time. This flat iron is a great value.</li>
    <li> Very good. Does a good job even when traveling.</li>
    <li> Just what my crazy wavy Irish hair needed. In one swipe it has it beautiful and straight. Wish I had found this earlier, would have saved me a lot of work.</li>
    <li> Absolutely gorgeous!! I love how it looks great with a casual outfit and it looks sharp with a dressy outfit!</li>
    <li> I actually like this flat iron. Heats up quickly and does the job!</li>
    <li> I purchase this in 2011 and it&#x27;s 2015, I still have and love it only issue is it&#x27;s a little tough to turn on sometimes. But still gets very hot and straightens hair well for the cheap price!</li>
    <li> I have not used this as much as I should. The temperature window and control is nice. I like the feature that can cause it to be flatter for storage,</li>
    <li> Over my lifetime I have probably purchased dozens upon dozens of straightening irons. Spent hundreds of dollars on ones that burnt my hair, broke right away, didn&#x27;t heat up fast enough or high enough or just did not work fast enough. This iron is amazing! The price made it that much easier for me to want it even more. Heats up incredibly fast and I can straighten my hair in a matter of minutes. It&#x27;s skinny enough for me to bring on overnight trips or for me to bring anywhere I need to on a daily basis. Love this product! And the color!</li>
    <li> excellent product! I love it!... I love how it leave my hair, soft straight and you can make curls too. totally love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this straightener. Works better than my other &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; brand one and for $15 it is the best deal. Buying a second one to keep at work.</li>
    <li> Very good buy is what I was looking for gifts, it is in very good condition and I have no complaints, thanks.</li>
    <li> I finally bought a new straightener after my old one died. Wow, this is way better than my old one!! I use the lowest setting to straighten my hair, and I go up a setting for curling my hair. I have thick wavy hair that will do whatever you don&#x27;t want it to do, but this straightener does the trick! All straighteners damage your hair, but this one tends to do minimal considering you don&#x27;t have to keep running it through your hair over and over again to achieve your look. It also leaves your hair soft and quite shiny! I cannot get over how shiny my hair is for two days after using it! It heats up quickly so you are not standing around waiting for it to heat up. It is one of the cheapest on amazon, but also a a dream!</li>
    <li> I always used a curling iron. Never again! I used to think, &amp;#34;Why do I need a flat iron? My hair is as straight and fine as it gets.&amp;#34; Let me tell you, this thing curls my hair better than any other curling Iron I have used and the curls stay!! I actually did a test the other day. I did one section of my hair with a curling iron and the rest with this flat iron. Within hours, the one small section I used the curling iron on was almost straight again. At first, I forgot and was like WTF but then I remembered, oh yeah, that was the curling iron. I officially rolled it up and threw it in the back of my cabinet. I am only keeping it for emergency purposes. I used to blast this flat iron on high because that&#x27;s how I roll but then I decided to tone it down. I usually have it on 370. Once you get it, I would mess around with it a first and get accustomed to it. This one is a great size too. Not too big or too small.</li>
    <li> Low price, cute color, works great. I have thick, long hair(up to my booty) and this iron is really good. You can&#x27;t take huge chunks of hair and iron it but you can do like 2&amp;#34; at a time. I iron my hair at a medium setting of 350, the lowest is 310.. My hair always comes out perfect and silky straight. I even bought one for my sister.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I lost it during a move to my new house and HAD to have the same one!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome. It got here right on time &amp; I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;They last FOREVER. Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> It does what I want it to do for my hair, straighten out last night&#x27;s ponytail bump in my hair. This is my first straightener, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. It does create a tad bit of static if I go over a lock of hair more than once, but it is not bad at all. I like that it heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair, and I loved it. I use to straighten my hair and it looks great. What I like the most of it is the fact that the material protects your hair from the damage the heat can do.  I have one from the babyliss line and its good cause I do my hair quickly but it doesnt protect my hair from the heat as this one does. Also, the curls you do with it look perfect.  The only con i can find is that I spend more time doin my hair with this straightner, but the difference in timing is not so big that I cant rate it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> this flatiron impressed me immediately my hair is probably as curly as it gets and this straightens it out with one or two swipes i will b purchasing another in case the one i have goes</li>
    <li> They get hot very quickly.  Love them! Might buy another pair for my best friend for her birthday! ! !</li>
    <li> i am mixed with very curly hair... it was hard to find a flat iron that actually gets the job done, but this one definitely does it. i highly recommend this flat iron. especially for the women with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I needed a cheap straightener because my last one recently stopped working. So yeah, this one is nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. Also dig the temp settings. Very user friendly</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with other brands, but this has worked very well for me. I like that the temperature can be adjusted.</li>
    <li> Its great I love it...</li>
    <li> Heat is great and warms quickly, the digital temperature settings and easy to read numbers are quite helpful when using.</li>
    <li> Pretty good straightener for the price. But I would not really recommend this, although it&#x27;s okay, I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> How much I praise this product it has exceeded all my expectations. I love it and thank you Team Amazon.com for delivering it to me in Kashmir.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I&#x27;ve used it for years. I prefer it over my chi straightener!</li>
    <li> my hair was silky smooth!!</li>
    <li> This item did not straighten my hair like I thought it would. I have medium thick hair with a slight wave to it. My hair looked frizzy after straightening it with this flat iron twice.  I have an older instyler flat iron and it still straightens my hair better than this new one.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I sent this item back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Useful little straightener. I&#x27;ve since moved to another type since mine died, but it works great while it lasted. I only had it though for maybe 6 months before it died, but I&#x27;m not going to necessarily blame that on quality, since I&#x27;m sure I dropped it one or two many times knowing me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace the Chi that my daughter \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; from me. It is a good straightener but it is not the Chi and understandably so since it was 19.99 and the Chi is 119.99. So for anyone expecting the Chi quality for this price, it isn&#x27;t going to happen. The iron heats up very quickly which is nice. It also does a good job straightening. The complaint I have is that the plates aren&#x27;t super smooth and if you aren&#x27;t careful it will leave a crease in your hair where you started straightening. With that said, some minor adjustments in how you hold it and the pressure you apply alleviates this. I have super fine hair and the setting of 370 is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some medium priced straighteners, some expensive ones, and have been using a wide paddle Bed Head straightener for about three years now. This week the lights went out on it. It still gets hot but it is obviously getting burned out. For daily use for three years, I really got a lot out of it. But, alas, the same model new costs about $40, so I cheaped out.  Last weekend, I chopped off all my hair. I thought, after reading all the great reviews, I&#x27;d give this little, inexpensive, narrow straightener a go. I curled my hair with my Bed Head 1 in curling iron this morning, but this straightener smoothed and flattened my strands super quickly.   It gets hotter than a person could ever need and very quickly. I usually need super hot irons to get my fine hair to behave, but this iron goes above and beyond. Recommend, as others have, to start at a lower heat setting. 370 or less is working for me. Doesn&#x27;t add shine, but what straightener really does? Is that what we&#x27;re really looking for? You just can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality. Hope it lasts a long time. I was really satisfied with my Bed Head tools, but this one is keeping up very well.</li>
    <li> This iron was Du-a-ble, I&#x27;m African American with a mixed mother..So my hair isn&#x27;t really nappy or super thick. but this iron does its job...</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancee, and she LOVES it.  Not to mention it&#x27;s like the cheapest straightener out there, and very high quality.  Ignore the one star review, someone obviously got a faulty model and decided they&#x27;re all bad, unlike the tons of 4 and 5 star reviewers.</li>
    <li> This product warms up quickly but maximum heat is not very high, although I&#x27;m not sure if this is better in order to avoid hair damage.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new flat iron in forever, and just purchased this one. WOW. Maybe its just me, but this iron is amazing. It gets very hot, which is maybe why, but my hair looks as good as when I get it done at the salon. No joke. And I can do this myself for free now. I also got a new heat protection spray which I used, too, so maybe its the combination of them both, but I am never buying a different flat iron again, I&#x27;m really happy!</li>
    <li> I DO NOT KNOW WHY AM I REVIEWING THIS, BECAUSE I NEVER USED IT...&lt;br /&gt;but....&lt;br /&gt;MY WIFE SAID ITS REALLY GOOD&lt;br /&gt;i hate these things and i always scream at my wife when she uses these...and i will tell you the reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. she is my wife, not my girlfriend...since she is permanent and not temporary, i do not want her to damage her hair just to look &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; for a couple of hours (she is already beautiful) i do not want her to damage her hair in the long run...&lt;br /&gt;2. i can smell the burning of her hair when she uses it... ( i have a strong sense of smell)&lt;br /&gt;3. close examination of her hair, I can tell it started to split and damage since she started using this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY REASON i am giving it a two star is becuase she said its good (may be as an ironing device that flattens your already flattened hair, and make it thin so it can wave around in the air)</li>
    <li> After using a different straightener for several years (that died), I purchased this one after seeing the positive reviews on Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I did. This iron gets my hair straighter and softer than the old iron ever did. Also, I&#x27;m glad there are different heat settings for different types of hair.  You won&#x27;t regret buying this iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after using my sister&#x27;s for almost a year. I even purchased my mom a much more expensive hair straightener for christmas last year, and she has ended up ordering a Remington for herself! This straightener does a better job than any other straightener I have owned. In addition, it holds up great! My sister has used hers almost everyday for two years and it still works like it is brand new! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used a flat iron in a long time.  I love how this iron rotates and the cable doesn&#x27;t get tangled up!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I recently cut my hair up to my shoulders and I wanted to curl/ create beach waves. I love it!  It heats up super fast, gets super hot even on the lowest setting, and does a wonderful job curling the ends of my thick hair.  I also use it to straighten my hair also.  For the price and quality, buy it!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best straightener you can get for $15.  It heats up in 30 seconds and I could straighten all my hair in under 10 minutes.  My hair isn&#x27;t super hard to straighten, since it&#x27;s fine and only slightly wavy, but it still did a good job of straightening in a really short time.  It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
    <li> my friend told me about the straightener. I love it because it do the job on my hair. I give it 5 star.</li>
    <li> Very nice product as per the price. Very fast and effective!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about 2 years now and use it 3-4 times a week to curl my hair. I love how long the plates are because I can get more hair curled than with my sister&#x27;s CHI straightener. I also love the small detail of a swivel cord since I often twist the straightener to curl without the hassle of a twisted cord. I really needed a new straightener and this one didn&#x27;t break the bank. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> 2nd time purchasing. The first one lasted a little over a year with daily use. For the price i guess its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Nice curls, gets very hot,  and sleek plates</li>
    <li> Keeps turning off on its own and I can hear electrical arcing inside the handle when the rotating cord ... is rotated.  Defective junk.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRICE AND GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Nice piece. It works really nicely and heats up pretty quickly. Sometimes, it just turns off weirdly, also it is a little hard to press on the up or down temperature keys. Aside from that, a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Straightens well, only thing is the back light on the screen never turned on</li>
    <li> I have been through 2 of these, I liked them but they don&#x27;t last. I gave  up after the second one and  got a conair. The power button sticks inward, so you can&#x27;t power it on anymore.</li>
    <li> Better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve had! It really is worth the money and makes straightening hair a breeze! I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and there has been no problems whatsoever with them</li>
    <li> Works okay and worth the price</li>
    <li> i ordered this for my mother,she loves it,it works perfectly.The bonus is the little screen that shows you the exact temperature you are at and you get to adjust to suit you.</li>
    <li> Only used a few times before I broke my shoulder.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter.  It heats up in 1-2 minutes.  The temperature is adjustable.  The body of the straightener is very manageable.  Hasn&#x27;t ruined her hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this since the end of May and it&#x27;s now nearing the end of August.  Even right out of the box, it never got hot enough to straighten my wavy, coarse hair.  I&#x27;d set it for 410 degrees and would spend at least 10 minutes going over and over each segment of hair, hoping for it to finally straighten out the curls.  Then about a month in, it stopped turning on.  Or, I should say, easily turning on.  I&#x27;d press the button over and over and some days it takes minutes to get it on.  My big concern is that one morning it will not go on and I&#x27;ll be late over something basic like straightening my hair.  Very frustrating.  I gave it two stars because, when it does come on, it does heat up quickly and does a fair job. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> For a cheap straightener, this thing heats up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair as much as some of my friends&#x27; more expensive straighteners.</li>
    <li> After years of trying to make my hair look like I wanted by using a curling iron and not getting the desired results, I finally decided to get a straightener. While I&#x27;m still learning and perfecting my technique, I am very satisfied with the product. I like how fast it heats up, the digital display, and the way the cord rotates. I hope it lasts awhile because I plan on using it pretty much constantly!</li>
    <li> Works really good I love it!!! And shipped fast!</li>
    <li> This straightener sucks this is literally my 3rd time using it and its broken. I turn it on, the temperature flashes, then it shuts off abruptly moments later. I&#x27;ve used many straighteners, including some different ones from Remington and I&#x27;ve never had one break on me like this luckily i only wasted like 8$ but its obviously not even worth that..two thumbs down Remington!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use mainly for travel due to it&#x27;s small size. It does a great job straightening my hair and would probably be great for every day use as well.</li>
    <li> Works great - good controls.  My 13 year old curly hair daughter is very pleased!</li>
    <li> Heats up in under 30 seconds and can manage to straighten even my wild mixed race hair, which is usually very difficult. makes hair shiny and smooth like more expensive brand but at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my first Remington straightener. Heats up really fast. Does not burn you hair. Very handy and worth the price.</li>
    <li> It is awesome for the price and makes a huge difference in the time it takes to do my hair in the  morning.  If I had known it would do the job so quickly, I would have gotten a new straightener a long time ago.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener, at a throwaway price! I expected it to be small, but this is a full sized great straightener, digital controls, swivel cord, goes up to 410 degree, and also imparts a shine to my hair. My hair feels soft and amazing after using this.&lt;br /&gt;The only qualm I have with this is that it does not do wet-to-straight, which I know was not written anywhere, but I thought it would do it, since my previous Remington Straightener did it. If you try to straighten wet hair, then it will become non-straight really soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all good product, could be better. But awesome for the price.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Revlon straightener that I bought from Walmart. It was also cheap, but it was wide plated. Maybe 3 inches or more. It was hard to get close to my scalp to get all the frizz and curls tamed. I borrowed a CHI straightener from a family member and was astonished how well it worked even though it was small like this Remington. I would have thought wider was better. Not if the straightener gets hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been disappointed with this Remington straightener. It has worked very well for my hair. I have curly/wavy long hair, which is not too thick. However I do have cowlick type curls near my forehead that almost never go straight. This does a pretty good job of them. It gets them straight and they stay that way for a few hours. Humidity or water will usually put a wave back in but nothing like the curl I get when naturally dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this has a setting to choose temperature. That is great depending on what type of hair you have, you can bump it up or if you don&#x27;t need it too hot, you can save your hair some of that heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As compared to the CHI, this can hold it&#x27;s own pretty well. The CHI did seem to work faster and be so smooth going through my hair. Sometimes I think it would be worth the price to get it. But for under $20, this one works so well, I think it is fine. I have owned it for 2 years and have had no problems. Still going strong.</li>
    <li> Well-made, durable and reliable.  Heats up quickly and has adjustable settings.  It&#x27;s on the small side, but if you don&#x27;t need to use it a lot, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I really like it..i got this product yesterday.. lets see till when i&#x27;ll be in love with this product..but right now i&#x27;m loving it..</li>
    <li> bought these for my wife as a surprise because she always complained about her other 2-3 pair (lol) didnt give her the results she was going for after one use of these she put the other ones away and exclusively use these so i think it was a great buy</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Minus one star because I have fine hair and even the lowest heat setting seems too hot! But really I guess that&#x27;s on me for not reading the description well enough.</li>
    <li> totalmente satisfecha</li>
    <li> it straightens my hair but it yanks my hair and damages it easily. will be returning.</li>
    <li> It Doesn&#x27;t have the blue light LCD as shown in photos and it&#x27;s really BAD!&lt;br /&gt;Straightener works as supposed...</li>
    <li> I was so excited this morning when mine came in! I&#x27;ve been needing a new straightener for a while. I previously had a Remington Straightener as well and I kept it for 8 years and it just has gotten kind of worn out this year. I am so happy with this straightener. It glides through my hair so smooth. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or hurt in anyway the straightener really does help with friz ease as well. My hair has been sleek and smooth today and we have 93% humidity where I am today. It also cut down on my normal hair routine time. It straightened my hair perfect in half the time as it would have my old one. If your looking for a new one that performs like a professional straightener I think this one is the one you should choose!</li>
    <li> For the price, this is great. I have extremely thick, wavy hair and although it takes what feels like a year to straighten, this manages to get it under control. Has several different heat settings, going up to 410F. It claims to have a 30-second auto shut-off, but I have yet to see it do that like it should.</li>
    <li> The Handel gets hot but works good</li>
    <li> Works pretty good.. I like it..</li>
    <li> I have had this for almost 2 years now and love it.  I just purchased a second one for travel because they are reasonably priced.  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it. It does the job and it was priced well. I wouldn&#x27;t say it blew me away or anything, but it does get hot really fast, which is nice.</li>
    <li> Not dual voltage!! Comes up as dual voltage in the search so I bought it and nowhere on it does it say it is capable with European voltage. I&#x27;m disappointed because half said yes, half said no, and some just plugged it in to find out- some with good and some with bad results. There was no difinitive answer, but there is now. NOT DUAL VOLTAGE AT ALL. If you are looking for a dual voltage flat iron to travel with, this WILL NOT WORK and you will VOID YOUR WARRANTY if you try to plug it in to the wrong voltage outlet or any &#x27;unauthorized accessories&#x27;. I&#x27;m sure it works great, it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for, and will probably return it.</li>
    <li> I just got done using this and it works great! i have long curly hair and it can be unruly but it took the frizz away and my hair is finally straight. ^_^</li>
    <li> My mother n sister both love this, very sleek,does the job well and keeps the hair nice for a long period of time.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.. I never thought that my hair can be straightened. This is the ultimate solution and it also made my hair shiny :)</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Completely satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a much more expensive straightener, but the plates were crooked and my hair would catch instead of glide through. I returned that one and decided to try my luck with a less expensive straighter . . . and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This one is great! It heats up quickly, can go up to 410 degrees, and has a long cord.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this iron, I have 4a hair and it straightened it very well without any snagging or having to pass it more than once on my hair. I have a sedu and a babyliss so I have a good base for comparison, for the price this iron is a steal</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love it!  Helps give my hair lift.</li>
    <li> I use this straightener all the time. It does not do as the name implies though! My hair gets more static when i use this straightener then when i don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! I have Chi&#x27;s, and I love this one WAY better. It heats up so quickly, and straightens my waist length hair really well. The locking feature is nice too so it&#x27;s not always just open, and you don&#x27;t have to wrap the cord around it to keep it closed.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this straightening iron!  Dual floating plates would be better, but I don&#x27;t use it daily, so I don&#x27;t mind too much.</li>
    <li> The size in great, the product has been holding up, and the heat is great.  Not more I could ask for.</li>
    <li> Came in the mail the next day! Works like a charm!! My hair is usually spiral girls and this got it stick straight within two strokes!</li>
    <li> I love this charger it has a swivel head, up to 400degree heat, and is just awesome. It is so much better than my cheap other charger. This charger is the best quality for a person with a low budget. Buy it before its gone!</li>
    <li> This really helps my daughter to get the stick straight hair she likes and that is so popular among girls right now. Very easy to use and great value.</li>
    <li> Seriously,I don&#x27;t know what people like about this one.It dried my hair out so bad,that I had to stop right away within 5 seconds of using it.It makes my hair look so awkwardly straighten and unnatural looking. I think people like this because it was cheap,but c&#x27;on,you girls are better than that.Go buy something at TJ max,cheap and good quality instead of this one.</li>
    <li> I purchase it for my mom and its a good price. this product is not bad at all it works perfectly fine just use it with care :) after 3-5 mins it irons the hair and good to go.</li>
    <li> I was on a tight budget this month and wanted a quick fix to my CHI finally giving out on me after 5 years. I read a lot of great reviews on this product and figured for the price, why not give it a shot. My hair is naturally straight, and sometimes I just need to fix a few pieces and my bangs.. this straightener leaves creases in my hair, and pulls. It does NOT go down smooth, AT ALL. Also, it smells really bad which leaves my hair smelling bad the rest of the day.. it might be because it is new, but I still don&#x27;t like going out with my hair smelling like it just caught fire. I am not impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> Small on size so its easy to use. Very hot tho already burned my finger it only goes down to 310 in temp which is still a little hot for my hair as it doesn&#x27;t take much to straighten.  When it heats up it smells like plastic I notice it goes away after a little use but some people don&#x27;t like stuff like that.</li>
    <li> This iron is amazing! It heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell and styles my hair so well that I can wait a few days before ironing it again (spares my hair some damage)....oh, and awesome price!!! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have owned.  I have bought several cheap versions over the years not wanting to spend a fortune on a Chi or similiar when I found this little gem on Amazon.  It straightens my hair effortlessly and makes it look amazing every time.  I only wish I bought this sooner!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on a whim because of the cheap price and the Remington name.  My sister, sister-in-law and niece tried to swipe them so I ordered three more pair.  Little did I know that they were thiking the same thing and ordered their own.  I gave them to my co-workers and they think I am the best thing since sliced bread.  This is a top notch product for a more than reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! She has thin hair and little bit of waves. Simple product but does the job and is easy to store.</li>
    <li> Crapped out within a month of using it. The time that it did work, it worked well. Into a month of using it just stopped working. Used it about 5 times in total. Disappointed !!</li>
    <li> I wish it got a little hotter but overall this is a great product. I bought it for traveling but I am now using it as my main straightener.</li>
    <li> I had been thinking a while about whether or not to buy it and I was a bit suspicious at first because I have a lot of hair and it is very thick and wavy and the straightener is only 1 inch wide. But this is the best straightener I have ever used. When used with heat tamer, it makes my hair super straight and it doesn&#x27;t look dry or damaged and there&#x27;s no static. (Which is a problem I&#x27;ve had in the past with other straighteners.) Really amazing product, it was completely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Bought this at Target while traveling. The &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; mechanism doesn&#x27;t really work well so it springs open every time. Very cheap product but does basic stuff. I have mostly straight hair with a little wave in it so it works for me.</li>
    <li> I lovelovelove this flatiron! My hair is thick, wavy, frizzy, broken and pretty much fried from dying my hair so much over the years. It&#x27;s hard to find a styling tool that gives me the sleek look that I want for work. My best friend has this straightener and told me how great it was, so I gave it a shot. For this price, I figured why not! I was more than pleased!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and thin enough that I can get through to the lower layers and I can even get the back stick straight when I have it cut down to an inch long, no lie!! It rids my hair of frizz entirely, and it leaves my rough, coarse hair feeling super soft! And not to mention it gets super hot (410 degrees I think it is) in less than 30 seconds! Totally worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I dįdnt expect much when I bought this because it was so cheap. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works, and so glad I didn&#x27;t spend the big money for the Chi again. I use my straightener daily, so I replace them every couple of years. This one gets pretty hot, and I like that you can bump up the temp. I still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap and actually works.  My hair is moderately straight, but I don&#x27;t dry it, so it has to be straightened every morning. Might not be quite strong enough for someone with really curly hair though...</li>
    <li> I jus received my remington flat iron i absolutely love it. I can see the difference in my hair drom just sampling it to see if it works. I love it ! And for the price simply amazing. . Thank You</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for nearly 5 years, it&#x27;s still awesome! Great buy for a great price!</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. It heats up real quick, and it does the job. My hair is frizzy and with this no more. Wonderful price, I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Awesome price for an amazing product..! Would buy again if I went back and repeated this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I love it that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy and it get warm fast (:</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom because hers was outdated and I think her hair looks much better now. It seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> I love these I have bought 3 pair in the last month and found a pair that works good.</li>
    <li> Very good product., My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> It was fairly good at straightening my hair until a year later when it stopped working now I have to spend money on a new one honestly I suggest you just spend the extra on a nicer one that will last much longer</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this. Made me hair dry and brittle. I trashed it was not as I hoped for. Made hair shiny just put so much crimps in my hair.</li>
    <li> i like this, heats good,makes my hair feel silky and no frizz or fly aways, works as good as my daughters expensive one. would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This straightener was hard to open (the packaging) but after using it, my hair looks great! It heats up really quick (I suggest you put it on lowest settings). Hopefully it will last long!</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron about two years ago, and it stills works great. Unlike other cheaper irons I&#x27;ve owned, this one can still heat up just as hot as it did when it was brand new, after two years of almost daily use. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair very well, it catches at times. So I can&#x27;t really use it for curling. However, it is 110% worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Bought it over a year ago and it still works great.</li>
    <li> Never owned one before and I really enjoy using it! Glad I picked this one out! Wow, just wow!</li>
    <li> i love controlling the temperature and it works amazing. It doesn&#x27;t  take long to heat up as well.&lt;br /&gt;i love it!</li>
    <li> One of my best purchases...</li>
    <li> its reallllllyyyy good heats fast</li>
    <li> A little iffy on what to give it for stars. I&#x27;ve used these a few times in the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it and I&#x27;m impressed but disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing of it is, the heat settings are really high. Mine only has 3 different settings. I have thin short hair (pixie cut) that&#x27;s not damaged but I feel like this would cause split ends and frying if I used it on a daily or every other day basis. Even at the lowest temp, steam rises off of my dry, just heat protected hair. I&#x27;m no hot tools expert but that&#x27;s a clear red flag for me. This is why I&#x27;ve only used it in passing and not on the regular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also takes longer than my other Remington to get hot. (I have the Wet to Straight Digital one, from about 8 years back. It works great still and does straighten my hair without damaging it. Makes it look super shiny too. Has multiple heat settings and is overall awesome but is more boxed on the sides. So curling with it is a no go. Enter this one here.) The plastic also feels super cheap and gets hot fast on the outside. Be careful if you are curling and touching the iron because it will burn. All though, all hot tools are this way. (That I&#x27;ve tried or have.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are buying this to straighten I would go with another one. I find that when I pull my hair to straighten it, (which may be my own fault but I haven&#x27;t found a way to not do this.) that it leaves dents where it first started. I hate that, it looks like you had a ponytail holder in your hair or something to that extent. But it curls nicely when properly used. I found that out the hard way, when I was flipping my hair out or in. I also did curls to see if it could since I had to experiment for a while with the flipping and it worked and looked awesome. The ends of my hair much like the beginning look a little stiff and iffy but I can deal. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t leave the dent at the end of my curls. I think its more of a pressing to hard thing for me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will re-update this when I&#x27;ve had it and used it more to give tricks and tips... hopefully. (If my hair doesn&#x27;t burn but even then, I will let you know.) Would I recommend. Not for straightening hair. For flipping or curling hair, yes. Oh, it also leaves my hair static free which is advertised in the name!I&#x27;ve had it and used it more to give tricks and tips... hopefully. (If my hair doesn&#x27;t burn but even then, I will let you know.) Would I recommend. Not for straightening hair. For flipping or curling hair, yes.

    <li> Quality product for the price.  A real bargain.  Heats up quickly and does the job on my long thick wavy hair when I want to wear it straight.</li>
    <li> Great product- works beautifully to straighten or curl the ends, and so cheap!</li>
    <li> I have never used a hair straightener before, usually use a curling iron.  But, my hair always tends to frizz a bit with curling iron, especially if there is any moisture or humidity in the air.  This anti static straightener leaves my hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> You would not believe the high quality of these irons, expecially for the price. I&#x27;ve been using the Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static Ceramic Irons for about 4 years now. This is my 4th one. It&#x27;s sitting on the shelf for the  future because I am a stylist and I use them all day. I&#x27;ve only had to replace them once and the other one I purchased for my daughter. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a review for those who are curious about this straightener&#x27;s performance as a curling tool. I wanted a flat iron for my bf&#x27;s place that could both curl and straighten my hair while being affordable. This is the cheapest straightener I could find, so I was skeptical. As far as straightening goes, I have gotten better results from other tools, but as long as you go over each section of hair carefully, it definitely gets the job done. For reference, I have thick, wavy hair. I absolutely adore curling my hair with this thing. Because the prongs are curves, it gives a nice, large, even curl that looks very natural and sexy. Think VS model hair. I ended up taking my $100 Babyliss straightener to my bf&#x27;s house because I like using this one more for curls, which is how I usually do my hair. It does smell a tad odd when it heats up but I can live with that. A total steal!</li>
    <li> I just want to add an important note here, because I read many reviews that this straightener will work on dual voltage automatically. When I received the straightener, I noticed that the voltage rate written on it is (120V) only. So I went to Remington website and filed a support ticket, and here is their answer:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thank you for your message. You would need to look between the handles of the flat iron and see if it&#x27;s printed on the handle 120/240V. If so, then the unit has worldwide voltage. The older version of the S-5000 has dual voltage but the newer one runs on 120V only. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So please take attention to this point if you want to use this one outside USA.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional it straightens and bumps</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my old straightener that i&#x27;d had forever. I was skeptical because of the price but needed a new one ASAP. However, this product is amazing. it heats so fast! I have thick wavy hair and I can have my hair straight in less than 10 minutes! Doesn&#x27;t leave creases in your hair (at least not for me). Cant recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> Smoth and very light. The thermometer works awesome, it helps regulating the temperature. My mom is very happy</li>
    <li> My girlfriend really enjoys it and says it works fast and well. she is very satisfied with the results of this product.</li>
    <li> Love the temperature control settings!  Durable, and lighweight, with an ease of use.  Even little touch, like the swivel cord makes this a gem to own.</li>
    <li> Works for me, my sister, and my friend, and each of us have very different hair. Keeps it straight all day, works very quickly. Never going to buy any other straightener. Buying this one til I&#x27;ve got no hair left to use it on!</li>
    <li> Works great, very hot, Adjustable to 410 degrees. Fast heatup, works as well as my old professional one and no snags, would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is nice and it works well but I just cant get over that smell when its heatd. smell burnt and awful</li>
    <li> The product arrived earlier than expected and it looked great. I purchased it as a gift so I cannot give a full review, but it looked like it was in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> This thing works great! It is my favorite so far! I don&#x27;t think I would buy anything else. It heats nice, looks good, and straightens well.</li>
    <li> Better than the $100+ I&#x27;ve owned! Best hair straighter! Gets hot fast and works amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington S5500 straightener about a month ago after reading reviews online. It&#x27;s the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had! The price is outstanding for the quality of the product. I use it about three times per week. I have thick wavy hair and it takes me ten minutes or less to style my hair. I find that it helps my hair stay smooth despite South Florida humidity, and I have not noticed any damage to my hair. I recommend trying the lower heat settings first to avoid damage to your hair. It&#x27;s a really fantastic product, and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Amazing price for well-functioning hair tool.  Allows for multiple heat functions and able to straighten and curl hair with it.  Small wand allows for multiple purposes and gets hard to reach spots.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how great this flat iron is. I have natural, very coarse, very thick African American hair (4B if you&#x27;re into hair typing) and flat ironing my hair NEVER worked unless I went to a salon but who wants to pay for that? it would always come out frizzy and fried looking when I did it myself with flat irons that cost $30+ dollars. I purchased this based on the reviews and this is the best $14 I&#x27;ve spent in awhile. My hair came out sooooo silky and straight with no frizz! I used 2 passes on each strand at 370 degrees. Don&#x27;t let the cheap price fool you this thing works!</li>
    <li> Great value. Use this on a daily basis and for the price it works really well. Perfect for someone who is lightly straightening their hair.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this flat iron. It is very light weight and efficient. It&#x27;s plate is ceramic coated which makes it glide very easily and heat control straightened hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my layers straight, and it works like a charm. I have very fine, wavy hair, and the lowest setting straightens it perfectly. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was shipped quickly, packaged in its original box and then in an outer cardboard box. This straightener works great for being on the cheaper end. it still works for me and i use it almost every day (when I told myself I wouldn&#x27;t). I have thick hair and have had comments on how shiny and straight it is after I use this.</li>
    <li> I loves this straightner. It did everything it promised and was a great price. However, after about a year of light to moderate use, it suddenly  stopped turning on. It was never dropped or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product does what to says... But buyer beware that it might suddenly stop working.</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my wife&#x27;s hair. She replaced a unit that couldn&#x27;t get nearly as hot and her hair has been fantastic ever since. She absolutely loves this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair iron for years as well as a Chi iron. My Chi hair iron has since burnt out and would constantly snag my hair. This hair iron let&#x27;s me customize the temperature, which I love, and has never ever failed me. It gets hot, makes my hair straight and smoothe, and still looks brand new. I even lent it to my mother for a while since I did have another hair iron - and I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it back! Totally recommend for the price, I&#x27;ve gotten 10 times my money out of this hair iron.</li>
    <li> I think it is a bit dangerous but with some skill, this is a cheap and great hair iron</li>
    <li> Love love love this flat iron. I am able to straighten and curl my hair. Leaves hair super soft and shiny. Adjustable,  digital temperature is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was great in the beginning, it heats up fast to a high temperature, has a lovely digital display and works great for my hair which is difficult to straighten. After about 5 uses the display suddenly broke and it no longer heated up and the next time I plugged it in it was completely dead. I will send it back to the company under the warranty to get a replacement and I hope that won&#x27;t break as well. It&#x27;s a great flat iron for the price but the components seem to be faulty and or very cheap since it broke so fast with very little use.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is perfect.. It works great..</li>
    <li> I love this iron! It heats up in seconds and works great! Favorite one I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> This is a really great flat iron. Especially for natural hair. I have to go over my weave a couple times but it still gets straight.</li>
    <li> These Are Amazing.!! They Deserve 5 Stars :)</li>
    <li> I just love this flat iron! I can use really close to the begging of my hair without burn my skin and I realized that my hair became more shine after I straight with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> The best! Heats up ultra fast, catches my ends. the packaging was a little hard to open. but money well spent :D</li>
    <li> This works great and I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was.  I don&#x27;t need to heat it to the max to get lots of heat.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does exactly what I want. It heats up quickly, cools quickly, and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. However, it does have an odor to it when using it about the first 2-3 times.</li>
    <li> Great straightner. Delivered the next day</li>
    <li> Great!! It does what it supposed to do... BTW I have African american hair. It straightens my hair good and heats up quickly</li>
    <li> Came very soon, and the packaging was excellent. It is a very good tool if you dont want to spend lots of money. I really like it.</li>
    <li> SHORT: It effectively straightened my hair with no issues. It has a low of 310 degrees, and a high of 410, and the integers you raise the setting by are pretty random. I did not need it to make my hair pin-straight, as I only intended to clearly trim my ends, but on the second lowest setting (330) I was able to do just that. Worth the money for me, and if I ever needed to, I&#x27;d buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LESS SHORT: I have a large body of thin curly hair. 3b-4a hair if you would like a more specific idea. Waves that are so close together that they are almost coils. Ethnic hair if this helps anyone. I was skeptical that something so small, and cheap could do anything. I&#x27;ve only ever used the older more expensive models that someone else lends to me, so this was new. It will be the first I have owned for myself.  You must read your instructions very thoroughly before using. For instance, this is not a wet-to-dry flat iron. It advises you to not use an extension cord, or place it on a soft surface. Small things I have no idea if they actually prolong my flatirons life, but I also won&#x27;t test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have had no issues with it. I&#x27;ve only used it once, on my hair, and my mothers. Her hair is 3a-3b, but thicker, and she has overall less hair than me. Flawless finish for her too. I will update my review if any problems arise. For now, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this two years ago, and it still looks and works new. Only issue I have is that I&#x27;ve used the power button too much, so now sometimes I have to double check.&lt;br /&gt;I owned the Chi, and hated it, it burned my hair because I could not control the temperature, and it broke very easily. This one wont though, my guess is it will last me another 2 years!</li>
    <li> I have used this a few times. Heats up fast. Has a lock mode, nice when kids are around. I like it and it straightens my hair easily.</li>
    <li> I like this flat iron. It heats up very quickly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use heating products a lot and I am no expert at judging but, for what I liked about it, I will write about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I love it:-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast,&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t burn,&lt;br /&gt;many temperatures,&lt;br /&gt;long term straightened hair,&lt;br /&gt;hair looks shin too  :D</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Jr High school aged daughter this past Christmas and was very happy to find that Amazon carried a PURPLE one...she was VERY specific about the color.  It heats up quickly and keeps its temperature, as she&#x27;s been using it every morning before school. Its quality is really holding up strong considering its daily use, for a few months now...not to forget to mention that she&#x27;s thrilled about the color (did I mention that it&#x27;s purple?!) ...which makes all the difference to a 12 year old girl!!</li>
    <li> Excellent straightener. I have thick hair with a natural wave. Only thing I&#x27;d change is having lower heat settings available - 310 degrees F is the lowest this goes, I&#x27;d like a 300 option or even a bit lower.</li>
    <li> After my last flat iron bit the dust, I searched for an inexpensive, but highly-rated flat iron to take its place.  This one met both of those requirements and is definitely a keeper :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 inch long ceramic plates infused with anti static technology&lt;br /&gt;  *I have had no problem with any static and I can use it on pretty short areas of my hair as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digital temperature controls with a maximum 410 degree salon high heat&lt;br /&gt;  *I like that everything is controlled with 3 buttons...On/Off, increase temp, and decrease temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floating plates with 30 second heat up and auto shut off&lt;br /&gt;  *It does heat up that quick and I like not having to worry if I forget to unplug it when I&#x27;m done :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salon style swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;  *This is a must for me as I cannot stand cords that don&#x27;t lay right, especially since I lay the end of the cord just underneath the&lt;br /&gt;  end of the iron to keep it from sprawling out on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auto Shut Off and a 2 Year Warranty&lt;br /&gt;  *Again, love the auto shut-off feature and am glad that it comes with such a long warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this flat-iron and would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for one.  I have no complaints on it&#x27;s function and results.  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have had my other pair for almost 7 years. I needed to replace them. These are amazing 😍😍😍</li>
    <li> Love using this straightener for curling my hair, so easy to use. It heats up super fast and it glides over hair smoothly (some straighteners catch your hair from time to time).</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Liked how fast it heated up and the auto shut off.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron.  Works as well as my Chi that cost a lot more money.</li>
    <li> I lost mine and it broke my heart a bit :/ I use a different replacement. This one is great though since you can curl or straighten your hair easily.</li>
    <li> This product has been a good one. I was satisfied with my purchase. I would recommend this product for the price it would be worth your investment.</li>
    <li> Love it... Best delivery ever😆</li>
    <li> Fried my hair, even when set to my normal low temp of 350. The plates are not ceramic, skip this, save your money and buy a Solia or something.</li>
    <li> This iron works great! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just flat ironed my hair its amazinggg</li>
    <li> I had a very expensive flat iron (over $100) that must have had a short in the wiring from the very beginning. I would have to hold the cord in a certain position in order for it to heat up and then it would go off when I put it down.  It was a gift that I received so I didn&#x27;t know where to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, my new one was very inexpensive, heats up quickly, stays hot, and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Got a defective one from Amazon but the one I purchased in a local store works great. Guess it&#x27;s hit or miss like with any product.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, thinner hair. I use this straightener to give my hair an extra curl and volume and it works just as great as something more expensive. I bought one of these three years ago and was happy to replace with the same model. Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome straightener it works very well, I would recommend it. Great price and great product. Better than I expected! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Seriously wish I had bought this years ago. It&#x27;s awesome, heats sooo quickly doen&#x27;t pull my hair at all. It&#x27;s way better than my hot tools!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a couple months and so far so good. Heats up quickly and straightens well. Good for the price, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts...</li>
    <li> I purchased this May 1st of last year. It was a good straightener, but about 2 weeks ago, it died on me. I went with another brand this time, because I don&#x27;t want to have to purchase a new one every year.</li>
    <li> I may marry it because I love it so much! It works fantastic! I had a conair before and did not like it that much. It took too long to straighten my hair and was cheap quality. The Remington worked so fast! It heated it quickly like it stated on the box. There was fast shipping. I would definitely buy one!</li>
    <li> This thing works suprisingly well. I have very thick, shoulder length hair. It takes me less than 10 minutes to straighten my whole head. I&#x27;ve &#x27;test driven&#x27; a number of my friends&#x27; straighteners, but could never bring myself to drop $100+ on such a simple item. This is a FANTASTIC product. The fact that it was under $20? Icing on the cake :)</li>
    <li> One of the ceramic plates is loose and it doesn&#x27;t turn on the blue indicator how my other one used to</li>
    <li> It has many different temperatures and it worked beautifully.  I would definitely buy it again.  My hair&#x27;s really curly and it looks like straw if it&#x27;s straightened wrong, but this was great!</li>
    <li> The wife says its perfect. Went on and on about previous hair straightners that were from from the quality of this. Hair stays straight longer etc. Long story short, she loves it.</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up quickly and works well.  I have had mine for about a year and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is great i love it. I have thick hair and im African American. I was surprise at how well it straightens my hair. My hair lasts longer then a week no matter the weather. With my old flat iron it only lasts a day or two. My only problem is I wish it was a little smaller.</li>
    <li> This straightener gets hot in seconds and straightens my thick hair in minutes. I&#x27;ve never been more pleased with a styling product. My roommate has short hair and she&#x27;s in love with it too! It&#x27;s in great shape after a year of consistent use. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to make their hair stick straight.</li>
    <li> For the price, it worked very well. I have thick Asian hair and it straightened it well but my hair was still wide as opposed to lying more flat. My friend used it who has thinner hair and it left it a little static-y, but nothing a little product couldn&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it&#x27;s 110V but I was able to use it all over Europe without it blowing out. Even if it did, it was inexpensive so not a big loss.</li>
    <li> I purchased this months ago, it has not died on me yet! It works hot and fast! I have really thick, semi-wavy hair and I can straighten my hair with this in about 20 to 30 minutes without getting that dreaded arm cramp. I love it! It also helps that it&#x27;s my favorite color! If you&#x27;re in need of a decent straightener, this one cannot be beat and it is cheap too! Never thought I could get such a great product at the price that I did. Go for it ladies!</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to. I love that you can change the temperature.  It works great even on a low temperature. I&#x27;m happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Decided to buy this product after I used my roommates. Love that I can adjust the heat temp and it flat irons my natural hair great.</li>
    <li> Ive used this quite a lot before reviewing, It works really well, and I have crazy curly hair. The only issue is that it kinda smell bad whenever I turn it on, but its not that big of a deal.</li>
    <li> this product is great. i have purchased 4 of them for friends and family. a must have. nice and hot</li>
    <li> As good as a Chi. My friend had this first, I tried hers &amp; I was sold! Heats up quickly &amp; gets hair perfectly straight without effort</li>
    <li> I love this straightener... It do wonders with my hair I have curly hair and couldn&#x27;t believe it works to straight it. The price is amazing for this product. I recommend this product to my friends and family already.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a hairdresser used one of these on my hair as she cut it.  I had never had my hair straightened I am one of those people that goes and gets the curly perms.  Love how easy this is to use, how quickly it heats up.  I am not one to spend a lot of time on my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t have the smell others talk about and I can also use it for curling my hair - its nice a light, heats fast and gets real hot - can definitely get too hot if not careful about the temperature. For the price, its really unbeatable.</li>
    <li> It arrived in perfect conditions, This is the second I buy just for practicality purposes. My sister has the other one, still in perfect conditions after 3 years. quick and hot, it has never failed us</li>
    <li> Perfect for mylar bags - heats up fast and seals bags well.&lt;br /&gt;Was used on 1-gallon mylar bags to make smaller bags and worked perfect.</li>
    <li> This is actually a good little straightener for the price. It does have a very very strong plastic smell when you first start using it. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t go away but it has already started to and I&#x27;ve had it about 3 weeks. It gets hot quick and is smooth. I was looking for a good cheap straightener and I think I&#x27;ve found it!</li>
    <li> i love this flat iron i bought is over a year ago and it still works perfectly. the only bad thing about this is that it get hot really fast and can burn you if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> This was the first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever purchases 3 years ago. It&#x27;s a great starter for the price. I&#x27;ve bought this as a gift for 2 other people and they said they really enjoy it too. However I stopped using this flat iron because I got annoyed with how much it SNAGS my hair. It gets the job done, but not in a very pleasant way. I would recommend saving the $15 and buying one of the better remington straighteners.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever used! My friends have Chi brand straighteners and they are impressed by this one by Remington when they borrow it. It leaves my hair soft and silky and straightens really quickly. It also heats up impressively fast and has held up after many years of use. I will never buy another brand of straightener again!</li>
    <li> still works after all this years.</li>
    <li> SO IN LOVE WITH THESE THEY STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR SO WELL MOST DEFINITELY WOULD RECCOMEND TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS</li>
    <li> Love the color, it does a good job, I have thin freezy hair and it straightens it well. At the very ends where it is very thin sometimes the hair slips out.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice straightener!  My only wish was that it started at a lower temperature when you hit the power button, but a few small clicks and it&#x27;s perfect.  Does an excellent job and is by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I would give this flat iron a 4.5 if I could. I love it, but it works best for finer hair. It is not the best for really thick hair. It is great for extensions however, and overall gets the job done. I also love the automatic shut off...because I can be be forgetful at times, with my busy schedule.</li>
    <li> it has probally been a year since i bought this it is still working great! its better than the 50 $ ones it heats up and cools down in seconds!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I have the one inch plate one and it works perfect. It starts at 310 degrees and goes up by 20 degrees and has a maximum heat of 410 degrees. It literally heats up in seconds. I bought mine at target for about $15.99 and wanted to see how much amazon was selling it for. Great product!</li>
    <li> It is a really nice Hair Straightener.. For a travel product it is probably the best! It&#x27;s not the same size than a big professional one but it&lt;br /&gt;is not a tiny one too..I also received it very fast less than 2 weeks in Europe</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair straightener. I had bought more expensive ones in the past but none of them compared to this one. It has been quite a while since I bought it but since it was so good I bought once for my niece too and she loves it. It heats up fast and leaves my hair pretty straight pretty fast. Would buy this product again if mine stops working.</li>
    <li> My Chi was getting kind of old and I felt like it was burning my hair so I ordered this one based on the awesome reviews. For $15 how could I go wrong? I think I paid over a hundred for my last straightener. Even though my other straightener is supposed to be solid ceramic and this one is not..there is no noticeable difference! They both glide the same, and I end up with the same results. I like that I can precisely set what temp I want the flat iron set at with the digital dispaly. My more expensive one is a turn knob and not as accurate. I can&#x27;t say how long it will hold up, I&#x27;ve only had it two weeks, but I would definitely order another of these.</li>
    <li> Smelled like a Home Depot store (only way I can describe it) when I first bought it but either I got used to it or it doesn&#x27;t staaank anymore. Heats up faster than any other straightener I have owned and does the job well... works great if you want to use it to curl too (has the correct edges). Love it. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I had a Chi before, but after 7 years, it finally croaked. Not wanting to spend a fortune, I reluctantly went with this one, and was pleasantly surprised! Works great, even on my thick, unruly hair.</li>
    <li> My CHI straightener that I had for about 10 years finally died (it had a short in it). I came here to look for a new straightener and of course, there were many that had high ratings and were going to cost and arm and a leg. I ran across this straightener and it had fantastic ratings and reviews and only cost about $15. I was very skeptical! Surely you get what you pay for!! But I was wrong and so  glad I took the chance! This straightener works wonders! I have fairly straight hair to begin with but it has a lot of body and frizz, so I use a straightener to help calm it down. This works wonderfully! You can adjust the temperature on it so if you have thin or thick hair, you aren&#x27;t stuck with one temperature. It is small, light and the cord twists 360 degrees! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is simple great. It&#x27;s everything you expect from a hair straightener (and I&#x27;ve have had a LOT of them): warms in seconds, you are ready in about 10 minutes even if you have rebel hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and leaves it shinny and great! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve paid like 60 or 70 dollars for other products because this one is just everything I need.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair so I use a larger flat iron for straightening, but this one would be great for people with normal to thinner hair. I use it for curling and it works amazing.</li>
    <li> Probably the best straightener I have ever used.  I have a really expensive one that does not work that well.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Worked well until it didn&#x27;t. I bought this because my best friend had it and I loved how quickly it straightened, but when I bought one myself it failed after a couple of months of LIGHT use. If you get this, it&#x27;s a toss up of how it&#x27;ll hold up.</li>
    <li> good quality and service</li>
    <li> Great size. Heats up quickly. Straightens hair quickly.</li>
    <li> I have purchased really expensive straightening irons and by far this was the best one I&#x27;ve owned and has been the cheapest. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am a Remington fan, it&#x27;s a great quality hair straighter for a reasonable price. I love it! I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Well this product didn&#x27;t take a long time to come it took maybe almost a month. This is an ok straightener, their isn&#x27;t too much to say about it. It&#x27;s a good price for the product. I dnt use it up to 400 but if you like having no hair then be my guest. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend I would say it should be required to use heat protectant ALOT of it. Because you don&#x27;t want to fry your hair! This product gets very hot within a few seconds. The only thing I hate about it is that u can&#x27;t curl your hair with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it - this iron felt cheap and flimsy - my hair caught in the plates, and it was difficult to pack because it doesn&#x27;t come with a case or sack or anything. Also, I&#x27;m pretty sure I was sold a refurbished model because it didn&#x27;t come in a box - just a plastic bag with instructions.</li>
    <li> I hated using a flat iron I was all thumbs. But, this one oh my goodness (smile). I fined my hair in 30 min.setting the temp was great, it is light to handle( that is a plus).start with a low temp and work your way up . You can&#x27;t go wrong.and the price : ) ; )</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s cheap. So don&#x27;t expect too much of it. I got this for traveling and it meets my purpose. Just make sure you use good heat protecting spray before you use this tool or it will burn the ends of hair badly.</li>
    <li> I really love this straightener. It heats up fast and is pretty inexpensive. It&#x27;s slim so I can easily store it without a bunch of clutter. I am not disappointed with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is so awesome. It does not burn your hair. Your hair is shiny and healthy after use. and it reduces the need to pass it multiple times which saves from heat damage.!</li>
    <li> I used to own a chi iron but stopped flat ironing my hair for years so I gave it to a family member. I bought this cheap flat iron because I wanted a hair straightener but didn&#x27;t care if it didn&#x27;t straighten my hair \\&quot;perfect.\\&quot; Well, forget that, because it DOES! It&#x27;s so funny too because I had it on the lowest setting: 310 and yet it still straightened my hair exactly like the CHI iron! Seriously, BUY THIS! I can&#x27;t even say how great this iron is. Even the fact that you can adjust the heat temperature is a plus. I have very thick, unmanageable hair and yet still the lowest setting worked great for me. The more expensive irons do not have temperature control and basically fry your hair. And like I said, there&#x27;s no point in getting those because this at the lowest setting, worked just as good for me. Also remember to flat iron small amounts of hair at a time. I&#x27;m so happy with this iron!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for 4 years now and I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have this for 2 years now or maybe more, and this is the best Hair Straightener ever. It gets hot in a second and the hair will come out really nice. This is very durable and a pretty color. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> The best $15 I&#x27;ve ever spent! I haven&#x27;t straightened my hair much until recently when I got bangs. I was looking to replace my giant dinosaur of a straightener from years ago that didn&#x27;t work so well on the short hairs of my new fringe. I was wary of buying such a cheap product, but I have Prime and figured if it doesn&#x27;t work, I can return it. I&#x27;ve been so pleased with this Remington. It heats up wicked fast, and I like the temperature controls and the swivel cord. So far, absolutely no complaints. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple months and usually use it only on my bangs, so we&#x27;ll see how long it holds up. But for the price, I don&#x27;t see why I would get a different one.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great product. It heats up quick and straightens well.Sometimes my hair is a bit frizzy after using this, but product helps that.</li>
    <li> For the price, this definitely does a good job.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is the best out there but I am content with the value.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re curly haired like me.. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend you this- only with the exception that you are looking for something quick and cheap. The highest heat setting it has is 425 degrees Fahrenheit but this still does not work as good as some straighteners. My curly hair does get straightened but it also gets frizzy easily  no matter how hot I put the iron or how many times I pass it through my hair. The only thing I really do like about this straightener is that it&#x27;s thin and has a clip at the bottom that hold the straightener shut.</li>
    <li> Only used it 2 times on a very low setting and it smells like your hair is burning. Please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> works wonders for my thick hair and also for my friend&#x27;s super thick and wavy hair !!! great buy for the price...</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it because of the price but I was pleased when it arrived. Love the digital readout. It&#x27;s salon quality with lightning speed heat-up time. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I am usually hesitant with products like this, but I am beyond pleased with this product! My hair usually takes about an hour to straighten and when I tried it out, it took me ten minutes. TEN MINUTES! Remington does not disappoint, I am very happy with my purchase! :)</li>
    <li> Ok so I bought this flat iron last year and I hadn&#x27;t started straightening my hair until then. When I used it I thought it was amazing because I wasn&#x27;t used to my hair straight. Now most of the time I look at myself in the mirror and my hair is not straight hardly at all. I used my friends straightener and it stayed pin straight all day and night. I suggest you use a chi, solia, or palladium. They are much better. My friends flat iron was a palladium I definetely recommend it that to you.</li>
    <li> LOVE,LOVE,LOVE it!It&#x27;s really fast to heat up and as soon as I turn it on I can start using it! Amazing, great and for so cheap! All my friends have more expensive one&#x27;s and they think mine is better! Love it! I can do it in less the 10 minutes and it looks great! Buy IT!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener in a pinch.  My old one died and I needed a new one to fill in until I had time to shop for a new one. (and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money).  I was pleasantly surprised at the results from this product.  It worked really well to straighten my thick, wavy hair.  It worked so well, I won.t need to find time to shop for another one.  I will continue to use this one</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up quickly and works really well with no damage to my hair. Really couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> Works great!! I love Remington straighteners! It&#x27;s the only ones I will use. Has a weird smell when you first use it but after it goes away. Overall GREAT.</li>
    <li> When I first bought it, I was hesitant. I&#x27;m a girl who loves CHI and since my CHI had broken I decided to find a temporarily straightener. I found this reasonable and cute so I went ahead and ordered it. Now when I received it I didn&#x27;t believe it would last past a month, but I was so wrong. I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a while now and let me say I&#x27;m so happy with it. I haven&#x27;t purchased a CHI because this really does a lot. I love it, especially the straightening. It heats up fast and it straightens hair perfectly. I have long hair so making curls with a straightener is difficult, but this flat iron is thin and easy to use and it makes the job so much easier and efficient. I bought the same straightener for my sister as a birthday gift and she&#x27;s just as happy as I am. &lt;3</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair too much, but I&#x27;ve had this one for the past two years, and I must say that this gets the job done. I have tex-laxed and natural textures and with the ability to change temperatures, I&#x27;m very happy. Usually I use a low setting of 200 degrees and curl my hair with it after blowdrying, and it gives me great body and wonderful results without snagging or anything.</li>
    <li> I cant believe the quality of this inexpensive straightener. I spent 5 times as much on my last iron.. never again.</li>
    <li> I would say this product is worth investing in.&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quick and has a smooth effect on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! It&#x27;s works really great especially for the price. It is exactly the way it looks in the picture and does exactly what it claims to do in the description. I have very thick, Italian - Puerto Rican hair which can be difficult to manage at times and can be a pain in the butt to straighten as well. I have bought a couple of expensive straighteners but they always seem to &amp;#34; disappear &amp;#34; at my sisters&#x27; or mom&#x27;s house and it&#x27;s starting to take a toll on my wallet. I decided to get one a little cheaper this time and it turns out that it was a great investment. I would definitely recommend this straightener to people with hair like mine and even fine - haired people like my sister.</li>
    <li> I have very long straight hair, but if I haven&#x27;t showered one day, or if I leave my hair in a bun overnight, it will get little kinks and flips that just don&#x27;t look polished. This is my quick fix for that! Love it, and at least when I got it, it was such a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. When I plug it in, it takes just a short time to warm up, and then I can use it on my hair. I typically set it to the lowest setting (330 degrees), but it can go as high as 400 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is sleek and shiny now. Even got a compliment from my fiance yesterday!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my neice. She loved it and I liked all the extras that came with it. Like the temp control, the elf shut off if its left on, and the swivel cord so it won&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a high quality flat-iron and this was not it. Its pretty standard. I think conair flat-irons are better but you get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t use this on my natural hair but works great on my extensions which are much longer. The hottest it gets is 410 and the plates are floating.</li>
    <li> I have had the same straightener for the past 10 years and i dont know why i waited so long.  Weird plastic smell (expected) when it heats up but has the LED adjustable temperature and gets hot FAST.</li>
    <li> It has the potential to be a good product, but I think my hair was just too wild for it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! Heats fast and works great! I&#x27;ve used so many different hair straighteners from expensive to cheap brands. This is definitely my #1 favorite!</li>
    <li> My friends have flat irons that cost 10 times this much, but this is absolutely perfect. I do have fine hair but it tends toward frizzy, especially in the humid summer, and using this for one minute throughout my hair after blowdrying keeps it smooth and silky all day. Love it! And you cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> IT makes kind of a funny smell the first time i used it but it want away. It never pulls out my hair or anything its super nice;.</li>
    <li> I was nervous after other reports of odor.  I am very picky to odors, but I am not bothered that when this is on, I can smell it.  It&#x27;s a safety feature for forgetful me.  It works well, was quite affordable, easy to use, and it can be adjusted for temps.</li>
    <li> Love this, works awesome on my coarse hair!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair and unfortunately it did not grasp the strands tightly.  Slid right off my hair!  One of my daughters was able to use it on her thick, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Works great on my thick head of fine hairs. I keep the temp around 370. Definitely love the price too!</li>
    <li> Idk why people like this, but personally I don&#x27;t. I like how cheap it is but the quality is horrible. It&#x27;s rough so it doesn&#x27;t flow nicely when you try to straighten your hair. I have to buy another one so basically I wasted money. Don&#x27;t waste your money, just spend a little more and buy another straightener worth your money.</li>
    <li> I do not usually write reviews but I am quite disappointed by Amazon&#x27;s frequent mistakes.  This is a good flat iron and I would recommend it to anyone that is not looking for a dual voltage flat iron.  I was looking for a dual voltage flat iron and first purchased the HSI.  When it arrived it seemed in bad and used condition and I suspected that it was fake, so I returned it.  When you search for dual voltage on Amazon, the Remington S5500 appears the 4th in the list so I ordered it.  The one that arrived was 120V and not dual voltage.  I contacted customer service and said this is not dual voltage and they sent me a replacement which was the exact same one with the first 120V Remington that I received.  I call Amazon customer service again asking what is going on and the customer representative who did not know what dual voltage means starts lecturing me to return the Remingtons, pay extra money and buy an HSI even though I have told him that I have already ordered and returned it.  The quality of Amazon and customer service has been rapidly decreasing and even though I loved shopping from Amazon I am planning on not purchasing anything from them. Too many mistakes with orders and rude customer service.</li>
    <li> This is a great sturdy flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair. This flat iron takes care of the kinks and coils. It gives me greater results than my $100 flat iron. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome! !! Love it money  well spent</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, and was skeptical just b/c for the price they seemed too good to be true, but this thing is legit. I had bought this b/c I had left my chi at a friends&#x27; and wasn&#x27;t going to get it back for a few weeks. Needed something for the interim. I just got my chi back (older model) and threw it out. This thing is fantastic. I sleep with my hair in a bun. Took out my bun this morning with hair creases everywhere. One run through w/ the straightener, 2 minutes later, it&#x27;s perfect. BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> This product works really well! Really good quality flat iron for a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Perfect. Great price, great size. It was a gift and she loved it so much. 100% recomended. The only thing was that the box was too big for it.</li>
    <li> It works amazing especially for those hot sweregret ita ty days. I recommend people to by this you wont they</li>
    <li> this straightener states that it is anti static, actually it creastes more statics than before it is used. and the handles get burning hot, its impossible for my hands to take the heat.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and was a bit skeptical... But after purchasing a $400 straightener that sucked and broke, I decided this was the best 15 bucks ever spent! Will curl your hair like the spendy ones!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron i ever owned. Is exactly as advertised. I love it. Thanx</li>
    <li> This flat iron does not stay on or stay hot. Makes is very difficult and frustrating to flat iron my hair!!!</li>
    <li> The smell is disgusting.  Tried to use it several times to determine if it was just a &amp;#34;new product smell&amp;#34; that would go away, but it seems here to stay.Have to throw this away.</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered this, love how adjustable the temperature is!  Doesn&#x27;t rip at your hair while straightening either. Great quality.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter and she loved it</li>
    <li> It worked really well at first, (heated up nicely, made my hair smooth, etc.), but it completely stopped working after about a month. I didn&#x27;t drop it or anything like that, it just pooped out. It&#x27;s not a terrible gamble since it&#x27;s so cheap but it was a bummer for me for sure.</li>
    <li> It works great on my short hair, it gets hot fast, and I love the color of it!</li>
    <li> I have damaged, wavy hair. This straightens it quickly and completely without adding any more visible damage. I can get ready in about 10 minutes if my hair already dry. I love it.</li>
    <li> Does great on my hair.  Had to get 2.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as she needed a new straightener. It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t damage the hair too much. Overall very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> This did a good job straightening my hair, but it didn&#x27;t stay that way for long.  It does glide through my hair very easily and is comfortable to hold.  I just wish it actually kept my hair straight.</li>
    <li> If used properly, product does what it is supposed to do as stated. It is light, slightly rounded at the edges which makes a bobbed look easier. On/off light  and  temperature reading, instead of just flashing lights, are good features. I was actually looking at units for around $100 but, as it was Christmas decided to try this for now and if it was not a good product I could replace it later. But, unless this unit breaks down I have no need to do so. I would mention that I have fairly fine hair but a lot of it. I cannot speak to anyone who has coarse or extremely curly hair.</li>
    <li> i just wanted something cheap and will straighten my hair. This does it. Granted I don&#x27;t do it too often so I don&#x27;t know the long term affect of what this product can do to your hair.</li>
    <li> I returned it, was terrible my worst experience, that&#x27;s what happens when you buy cheap things, the wire has the worst quality it broke the first day i used it. the iron was good, but for the same price i could one better.</li>
    <li> Im really dissapointed that within only a few months this has sh*t the bed. It now turns off on it&#x27;s own and flickers on and off as the cord rotates. Not safe. And it will only stay on for a few seconds. Can&#x27;t use it at all. Worked great while it lasted...just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this straightener from amazon, I actually got it from target and this is an awesome straightener I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great, it greats very hot. I have pretty easy hair, it just gets a little kink in the back and this takes care if that. no snagging at all, great for the price.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I was disappointed this was not dual voltage, as I travel for work and needed that. It also seems too hot for my fine hair. Instead of silky and smooth, my hair looks dry. I&#x27;ll look to buy a better one at a higher price and disappointed that the vast majority of reviews were so positive while my experience was not.</li>
    <li> First off I have African American hair, which sometime is a pain to style. This does what it says it straightens and can curl the ends a little. Had more expectations for it but oh well.</li>
    <li> well, properly Iam not happy with the product, but My girlfriend&#x27;s mother loves this Hair Straightener, now it takes more time to get ready!!</li>
    <li> So, I read someone&#x27;s review and they said it was &amp;#34;great for traveling&amp;#34;, and I really wanted a straighter that I could bring with me to work so I bought it. I thought it was going to be one of the tiny ones I see at the mall kiosks. Totally not. It&#x27;s full size. I paid about $15 which is pretty awesome. It works great! I had another &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; straightener that I&#x27;d been using for a while and paid waaaay more for, but this one works just as great. I ended up giving that other one away since I&#x27;d had it for a few years. I also love that this straightener has an LED screen that lets you adjust the temperature. Definite plus. And another small feature is that you can lock it shut. I love that! Takes up way less space and makes it easier to put away for sure. If you&#x27;re looking for a straightener that gets the job done well and is inexpensive, you&#x27;ve found it!</li>
    <li> works great, i do have straight hair to begin with though.  this heats ups extermely quickly and cools down quickly too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this straightener for a few months now and have been very happy with the results. The lowest temperature setting is good enough for me to get my hair styled. By far, there have been no damage from the heat to my hair. It is reasonably priced and light/small enough for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I use this almost every alternate day and can&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
    <li> I love to try new products and do often.  Which is why I usually have at least two hair dryers, irons, etc. at all times (plus it is always nice to have a backup).  Needless to say, I have tried my fair share of irons and have paid good money for them.  The Remington iron is by far my favorite.  This thing really heats up and does a wonderful job in one swipe.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works very well. It heats quickly and gets very hot. Great size for short hair and convenient for traveling.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work being so cheap and all, but I needed a new one, and couldn&#x27;t spend much on one, reviews were good, so decided to give it a shot. It works great! I don&#x27;t have long hair (little past my shoulders) or too crazy hair, but still it would take me about 8-10 mins with other ones to get it right, and I&#x27;m a mom, I don&#x27;t have that much time to do my hair, and honestly, I don&#x27;t WANT to spend my time on that. With this, I am done within 3 minutes, INCLUDING heatup time! It&#x27;s fantastic :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about 6 months and it&#x27;s held up well to being dropped frequently (I&#x27;m clumsy...) and it heats up very fast. You can adjust the heat but not as much as I&#x27;d like. It ranges from 310-370 degrees and even at 310 it still will fry my hair if I don&#x27;t put a TON of protector in. I have thin hair that gets damaged easily thought so I&#x27;m not sure this would be a problem for most people. It would definitely be 5 stars if I could just turn the heat down a little more. I&#x27;d still highly recommend it regardless, you can&#x27;t find better for a comparable price.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely thick and extremely curly and quite frizzy and just overall untameable. Hair straighteners and hair products only work about half the time, and the hair straightener I had before this refused to actually straighten my hair. This one is fairly cheap, and works quite well for the price. It straightens my hair and it&#x27;ll stay that way until I get it wet, even on humid days. It doesn&#x27;t work so well on wet hair, but with dry hair straightening is a breeze.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  It is the right width for me and I love the variable temperature. I also like the auto-off feature so if I do forget to turn it off, I don&#x27;t have to worry.  Last but not least, it&#x27;s purple!!</li>
    <li> it works with my hair. Yes, there is a burned plastic smell. but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> When I first got this straightener, I&#x27;ll admit I was a bit worried because it was a 1 in. one and was only $15. It came pretty quickly, and works great! You can straighten more hair at a time with this one. And It goes up to 410 degrees F. Once you plug it in and turn it on, out it on the heat setting you want, and wait. It flashes until it&#x27;s completely heated up to the temp. you want. If you put your hand on the medal after five seconds LITERALLY FIVE SECONDS, you will burn the crap out of your hand! Heats up quick! I definitely recommend this for you, or as a gift! I&#x27;m amazed, and very satisfied! Only problem is there is a slight odor when you plug it in the first couple times. It doesn&#x27;t really smell bad, just odd. :)</li>
    <li> This flat iron does wonders. I&#x27;m natural so it flat irons my curls out and my roots. If I flat iiron my weave it takes no time. Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> ever since i bought the blow dryer and wand i just had to try the hair strainer and guess what im in love</li>
    <li> I have spent a great deal of money on flat irons in the past, only to be disappointed within a month or two. My flat iron is a daily appliance at my place. So I initially picked up this guy at Target for about twenty five bucks. No issues for about a year and a half, then the led display that showed the temperature started to go out. So I looked on Amazon and found the same unit for ten bucks less. Picked it up, and kept it sealed in the box for another three months while waiting for my unit to die. When it eventually did, I tossed it and opened this guy. Super happy. It&#x27;s compact, so when I do travel it fits well amongst my clothing. It&#x27;s purple, which is a huge plus to me. And it heats up WELL. It certainly has surpassed units that I&#x27;ve spent double my initial cost on. Very happy and will continue to buy this product for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> This does the job very well. It takes only a few seconds to heat up and straightens quickly. recommend it highly</li>
    <li> It is Amazing I love my hair straightener I use it to curl my hair it works beyond good and paid great price</li>
    <li> It gets your hair so soft and thin. and you can use it to curl , and the heat can get really high so i would reccomend a heat protectant!</li>
    <li> Causes more static than the last one.  Now I just use a hair smoothing serum to  keep the static down. Sometimes you can&#x27;t win.</li>
    <li> I have a $120 straightener and this Remington beats it. You can adjust the heat, so you can minimize the damage to your hair, but the biggest plus is that is does not snag your hair, and it gets the job done nicely. I&#x27;m impressed, and I would repurchase this item.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great. It heats up very quickly, very easy to use. I would recommend this product. This  is a great addition to your other hair products</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. It&#x27;s great for natural African American hair. And it&#x27;s light weight. It&#x27;s gets my hair bone straight</li>
    <li> My wife used a hair straightener at our daughters house and she wanted one.  We purchased this item and she is very happy with how it works.  It is very easy to set the controls and it does exactly what she wants it to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned some pretty expensive straighteners, and this one surpases all of them. Heats up fast, works great. Amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> This seriously heated up in less 30 seconds all the way to 410 degrees. This little thing is insane once heated I went to straight my hair and flip on the ends and it left a big crease. I then turned it down and it worked great after that. Keep it in a lower heat and gradually turn up.</li>
    <li> I have had this iron for almost one year. This iron straightens my natural, coily, kinky hair with one pull through. This iron is A-1 over my FHI, Babyliss Pro, &amp; NuMe flat irons (all of which I own) due the easy of navigating throughout my head and how secure it feels in my hand. This iron is pennies compared to how easy it will make curling or flat ironing your hair after just one use. This iron could easily be $100 in my opinion because it is just that awesome. I gave it four stars because it takes awhile now of constantly pressing the on button before the iron turns on. I do not know if that means it is on the fritz or what but I sure hope not. Also like other reviews states there was a burning smell in the beginning after the first few uses. It has since subsided. Also this thing gets hot on the outside so wear a glove if you have it on the highest heat which is 410 degrees.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant ordering a $15 straightener considering my CHI had lasted a full 8 years on me and I was putting off buying another one so much that I was curling my hair everyday so I could put some money aside for those $120 monsters. Finally, I tired of curling my hair everyday for a month and decided $15 wasn&#x27;t too much of a loss if this straightenered turned out to be a bust. To my delight, this straightener is AWESOME. It works better than my CHI, which is saying a lot considering I have thick and long blonde hair and am very hair-conscious. I am very happy with the result thus far- will update if anything changes!!</li>
    <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for! Cost conscious and effective! I have naturally (mostly straight) hair, so this works well! Bravo!</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair, so i&#x27;m generally too lazy to straighten it because it takes forever and doesn&#x27;t often work. When I got this straightener, I started straightening much more frequently! The straightener gets hot quickly and actually works. and it&#x27;s affordable too. :)</li>
    <li> I Had to purchase another flat iron , as my old one broke , totally my fault, but this is so much better, it heats up fast, and seems to straighten better than the &amp;#34; Andis&amp;#34; I purchased, in a way I am glad the other one broke, lol</li>
    <li> Best best BEST hair straightener. Always go ceramic!!!! It protects my hair, never degrades, and cools/heats really quickly. I love this product and I use it daily (With heat protection of course!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can even use it to curl your hair. Go to youtube and look up different methods. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I like having less hardware in my bathroom if I can, and this can do both really well.</li>
    <li> This straightener works well. It is hard to get a good straightener without spending a fortune, but I got a great deal on this one &amp; it works great. It gets VERY hot, a lot more so than others I&#x27;ve had. I got this probably a year ago &amp; continue to use it almost every day.</li>
    <li> Product is totally great, works well, just as expected, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor flaw is I wish it had a better bottom surface so that it would stand on the counter better when you place it down. It always topples over easily when I put it down and I don&#x27;t like the thought of hot plates sitting right on the counter, they could melt it/burn it. So it&#x27;s difficult to balance it upright while cooling down after using it and before putting it away.</li>
    <li> Works great. Heats up fast! Love the temp gauge and how you can turn it up or down depending on desired temp. This is my first flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good straightener.It straightened my hair the first time I used it. I used to have one of those pricey straighteners with the steam vents for straightening your hair when it&#x27;s wet, but it always ended up frying my hair even if it wasn&#x27;t wet. This one you can&#x27;t do that, you have to completely dry your hair (obviously). I just really like the plates because they run through your hair smoothly and it heats up in less than 2 minutes. I wish the cord was a little longer, but then again I move halfway across my room when I straighten my hair so it&#x27;s really just personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I got this product shipped today. I bought it because I needed a straightner for my thin hair - by thin hair i mean the strands are very fine. If you have fine hair like me, you know that you use low heat settings and avoid having the straightner on your hair for too long. So the reviews where people with really curly hair that needed high setting was not very helpful to me. But I think this straightner is great - I just tried it. The fact that it does not slide as smoothly is due to the texture of the ceramic plates but I think that might be a good thing. At the end I still had moisture in my hair but it was straighter and looked good. Basically, I have used other straightners which give me the feeling that my hair received too much heat or the strands looked thinner at the end. Not with this one - it does less damage and the low setting is good. It is very light so a plus for carrying around and it is simple and easy to use. I would definitely get it. More reason to get is that even if it is not better than more expensive ones, it is comparable and definitely worth the price. I have ended up buying expensive hair tools that don&#x27;t offer much more.</li>
    <li> Its a really good product, it did work on my hair but not that well (blame on my thick hair). And I like how convenient it is with the heat control and 30 sec heat up.</li>
    <li> First time owner of a flat iron. It works really well on most of my frizz. I use it at a very low setting, 350, although it says to use it on a higher setting for my hair. It does sometimes cause steam, but that is usually if my hair is mildly damp (no damage though). Love that it isn&#x27;t heavy too heavy to be hung by a command hook (midsize, use the cord in a sort of hammock fashion to hang it).</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! I used to have a straightener that cost $100 and this works just as well. It kind of leaves a burnt smell though on your hair which lingers a bit but isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
    <li> It works just fine, but a major turn down for me is how the hair glides through the straightener. It does not glide easy and I feel like im tugging on my hair.</li>
    <li> I never understood why people spent hundreds on straighteners I feel this does just as good of a job. I have waist length hair, not too heavy but not that thin either. It heats up quickly and reduces frizz as well and i&#x27;m done with my styling fairly fast.</li>
    <li> fast. affordable, smooth. love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought multiple just to have in different locations! Love it! Heats up really fast, love the self-shut off after a period of time, and I love the range in temps to choose from!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the straightener is amazing. And the price than Walmart. I bought a 30 dollar straightener from there it was terrible but this straightener for 15 works wonders on my frizzy hair. Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> This works well, but I always burn my fingers on it.  Too hot and dangerous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a CHI for years, it&#x27;s been through a lot and I&#x27;ve had to replace the plug, but it finally died.  I needed something ASAP and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.  I saw great reviews on this and thought, worst case scenario, it can be a back up after I find a professional straightener.  I&#x27;ve had it for months now and it stinks every time it heats up, which is not that big of a deal, I guess.  It gets hot really fast, but it puts a lot of static in my hair and leaves it stringy and limp.  It feels pretty cheap, but.. it IS cheap, so I didn&#x27;t expect much.  If you have more money to spend, spend it.  I&#x27;m looking for a replacement and this will sit in the closet just in case the nice one craps out like my CHI did.</li>
    <li> Has stopped working after very short time on two different irons</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried several (ranging in price between $15- $80) and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used! I&#x27;ve even had some friends use it and say it better than their $200 ones! It heats up quickly (about 45 seconds to a minute depending on heat level) and maintains the heat. It glides over the hair well and leaves a very silky smooth finish. I am Caucasian but have relatively thick hair and can get it all done in about 10 minutes.  Love this product and love the price! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I barely flat iron my hair, maybe a few times each month. And this has done the job just fine.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this straightener is. I have waist-length spiral curls and with this straightener I can get my hair straight in less than ten minutes. It took me over an hour with my previous straightener. I once had a man do a demonstration of a hair straightener on my hair at the mall. His straightener was a few hundred dollars and nowhere near as good as this one. This is the best straightener for any price, it&#x27;s insane it is so cheap!</li>
    <li> Great product just found 3 days later cheaper at walmart...</li>
    <li> I really liked this product! I bought it to straighten my bangs! It works really well and heats up to 410F but you can adjust it to lower if you wish. The only thing that bothers me is I have to press the on button a little hard to turn it on sometimes! It always turns on I just have to put a little push in it every once in a while. Other than that the straightener is great and heats up very well and quickly.</li>
    <li> The first (and only) time I used this I noticed a strange buzzing sound. Then it just turned off. I really needed to finish the other part of my hair, so I turned it back on. This time I watched the cord while I turned the iron, and sure enough when the cord moved the scary electric buzzing came back. To make it worse, the plates don&#x27;t come together properly except at the very back, and if I run my hair through the back, it snags. I have been straightening my hair for over 10 years, and this is the worst iron I have ever used. I hope Target takes it back.</li>
    <li> This is such an inexpensive product for what it is capable of. It heats up quickly and looks pretty. As a disclaimer I do have pretty tame-able hair so I am not sure if this will work for heavier straightening jobs. I also use it to curl my hair and it does a good job of creating waves to my liking.</li>
    <li> So far so good- my only criticism is that the cord is already totally twisted. The iron works well at the lowest temo 310.</li>
    <li> No complaints for the price.  I still get static though..</li>
    <li> corresponde a lo comprado muy bueno</li>
    <li> last one lasted 10yrs!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for me</li>
    <li> love love love love love!!!  It does a great job at straighting and curling my hair.  I am so happy I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy as well i love for my hair to be straight so I flat iron it alot and this will make sure your hair is looking good.  I have very course hair and it is hard to straight so I really need a flat iron that heats well and this one will.  you will have really smooth finish</li>
    <li> It already broke. Only 3 months in. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because of the price (i got it Prime for $14). I absolutly love it!! I have thick curly hair and I have a hard time strightening my hair usually. This straightener heated up fast and made my hair silky and shinny. I do not straighten my hair everyday, but when I do I hate it when it turns out frizzy. I have never had my hair stick to this straightener. I really recommend this for any hair types!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 months and i find it pretty good.My hair is very long and curly  and the flat surface of the straightener fits  my hair perfectly and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair or dry out my hair  and i can finish my straightening job in 10 minutes.Also it heats up very fast and the temperature control is easy to handle.Plus,my hair retains the straightened texture for at least two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it does a pretty reasonable straightening job, i have to use it again and again and again to make my hair perfectly and flawlessly straight.But for the above rates, this straightener does a good job when compared to many others available in the market at higher rates.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a simple straightener, i thinked better!  the first few times I used it smelled of plastic, but after a month and a half the smell is starting to disappear-or is it just my nose that is abbituando smell?</li>
    <li> I like the following about this awesome machine:&lt;br /&gt;Color, purple&lt;br /&gt;Heat, very powerful&lt;br /&gt;Light, in weight&lt;br /&gt;Price price price !!</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few months ago and it&#x27;s great! It heats up very quickly and works perfectly. It does have a weird plastic burning smell, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair and I just wanted something to help style it when I&#x27;m having a bad hair day. This works great. I always use it on the lowest setting. This is probably too small if you have thick or curly hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of straighteners and this one is my favorite! I love that I can select the temp I want. Great for straightening and curling hair. Turns out perfect every time and holds all day:)</li>
    <li> This heats up lightening fast.  Have used it a few times per week for a month.  Seems to be sturdy.</li>
    <li> This came really fast which I am happy with :) it also got my hair really straight and it gets hot really fast the only thing I dislike though is the smell it&#x27;s like a burnt smell other than that I like this straightener.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener from a Target for about 20$ I&#x27;ve had it for almost 5 years and it still looks brand new the color is nice, it does everything perfect the only thing that hasn&#x27;t belt up is the white ink symbles on the buttons those are completely gone. But it is fine with me. If your looking for a good straightener then you&#x27;ve found one. The only reason I give it four stars is my hair does seem to crack up quickly after use.</li>
    <li> It works almost as well as my Chi. My only problems was it didn&#x27;t curl as well and had a higher propensity for creasing, both can be fixed with practice.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced my straightener in years. Almost ten to be exact. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to buy as mine had finally kicked the bucket. I decided to go with this and I love it. After using it, I discovered my old one hadn&#x27;t been heating up properly since I was expecting to have the same problems straightening my hair. Not a problem with this one. This heats up fast and a few quick swipes through my hair and I&#x27;m done. Others have commented on the weird smell and that goes away after a few uses. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the auto shut off. I&#x27;m good at turning it off but I always worry later on if I really did turn it off. No more worrying!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Heats up almost instantly, straightens my hair really well and really quickly.  I would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Kinda low-budget and feels a bit like it&#x27;s ripping my hair when I use it.  Ok for an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; straightener but not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected...works good. Good product for the price. Not as nice as my expensive straightener, but it gets the job done with minimal snagging. Also nice color purple.</li>
    <li> Seems the strighetner is brilliant, but I couldn&#x27;t check how it works. It&#x27;s smooth, lighteight and stylish. But it works only on 100 Watt (US system). But I bought it to use in Europe, with our 220 Volt electicity system. Of course I read the instruction and was afraid to turn it on. Very sorry I couldn&#x27;t use such beautiful product.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well, I am happy with the purchase, obviously not as FANTASTIC as the higher grade straighteners, but well worth the money</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a colleague who loves to go by the hairdresser to flat iron her hair...we thought why not?? just buy her one</li>
    <li> Gettings your hair really straight and gets really hot really fast best I ever had.  If your looking for good flat irons for cheap these are the best</li>
    <li> I just bought a second one of these, as we wore out the first one&#x27;s power button.  I tried a couple others, including the wet to dry straightener, and the Remington Silk flat iron.  I returned the silk after a month when the nonstick coating starting coming off, and I don&#x27;t use the wet to dry because it pulls hair.  This straightener has a nice long iron area, and the floating plate ensures  even and firm hold of the hair while straightening.  My daughter is biracial (black and white), and we use it on her hair as well as my own (I&#x27;m white).  Her hair turns out beautiful, without pulling, and with just one or two strokes to get it straight.  I highly recommend.  It&#x27;s simple, hot enough, smooths without pulling, what more do we need?  I just love it!</li>
    <li> After using an old flat iron for many years, I decided it was time for an upgrade &amp; I got this one after seeing it offered at a great price as a Warehouse Deal.  Overall, I really like it compared to my old flat iron.  It heats up pretty quickly &amp; though it is small, it straightens hair quickly as well.  It left my hair silky smooth, not fried, and I also like that it has a button to lock it closed.  It has an auto shut off feature, which is nice, but I wish there was a light to indicate when it was on/ready to use also.  My only complaint is when you plug it in, you still need to turn on the power button, and if you want the max heat, you need to hit the heat button up a few times- I wish it would just automatically go to the highest setting, but it&#x27;s not too big of a deal.  I tried to curl with it, and it seems to do ok, but I haven&#x27;t really experimented much in that dept. yet.  I would recommend if you &#x27;re looking for a good, inexpensive flat iron.</li>
    <li> Perfect straightener, good price</li>
    <li> Heats up sufficiently and quickly. I use it for straightening and curling. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I mainly iron my bangs, and sometimes the top of my hair since I have naturally wavy hair. This iron heats up quick, and it gets hot! I usually go up only once on the temperature because of how hot this thing can get! Good value for the price, only downside I can think of is that sometimes I want to grab the tip of the iron to twist my hair and there&#x27;s almost no space to grab this without getting burned. Other than that, I can&#x27;t think of any reason not to buy this. Also, just for reference, I purchased this in April of this year, and so far its been working just fine.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!  I can let my long hair air dry and then flat iron it in about 20min.  It goes up to 370degrees.  I use 350 and it works great!</li>
    <li> Years ago my friend bought me the GHD 1-inch classic styler as a gift.  She told me it was the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;.  Throughout the years I&#x27;ve used it here and there because I know these tools are damaging.  My hair is straight but tends to get wavy underneath so occasionally I like the super-sleek look.  One thing for sure the GHD straightener was way too hot.  I really didn&#x27;t like the fact you couldn&#x27;t control the temperature.  I would often turn it on and use it immediately before it had the chance to heat up...otherwise my hair literally became so hot I couldn&#x27;t handle it.  Also, that heat would inevitably create frizz because the underneath of my hair would get so hot and I would sweat and then humidity would do its wonder.  Forget trying to use that thing on a warm day or when I was rushing to head out.  I would always end up with frizzy fly-aways.  And forget trying to use it to create curls.  The steam coming off it would always burn me and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get more than one rotation without stopping.  But like I said, I don&#x27;t use these tools often so for what it was it worked and I held on to it for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving forward, I recently just cut my hair chin length.  Now that it&#x27;s growing out and starting to hit my shoulders it&#x27;s doing that weird flip-out thing in different directions.  I tried using my old GHD on it but being such a short length I felt it was frying my hair more than ever.  I wasn&#x27;t going to drop a lot of money on something and of course knew Amazon would steer me in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I purchased the Remington Cermanic Hair Straightener!  For under $15 I honestly didn&#x27;t care what the few bad reviews said or how well of a job it did.  And to be perfectly honest - I love it so much more than my &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; GHD straightener.  The Remington&#x27;s temperature setting is 310-370 and I find the lowest temp to be perfect for my short hair.  Yes, it does have a slight smell like burning metal when you turn it on.  I&#x27;m okay with that.  It&#x27;s not that bad and goes away after a few minutes.  The plates are smooth and glide against my hair better the the GHD.  With the GHD the plates would often grab stray hairs at the end and pull them.  It wasn&#x27;t until I used the Remington I noticed how smooth it can be.  It doesn&#x27;t get my hair ridiculously hot and I haven&#x27;t once broken out into a sweat with it.  Which says a lot this time of year where I am because it&#x27;s gross and humid out already.  I haven&#x27;t tried to use it for curls yet but I truly believe it will do the job with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all I highly recommend this straightener for anyone - newbie or not.  After years of a professional straightener I&#x27;m glad I found something that actually works.  You can&#x27;t beat the price - just buy it!!</li>
    <li> Great value for price! Easy to carry around and is sturdy. I have short hair and need something sleek to make straightening easier.</li>
    <li> due to hair damage and consuming hair doing.I&#x27;ve decided to straighten my hair and get on the move faster with no worries.</li>
    <li> It literally smells like if your hair is burning completely! its ceramic so it explains but i wish i had bought an iso straighter !</li>
    <li> Works well for me and was the right price.  I wish the plates were a little larger and sometimes it catches my hair, but these are easily overlooked when I consider how much I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Great straightener! Heats up fast and is easy to use. It has 5 heat settings and has a lock for the plates.</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOOOOVE THIS HAIR STRAIGHTENER!&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and you are able to control the temperature. It straightens your hair within seconds. I highly recommend this. So fabulous!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I had so far</li>
    <li> My hair looks great after using this iron. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very cheap and it works wonders! My sister used mine and wanted to buy one for her, she uses more than I do and she approved it! 5 stars, no doubt!</li>
    <li> Excellent seller 100% Recommended</li>
    <li> I got this a few weeks ago and has done the job so far.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair so I was a little skeptic about it and when it came it had a weird stench. But after I used it my hair was so pretty I loved it so much it was perfectly straight and I only passed it two times. It suggested to put the heat at 350 for my fine hair and I left it at that and it was a good temperature. I know there was suppose to be a blue light to indicate its heating up but mine didn&#x27;t work but not a big deal cause I could tell when it was done heating up. Also beautiful color.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair it&#x27;s fine but frizzy. 3 years old still works well as ever. Make sure to clean any straightener, curling iron or crimper at least once a month to decrease build up.</li>
    <li> Stopped working within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> So I have been looking for over 2 years for a straightner that compared to the CHI in quality but not price! And this is it! Gets hot very quickly, only have to go over my hair once and it is straight as a board. I have tried so many other brands and nothing works like the Remmington. I go to bed with my hair wet, get up the next morning its super wavy and frizzy and after 5 minutes my hair is straight. I would buy this product time and time again!</li>
    <li> I went from a $90 FHI flat iron to this and it was the best decision i could have ever made. I was so unhappy with my FHI (granted, I had it for some time and it started going to crap) but what this remington does that FHI never did even when i first got it! This iron has some great features that make straightening your hair a breeze! It is so hot on 410 degrees but it straightens in 5 minutes. My hair is so uncooroperative and using the FHI still took about 25 mins to straighten my hair, this one is so fast! The swivel cord makes it easy to maneuver and the lock feature is good for the lazy days you just don&#x27;t want to keep opening and closing the iron! LOL! Also, the buttons for power and heat are flush to the iron so while your straightening they are not in the way. I LOVE this straightener and I would recommend it to anyone! Just be careful, it does get very hot!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and am soooo glad I did. I searched for days before I finally found this one. On average I&#x27;d say I use it at least 3 or 4 times a week.I have thick long hair and it goes through it with ease. Leaving your hair feeling silky and smooth. I highly recommend this product to EVERYONE looking to buy a hair straightner.</li>
    <li> This lil iron works great.  I wish I could turn the heat on it down lower than 310 which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5.</li>
    <li> Looked at a lot of straighteners and this had all the features of the other brands.  Power button is a little hard sometimes to turn on, but for the price it does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I got side swept bangs and they started getting curly.   Now I straighten all of my hair, and I have gotten more than a few compliments on my new hair. My hair is really thick and frizzy but not after I use this straightner. I love how it heats up very fast, and makes my hair so soft and smooth. Would deffinatly recommend this product, I have had other straightners before but they all busted and werent very tight in the area of where the hair goes. This one is perfect. A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for about a month now and it&#x27;s awesome! It gets super hot and does the job fast! The only problem I have with it is that I get burnt more than I used to &#x3D;) I used to spend 30-45 minutes trying to straighten my hair, not now! I&#x27;m done in 10-15 minutes. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and the price for this quality us unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I love it. I had to buy another one because my previous one was taken over by my teenage daughters. It is an awesome product. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Excellent ceramic hair straightener, easy to use and fast.</li>
    <li> It straightens my hair very well, but I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks now and it still tends to have a burning smell whenever it is heating up.</li>
    <li> Good one! Happy to buy it</li>
    <li> It is the most strong iron relaxing device i have ever used ..i advise you to use it realy you will comfort from and save your mony  going to salon ..</li>
    <li> Quick heat up, closed up locking position, general quality and price point.  I own one of the 2 inch irons, which I love,have had for 2 years. This was bought this as a gift for a teenager who wanted a skinny flat iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very very curly and thick hair.  Her cousin (both of them are under 6 years old) has very fine straight hair.  My daughter wanted to have her hair lay flat too.  I mentioned this in passing to my doctor the other day, and he told me to get her a flat iron.  Since I have never heard of this, I checked amazon to see how much it was.  After reading the reviews, and loving the price, I bought this.  We have used it 3 times over the past week, and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think something so inexpensive would work as well as the professional model I purchased a few years ago.  This product heats up as well, straightens at least as fast, if not faster, and has a more protective case that prevents burning things I lay it on.  The digital temp reading is helpful as is the auto off function.  I would definitely recommend this and would buy it again  Still a 4 rating, since it does not feel as heavy duty as the one that costs 10 times as much.   Addendum: I purchased a 2nd one of these in 2015, and on the 2nd one I received, the temp/on screen does not light up. It can be difficult to know if it is on without touching it and burning yourself. I would have given my original rating a 5, as it really was an excellent product.</li>
    <li> heat up fast, cool down fast.  easy on/off.  adjustable temp. great item for the price.</li>
    <li> i do love it im realllyyyyy picky on my supplies for my hair red for ever. i needed a new one cause the last one i had kept eating the red dye so no no no for that but this one heats up fast and gets the job done :D ty</li>
    <li> This is a really great flat iron!! i it makes my hair very nice and straight. Just be careful with the heat settings this flat iron can get very hot and you definetly don&#x27;t want to burn your hair off!</li>
    <li> This straightener does its job for the low price that I paid. However, I have had much better straighteners that produced much sleeker results, but for a much higher price. So I guess you get what you pay for. It does an okay job at straightening.</li>
    <li> A regular iron. Doe the job. Nothing bad or extraordinarily good to write about it. Worth the price. Thats it</li>
    <li> It works to get the job done, but I was very disappointed when I saw that the plates don&#x27;t completely meet.  I really feel like I should have stuck with my old Remington Wet2Dry.</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast! Is a great option that&#x27;s not too pricey. I&#x27;ve had better straightners, but didn&#x27;t want to invest in one right now and this one works fine.</li>
    <li> Price &#x3D; Quality? NOT THIS TIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener is reliable, heats up quickly and totally portable. It has worked better than any straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. I am not against paying more money for quality, but in this case, you really are getting a good deal. I just hope it doesn&#x27;t give me cancer or any other diseases in 10 years.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. exactly as described by the seller</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons! I&#x27;ve had them for almost 2 years and have yet ran into any problems! Better than the ones I paid $250.00 for.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my super long hair.  This straightener is not very powerful, but it stay hot.  It would not have done anything before with my long hair.  It can handle my shorter layered hair and get most of the curl out in a reasonable time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was fair and I will not feel upset if this is no longer working in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice compact on a budget.</li>
    <li> Good hair straighteners and durable.</li>
    <li> This product is why I love amazon reviews. As long as you stick to products that have 1000+ ratings with verified buyers and most seem happy, the product is good! This iron is really amazing. I use this and the wet to straight by Remington. Both are fantastic irons and I&#x27;d recommend either one. My friend came and used this, and wanted to know how much I spent on it because she wants one too. She guessed $75 so I got her one as a present and now she thinks I&#x27;m the most generous friend. Heh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 4/16/16: I am still using the same iron! It&#x27;s working as well as ever, and I use it several times a week. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Works well, no problems</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Great quality! I had my other flat iron for years and years and I finally decided to replace it with this one. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> works well for the price</li>
    <li> great, works very good, the price was right!</li>
    <li> WORKS PERFECTLY!!!!  RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. It&#x27;s easy to use, heats up quickly, and has many heating levels (but the 2 lowest levels are perfectly hot enough). I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Heats up quicks!  Love the color. Great buy. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing. I have naturally curly hair and use a straightener every day. I didn&#x27;t buy it from amazon, but I have had it for 4 years and it still works just as well as it did when I first got it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This iron is awesome within just a few second it heating up.</li>
    <li> I mainly bought this for my pre teen and she loves it.  She has small hands and this is just the right size for her to manipulate through her thick, wavy hair. I&#x27;ve used it as well and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. It heats up quickly. The digital screen is easy to read. 3 heat settings. Careful the highest temp of 410 is hot, hot, hot. I have course, beyond thick hair and 410 works great but move quickly. My hair has a great shine after using. Mid temp if I&#x27;m using to curl my hair with it; which is made easier with the swivel cord. Remember to use a heat protective spray.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have thick hair and it still doesn&#x27;t take me much time to straighten my hair with this product, you can also use it for some curls :) it does kind of smell weird the first couple of times you plug it in.</li>
    <li> I really liked very good .... I loved ... :)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products that Remington makes so far that I have tried! I love how easy it is to heat and use.It smooths your hair while you&#x27;re straightening it.</li>
    <li> This is the second one that I have ordered I have had the first one for about 12 months , it is still working perfectly however my daughter has borrowed it one time too many so I am ordering myself a second one , the price is great , the product works well</li>
    <li> Its just like any other straightener and its just as described says, glides really nice on hair. some how my hair didn&#x27;t stay straight for very long don&#x27;t know if it wasn&#x27;t hot enough. will have to use it more and try it out.</li>
    <li> I love this iron good value for the money</li>
    <li> It is good. Heating adjustments are comfortable. Gripping good. Easy to use. Heats up quickly. Auto shut off facility is there. Actually mine is long thick curly hair. It took 45 mins to do</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy, currently shoulder length with bangs, so it&#x27;s not too difficult to straighten. My bangs, however, have a mind of their own and one section in particular wants to stick straight up or part wierdly, even after at attack with product and the blowdryer. This flatiron really works well to make them look straight and even, and the price was right. When I take the time to do the rest of my hair, that works well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser asked me if I burned my forehead straightening my bangs -- no, i haven&#x27;t, and I think that the design of this iron would make it difficult to do so.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It gets hot in no time at all and does the job better than any I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> It was an awful product, as soon as I turned it on, it smelled like it was burning. Not only that, it makes my hair awkwardly straight or curled. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is my second flat iron of the same brand and color etc. Ive tried other ones, but this one is by far the best on the market. With a terrific price at that. Easy to hold and your able to hold it with out it getting so hot you have to put it down.&lt;br /&gt;This is my personal opinion, Im sure others have there favs also.&lt;br /&gt;Five starts from me..</li>
    <li> This is a really great straightener. My hair is pretty straight as it is but this gives it exactly what it needs. It does not pull my hair or kill it. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first hair straightener (also first purchase on amazon) and I was thoroughly pleased with it!  First of all, I was so excited for it&#x27;s arrival that I used the \\&quot;track package\\&quot; feature, and to my delight it arrived ahead of schedule (now who doesn&#x27;t like that?)!  The straightener works very well, the outside gets pretty warm at high temp. settings though, so be careful.  I also bought it wanting to use it as a curler (i saw in another review that it did both), but buyers be warned, it takes practice!  Looking up a youtube video works best, and with a good bit of practice the curls look just as good as the straight.  Also, Using the lowest temp. settings (perfect for my hair), my hair doesn&#x27;t get damaged, and I use it about twice a week!  (I don&#x27;t use spray protectant)&lt;br /&gt;Another super hand thing about the Remington hair straightener is that it heats up SUPER QUICKLY, meaning about fifteen seconds!  yaaaaay i love this product :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope you find this helpful,&lt;br /&gt;K</li>
    <li> This straightener is a good product but just beware that at some point it may blow out.  Since I use it almost every day the buttons started to stick. When I wanted to turn it off it would continue to stay on. I probably did get a faulty product I don&#x27;t know. Luckily I registered my product and customer service was very helpful. They sent me a new one within a week which was really nice and this new one actually works better.</li>
    <li> So I used this for the first time today and it made my hair extremely staticey. Although it did heat up fast and is light Weight, I usually love remington products I recently had the wet2dry which i prefer over this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron to bring along when travelling, and the price was definitely right. I have fine, medium length wavy hair that I blow dry straight and use a flat iron to straighten/de-frizz. This iron does the job, and I like that it heats up quickly, has multiple heat settings, and is easy to hold and maneuver. It can snag hair if you&#x27;re not careful, though. I also noticed that this iron gives off a plastic-like smell when it&#x27;s on, and mine gave off a faint electric current sound when I left it plugged in (even if it wasn&#x27;t on). Not sure if that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t use it much or just because it&#x27;s cheaper quality, but overall it&#x27;s not a bad iron for the price.</li>
    <li> fue un regalo, y la persona quedo encantada , es liviana y muy útil, yo ya tenia una parecida .</li>
    <li> This straightener still has an awful odor which it emits whenever it is used.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read more of the reviews before buying.  Not worth $15.</li>
    <li> It heats up super fast and for a cheap price! I have ethnic hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a good iron that works . the cheap price is a bonus!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that was easy to use, heated up quickly. You have different temperatures to adjust depending on hair quality. The plates are long, which I prefer. FYI, this product is only 110volts for those interested in taking it overseas.</li>
    <li> This product is much cheaper compared to others in the market. So far, I&#x27;ve been loving the product because it is so smooth. I like how it does not damage my hair. It&#x27;s versatile so I can curl and straighten my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for three reasons. The first is that it is the typical, very reliable design that has proven to have all the attributes of a really good flat iron. The second reason I chose this one is that this is one of her favorite brands and since she is a professional cosmetologist, she knows her stuff. The third reason is that it is purple and my wife is wild about purple. The flat iron&#x27;s ceramic heating surfaces are scratch-resistant, durable, distribute the heat very evenly, and keep a constant temperature for long hair styling sessions. The shape and overall feel of this unit makes it ideal for holding while working with your hair so it is not awkward in any way. The digital readout that shows the temperature is a very nice feature for obvious reasons. You never have to guess if it is really at the temperature that you want it to reach before working with your hair. This unit has a very good feel to it and seems very durable and unbreakable should it ever be dropped. The controls are easy to read, simple, and the control switches/knobs are not cumbersome and in the way. It is a good solid unit and its features are top-notch. So me and my wife both give it a big thumbs-up because when she is happy, I&#x27;m happy. I would recommend this flat iron to anyone.</li>
    <li> Does the job well... Great for curling... Heats up very quickly... Awesome price!! Very happy and would totally buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my first hair straightener and it works perfectly. Does the job quickly and easily smooths through my hair. Heats up quickly. Easy temp controls.</li>
    <li> this item was just awesome! it came on time and it was in splendid condition, just like brand new!!!!!!!!!! i use it almost every single day!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product; great seller, great price</li>
    <li> great price! works great, i have thick hair, very very thick hair and this straightner has no problem leaving my hair silky soft and straight. love it and the price! it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Thank you</li>
    <li> Great product, but was misleading with the temperature control feature. 310-410 by increments of 20 is not temperature control at its core. Got here quickly though</li>
    <li> I bought it cause i saw it had good reviews but i was dissappointed i was a little unsatisfied with it, it does get hot super quick though</li>
    <li> I loveeeee this flat iron! From only one use and it has already surpassed my tens of flat irons. I am African American and have very thick, tightly coiled hair that becomes smooth and sleek with only one pass. Excellent buy!</li>
    <li> Perfect to the last detail!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this flat iron. It&#x27;s not the flimsy/lightweight plastic like most of the ones that I&#x27;ve bought from the store. I&#x27;ve bought ones from the store that break in 6 months. This one has lasted me for a couple of years now and is still working like new! Very durable and works exactly as expected! Also a great price compared to similar flat irons.</li>
    <li> I first used it at my best friend&#x27;s house and I noticed how my frizzy curly hair was straighten in the first try unlike my other flat iron where I have to pass the plate two or three times to make it look sleek and smooth. I highly recommend this flat iron and it comes at a great price!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron from walmart not on Amazon but i have to say its an amazing flat iron for the price. Its straightens and curls on the default temp which is 340°F and i don&#x27;t have to take it up at all. I love that!!!</li>
    <li> Returned this a long time ago as it was too big!</li>
    <li> The best straightener I&#x27;ve come a cross.</li>
    <li> I love these. I was so surprised. Best buy so far.</li>
    <li> This flat iron just doesn&#x27;t get my hair as straight and shiny as other ones I&#x27;ve owned.  It also wants to stick instead of gliding smoothly through my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure why, I think it has something to do with the ceramic coating.  Whatever the reason, I&#x27;m considering just trying to find a better one, even though I haven&#x27;t had this one for very long.  It does seem to get plenty hot.</li>
    <li> This is a good inexpensive flat iron that gets the job done fairly easily. My hair is fine and straight but when i wash it, it can get a bit puffy sometimes or get the misplaced waves of a scrunchy, so I like to have a flat iron on hand to smooth it out when needed especially if I&#x27;m going out at night. I find it easier then blowing out my hair which I rarely do anyway because my hair dries quickly on it&#x27;s own. I like this product a lot, I also purchased it for my 16 yr old niece who has kinkier hair than I do and she uses it several times a week. It straightens her over processed hair well.</li>
    <li> AWESOME! Heats up fast,my hair is thin and wavy,but my sis&#x27;s is really thick and curly and it straightens both of our hair in 5 minutes or less. Have nothings but good to say about it....I even bought a second one! Owned it for 5 months and have used it every day. Yes there is a slight bad smell the first maybe two or three times that you use it but I think it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s a new product, it goes away pretty quickly. Otherwise can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my broken one.  The price was awesome and the product works beautifully.  I&#x27;m glad I picked this one.</li>
    <li> This straightener is super. I have not used a straightener before as I was always afraid it would damage my hair. This one hasn&#x27;t caused any damage and my hair actually looks healthier after use! I&#x27;ve been using it about 9 months.</li>
    <li> This heats up super fast; I love that it has an auto-off feature.  Use it every morning; great price too.</li>
    <li> really cheap and works for me!</li>
    <li> Its a cheap hair straightener that gets the job done. I have used this exact kind for like 3, 4 years now. I straighten my hair every day so I have had quite the experience with this and other hair straighteners. every time it stops working I buy the exact same kind (only replaced it twice so far) because I like it, has temp control and its a good price. Next 2 years when my other one gives out, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am African American and have 4B hair type. First off I want to say I was really shocked that for only $15.00 this flat iron got my hair super striaght. I have tried alot of expensive flat iron and usually give them away because it can never get my hair the way I want it. The first time I use the flar iron it did give off a smell but I have used it at least 6 times and I love the results. I have less fly aways my hair is really boncey after I</li>
    <li> This heats up fast and gets hot. It doesn&#x27;t leave a smell on hair or in your bathroom. This will straighten your hair ladies. I recommend</li>
    <li> I have used flat irons for years and didn&#x27;t really expect this product to be any different that the others I&#x27;ve used, but after more than a year of use I can safely conclude that I really don&#x27;t like it and need to buy something else. It&#x27;s hard to identify exactly why, except that something about it makes it hard for me to get the exact section I&#x27;m trying to get and to make it do what I&#x27;m trying to do. Somehow I end up with the hair not properly set against the plates. Certainly it could be my technique, but as I said I haven&#x27;t had this problem with other irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that my hair is roughly shoulder length and quite fine.</li>
    <li> I love these... I bought them as a second pair to leave at my holiday home and I love them so much I am thinking of buying another pair to replace the set I have at home.    As they have narrow plates, its very easy to curl your hair - 10 out of 10</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the bad reviews on this.  Just wanted this as a backup, for travel, but my other one died and I had to start using this one.  It heats up fast, and the temp is adjustable, but it seems to dry out my hair no matter what temp it&#x27;s on.  The worst part is how HOT the outside of this iron gets.  You have to be so careful the way you hold it not to burn your fingers.  I need to purchase a better flat iron and throw this one back in the travel bag.  I&#x27;ve burned myself more times in a few months using this than I had in 5 years using my old one.</li>
    <li> this is my first hair straightner, so consider that I have no other reference. I have relaxed african american hair which is not too damaged, only at the front. i use avlon for relaxing. This iron is soft and I work it on 350 just to style my hair in the morning. It is very easy, and I&#x27;m done in 5-10 mins. I use it at the front and it doesnt appear to damage my hair more than what it is. It doesnt magically straigthen my hair, but it does help me style it. I would recommend it for someone with my hair type, needs and age (22)</li>
    <li> Very good straightener. I recommend this to anyone, especially because of the great price. Its better than  any other ceramic straightener I&#x27;ve tried. It also has a very quick heat up</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener about 20 min ago. I was very hesitant, but I can always return it if it sucks. I thought it would suck. I go through straighteners like nothing. I have EXTREMELY thick and wavy/curly hair. I was amazed when i ran this over one part of my hair a few minutes ago and it took one pass to straighten it. It heats up very quickly, and lets you know when it has reached the desired temperature. My only complaint (if we can call it that) is it gets very hot. So let your hair sit for a second or two before you touch it!</li>
    <li> when i saw how cheao the price was for something that was \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to reach a temperature of 410 i was kind of skeptical. but to my surprise, it worked great on my hair! i have very think hair and a straightener that reaches a high temp is something that i always needed but good find. Im glad i took the risk with this straightener! definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> OK so straight to the point i am african american and this flat iron works sooooo good on my hair....it is a must have....perfect and its cute too!!!</li>
    <li> When  I first ordered this I was worried that it might not be a good straightener due to its inexpensive price. It was fantastic from day one though. It straightened my hair much quicker than my past straighteners and left my hair without any frizz. My hair stays straight all day whereas with some other straighteners the effects didn&#x27;t last as long. I&#x27;d definitely suggest this straightener!</li>
    <li> I have just recieved this straightener. First off I ordered it at night and a day and a half later it was at my doorstep. So quick shipping is a plus. The moment I plugged it in it heated up instantly. I would say I had to wait 5 seconds to begin using it. I had it at 370 and it straightened my hair flawlessly and quickly! I am so happy about this product and I have reccommended it to all of my friends. I couldnt believe the price for such an awesome straightener. And it&#x27;s really light weight so it&#x27;s easy to bring with you any where. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> GREAT flat iron.  Gets super, super hot.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but a little small as my girl says. Not much difference among them.</li>
    <li> Works great, i like to use flat irons to curl my hair a little at the ends and it works better then the expensive one I broke right before i bought this one. Just watch the temp. I have course hair but the automatic temp it goes to is 310 and even with heat resistant serum, my hair still felt like it was burning on the first try, so i turned the heat down and it worked perfectly. Use with Mystic Oil Heat protecting serum, best serum i have ever used!</li>
    <li> It is lightweight and heats quickly, love it!</li>
    <li> I Love This Flat Iron.&lt;br /&gt;Takes More Than 30 Seconds To Heat Up But She The Best.&lt;br /&gt;Its A Must Buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for almost two years and I absolutely love it till this day. It straightens my hair with no problems and after buying two other straighteners that were way more pricey, this straightener gets the job done more than the other straighteners. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it to pay any more bucks to get anything else unless you are going for top notch brand like CHI, which will cost you way more!</li>
    <li> So I gave this a a present to someone and I don&#x27;t think they ended up using it because of the reviews.....but I thought it was cool.  I mean look at the features....THE FEATURES....and the price was good.</li>
    <li> My hair is a little bit curly and this is perfect to make a straight hair. It gets hot quickly and super easy to use.</li>
    <li> very plastic like and does not heat up hot enough to straighten my hair. I have to use my old one in combination with this one otherwise I have half a head of curly hair.</li>
    <li> 12 year old really likes this she still uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because of my hair type or this iron, every time about 1 hour after using this hair straightener my hair gets frizzy but a couple of hours later it becomes to its normal situation.</li>
    <li> Great for very curly hair; heats up quickly and works extremely well (to 410). I had a Chi before, and this product is just as good for a way cheaper price.</li>
    <li> It works really well. I love it. It came really fast in the mail. I would recommend this. Never had a flat iron like this.</li>
    <li> I have had a straigthener for about a couple year nows that i bought from one of those mall kiosk. It worked good but it would take about ten minutes longer than this straightener. After about a half an hour my hair would go back to what it looked like before i straighteneed it. However, this past week I have used the Remington Straightener and it is the greatest straightener I have ever owned and a great price. I just put my protectant on my hair and straighten and it takes about five minutes. I will admit that my hair is fine but I have alot of hair. Best product and well worth the money. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t break on my like the other reviewers!!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this.  I have been using a croc and I loved it, while it worked.  I had my croc for 5 months and it just quit working yesterday.  I paid a lot of money for that to only get 5 months out of it.  It was starting to snag my hair and break it off.  This Remington was 17.99 at Target.  I got the last one.  I cannot even begin to tell you how awesome this thing is.  I know I have only used it one time but it is magnificant.  Smooth glide over my hair.  One swipe is all it takes.  Shiny hair. Very comfortable to hold in your hand. An awesome purchase. Honestly, I may get another one as a backup.  I am that impressed with this one.  I love it.  So glad I did not go out and get a high priced one.  My  hair looks better today than it ever has since I have been straigtening it.  You must give this one a try.  What do you have to lose!!!!  Put it on ebay, I&#x27;ll buy it..lol.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new straightener to work well and get the job done. And this one is the way to go! It heats up so quick, and it works Iike a miracle! I was scared to buy it because I read some of the reviews. But I LOVE it. It also arrived at my house a week earlier than expected. My hair is thin, and it works perfectly! I am so glad I bought this straighter! I will DEFINATELY be buying from this buyer again!! :)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this straightener so far. It heats up very quickly and I like that it has a digital temperature reading. The plates are narrow enough to allow for easy maneuverability and styling, but not so narrow that it takes forever to straighten all your hair. It slides easily over my hair which allows me to finish straightening all my hair in just a few minutes. The only slight downside I have seen so far is that every time you plug it in, you also have to press a button to turn it on and then set the temperature (it defaults to 370 degrees.) I am sure this is the same as many other straighteners, but the one I previously used turned on automatically upon plug-in, so this has just been something for me to get used to.  I have never owned the higher-end straighteners like the Chi so I can&#x27;t really compare it to that, but I doubt you could find a better straightener at this price point.</li>
    <li> My wife is using this product for almost a year now and she absolutely loves it. Great product for such a low price. Truly anti static unlike her previous flat irons, heats up well and gets the job done quick.</li>
    <li> Excelent Product. I like it</li>
    <li> I was worried about having a straightener to use with an adapter/converter on a recent trip to the UK And I also need a high heat setting to straighten my hair. Was very pleased with this one. It temperature seemed to be a little hotter when used in the US but it still worked just fine!</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift.</li>
    <li> After much use and travel it still works great.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and this worked fantastically for me. To be fair I don&#x27;t have the highest of standards -- I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often and when I do I&#x27;ve used the Wet 2 Straight flat iron for the past several years, which definitely wasn&#x27;t the best. I really do like this one though. I rarely had to go over sections of hair more than once, and it heats up very quickly. Excellent straightener for the price, IMO.</li>
    <li> Use it all of the time</li>
    <li> This is the first straightener I&#x27;ve ever bought, but I&#x27;ve used friends&#x27; on several occasions. I absolutely love this! It works great for my thick hair. I was a little concerned because some of the other reviewers said there was a burning smell produced by the straightener. However, after using it quite a few times, the only thing I smell is a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; smell (which I would expect from this!). A reviewer said it wouldn&#x27;t turn off &amp; you have to unplug it, however, all you do is hold the power button until the power goes off. Pros:  turns on &amp; off easily, heats quickly, works smoothly (doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all), the cord swivels when you turn the straightener &amp; doesn&#x27;t get all twisted, &amp; the temp setting is very clear &amp; easy to set.</li>
    <li> It actually works on my always wavy hair &#x3D; even on a rainy day! Seems to be gentle enought too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and am very happy, for the price. I only straighten my hair about twice a month so I didn&#x27;t want to pay a ton of money for a straightener. If you&#x27;re not expecting this to be a high-end product, you should be pleased. It gets my thick and course hair straight in a reasonable amount of time, and it&#x27;s slim and looks nice too!</li>
    <li> Awesome item. Works great!!</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Walmart. I have had it for about two year I think. Maybe longer. Heats up fast and stays hot. Not to mention if I forget to turn it off I don&#x27;t have to worry about my house burning down with its shut off feature! I do however use a protective heat spray in my hair, but this leaves my hair smoothe and straight in one swipe! Or curly if I want! It still works like the day I bought it! Highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> I just took this out of the package this morning. It heats up fast and works great. I use it to help curve the ends of my hair inward as they can get unruly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately there must be a wiring issue with the one I got because as soon as the cord on the end jiggles in either direction it makes an electrical shorting noise and shuts off completely. I could tape it up so it stays in place and go on using it, but I&#x27;m afraid that with the messed up wiring it could be a fire hazard. Returning it, but open to ordering a replacement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:: I realize that I forgot to edit this review so here goes. I ended up purchasing this same hair straightener again and was pleasantly surprised! No wiring issue. The straightener heats up super fast and straightens my hair quickly and easily. I even purchased one for a friend for her birthday and she LOVES it. I&#x27;m the lucky lady that gets to use this to straighten her hair most mornings at work. She has coarse, curly hair and this straightener makes quick work of smoothing her out nicely. So glad I didn&#x27;t give up on this. Best hair straightener you can get for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a good flat iron for the price</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for years. I got a Chi for christmas and ended up returning it a couple days later, due to not seeing a significant difference in how the Chi and the Remington straightened my incredibly difficult and thick hair. I will buy this one again if the one I have ever goes on me.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but when it got here I wad very impressed! Especially for the price. Its very nice and works great!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever bought! Works better than my friends who spent $100+ on theirs. I have had it since late 2012 and still works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fit student&#x27;s budget. Above average quality. I bought it when it was on sale, so it is a very good deal compared to its prices in other stores. I am happy with that so far.</li>
    <li> This is a FANTASTIC flat iron.....for maybe 4 months.  I&#x27;ve bought two of these.  My hair is long, frizzy and mostly grey.  This wonderful flat iron makes my hair smooth &amp; shiny and with the flick of my wrist it also gives gorgeous curls.  I loved this flat iron so much that when the first one broke after just a few months I went and bought the exact same one again.  Now that one broke, also after just a few months.  SIGH.  Even with the cheap price for a great flat iron, I simply can&#x27;t buy a 3rd one in less than a year.</li>
    <li> Awesome and compact. Does a great job straightening and curling!</li>
    <li> i have very thick, curly/wavy frizzy hair. this straightener smooths my hair out very well. my hair takes a while to straighten but i&#x27;m used to that. just have patience and it will be fine. i highly recommend this, especially if you have thin or easy to style hair. p.s. i also use coconut oil as a heat protecter and the syraightener has no build up and is easy to wipe any product off of.</li>
    <li> love this flat iron works just as good or better than more expensive one  .</li>
    <li> I love love love these flat irons! These are the best thing to happen to my head Thus far!</li>
    <li> This is one of the worse flat irons I have used...It get&#x27;s hot really quickly, but when it heats up and u actually put it in your hair to straighten it..It does not straighter your hair very well..I mean if u want it bone straight not for you..and it smells when it is heated..I had a better one that I purchase from another store that worked very well and it was actually cheaper...I miss that flat iron..I had to retire it because my kids got a hold of it and broke it...</li>
    <li> Very easy and small for casual hair straightening needs.  I only straighten my very short hair every once in a while but this little guy heats up quickly, and is easy to use.  Perfect size for travel or short hair needs.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair that&#x27;s difficult to work with, and I was very skeptical about getting a 1 inch straightener, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! This thing is great. It heats up nicely, the digital screen makes it easy to read, and it flashes to indicate when it&#x27;s warming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the rounded edges - it&#x27;s so easy to add just a touch of curl right at the end of the hair. I&#x27;ve been through a lot of straighteners, and this is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> the warming system is really fast, my girlfriend is happy with the product</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ll get one with a cool-tip handle next time. Will cost more but I might not burn my fingers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the BEST flat iron, but it&#x27;s still great and very inexpensive.  I&#x27;m pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  More than one heat setting.</li>
    <li> I would like to see holder for this thing, it is not stable when you put it on the table. For the rest - it is okay, gets hot fast, works well</li>
    <li> I was very upset with this product..i opened it, plugged it in, and went to use it for the FIRST TIME and i heard a little POP sound followed by a burning smell, it had completely quit working!  I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to see how it actually worked to straighten my hair&amp;#62;:( $30+ in the trash!</li>
    <li> This straightener is great the best I&#x27;ve ever had it straightens good and is easy to use the only thing is the awkward smell.</li>
    <li> Low cost option, does the job fine. But does not work perfectly like a professional Straightener. Have to hold it really tight to get the hair straight, and fingers feel the stress after half the hair is done, Maybe bcoz my hair is really thick and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But using it since 1.5 years now, and works good for the price.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The fact that one can control the heat is perfect - it works well on my hair. I find that if I rotate it from about halfway down it gives my hair a little curl and I can style it in different ways. Children have been complimenting me on how my hair looks and they never used to.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY! horrible hair straightener... smells like burning plastic when its on and damages and dries hair.</li>
    <li> I needed this straighter for my hairstyle i wanted and it heats better than other straighteners i used before.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this to anyone looking around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it does a good job, but I feel it takes away the shine. This doesn&#x27;t happen with the \\&quot;Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates\\&quot; and their price is very similar, so I would say that if you are in doubt you shouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Love this little straightener. I bit the bullet and bought this after my beloved Sedu died. Sedu is well over $100, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much of anything from this thing. I kind of have to admit... it&#x27;s better. It heats up super hot, super fast, and doesn&#x27;t seem to burn my hair. Really even if it dies in a few months it&#x27;s still worth your $. Great buy so far.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly but no, IT IS NOT DUAL VOLTAGE. I bought it specifically for that reason last year (July 2013) for my trip to Ireland. At the time, the description said it was but that&#x27;s not the case anymore.</li>
    <li> The extra star is because it was relatively inexpensive. My Croc hair straightener, which I loved and had used for about 3 years, broke the day before my wedding. Didn&#x27;t have time to do anything except run to the closest Walgreens and pick something up, and this happened to be it. It does straighten hair, but I noticed it made my hair frizzier and creased my hair, and also wasn&#x27;t very effective at any sort of curling. Never had these problems with my last straightener. Am currently researching different straighteners to replace this one.</li>
    <li> About my hair: relaxed, APL length&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an FHI in 2007 and it \\&quot;passed away\\&quot; in June 2011 (the plates became detached). At the time, I was in no position to pay $100+ for a flat iron, so I headed to Walmart to see what they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a 1 inch ceramic flat iron. They had several to choose from, but I did not want the Ed Hardy-esque roses, skulls and bling designs. Then I saw the Remington. It was simple in design, but had great features! It had a digital display so that I could choose the temps that I wanted (which is beneficial since I have a relaxer and near the end of a relaxer stretch, the roots can get quite unruly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I love this flat iron! I especially love how quick it heats up! The results that I get are superb and equal to that of the FHI! It is also easy to create curls and twists with this flat iron due to its rounded design (the FHI was more squared, so it was not really good for curling hair). I recommend this to anyone who wants a great flat iron without breaking the bank!</li>
    <li> Great product. Finally found one that works for me. But be careful it does get real hot and you might burn yourself by accident</li>
    <li> Wife says this is a really good product for the price. Arrived quickly also!</li>
    <li> Works fine. Heats up very fast and works as expected. Good quality</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars because of its good quality and great price. I really liked using this hair straightener but I made a mistake buying another remington hair styler. I have both a remington blow dryer and a black 2 inch straightener that burnt my hair badly. I wanted to give this s-5500 a try and when it was delivered it worked so much like my black remington flat iron and I wanted something different but I&#x27;m on a budget. My last remington was also digital, swivel cord, and had a lock feature. The difference between the two was that it didnt burn my hair AND it heated up significantly faster.My last remington straightener left a burning smell on my hair and I hated it, it also left my ends dry and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Im very glad I bought the s-5500 it was just as good as everyone says:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up quick&lt;br /&gt;-Gets very hot&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves little to no hair static&lt;br /&gt;-Swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;-Lock features&lt;br /&gt;-No burning smell left on my hair&lt;br /&gt;-Great price!!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The straightener starts to smell like burning plastic once it heats up</li>
    <li> Am very happy with this purchase. Probably one of the best hair straighteners I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Am buying an extra one because my bro/sis are also in love with this. It heats up pretty fast, and makes your hair looks really healthy and glossy after straightening, unlike some of the more expensive saloon brands I&#x27;ve puchased previously which dries out the hair.</li>
    <li> Better than Chi and a fraction of the cost</li>
    <li> Excellent. It&#x27;s heats up so quickly. It makes my hair look great. Great for making waves and curls also.</li>
    <li> This straighter is okay it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair perfectly straight the design is nice just not my favorite straightener.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I have had one for 4 years and am buying this one as a backup.  I have slightly wavy hair, so I just use the lowest setting(330F) to straighten my hair.  I like that you can control the amount of heat needed so that your hair stays healthy and damage free.</li>
    <li> still works. ok for short hair. dont buy this if you have long hair. it wil take forever for you to use. get wider than 1&#x27; .</li>
    <li> Works nicely for a low priced item.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these because each of them died after about a year.  I use a straightener everyday.  My hair is very fine and only about shoulder length, so it is not like the straightener was working overtime.  The straightener worked great and kept my fine hair from getting staticky.  I thought when the first one died that maybe it was a fluke so I purchased another one because I really liked it.  When the second died I went to a higher quality straightener.</li>
    <li> Today a friend was asking me about good flat irons. I recommended these and told her that I paid ~$20 on Amazon. After checking my order history, I realized how cheap theses actually are, and they work better than many more expensive brands. I have been using these on my natural 4a/b hair since 2011. For the price, it doesn&#x27;t get much better.</li>
    <li> Super stylish in looks, but is also very light weight. Beautiful results</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve had mine for about 4 years and am loving it!!! It&#x27;s not only good but it LASTS, and that&#x27;s how I like to spend my $$$. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a while now and it never fails to get the job done. It always makes my hair pin straight with no frizz. I&#x27;ve had long hair, short hair, overly bleached hair, virgin hair, etc. I&#x27;ve even gotten really curly and unmanageable hair to be pin straight and silky smooth with this product. I would recommend anyone to buy this straightener it gets to up 410 degrees Fahrenheit. I&#x27;ve also curled my hair with this product and had bouncy curls for 24 hours. This is a must have.</li>
    <li> I really loved..Make my hair so cute, I bring it with me every where.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have owed it for about three years now and I can truly say that I haven&#x27;t had any issues. yes, it does get very hot, very quick. so I keep it at 370 degrees. I have only used it at its max of 410 maybe twice. but there really isn&#x27;t a need to. 370 works just fine for my hair. I am transitioning to natural so about 4 inches is relaxed(my ends) &amp; I have 4 inches of new growth(3b/3c).</li>
    <li> i was pleased great product</li>
    <li> amazing and the price is the best part of it.</li>
    <li> there is nothing bad to say about this product, it work perfectly and the price is awesome!</li>
    <li> The product does what it&#x27;s supposed to and I like the auto turn off feature. However, the straightener itself isn&#x27;t very smooth on my hair like my old straightener was. Over okay product.</li>
    <li> Durable and lives forever... It also straightens my very curly and stubborn hair with ease with little damage and no frizz. I love this straightener (and so do my friends, so I have to hide it!)</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year now and it&#x27;s held up great. The heat settings are high enough for my thick hair to be straightened in five to ten minutes. I can even curl with it which is a somewhat difficult technique but my stylist friend taught me. This is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This flat iron was a replacement for a 2 inch conair that was not so impressive.  It is easy to use/handle.  It worked well on my fine relaxed hair.  I was very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener. It works awesome. I have very very thick, wavy hair that does not straighten hardly ever but this straightener did the job by far in about 10 minutes max. Loved it I would recommend this for anyone (: shipped in about 2 or 3 days</li>
    <li> I just recently got the \\&quot;brazilian blowout\\&quot; and wanted to find a straightener that I could easily use along with being able to do a good job. I got this one because of the reviews and definately becuase of the price.  And all I can say is that it is amazing!!!! I love that it can straighten my hair getting rid of the frizz or I can curl it.  I bought a curling iron at the same time as this but haven&#x27;t even used it because this straightener works so well.  So for a girl who wore extremely curly hair for a long time to be able to rock some different hair do&#x27;s is pretty awesome!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is the best ever for the price. Works like the expensive ones costing $200 to $300. My daughter told me about it because she liked it so much and after ordering one- I am a believer!</li>
    <li> I have used this straightner about 2 months now and I am very pleased with the product. It stays at the temperature you set it at, not like my old one that I kept having to reset.</li>
    <li> I visited my sister-in-law and she had this product. I used it and fell in love with it, I loved the way my hair looked after using it. I decided right then I had to order it, and I orderd a second for my other sister-in-law as well as a B-day gift. I couldn&#x27;t believe that I could have such a great look for such a cheap price. My curls were defined and it broke through any frizz that I had at the time and just gave me nice beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great</li>
    <li> This flat iron is beautiful, works amazing, and the price you can&#x27;t beat!  I recommend this straightener to every girl and woman alike!</li>
    <li> This Remington heats up faster and works better on my hair then an expensive chi! I&#x27;m a very hard person to impress but I am!</li>
    <li> The iron does have a smell of burnt plastic when you first start to use it but I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s decreased dramatically since I first got it a few months ago. I&#x27;ve checked it periodically to make sure it wasn&#x27;t really melting and I&#x27;ve found no cause for concern so far. This little gadget is a time saver, works just like it&#x27;s supposed to and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it!!</li>
    <li> I will be blunt. This is not the best straightener around; however, it works decently and is very cheaply priced so it does the job well enough though there is significant room for improvement. I much prefer my old HSI straightener that I had previously ordered off of amazon a couple years back, but unfortunately it died a few weeks ago. Having short hair now, I just needed a straightener that would do the job and not make a dent in my piggy bank. This thing will straighten your hair, but be aware that you get what you pay for and it does not glide as smoothly through your hair as you might hope, and it sometimes leaves a crease where you first place the iron. All in all, however, it is a good iron for the price.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, I didn&#x27;t expect miracles from this styling iron. It gets the job done in straightening my short hair and when I need a toucher upper; it does leave a bit of fly away and static compared to my tourmaline plate flat iron. On the plus side, it heats up quickly and is lightweight.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product for the price. I have bought two one for myself and the other one for a christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about a year now and it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; the iron plates have not worn down (and I use it almost everyday).. The flat iron gets hot in less than 15 seconds and if you turn the temperature down it cools in about 15-20 seconds. I am overly satisfied with this product. It is great with all different grades of hair (curly, course, fine) I know because my friends have used it as well. Best part is its inexpensive!  And Remington is a trusted name brand. You&#x27;ll love it too..</li>
    <li> man i love this product it works great and even my mother in law loves it i use all the time and i cant imagine myself without it</li>
    <li> First hair straightener I have ever owned that actually made my hair straight without causing it to frizz. It also doesn&#x27;t catch or pull your hair out.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works great! One thing I didn&#x27;t like however, was that even on a low setting, the straightener gets super hot on the outside. So make sure you just grab the bottom of the straightener to avoid burning yourself!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron at Target sometime in November 2011. It was fine at first, it did its job. It does get VERY, VERY HOT. Almost impossible for me to straighten my sister&#x27;s or my hair without my hand hurting because I hold it in a way so I won&#x27;t get burned (sometimes I do anyway). It also releases this really terrible gas, which makes me hold my breath while I do my sister&#x27;s hair in order to not inhale it. It also pulls the hair, as some of the other reviewers pointed out. I would not recommend this product to anyone because of these problems.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron after reading some of the great reviews by other customers and because it was significantly cheaper than the higher end straighteners out there. But you truly get what you pay for with this product--a veritable piece of crap. I was extremely disappointed by the overall quality of this flat iron. The biggest issue is that the ceramic plates are not aligned correctly and do not meet fully, so when the flat iron is clamped down the plates come together at the top but gradually get further apart closer to the handle. This makes the quality of the straightening suffer (I was not impressed by the straightening ability of this flat iron whatsoever) as well as your hand hurt applying pressure on the handle to try and get the plates to meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to invest a bit more money in a high-quality flat iron with which you will certainly be more satisfied than this one.</li>
    <li> Very impressed.  I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for months, and it has worked flawlessly.  Makes my hair smooth and silky on one pass.  Heats up very quickly - maybe less than 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about 3 weeks. It gets the job done. Leaves hair a little dry but nothing hair serum won&#x27;t fix. It straightens faster and better than my $70 one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this straightener. It heats quickly, and does a nice job on my baby fine hair. I use this the most to curl my ends under, and the curl stays all day with a little hairspray. Item shipped quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this staightener 3 times now. And WOW it is amazing really I never thought I&#x27;d have staight hair that looks good and shines and I cant even beleive it.&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to spent a lot of money for a straightener so I get what I paid for.....&lt;br /&gt;Until now this straightener works so well it freaked Me out.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin color treated hair curly frizzy and its terrible. Have never been happy with my hair and Im 47 yrs old lol&lt;br /&gt;This straightener does what I want it to do. I bought the 1 in. and its shape is wonderful a little heavy but worth every ounce of weight.&lt;br /&gt;It slides thru my hair easily and it so much better than I could imagine.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT. Girls if your looking for a straightener without the huge price this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;I want to get another one for a back up incase they stop selling this one. I love My staightener wish I could post a pic of before and after you wouldn&#x27;t beleive the difference!So HAPPY I have this straightener!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant when I first decided to order this hair straightener because of the mixed reviews it received but seriously, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I had an Andis, this is definitely a step up. I&#x27;m never careful when I straighten my hair, I just do a few quick passes in each section, but I have yet to get my hair caught or pulled. He heats up nearly instantaneously, locks easily, and looks pretty sweet. The size is great for bangs and curling.&lt;br /&gt;If you know that you usually use something more professional and you aren&#x27;t expecting to like this, move on. I&#x27;m sure the pricier \\&quot;high end\\&quot; brands are better but unless you&#x27;re some sort of hair straightener expert you&#x27;ll be satisfied.</li>
    <li> WOW, this little 1\\&quot; Remington straightener doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  My much costlier flat iron died &amp; I saw such good reviews on Amazon about this one, I had to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the temperature gauge. I have fine hair &amp; don&#x27;t want to fry it, when I use heated hair appliances!&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price! A real bargain.</li>
    <li> I have had this for some time and it works well and has manual settings so you can turn it to the temp you want, up to 410 for really coarse hair. If this ever breaks, I would get this same one again.</li>
    <li> A very great product , is easy to use and does what it says! the wide plates makes it easier to use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic straightener - who knew a straightener at this price could be so effective!</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast, does a wonderful job straightening and curling hair. Excellent purchase...</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for  my grandaughter and she loves it.Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> this is a wondeful product for the prize i cant complain, as I plug it in, after ten seconds, its very hot, it has gauges, so you can actually adjust the heat, base on your hair type, when I use this flat iron, it gives me a salon finishing look.</li>
    <li> Cheaper in cost and really good to make hair straight ! Loved it!</li>
    <li> Works better on my thick, wavy hair than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used. It smells a little weird, but the smell didn&#x27;t come off on my hair. :)</li>
    <li> the flat iron came brand new in original packaging; also the flat iron met the description.&lt;br /&gt;the flat iron has a 30. sec. heat up which i LOVE when im running late in the mornings. i definitely recommend this product to others</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the other great reviews who stated they had thick hair.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t attest to the same results.  I have thick and slightly wavy hair.  It will straighten my hair so that it is less wavy but it&#x27;s not the straight silky hair effect that I was expecting to get with a hair straightener. On the default setting of 370 degrees it lets out a smell like something is burning.  That part is minor and I can live with it but I always wonder if there&#x27;s damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> Wow amazing is perfect for any style</li>
    <li> amazing! came here so fast and in great condition! even came with a coupon for hair products! Love Love Love Love! And it seems like a really good quality flat iron!</li>
    <li> I love this products.  I can say All my family use it.  My poor review is because of the price.  I paid 14 Dollars,  Now It costs 30.  It doesn´t have sense</li>
    <li> i love how it left my hair .........</li>
    <li> This flat iron works wonders on 4a/b type hair. The flat iron heats up quickly and does the job. If you&#x27;re not looking to spend tons of money on a flat iron that you only use a couple of times of the year I would recommend buying this flat iron it works very well!!</li>
    <li> This Little Bad Boy is the best and plus it was cheap</li>
    <li> Great, straightens my natural coarse hair very well.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it and is thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> Works great..heats up fast and leaves my hair soft abd frizz free!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine spending $100 on a hair straightener. I mean it gets hot and you run it over your hair. How fancy can it get? This straightener does a good job for the price. It&#x27;s not the smoothest straightener I&#x27;ve ever used, there is a bit of resistance when you&#x27;re pulling it through your hair. That seemed to get better with time... or maybe I just got used to it. My hair is pretty easy to straighten, but I imagine if you have very difficult hair you may want to look for something that gets hotter than this one. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months now and it still works fine.</li>
    <li> Worst hair straighter ever, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Decent hair iron for the price but don&#x27;t expect too much. It does straighten the hair but has lots of room for improvement.</li>
    <li> such a grate. straightener for a decent price,heats up fast and its easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;I love the automatic shut off feature because I&#x27;m an air head..lol Love the temp control and it was exactly how it was described..I would highly recommend it and its nice for both short and long hair hair.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely satisfied with this little straightener.  This tool did the work of a $150.00, salon grade flat iron...for less than $20.00!!  I have very thick, wavy, stubborn, and at times, frizzy hair.  Especially since I just had it highlighted and colored.  So, it took on a little damage with that.  However, it only took me about 5-10 minutes max to completely flatten and style my hair stick straight.  My little metal, El Cheapo Revlon used to take me about 30 to almost 45 min.  I will also add that my hair looks very healthy after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up very quickly to a max temp of 410 degrees, and there is a little switch on the bottom to lock up the plates for storage or travel. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a quick and less expensive alternative to my chi. This product is amazing. My hair is straight and sleek. Recommended to several friends and they bought and agree!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I use it on my brazillian hair and the settings are great! The seller was quick and so accurate! I love everything about it!</li>
    <li> I love this straightner, it&#x27;s not too big or small but just right, and it does what it&#x27;s suppose too. It goes up to 410 of i think 450 in temp which is really hot so be careful when using it, it could burn you. Never been so satisfied with a hair product like this.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair and this straightener works great. My hair is very long and it definitely gets the job done. Plus its a cute color. Win, win.</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron.  It has a digital temp thingy and shuts off after an hour. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it</li>
    <li> My favorite ever!! Heats super fast!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit  i was a bit sceptical about this purchase.  I had been looking for a while. But I decided it was worth the chance for the price. I love it, one pass straightens my curly hair, I love 3 choices for temperature, the digital display is great, auto shut off excellent.  If your looking for a quality low cost flat iron this is for u.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a first time hair straightner.  It seems to do a good job, but it&#x27;s not as good as my Chi at home and it does take longer to warm up.  (like 60 seconds.)</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron so much. It straightens my thick coarse frizzy hair. It makes my hair so smooth and manageable especially my new hair growth.</li>
    <li> My 11-year old granddaughter was born with curly hair.  Like many young girls she hates it and wants straight hair.  Well, this product really did the trick.  When I saw her recently her hair was straight and soft and she looked like a different person.  She loves her new straight hair.  As her grandmother though I think she looks good with her hair either straight or curly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this straightener only a few times and I already have split ends.  It destroys your hair.  Before, I used another of Remington&#x27;s straighteners and loved it.  Do not buy this one - it&#x27;s not even worth the $15.</li>
    <li> Pretty good especially for the price, kinda has a weird smell but works really well. I use it to curl my hair</li>
    <li> Just replaced an FHI flat iron that I&#x27;ve used for years and found this on an amazon.com search.  It was so inexepensive that I thought I&#x27;d give it a try..maybe buy a second standby one in case it dies.  Just tried it out and it works great.  The irons on it are shorter than my FHI...but I can adapt.  I used to take a bunch of hair on the top and use the longer length to flatten more hair at a time..but this should still work fine.  I don&#x27;t have particularly complicated hair straightening needs...just something that does it minimally and heats up quick.  And this works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah..one other thing I&#x27;m undecided on when it comes to functionality.  I think he has a timer that turns it off after being on for a while.  My FHI just stayed on.  I&#x27;d often come back to it the next day to see it still on.  I suppose that is sort of nice.  However, if I turn it on and forget and don&#x27;t come back in a short while to use it, it will turn off and then I have to start the warm up process over again.  Not a big deal I guess.  And it does heat up pretty fast.</li>
    <li> If you have thick, curly hair as I do, this flat iron is a good temporary fix until you&#x27;re able to get a higher quality flat iron. I ordered my Chi online but needed something cheap until it came in. Believe me, you get what you pay for. It took me twice as long as normal flat iron my hair and made my bathroom smell like melting plastic. It&#x27;s a good temporary fix but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a daily basis as I do with my Chi.</li>
    <li> The best and only hair straightener I will buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this hair straightener 5 times so far (from Target and Amazon) because it is so affordable and effective. It has never broken on me. I lost two of them (left behind on vacations in hotel rooms) and now I just like having spares to leave at my boyfriend&#x27;s and at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium thickness Asian hair (silky but on the coarse side) that generally lies flat and doesn&#x27;t usually hold curl very well. I use this straightener about 3-5 times per week to curl my hair or straighten it depending on the look I am going for, and have done so for the past 4 years or so. My hair is still very healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;- easy to adjust settings&lt;br /&gt;- works great for curling and straightening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;??</li>
    <li> Worked okay at first but stopped heating all together after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> Great styling tool. Easy to use. Perfect for young adults and more mature ladies alike.</li>
    <li> Amazing! From my experience this product is comparable to high-end flat irons. For the price i dont see myself using anything else.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener, it&#x27;s a steal for this price.</li>
    <li> Great straight iron, I&#x27;ve had it for years and haven&#x27;t had any problems. It has a digital setting for heat, so it&#x27;s great to select how hot you want the iron to get. It&#x27;s lightweight and does a great job on your hair.</li>
    <li> For my new hairstyle this is the greatest thing in my beauty regime.</li>
    <li> Not picky about straighteners personally...as long as they stay hot and don&#x27;t break. This works great though doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like several I&#x27;ve had in the past and I love being able to control exactly how hot I want it.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and evenly, the digital temperature readout is a great feature. Best flat iron for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for very thick hair i looooove it</li>
    <li> Works great.  Great for the price too.</li>
    <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell of the heating iron. Whenever I turn on the straightener, my room is like a burnt atmosphere.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is very affordable and works amazingly! This is my first one, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money. It heats to the highest setting in 30 seconds and is very gentle on my hair. I have very curly, long, thick hair and it only takes me about 7 minutes to straighten it! It holds all day and is not frizzy at all (as long as I don&#x27;t get wet!) Very worth the money!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Heats up fast, smoothes my hair well.  No complaints.  Hope it lasts for awhile!</li>
    <li> I have straight hair so I only use this when I&#x27;m trying to tame my frizziness. The only issue I have with this is that it&#x27;s a little too hot even at the lowest setting, and it feels like it&#x27;s burning my hair. Plus, I&#x27;m so afraid of scalding myself whenever I try to straighten the hair at the back of my head. Aside from that, I&#x27;m overall satisfied with this hair straightener for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> This straightener is pretty standard &amp; you can get this at the same price in stores like Walmart or Target. This iron does the job!!</li>
    <li> This was the first straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I have thick, frizzy, but curly hair, and this straightener leaves it silky straight. I read a lot of reviews before deciding to get this one, and I am very satisfied with it, especially for the price. It heats up fast, but it does wonders!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. It smooths fly aways and straightened my hair in 10 minutes. I have medium length thick soft hair. I do recommend using the Tresemme heat tamer with it. Target also sells this flat iron for $20 but it isn&#x27;t available on their website, only in stores. This flat iron works better than by $100 one did.</li>
    <li> After shopping around for a week or so for a well-reviewed straightener that also was relatively inexpensive, I bought this one. For me, it was definitely worth the money. It heats up very quickly and I really like the different heat settings available, especially since they have a digital read out of the temperature rather than having to guess how hot a medium setting might be. I have hair that&#x27;s pretty long and thick, but already somewhat straight, just poofy and frizzy due to the humidity where I live, and even on one of the lower heat settings it takes me less than 10 minutes and typically only one pass to straighten my hair. My only complaint is that the locking mechanism for storage on mine never seems to hold.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money!! I love it!! Use to curl or straighten my hair!! Best 15 investment I ever made!!</li>
    <li> This is the only hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned so I have nothing to compare it to really.  I have pretty straight hair already and was purchasing to help tame fly aways and lay more evenly.  It&#x27;s great for my purposes!  It heats up very quickly and I&#x27;ve managed to not burn myself yet.  I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone in the market for a small straightener.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull worth every penny! so slick! I love it!! i was worried because some reviews were bad but its amazing!</li>
    <li> This Flat Iron Is AMAZING....It gets really hot my hair gets bone straight and it also keeps my hair nice and shiny..I JUST received it in the mail today and I&#x27;ve used it twice already.I cant wait to see how it curls. I&#x27;ve had expensive flat irons but these work even  BETTER...Remington is a really good brand I have the curling wand also..You wont be disappointed !!</li>
    <li> me  llego bien , buen articulo, buen vendedor, me llego a tiempo, por ahora todo esta bien, lo compraria de nuevo</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted and expected. Gets plenty hot and isn&#x27;t too wide for my new, shorter hair.</li>
    <li> Firstly, the color is adorable! I also like the fact that it has adjustable heat settings because I have fine wavy hair and don&#x27;t want my hair to get burnt. This works well enough. It heats up quite quickly(about 1-2 minutes) and straightens my hair in one go. However sometimes the plates snag my hair, which I don&#x27;t like. The length of the plates is really nice which means I can straighten larger sections at a time. On a side note, it also creates really nice curls that last for long. If you&#x27;re on a budget, I&#x27;d say go for this. It&#x27;s inexpensive and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quick. Heats up fast and straightens my hair in half the time it used to! Having thick hair its always been a challenge to find a good straightener. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener and I love that it heats up so fast but holding the power button does not turn it off again. I have to kill it&#x27;s power by the plug.</li>
    <li> Bought this from Target after giving up the search for my missing Ion flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I was on a tight budget, and the reviews made it seem worth the risk.  I have mixed (black/white) hair that I relax regularly (3B, for those that go by curl pattern), and this iron works pretty well on it.  I have to set it to max heat to make it work on my hair, but once it reaches the right temperature I only had to go over one section of hair maybe twice at the most.  My hair ends up looking shiny without me having to apply pomade or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and not super picky about how \\&quot;sleek\\&quot; your hair looks, this will do just fine.</li>
    <li> This is a very good flat iron. It straightens very well and gets really hot. There are just better ones. But, for the price, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> i have naturally thick, frizzy, wavy hair. with this straightener, i can finish my whole head within 5-8 minutes. it has so many great features, im surprised how cheap it was. i got it for $14.97. the lowest temp is 310 &amp; the highest is 410. i recomend this to anybody who has crazy natural hair &amp; is looking for a cheap straightener that gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;it also stays straight all day long.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for some magical iron like the salons use.  I use it to get rid of frizzies.  It smooths my hair and that&#x27;s what I wanted.  Would get it again.</li>
    <li> well i bought this because my sister have this one and she got this 3 years ago and still works perfect i dont why my hair straightener makes static but its funny thats why i put 4 stars but is perfect I LOVE CURLS AND THIS ONE WORKS for both things! c: great an d cheap buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good hair straightener. I&#x27;m not a big fan of Conair, but I found Remington&#x27;s to be just the right straightener! It&#x27;s affordable and gets the job done :) Doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up either.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter as part of her 13th birthday presents. It works well with her hair, which is somewhat fine and very wavy. It&#x27;s a great option for her because of the automatic shut off I&#x27;m not worried about it being accidentally left on.</li>
    <li> for an such an inexpensive product, it works wonderfully. It&#x27;s faster and smoother than other hair irons I&#x27;ve used that are more expensive. It&#x27;s light and hits up very fast.</li>
    <li> This iron is so good I don&#x27;t get it why it&#x27;s so cheap. It has temperature control and heats up incredibly fast. My hair is not exactly thin and easy to straight but I only need to use the lowest temperature setting. A couple of years ago I tried a different remington iron and it was also as good as the more expensive ones by that time.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely reccomend this product &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have only owned Chi flat irons because I was under the false impression that they were the best.  With my first Chi the floating plates came unglued and my second one has a short in it.  The biggest complaint I had with the Chi (besides the price) was the cord is just too darn long.  Not so with the Remington.  No more stepping on the cord and jerking a hot flat iron through my hand.  Ouch!  So back to the Remington.  I purchased this because I was not looking to spend that much money if I could get quality for a better price.  There were so many great reviews for the Remington that I had to give it a try.  I can say that I am so pleasantly surprised at what a great job it does on my hair.  My hair is about mid back length but baby fine.  I put this on 330 degrees and it straightens my hair perfectly without frying it.  That is another complaint I had with my Chis, none of the ones I owned had a temperature control (and the fried hair at the top of my head is the proof of that)I would swear the Remington made my hair shiny although I do not know how it did it.  I have way less flyaways than before too.  I love that I can lock the Remington closed when I want to put it away.  The only complaint I have about the Remington is the color.  I know what a silly thing to complain about.  I wish Remington offered this great iron in a variety of colors but for the price I&#x27;ll get over it.  I will never again be a flat iron snob. P.S. (and by the way) I have never in my life been able to go more than 1 day without washing my hair.  With it being so fine it would look so greasy and flat the next day.  I happened upon [[ASIN:B005Q8QKLY Bumble and Bumble Straight Blow Dry 5 oz]] and now I can go every other day without washing.  It&#x27;s amazing.  Combine it with the Remington and you&#x27;ll not have another bad hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find my review helpful please let me know and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them below and I will answer them as quickly as possible.  Thank you for checking out my review.  :)s possible.  Thank you for checking out my review.  :)</li>
    <li> this plate fulfilled all expectations of my girlfriend, is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for perfect hair ironing.&lt;br /&gt;....&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
    <li> This flat iron is inexpensive but does the job of my FHI and Chi that broke.  Love the flat iron this is my first remington product.  Bought for daughter in college</li>
    <li> I own this straightener then bought this one for my sister. It is a good size for long hair. Works great. Difficult to burn yourself. Easy on and off plus auto shut off if you forget about it. When you shut it there is a toggle that keeps the device shut for storage and travel. I&#x27;ve looked at a lot of straighteners and this is a great product with a great price.</li>
    <li> Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener met all my expectations! It works really fast! I love how fast it heats up!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand people who spend 100 dollars on a straightener. This is a GREAT hair straightener! I have really thick curly hair and normally use a 2inch straightener but wanted a smaller one so the I could curl just the ends and this does EXACTLY that!  Really simple and straight forward, it gets nice and hot very quickly. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I just straightened my hair with the Remington S5500 yesterday and I was completely shocked at how well it works. I am half black half filipino and have very thick cury hair and this straightner was able to straighten my hair pretty fast. It took only seconds to start heating up and about a minute to heat up to the set temperature. I was very skeptical about purchasing this product because it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. But it straightens my hair with ease and as well as a more expensive straightner I used before. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is trying to find a straightner that both does the job and isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat  iron for 3 months  now and it works perfect for the price. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my sister in law as well.</li>
    <li> Oh my how do I love this iron, mine finally went out after about 8 years, and this one is so smooth and with my thin hair it works great! I was so stressed over buying a new one- whew!!!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have ever owned! I use to have an older remmington, but that started to lose heat so it was time to buy a new one. This heats up so fast, doesn&#x27;t fry my hair and leaves it frizz free. I definitely recommend this. It curls really well too, better than any other straightener I have owned. It&#x27;s perfect for my thick hair and I love the slim design. I can so all my hair in only 10 minutes with this and don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting frizzy.</li>
    <li> Works pretty damn well and super low price tag!</li>
    <li> A perfectly fine flat-iron. It doesn&#x27;t do the best job ever, but it heats up quickly and is nice and lightweight, which is great for traveling. It also locks shut, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being absolutely cool before throwing it in your bag (and worrying about burning everything in there).</li>
    <li> Great travel straightener.  It is thin, lightweight, and has a lock feature that makes it easy to move around with and store.  It heats up extremely fast!  The digital reader flashes to indicate that the plates are heating up to the temperature on the screen.  I only wish it could be set lower than 310F, but I must say, it straightens hair really well.  I love the peace of mind from the 60 minute auto-off feature. Overall, a great buy for a great price.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive hair straightener, this one does the job.  However, when I press the power button to turn it on, there is no light or indicator that the unit is on, other than the temperature display that shows the temp that the unit is set to.  Then, when I push the power button again to turn it off, the temp display stays on, so I am not sure if pressing the power button has turned the unit off.  It would be nice if there was a light indicating whether or not the power is on.  I just unplug it when I am done using it, so it is not a huge deal.  You get what you pay for, and this is an inexpensive model, but again, it straightens my hair, and that is what I need it for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually really surprised at the high reviews on this flat iron. I bought it because I was short on cash at the time, and although it has high heat settings, it does not work nearly as well as some straighteners I have tried. It takes two to three strokes per hair segment to reach the smoothness that one stroke could do using another brand. I give it three stars because it still works and it is not expensive.</li>
    <li> My old iron broke so I bought this hoping it would be awesome considering how many people reviewed it and it still had a high rating. I was excited because of the price as well. After using it I can see why it&#x27;s so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I had no problem straightening my hair with it. No major pulls or snags. It didn&#x27;t glide extremely well over my hair, but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;- The controls are easy to use and it heats up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;- My biggest problem was the smell that emitted from it while heating up. It was a horrible plastic smell, which I hoped might go away after a few uses. I used it maybe three times and each time the smell was just as strong as before. I could have put up with it, except for the fact that the burnt plastic smell clung to my hair. So through out the day I kept getting whiffs of it. If it wasn&#x27;t for that it would be a pretty decent flat iron for 15 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Also, It was described as having floating plates in the description. Just so you know only one plates actually floats.. the other is stationary.</li>
    <li> its the best straightener i have ever owned</li>
    <li> This flat iron ha worked pretty well so far! I only use it for curling my hair though an not too much because it can damage your ends...</li>
    <li> THis is my first hair straightener. I&#x27;m happy with it. I have long fine hair and this guy works for me :)</li>
    <li> Even though I have ceramic hair straightener, my oldest daughter claimed that she needed to use this specific one for my youngest daughter&#x27;s hair.  I didn&#x27;t see a difference when I used on my hair.</li>
    <li> This works better in my hair than most curling irons. I simply rotate as I pull and whoola I have curls that aren&#x27;t burnt. I also can straighten fly-aways with the same tool. Sometimes I get creases where I start and it doesn&#x27;t do a great job, but worth the money when it does what I intend it to. This works best with a few strands at a time. I also forget to press the ON button sometimes after plugging it in, but that&#x27;s my own forgetfulness :) Overall a good little machine that heats up pretty fast!</li>
    <li> My old hair straightener died and I needed a new one right away-- this straightener is affordable and it works very well!  I flat iron my hair almost every day.  I would definitely purchase this straightener again!</li>
    <li> I never, and I mean NEVER, write reviews. But I just have to for this!! I have bought so many straightners in my short 24 years of life and I have never had one do what this one does!! My hair is so soft and straight! And the only time it ever looks and feels like this is when my hairstylist does my hair for me. I got this in the mail this morning and tried it and I have fallen in love!! Please save the time and effort and just buy this one!! For the money, it&#x27;s great! Love everything about it!! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron as a gift for a 13 year old, (now 15), and 2 years later it still works great. Not only that, I rather use this one instead of using my expensive herstyler flat iron because I have very thick hair and this thing heats up fast and straightens with just one glide. I&#x27;m going to purchase one for myself, you can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this, no static and it does not pull your hair.</li>
    <li> My son uses this to straighten his hair. He says it works well. It heats quickly and is easy to use on &amp;#34;shorter&amp;#34; long hair ... he says the size is good, and he likes that it can be set to a lower temperature. Inexpensive as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener after having to get throw away my old Remington that I had for seven years. I&#x27;ve had it for about four months now and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It straightens even better than my old one and for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I had hoped this would do the job since it is so light, small, and dual current --  all features great for travel.  It really is too small however.  I guess it is meant for short hair, and mine is medium length.  I can&#x27;t judge how it would work if my hair were shorter and/or thinner.  It was worth a try, but I guess it will be headed for a  charity thrift shop.</li>
    <li> Great product, just as described, does a great job, and for a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Works perfeclty, gets yuor hair straight in few minutes! :) Loved it!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener to have in addition to one I already had. My other one is too wide to do any of the styling techniques such as curls or crimps (Pinterest if you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about), but this one is perfect. Much better and more durable than I thought it would be based on the price. Really good straightener, especially for styling.  Update: after over 6 months, I LOVE this straightener even more.  It&#x27;s so good that I actually get rid of my main straightener (which was 5x as expensive). I can&#x27;t believe that such a great straightener cost less than $20.</li>
    <li> very nice for the price</li>
    <li> i cant say enough about this straightener it heats up so fast and works really well. the lowest temp on here is 310 just to let everyone know. after you use this your hair is so soft and it feels great get it now you wont regret it at all.</li>
    <li> My niece with straight hair wanted it staighter, so I ordered this for her for a birthday present - she immediately used it and LOVES it. Cost was reasonable, shipping through Amazon quick, and it was delivered in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Who needs a $90 Chi? This straightener is great! I use the highest temperature since my hair is ridiculously thick and needs a lot of work, and straightening my hair is a breeze! I like that you can lock the plates together for easy travel, too. I&#x27;m never spending $100 on a straightener again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without a flat iron! And this Remington was a great deal. I bought it elsewhere for a few dollars more after my stylist recommended a one-inch flat iron. There were so many options and some flat irons were very pricey. So I bought the Remington because it was my first and I didn&#x27;t want to spent a whole lot on something that may or may not be worthwhile. It turned out to be such a great buy. It hits 410 degrees (and is temp adjustable) and turns itself off after two hours (I think it&#x27;s two hours) if you forget. I use it on maximum heat 410 degrees for this one, and it reaches that fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt; I usually have smooth hair that I blow dry straight. But, living in a humid environment, my hair can get unruly, wavy, flip out and generally be a headache when the weather stinks. My Remington has eliminated that problem. I use a leave-in styling gel (I didn&#x27;t know you weren&#x27;t supposed to) and Fredrick Fekkai cream heat protectant, just a slightly bigger than pea size that I work through my wet hair. After I blow dry, I go over my hair with the flat iron and I&#x27;m good to go, no matter the weather. And it lasts -- no matter the weather. Of course dry weather always is the best for hair, but I appreciate a tool that didn&#x27;t break the bank. I recommend it. Why spend a fortune on a product just because it&#x27;s got the name?</li>
    <li> I hate writing reviews because it takes to much time but this is worth it. I bought this so scared because it was so cheap but OMG , I tried it. BEAT THE SALONS</li>
    <li> I love this straightener so much. My mum took mine which I had been using for two years so I came back and bought it again. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Buen Producto Desde Venezuela Me Gusto Todas Llegaron En Buen Estado Y Valen La Pena Se Las Recomiendo Con Los Ojos Cerrados</li>
    <li> you seriously get what you paid for. If you have curly wavy hair this product won&#x27;t do that good of a job to straighten it.</li>
    <li> Works great heats up fast ! Does the job</li>
    <li> The first few uses were great. Straightened my hair exactly how I was hoping...salon straight. Heat wise is great. Easy to use, manage, its not heavy. After the first few uses it doesn&#x27;t grasp the hair like it did on its original day. I am going to invest in something a little more stronger. Think I was drawn to this for the color. I feel like I got what I paid for. I could still use it as long as I squeeze it on my hair sections.</li>
    <li> muy buen articulo mirandolo desde el punto costo beneficio&lt;br /&gt;es tal como lo dice la descripcon. en terminos generales muy recomendable</li>
    <li> i ordered this hair straightener more than a year ago and im proud to say it works ! At first the first few times i used it it mostly always smelled like burned plastic but it goes away after a while. it really straightnens really good !</li>
    <li> I was actually pretty impressed. Not bad for the money!</li>
    <li> This iron is perfect. The plates do not pinch hair.  I have thick, coarse, color treated hair and this iron flattens completely straight. Get it, don&#x27;t spend money on something more expensive because of the &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> One of my new favorite flat irons. I have nice, fine and middle back length hair so it only takes me 30 minutes to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again if I have too. I also have the Remington curling wand which is very good.</li>
    <li> This flat iron left my hair really frizzy! I hate it and had to go buy another one (which I love). If you are looking for something to help with frizzy hair this flat iron is not it.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of hair that mysteriously got curlier and curlier after I had kids.  And not the super cute, corkscrew, perfect kinds of curls.  Some parts are really kinky, others are mildly wavy... basically it looks bad unless I curl it all, or straighten it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this hair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!!  It effectively straightens all my hair in about 20 minutes (and I have a LOT of hair).  It makes my hair appear more shiny after it&#x27;s straight.  It heats up fast.  I can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about it!</li>
    <li> probably works for girls with wavy or straight hair, but if you have curly thick hair like me you are better off looking elsewhere. I do love the swivel cord and the dials for the temperature and the lock for it so you dont accidentally change the temperature. HOWEVER, it has a really strong smell of burning before you even start to do your hair. It didn&#x27;t leave it pin straight, in fact it was still a little poofy after I did my hair. I had to do a half-up style. Like I said, if you think curly hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but if your hair is more on the wavy side, knock yourself out</li>
    <li> Good. But not for wet hair.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I use it to curl mostly and it just just as good of a job as more expensive ones like the Chi. My sister borrowed and liked so much that I got her one for christmas.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I normally have to wait for at least five minutes before my hair straightener heats up. This one heated up instantly. I also don&#x27;t have to go through most parts of my hair more than once. The price was amazing as well and I got this pretty quickly. Very happy right now!!!</li>
    <li> I was really needing a hair straighter and this one was the best seller in amazon and cheap. So I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely happy with it and I already recommended to some friends.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, works well, tells the temperature and do an incredible job.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener years ago and loved it!! It makes your hair so silky and shiny looking and straightens nicely.  I have this curly more textured hair that is not easily straightened and this does the job!!! Cheap and very effective.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron so much, I have really long thick hair and it gets it from curly to straight in no time. I&#x27;ve had it for two years now and unfortunately the power button stopped working but I&#x27;m ordering a new one because of how awesome it is. I definitely recommend  buying this product. It worked wonders on my hair!</li>
    <li> It gets nice and hot, and straightens hair awesomely! If you are looking for a straightener for cheap this is it!</li>
    <li> I owned a Chi before as well as a Paul Mitchell flat iron. So far..this Remington flat iron has been quite comparable to the two. Again \\&quot;so far\\&quot;. I was not expecting it to work so well being that it is under $15. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the shorter cord. The professional irons have longer cords. But that&#x27;s because it has to be long enough to walk around the stylist chair. I purchased this iron for myself, so it&#x27;s no biggie. It does smell alittle funny when it heats up. But it doesn&#x27;t make your hair smell or anything. I&#x27;m curious to see how long this iron lasts. It does have a 2 year warranty. It&#x27;s sooo worth it. I&#x27;m very happy I bought this instead of another professional iron. However, I would only use this on my hair, not a client&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It works better than it&#x27;s replacement; not quite as shiny as I would like. I will use it until I get my replacement. It appears that I get the same effect on a lesser temperature--I do like that.</li>
    <li> CUTS BACK MY IRONING TIME IN HALF...BOTH MY GIRLS LOVE IT TOO... YES IT HAS A HOT PLASTIC SMELL WHEN IT HEATS UP...BUT DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER ME</li>
    <li> I have gone through plenty of straighteners.. the ones that pull, frizz, fry, turn your head into one of those static balls, the too hot ones, not hot enoughs and worst of all.. the ones that just couldn&#x27;t straighten a toothpick.  But this thing... wow, Remington..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1&amp;#34; is perfect for doubling as a curling iron (Try it, works better than ANY curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used) and the static is non existent, which for me is a maricle.. I create static when I breath and get shocked by EVERYTHING!  And the fly aways are a lot less but I find it makes a lot of the stray straight ups on the top but with a bit of twisting and getting very close to your scalp.. you can get those suckers down.. and then there&#x27;s the hairspray option as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus!! Yes, there is more.. it heats up in 5 seconds flat, no exaggeration. And I mean HEATS up!  It&#x27;s  a bit different with the settings ( goes from 310-410) But I find 340 enough to straighten mine (I have fine hair that gets frizzy, so I don&#x27;t need too much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of story-- AWESOME PRODUCT!! Great price, highly recommended &amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. It works perfect. It gets my hair pin straight and heats up really fast. I straighten my hair a lot so I know what I am talking about when I say that this straightener works better than any of my other ones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small and purple. I like the adjustable heat. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair either. If i got another one i would probably get the bigger width</li>
    <li> I love it,really does its job,but have a little suspicious about the ceramic surface of the plates,i think they are simple ones.What you think about that?</li>
    <li> My daughter received this as a gift for her 12th birthday.  She has medium length, very thick, naturally wavy hair and this is her first straightener.  It heats up fast and she does well handling the smallish size.</li>
    <li> I got this order exactly on time, and have been using it for the past week. It&#x27;s great!! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price, but I needed one pronto and I&#x27;m broke so I just went with it.... Needless to say I don&#x27;t regret my decision.</li>
    <li> Very good. First straightener I&#x27;ve used but my hair is a beast and it helps me a lot. I straighten and curl with it.</li>
    <li> Very nice product &amp; very easy to use. Big Thank you from my side. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I chose this iron to replace my $100+ amazing fast-heating flat iron from Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is almost as good. I honestly can&#x27;t believe how great it is considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my frizzy wavy hair soft and silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I love the price, the color, and the quality of this straightener. I highly recommend it if you have long, wavy, and difficult hair with lots of frizz. You will love this tool!</li>
    <li> Have not used much.  It works great! Would recommend for any one to use.  Also it was inexpensive. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this in October, here it is February and already it quit working!  All I use it for is to straighten my bangs a little every day.  I&#x27;ll be going back to getting the cheapest one I can find.  Maybe it will last more than 4  months.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy and very disappointed that Remington would put their name on this piece of crap!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;:(</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener about two weeks ago, after my other straightener finally died a slow and painful death (that involved some weird buzzing and finally refusing to heat up beyond lukewarm). I&#x27;ll start with the packaging - it sucks. I handed the package to my fiance, told him to be The Man, and was handed back the unpackaged straightener. I recommend you find someone else open yours, unless you&#x27;re into clamshell packaging and/or ripping your hands to shreds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is a lightweight 1-inch porcelain hair straightener. It boasts a 60-second warm-up time, and that&#x27;s no joke. I am thoroughly impressed with the speed of the heat up. The straightener has a power button that you have to hold for a few seconds in order for it to respond. This can be confusing at first, but once I realized I needed to hold it vs a quick press, I&#x27;ve had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once turned on, the user has the ability to adjust the heat to a level that is suitable for your hair. The packaging included directions, which contained tips and a heat guide for your &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of hair. Definitely useful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and while not overly frizzy, certainly needs professional strength heat in order to be tamed into submission. Previous straighteners have done this with a LOT of effort (burned hair, anyone?), and the results never last more than a few hours at best. The Remington S5500 straightened my hair perfectly, and much to my amazement the results lasted into the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool-down time is also fairly quick, for anyone who is wondering. The Remington also has a lock, so that once closed you can keep it that way for storage/safety. Smart, I really enjoy that feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is jsut an added bonus, but really, I adore this straightener. I am so glad to have chosen it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightener that I have ever owned and it simply amazes me away at how little I paid for it compared to others that I have previously owned. Would definitely buy a million times over!</li>
    <li> The hair straightener is valued for money. It is a good product. The one thing I liked the most is its anti static property!</li>
    <li> I just did my hair yesterday, and it works fast and great. It glides smooth, and it&#x27;s fits in your hand well. Sometimes it feels awkward though. I have thick, curly, fluffy mixed girl hair and this makes it pin straight with 2 passes. I think I paid 13 or 14 for it, and I looked around and could not find any with temperature control (much less a digital display) for that price.</li>
    <li> The 1 inch ceramic hair straightener was shipped extremely quick and it works wonderful.  Would definitely recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase the expensive flat irons such as the ones from the chi brand but recently two of them broke which I had for a long time since I&#x27;m broke lol I can&#x27;t afford a $100 flat iron so I went for this one. I felt that I was taking a big risk by buying this since it was really cheap but to my surprise so far it works just as good as my chi ones used to. The only difference is that this one leaves like a burn plastic smell on your hair; however, is nothing to worry about since the smell is very light and it goes away quick or maybe its because its brand new. I do recommended it if you are looking for something affordable and ok quality.</li>
    <li> Light but solidly made, easy to handle, heats up quickly, and works like a charm!  I have shoulder-length, thick hair, and I asked my hairdresser the best way to use a flat iron.  She advised me to &amp;#34;rough dry&amp;#34; my hair (head upside-down, just dry without thought to styling), section it off, and, working from the bottom of the scalp to top of the head, straighten a section at a time.  Takes less than 10 min. to iron.  This has revolutionized my hair (no joke!).  Wish I had this info 20 years ago!  Great item, and am hoping it works in Europe!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen nicer straighteners, but this one is well worth it for the price.  There are a ton of levels and it heats up quickly.  I use this thing every day.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this everyday love the automatic shut off. At the beginning smelled funny however a couple weeks no smell detected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter to replace a Hot Tools flat iron that was broken. She said that this works just as well, and it was less expensive. She has very thick wavy hair and needs a hot iron. This one does the trick.</li>
    <li> Heats up decently fast. I use it to curl and give my bob hair volume rather than straighten. Has snagged my hair a few times but not enough to be a problem. Cute purple color.</li>
    <li> when you see the box it comes in says &amp;#34;heats up in 30secs&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not lying......this flat iron is great!!!</li>
    <li> So, I have long and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;My last straightener was just...garbage.&lt;br /&gt;This one was a birthday gift.  I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can do my entire head in like a half hour or so.  And again, long thick hair.  I section my hair to do it, still done in about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;And the results, really last!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the digital thing, and it heats up quick.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s a beautiful shade of purple!!!  YAY!</li>
    <li> I really love this iron. For the price it does a tremendous job on straightening the hair as well as makes pretty curls.&lt;br /&gt;This iron is very impressive, better than I was expecting. Thanks for all the reviews they we&#x27;re extremely helpful in narrowing it down to this iron opposed to all the other ones.</li>
    <li> My 1st flat iron was a remington brand and I have used it for about 5 years now, and it still works very good. Both me and my daughter use it a lot so i bought this one as a backup. She likes this one better than our old one because it feels hotter and seems to flatten better. I notice my hair doesn&#x27;t glide through this one as smoothly as the old one (the old one was ceramic with tourmaline, whereas this one is just ceramic). Otherwise it really does do the job a little faster. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product its worth every penny</li>
    <li> It is perfect. I like that it is not too thin, so I can move it easily. It easily works on curly hair too.</li>
    <li> Gets hot quick straightens well</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews of others, i went for it and bought this straightener, and i&#x27;m glad i did.  it works absolutely perfectly for the light use i&#x27;m giving it, and i really like that i can actually set the temperature, not just have an on/off indicator light.  great product!</li>
    <li> I have thick Polynesian hair and was looking for a product that will keep it tamed even in humid weather and this was it. A product that works well AND affordable is an A+ in my book!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a Chi or anything, but this is a really good straightener. It gets really hot (I don&#x27;t even set it at the hottest setting) and does a good job. I like the digital temp display. I curl my hair with it too! Somehow it works as an even better curling iron than my actual curling iron haha.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron less than a month ago (not from Amazon) and the temp increase button has already stopped working.  The 370 degree temp works well for my hair since it&#x27;s fairly straight anyway but I prefer the highest temp.  I&#x27;m trying to avoid spending $$$ on a Chi but if I keep spending money on irons that don&#x27;t work to my satisfaction I will have paid for a Chi anyway.  I will definitely make sure my next one has a dial and no buttons.  It is an ideal size, and I like that it shuts off automatically and has the lock.  So the temp button is the only negative, but the 410 was the main reason for buying it.  Get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it came in 1 week early!! I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year now and it&#x27;s never faltered to make my hair straight as can be! Only takes me about 4-5 minutes! I defenitely approve of buying this! (And it looks just like the picture)</li>
    <li> These are better than my previous Conair one. It gets hot really quickly which I love. There is more than 1 heat setting and having natural curly hair I need it to be hot. I was able to do my hair fairly quickly. I used the highest setting it was extremely hot at points my hair was too hot to hold lol so next time i&#x27;ll probably use the middle setting. I am mixed so aside from my hair being curly it is also extremely thick. For the price this is an amazing find. Don&#x27;t let it pass you by.</li>
    <li> Iron gets super hot and emits a strange smell even before using it. Despite the heat, it seems to take too long to straighten my hair which is not thick.</li>
    <li> My favorite straightener. Works amazing.</li>
    <li> Temperature can be easily set. And it is very easy to use. Only need to wait for about 20 seconds</li>
    <li> Great value and does my whole head of hair in well under 10 minutes. I have nothing but good things to say about this one!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is amazing! I bought it because it was cheap, and didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the details, and it is a lot nicer than I would have guessed for the price. It comes with a digital display that shows you what temperature the iron is set at. The buttons are nice and easy to push, and they come with a lock feature so you don&#x27;t accidentally turn the thing off while you&#x27;re using it. The plates are nice and do a great job of smoothing my hair without pulling it. In particular, I really like that the cord is rotatable, so you don&#x27;t end up with a twisted mess when you use it. This product is great and definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s purple, it&#x27;s cute and I like how fast it heats up. It&#x27;s pretty good at straightening but I gave it four stars because it feels like it doesn&#x27;t have a strong grip on my hair. Overall it&#x27;s good and for the price you&#x27;re paying it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these for my 10 and 12 year old daughters. They both love them and are able to use them without issue. They heat up quickly and with the smaller size (1 inch) are very easy for smaller kids to use. With the way they are designed the hinge does not snag hair. I have a larger one by a different company and my hair is always getting caught in the hinge and pulling out. This one doesn&#x27;t. I may even buy one for myself. The price was much better than I could find locally.</li>
    <li> Straightens hair nice and fast.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair go from frizz to almost looking as if I&#x27;ve had a perm. I like that the lowest setting is 310. Sometimes, you just don&#x27;t need a high heat setting to get some frizz out or a straight look. I bounce between this and the other flat iron I have, but this one does the trick for my frizzy days.</li>
    <li> makes your hair very staticy and frizzy/all over the place and has a strong plastic smell when you plug it in.</li>
    <li> It never got hot. The light would not stop flashing. And on my second use, it started to make weird noise and shut itself off!! completely disappointed!</li>
    <li> This flat iron work very well, no complaints. It stinks like bug spray and when your done with your hair your hair smells like bug spray. I cleaned the flat plates with a damp cloth and Dawn thinking it was oil from the machine works. No it didn&#x27;t work. I decided to &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; it off by letting it stay on for 20 minutes, let  it cool and do it again. My bathroom, bedroom and living room smells like bug spray. Not good. Would I buy this product again no. Seller is great</li>
    <li> It might have just been my hair, but when I used this straightener it kinked all of the ends of my hair. Making for a nasty tangled mess. I thought it had fried my hair, but when I tried my other straightener my hair was nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be as good considering the price, but so far this has been a great purchase! I absolutely enjoy the digital capability to be able to lower the temp, 310 degrees is the lowest I have seen. It doesn&#x27;t heat up to wear it&#x27;s too hot to touch the end to help navigate when using.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t light up like the identical one I bought at Target, but works exactly the same otherwise!  $5 cheaper too.</li>
    <li> product as described, made my hair straight, smooth didnt smell like burned! it was less heavy than my coriolis straightner, the long plates are a plus.really loved it!</li>
    <li> Works great for its price my girl loved it (:</li>
    <li> My wife loved it the first time she used it.. Though it&#x27;s not advisable to use constantly on your hair as your hair gets frizzy over time. She uses when ever we go for an outing. Makes her hair straight and bouncy. And it gets heated as fast as 30 sec.</li>
    <li> I had this straightener for 3 years that I purchased at target. It recently shorted out and I am buying again! I love it for putting waves in my hair. Easy to handle and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> with given cost it works good!</li>
    <li> Works well on my dry frizzy hair. Worth my money.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only used them once on my nature thick 4c hair and I love the out come, I would definitely recommend these flat irons to someone else.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It heats up quickly, has a variety of temperature settings, and works like a charm. I can straighten my hair in 5 minutes with this thing (granted, my hair is pretty thin and medium-length). What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this straightener, its nice and light weight, and easy to handle. the temp it perfect and its also a fun color.</li>
    <li> Got this for my ten year old daughter and I sometimes steal it. Works great on her very wavy red hair.</li>
    <li> At 15 bucks it&#x27;s a steal!!  My wife has had it for a couple weeks now and she loves it!!  Remington is a great name and amazon once again had a great price!!  Thanks guys!!</li>
    <li> like the fact that its light and easy to use !</li>
    <li> Works great! Heats up quickly. Doesn&#x27;t tug on my hair. I use it to create waves. The waves are shiny and last until I rewash my hair.</li>
    <li> I like the digital temperature control and how quickly it heats up. Definately gets my hair straight. Would definately recommend it!</li>
    <li> Came in good condition, and still In its original packaging. Works wonderfully, it is now my new favorite straightener.</li>
    <li> Product worked as advertised. It took my short curly hair and turned it into a nice long hair.Gave me enough to do a small pony.</li>
    <li> I used to be strictly Helen Of Troy when it came to hair tools. My chinchillas ate my 70$ straightener so I was in a hurry to find something good and affordable. This works amazing and at a very affordable price, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed. I bought this to take on vacation to Ireland and now that it has arrived it is DEFINITELY NOT dual voltage. False advertising on Amazon&#x27;s part.&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping it to use at home, but I really didn&#x27;t need another one for home. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for several months now and I must say that it works surprisingly well! After having 2 Chi brand straighteners before, I was hesitant to purchase this one. But it was much more reasonably priced and it works the same as the Chi&#x27;s I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener\\&quot; is an excellent hair styling tool and an even better value.  It is lightweight, an attractive color, and very reasonably priced.  It heats quickly; one pass through my fine, medium-thick hair is enough to create a smooth, shiny surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am happy with the \\&quot;Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener\\&quot; as a styling tool to use while traveling, Remington should consider improving several features.  The control switches are somewhat recessed; those whose fingers are not nimble or who have larger fingers may find them difficult to push.  Having those buttons project just a bit further would improve the tool.  When the straightener is heating up, all three bars located on the digital readout flash; once it reaches the desired temperature, the number of bars associated with the temperature shows as solid.  It would be nice if the number of bars associated with the selected temperature flashed while the unit is heating.  Finally, the automatic shutoff time is one hour.  I believe a shorter time would be safer as a fire might start if something flammable was in contact with the unit for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the \\&quot;Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener\\&quot;, but have deducted one star because of the perceived shortcomings.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter. She said it heats up very quickly and it was an awesome price. She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had initially given this iron high marks for durability, high heat, and it&#x27;s dual voltage. I still think it&#x27;s great, but these \\&quot;floating plates\\&quot; are just no good. The surface of the plates have also deteriorated quite badly after only a few months of use - and I only use an iron once or twice a week so it&#x27;s not exactly wear an tear. While it&#x27;s been okay, I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
    <li> This is not a dual voltage flat iron. It appears in amazon&#x27;s search list of dual voltage flat irons but it does not support dual voltage. It supports only 120V.</li>
    <li> I have this more than two years now, it still works fantastically</li>
    <li> Love this product! The fact that the iron gets hot immediately makes this product awesome., I have also noticed that it takes no time at all for it to cool down. Its small size is ideal for traveling. I would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> Excellent The product I came in perfect condition, easy to use! Super accordance ... 100% recommend the product&lt;br /&gt;excellent for curly</li>
    <li> its fantastic.  just what i needed.  very little time consumption and great styling effects.  its makes my hair looks stunning straight.  i have received so many compliments and inquiries too.  some say its a natural look.. sounds good to hear just words..  Definitely makes me professional and young</li>
    <li> This flatiron is amazing!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great. Does a wonderful job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seriously had this for YEARS! It straightens my hair perfectly and lasts forever. I couldn&#x27;t really ask for more! I have bought both my sisters these because it&#x27;s so amazing. I would highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting high quality straightener on a LOW budget. I had purchased a $150 one at the mall back in 2010 and it didn&#x27;t last a year! I hope you purchase it! ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Love this product and it makes my hair soo shiny per my husband!</li>
    <li> Works, but doesn&#x27;t shut off properly</li>
    <li> LOVE this flat iron. When my old iron died I was afraid that I would have to dish out a lot of money in order to get a decent product. Not the case at all with this flat iron. It heats up quickly and gives me salon quality results. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I use this to iron my clothes, haha. I&#x27;m a guy and I have a few shirts that wrinkle in the same exact spot every time I wash them. So I turn this on, wait a few seconds and iron those specific spots. Wrinkle gone. No starch, no ironing board, no bulky iron. Take it in your suitcase when you travel. It&#x27;s a handy tool!</li>
    <li> Good for all its specs and worth it&#x27;s listed price. This is a good product this gives you quality at an affordable price and better than many other straighteners for the same price.</li>
    <li> I am using this straightener as an iron to press silk ribbon when it becomes wrinkled during my silk ribbon embroidery project.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Love this Iron it is light weight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am an avid hair straightener because I have that awesome fizzy wavy hair in humidity and rain.  So I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for a loooonnnnggggg time.  I&#x27;ve owned every type of straightener (chi, babyliss, Sally&#x27;s brand of Chi) and this one heats up the best by far.  The plates are not gapped like most drugstore brand straighteners.  But I&#x27;m on my 2nd one in one year because the first one died.  But for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.  It stays hot and shuts off automatically after an hour I believe.  Another plus.  How many times do you leave the house in a hurry and wonder if your house will be burned down to the ground because you might have forgot to turn off your hair straightener.  So purchase it for how awesome it is!</li>
    <li> The best one I have ever had..thank you..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it left my hair nice. the only think is the burning smell is really noticeable &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Smells of paint! Absolute waste of time. Save your money! I want my money back ASAP! This is crazy.</li>
    <li> Although I initially bought it because I needed something cheap, I have been impressed with how well it works. If you use it correctly, the frizz can be limited.</li>
    <li> I must say this is a really cool product. It heats up awfully fast, which is good. But the best part, which was not written anywhere, that it works with dual voltage, i.e. 110-240V. This is absolutely necessary as we visit overseas locations with 240V line voltage. Good job Remington.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener works great.  It heats up quickly and gets the job done.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I like this little guy. It&#x27;s a lot thinner than my other straightener and unlike my daughters who use these to straighten, I use straighteners to add curls to my hair. My other straightener works really great for this purpose and for straightening, but I got this one because I tried my aunt&#x27;s out when she bought this model and I found I could make tighter, smaller curls with the smaller, thinner wand size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how this straightener has a digital reader and you can adjust the heat easily and you can read what setting you are on digitally. I have three daughters and they each use a different heat setting for their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of this unit can&#x27;t be beat for the quality. This is an easy to use, well made straightener which works wonderfully for the price-if you straighten, add body or curls to your hair. For me, the size makes it easier to use. I have shoulder length, very straight and fine hair. One of my daughters has super thick long hair and she likes this model as well, but it takes a little longer to straighten her hair with it. For me, it&#x27;s faster and easier than my other straighter. I will use my other one when I want larger curls and this one if I want smaller curls and if I want to get ready super fast because it&#x27;s so easy and fast to use.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. If you buy it, make sure you have good straightening spray. I use it on the lowest heat setting &amp; it fails to disappoint.</li>
    <li> Nothing mind blowing ... I have long fairly straight hair and it does straighten it out pretty good on the lowest setting ... I think if i had some kind of styling hair spray it would do even better at taking care of the stray frizzled hairs, but i don&#x27;t really care that much. It works as described so far. Hopefully won&#x27;t break any time soon.</li>
    <li> Got this for my teen daughter and she LOVES it!!  It straitened her hair quickly and leaves it looking shiny.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five is because if you don&#x27;t hold it in a certain spot, it is very hot to the touch.  I would have preferred the entire purple cover would have been resistant to intense heat.</li>
    <li> First time I used this, there were at least 3 people whom I met for the first time (so they don&#x27;t know how my original non-ironed hair looks like) said my hair looks very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it everyday this week, and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any signs of hair damage.  Of course you need to use a great thermal protector with it..</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT, I USE IT MORE ON DOING CURLS ON MY HAIR AND ITS AWESOME. :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Heats up fast. No noticeable  damage to hair.</li>
    <li> i love it! u can str8 ur hair with it or use it to curl...it works amazing both ways!!! been over a year still seems like i just bought it!!</li>
    <li> This little straightner is awesome. Heats up really quickly and smooths perfectly. I&#x27;ve read some bad reviews of it but works great for my thick hair!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a quick replacement to my old flat iron.  I like how fast it heats up but other than that it&#x27;s just OK. I have very short hair and I&#x27;ve noticed that it really doesn&#x27;t smooth my hair I&#x27;m really not so sure they should label this &amp;#34;anti-static&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> So I have tried many heat products from Chi to Revlon...&lt;br /&gt;I have to say for the price this is an amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The Price&lt;br /&gt;-No static, no frizz, no hassle&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts a lot longer than my other straighteners&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth, perfect finish each time&lt;br /&gt;-FAST, I use the highest heat each time with some heat protectors and my hair straightens with one brush through and it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-No sound for when you turn it on&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as other straighteners (but I guess that&#x27;s okay and your hair will thank you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall wonderful product and a great value!</li>
    <li> FINE PRODUCT, BUT NOT DUAL VOLTAGE. Only 120V.  I&#x27;ll have to buy another one that is 120/240 to use on my trip. But this one is a fine straightener for use in the US only.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Chi.</li>
    <li> Great to use and easy</li>
    <li> Smiliar to store brought flat irons but at a way better price. Told friend about this and she also brought a pair. :)</li>
    <li> The first one I received has faulty wiring--the swivel cord would buzz because it couldn&#x27;t keep powered. But after exchanging, the 2nd one works great! When I recently had my hair done at the salon, the hairstylist used one of the new Chi flat irons--I&#x27;m new to using a flat iron &amp; wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it, so I decided to try the Remington one because the cost was so low. Well, not only does this have the same functions as the Chi iron, it works just as fast &amp; the ceramic plates keep the static away so well. I don&#x27;t know how long this one will last--it&#x27;s a fraction of the price that I would have paid for the Chi iron, but I will use it for as long as it works. It does exactly what it claims to do, so I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, she claims it is the best straightener that she has ever had. It seems to work great.</li>
    <li> Works well. Wish it got a little hotter</li>
    <li> I have a CHI and have not been very satified with it, I had read several reviews about different straighteners and this one seems to get the highest reviews. I was a little sketical because of the low price point, but after getting it I am very pleased. Pros: Heats up quickly, the plates are very close together so every piece of my thin hair is gathered, it does not break off any pieces of my hair as the CHI did, short cord, hair is very smooth, style last longer, shuts off after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: if any the temperature only goes to 410 but that is Ok because I have very thin hair. Do not waste your money on an expensive CHI, you will be sorry. Give this straightener I try, I promise you will not be dissappointed.</li>
    <li> Great price for a quality product. Works great on my very stubborn and thick curly hair. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase. I&#x27;m so glad I found this straightener!</li>
    <li> I have had a couple straighteners in the past and they have snagged or somehow gotten caught in my short hair (ear length, almost to earlobes).  Also, they haven&#x27;t been able to straighten my hair, and this was before I bleached my hair into submission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smoothly glides through my hair, doesn&#x27;t catch AND at 310 degrees smooths and flips my hair well.  I was cautious with the temperature but I&#x27;m going to up the temperature a little bit to see how smooth I can get it.  I use Keratin Coppola Complex Infusion Keratin Replenisher, Matrix Biolage Daily Leave In Tonic and Pravana Silk Degrees Shine Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy straightening!!</li>
    <li> For the price this is an incredible value.  Works great.  The heat range options are very nice.  It has a small plastic lock button at the bottom in a place where you are unlikely to accidently lock it while in use (big plus!).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had $100 flat irons that didn&#x27;t work as well as this one. It smells a little funny when it&#x27;s on, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair smell. It gets hot incredibly fast and does a great job. I used to have a chi and I never would have bought it had I known about this one first.</li>
    <li> Best Straightener I ever had, I always got compliment on my hair. Me and my mother would even fight over it lol until it went out last year. Definitely thinking about getting another one</li>
    <li> Not salon quality, but excellent for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this Straightener iron!!!! I brought this when my chi broke after a couple of years, and saw all of the reviews and figured to take a chance. Basically I got the same results as I would with my chi!!!! Yes the design is different and it probably won &#x27;t last as long but come on people its $15. I brought three for $45 just in case it didn&#x27;t last or the price increased.Two years later I&#x27;m still on the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an example of how it works, I&#x27;m an African american with 4b hair,that is soooo thick! When I do straighten my hair with this it looks laid and relaxed,silky and shiny!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much for hair, but works great to iron patches on to my daughters girl scout vest!</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for 5 years now. Bought it at Walmart for 20$. Best iron I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve wasted money on some expensive ones. Definitely affordable way to get your hair curled or straight.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you twist the straightener while pulling your hair through, it curls your hair.</li>
    <li> excellent value for money. great product. I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> Cute little straightener. Everything I thought it&#x27;d be, gets really hot fast and straightens like a charm :) Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I was too cheap to spend 100 bucks on the CHI air which is an amazing hair tool. I bought this, with shipping and handling came to 20 bucks. I have to say I wasnt disapointed but I was not thrilled either. I plan on using it over the course of the next couple of months and have it as a back up straightener.</li>
    <li> OKAY! to be honest, I&#x27;ve only used one straightener in my life and that&#x27;s a wet to dry from target. I&#x27;m going to college and thought it would be great to get something new. I didn&#x27;t have my hopes up because nothing really worked for me except this one kind. my hair is wavy sometimes and then curly others and is always frizzy when i do anything but air drying. when i used other straighteners it would poof out and look horrible. when i used this i was VERY surprised! it worked amazing! its a cute color, great size, AMAZING price! i would buy this one again! it may not be for everyone but it was a great buy for me! the heating is in degrees which is hard to adjust to but i think its way better ! GET IT!</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and leaves my hair so smooth and straight! Love it!</li>
    <li> much to bulky, hence awkward to use. It heats up to much</li>
    <li> For some unexplained reason my hair had gotten curly with a lot of cowlicks and waves. I had never used a straightener before so I decided to try this one because it was inexpensive. After using it for a few weeks I know there is no need to buy a more expensive model. I am so pleased with the results. My hair is thin and fine and I used the 370 degree setting. It leaves my hair silky and shiny and is the best styling tool I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;There are two things about it that are a disappointment however and prevent me from giving it that 5th star. The first is that it is does not have dual voltage capabilities which was stated in the ad. The second is that there is no shut off. I thought the power button would take care of that function but it doesn&#x27;t. I have to unplug it to get it to shut off. I have not left it on to see if the automatic shut-off works but there should be a way to shut it off instantly.</li>
    <li> this product heated fast but beacame hot on the edges but this is a great product for teens who would like a pretty and efficient straightner</li>
    <li> I was looking to switch to a 1 inch flat from my 2 inch wet to straight. My hair is shorter, with lots of layers and it can be hard to straighten with a 2 inch, but since I&#x27;ve started using this I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
    <li> I received this straightener on time and as expected.  This is the third hair straightener I&#x27;ve had, all are Remington, but this is definitely the best one.  I love purple so that is a plus, but it doesn&#x27;t take long at all to straighten my hair and it&#x27;s thick and long.  My last straightener was the Professional by Remington and it was bad about snagging my hair, which is why I wanted to get another one.  My hair is also really shiny after using this one, not sure if it&#x27;s the straightener, but my hair was never this shiny before.  I would absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> The item was received promptly and was exactly what I had ordered. I also purchased a neutrogena hair cream to protect my hair against damage. I liked the straightener and it does work very nicely, but I did notice it dried out my hair alost immediately after use. My last straightener left my hair feeling very soft and shiny, this one leaves it in a nice style but very dry and easily tangled. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, fortunately, but when I do I have to leave my hair several days to recover. It is a really nice straightener but make sure you have excellent hair care products to bounce back from the damage.</li>
    <li> I really like this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate when I read a review that says \\&quot;good for the price\\&quot; because since it is only about $15 it gets me worried but this iron is great AND on top of that it is a really good price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quick and I like that it is digital so I don&#x27;t, by accicent, change the heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont like my hair slick straight, I like it more wavy. I like that with this iron with just one swipe it was straight but not too straight and with two swipes ti was REALLY straight. Now, It really all depends on hair beacsue my hair isnt curly to begin with but it isnt slick straight either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complicated. I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it! its a great buy. Lightweight and portable too.</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron. It&#x27;s the very first one I own. I&#x27;m AA and when I stretch my relaxer and have something I gotta attend and not planning to relax, it lays  my new growth so well! But i must say it takes a  couple passes but at first I was so afraid to burn my hair I didn&#x27;t do it properly. When I learnt it does the job that I want it to do and it straightens so well and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.  The color is fab! And I love the fact that it has the digital heat adjuster which can lock at the temperature that you know you are going be using. What I don&#x27;t like though is that after 5 uses, one of which was on my own hair, one on natural hair and the rest on relaxed hair the silver ceramic plates already look a tad eroded. Thats why I Gave it four stars? It&#x27;s  not that visible but I&#x27;m a aware of those little details. It doesn&#x27;t affect the way then item works though. Very good beginner flat iron in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this if you want a cheap alternative.</li>
    <li> I use it almost every morning and it gets the job done. My hair starts getting wavy again by the late afternoon though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this. It&#x27;s a pretty good straightener for only $15.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
    <li> Love it -- still going strong.</li>
    <li> I know that a lot of women spend LOADS of time on their hair, etc., but I&#x27;m more of a fastest path of least resistance kind of woman. I want to look well-kempt but I don&#x27;t want to pay the time. My hair got wavier and frizzier when I moved to a slightly different weather pattern and it was making me a little crazy figuring out what to do with it. My niece recommended a straightener so I sifted through A LOT of options online, reading reviews and rating, and chose this one. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use it regularly (and because WHY would I want to?). This does a good job, hasn&#x27;t burnt me once, is quick, heats up fast, and cools off quickly, too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my grand daughter, she uses it every day before she goes to school.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best gifts I bought her</li>
    <li> After a year it only turns on. The buttons to turn up the heat no longer work and the heat quality just isnt good anymore so im buying a pricer one to see if they will last longer. Also I dont use it often maybe 4 times a months so it just doesnt last long.</li>
    <li> This straightener is perfect for my hair. It leaves my hair really smooth in comparison to my old straightener. The only thing I had an issue with is that for some odd reason when it&#x27;s on, it smells like burnt rubber?</li>
    <li> After one use, it no longer turns on. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works well and get&#x27;s my hair super straight. Where as normally my hair takes over 30 minutes to straighten i can do it in about 10 with this one. It is inexpensive and the quality well surpasses the price!</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair so straight and it even lets your hair straight for like 3 or 4 days. I really recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons. I was in the market for something cost effective yet durable and I&#x27;ve found them. They heat up quickly and work for curls or if you want your hair straight. Great for both weaves and natural hair. Very nice product!</li>
    <li> So I ordered this flat Iron and I must say I think I got ripped off ! Tricked ya ! &#x3D;) I think I did the ripping off, This product performs above and beyond what I was expecting. For less than $20 I got my money&#x27;s worth. Think I want to order 3 more just in case something happens to this one that I have &#x3D;). I&#x27;m sooooo In love, I must say this is a huge step up from what I was used to &amp;#34;GoldNHot&amp;#34; flat irons that would always melt on the side, and the plate would crack snagging my hair as I glided through my Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews made me get it, I must say that I am a Product Junkie so Seeing all the great reviews I had to see what the hype was about ! An I must say now I know. These Flat Iron go up 410 Degrees, and its Lowest setting is 310 Degrees. It only takes 30 seconds to heat up, You don&#x27;t need to have it up so high, One pass through your hair should be enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m in the process of going natural so I&#x27;ve never used it on me but used it on my natural Little cousin&#x27;s hair and It Straightened her hair soooo sooo good. After Straighten her long extremely thick  hair I noticed the shine it gave her hair, it was nice and soft, shiny, and straight didn&#x27;t take long to straighten her almost waist length hair. There is an automatic shut off after 60 minutes, which is good for those of us who rush  then once we leave the house realize &amp;#34;ooops&amp;#34; I left the flat Iron on !!!! So Now worries there. Soon will try this with my natural hair. So far so good. No Need to go out and get a Chi or a Pricey Flat Iron This does the trick I promise. I&#x27;m into hair I even tested this out on some 100% Human Hair Blend, For those of you who aren&#x27;t familiar with that term, It is a Human hair, and synthetic hair  blend of hair. Now this hair Was created on a wig, and if you know anything about Synthetic wigs or hair you know how the tips get all ratty looking right ? This flat Iron Straightened it right on out and I was able to give it a Kim K. Kind of feathered curl, and It flowed nicely and brought the hair back to life. If I told you I paid hundreds of dollars on that hair you wouldn&#x27;t know that I wasn&#x27;t telling the truth!I Absolutely recommend this Flat Iron 100 times ! Great quality for a Great price, don&#x27;t sleep on Remington. You guys better get it while the getting is good, Next thing you know Remington will be to expensive for us Lol. But Truly great great quality for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;*Keyed curl, and It flowed nicely and brought the hair back to life. If I told you I paid hundreds of dollars on that hair you wouldn&#x27;t know that I wasn&#x27;t telling the truth!I Absolutely recommend this Flat Iron 100 times ! Great quality for a Great price, don&#x27;t sleep on Remington. You guys better get it while the getting is good, Next thing you know Remington will be to expensive for us Lol. But Truly great great quality for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;*Key</li>
    <li> Bought this for my bf for x-mas... After purchasing a diffrent hair straightener from a diffrent seller that didnt work I ended up having to rush to get this one. It arrived on time and was well packaged. Works great, he loves it :)</li>
    <li> You can easily select the temperature you want for your hair.  I have fine hair and needed a lower temp option and this straightener has it, 310 degrees.  It heats quickly, is light weight and smooth. The latch which holds it closed is handy for storing. BOTTOM LINE -Great straightener for anyone, especially fine hair.</li>
    <li> Okey I have really thick unmanageable hair, and all the other straighteners I&#x27;ve ever owned wouldn&#x27;t straiten it, and even if they did it took hours and never lasted the whole day, but this one dose and it straightens really nice! i would def get another!!!</li>
    <li> I was using the same straightener for too many years - upgrading to this one (and at a great price) was a treat!!  Very smooth and glides through hair.  Does the job for my relatively thin, smooth hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron by far is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t burn your hair and it straightens my transitioning hair really well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! I was looking for a new one because my other one was starting to not get as hot as it use to (had it for 2 years) and I saw this one. I first liked the color bc purple is one of my favorite colors. Then I read a ton of reviews and saw how many people liked this particular straightener. I figured for the price, why not? I just got done using it and my hair looks and feels great. The straightener gets really hot really fast and works amazingly!! It also cut the time I used to take to do my hair with my other one in half! This is by far the BEST straightener I have personally ever used. I would definitely recommend this to people who want a great straightener for a good price. It&#x27;s worth it, I promise :)</li>
    <li> Great flatiron that works wonders on my hair. I am ethic and i believe in healthy hair this flatiron is better than my other flatiron that i actually put money into. This flatiron was also a must buy for me because its my favorite color PURPLE!!! I defiantly recommend!!</li>
    <li> i have really big frizzy hair when i used this straightner i was amazed that i didnt have to spend over twenty bucks to get a great quality straightner i was very impressed</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant on buying such an inexpensive straightener because I have very wavy/frizzy hair. But, I read all the reviews and decided to try it. I am so happy I did. This is a wonderful product. My hair is silky smooth after using it. And I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the plates like it has in all my other flat irons. This is a great straightener, try it!</li>
    <li> I love this $20 flat iron more than the one I spent $150 at the mall 4 years ago. You can adjust the temperature, it has a swivel cord, and it heats up super fast. My hair gets even straighter than with the flat iron I spent $150 on. People keep complimenting me on my hair and asking me what I&#x27;ve done differently. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new flat iron.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an inexpensive iron that delivered a good quality result, and that would automatically power down because I can be a little absent-minded. I love the different heat settings so I don&#x27;t fry my bangs, and the price was amazing - $15! And it works really well. I actually expected that I would have to send it back because of the price, but I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the seller, I was guaranteed to receive it by Saturday, and received it on Friday. All around great transaction.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, this straightener manages to straighten my hair to a wonderful fresh perm like texture.&lt;br /&gt;I have little to no complaints concerning this product with the exception of the facts that :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can get a bit hot to hold in the middle section of the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;The placement of the buttons aren&#x27;t the smartest design out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re straightening, because you have to hold toward the bottom (because the top is a bit hot),&lt;br /&gt; your fingers can sometimes turn off the straightener or turn up or down the heat.</li>
    <li> My grandmother bought this for me and it works really well! My hair turned out very straight in just a few strokes. Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Smells a little like burnt plastic the first time you use it though, Haha.)</li>
    <li> I was really surprised when I got this straightener because I purchased it as a replacement of my old one until I could afford a nicer one. It works really well. Heats up fast. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair unless my hair is really dry and not fully brushed out. A really good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I have had several expensive flat irons, and none of them have worked as well as this one.  This is such an incredible deal, and excellent quality product.</li>
    <li> Very nice hot iron, I can straighten my hair in such a short time now. I love how you can change the temperature to whatever heat you&#x27;d like. And it was quickly shipped to me.</li>
    <li> My daught has very thick hair and this is one of the best hair products i have bought for her that she not complained about..</li>
    <li> This flat iron has a mind of its own, it gets up to 350 and when not in use or gets too hot it turns itself off. Plus it is sleek enough to fit anywhere.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!  Lightweight, easy to use, allows user to regulate temperature in degrees as oppose to a &amp;#34;high or low setting&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Works as well as some of those expensive brands out on the market.  This is my second one, have one at work.  Whenever this one dies I will definitely buy this same type.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!  It&#x27;s a great size for travel but also works well on a regular basis.  It warms up quickly and works just as well as more expensive hair straighteners.</li>
    <li> Works well, could have bought it for cheaper at walmart.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works really well!</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m From Dominican Republic and here we always go to the Hair Salon for a blowout because its not so expensive, and we are use to it. A year ago I moved near the beach and been looking for alternatives so I can have a nice hair at home, since I go so much to the beach and do exercise. This flat Iron is the best thing that happened to me, I have short curly hair and this flat iron leaves my hair so soft as it is when I go to the hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!! I&#x27;m amazed!! And the price.... AWSOME!</li>
    <li> I love this! Got it for very cheap. It&#x27;s very light and easy to use</li>
    <li> Works great.  There is no memory on the temp setting, so the temp button has to be pressed 2-4 each morning unless you need the hottest setting.  Also, there is no OFF button.  The power button only turns it on.  It has to be unplugged to be turned off.</li>
    <li> I love this straighetner! It&#x27;s also a good hair curler! :)</li>
    <li> I do hair and I&#x27;ve been looking for a good flat iron that won&#x27;t mess up for the longest. I&#x27;ve been scared to order anything due to negative reviews. I hate I waited. My package came in four days (: !!! And it works !! Nothing is broken Lol. I tried it on my hair and it&#x27;s worth what I paid for. I&#x27;m most definitely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This thing heats up in no time (a minutes or less), but I only use it 310 degrees, which is the lowest heat setting.  My hair is fine and this irons it out in no time.  It&#x27;s easy to use and, for the price, quite the bargain.  I can straighten my hair in a quarter of the time it took me to do it with the hair dryer and a roller brush.  I don&#x27;t get flyaways and my hair stays straight all day.</li>
    <li> I own 4 flat irons (including this one)--a $200 GHD, a $80 T3, a $60 Wigi (Black Friday Ulta special) and this guy.  I *can* tell that this doesn&#x27;t glide across my hair is nice as the pricier models, but for the price, this is absolutely fine. If you&#x27;re going to flat iron your hair every day, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this (unless you have already pretty straight hair).  I have extremely curly hair so it takes a LOT of work and I don&#x27;t want something that I have to pull across my hair several times.  Great value though.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my daughter, after our old one burned out.  This iron was about 1/2 the price of similar irons in our area.  I like the quick heat up and auto-off features.  I also like that you can lower the heat setting on the iron.</li>
    <li> Remington made two versions of this: a dual voltage one and a 110v one.  Though the Amazon site (and indeed the Remington site that I googled) claimed it was dual voltage, it arrived and was single-voltage.  That was confirmed by Remington tech support.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, works just a good as the higher end flat irons for my hair. I like the color as well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 3 years now (it was around 17$ back then) still as amazing as I first got it, very affordable and works great I recommend this to everyone all the time because it not only straightens your hair but also can curl as the edges are slightly rounded. If you hold it closed it almost looks like a curling wand. 2 in one product plus ceramic plus it has an automatic 60min turn off built in, all for this low price I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Really happy with the product. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Its a good buy for the price, but it makes my hair really staticy if I don&#x27;t use heat protection products.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for..</li>
    <li> heats up just fine. Does not take long to heat up. Awesome for curling your hair as well</li>
    <li> Best quality for its price.</li>
    <li> Works great. I have thin straight hair, but I use this to help tame flyaways and to straighten out my hair after it&#x27;s been sitting in a ponytail or bun.</li>
    <li> as expected. Works well and heats up fast....</li>
    <li> Works so well!  Be careful, though- it gets really hot.  I put it on the same setting as my old one and smelled like burnt hair for a little while afterwards.</li>
    <li> I had to wait three weeks for this hot iron to arrive and was leaning towards cancelling the order; nevertheless, it is phenomenal. I used it the very first time on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it was unbelievable. The hot iron has several heat settings (the lowest is 330) and that is the one I used. At first I was afraid it would singe my daughter&#x27;s hair, but it didn&#x27;t. It straightened it out with just one passing and it was completely straight and burn-free. After two days, her hair is still straight and not at all frizzy or dry. We would definitely recommend this to our friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about two months and I have really thick hair and this has to be the best straightener I have ever used. It takes me about half of the time it used to. doesn&#x27;t pull my hair and the length of the plates is great!!</li>
    <li> First time straightening my hair with a flat iron and i liked the results.The setting allowing you to control how hot it gets is great.I recommend this</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price of this flat iron.  Even better it actually works!  I was pleasantly surprised by how well this product worked.  It heats up really quick and straightens my hair in one pass through.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener almost exactly a year ago and I&#x27;m back for a second. No, the first didn&#x27;t die; I just want a second one to keep in my travel bag. This hair straightener heats up quickly, offers an easy to read digital display, and comes in a fun color. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> For 20 bucks this is amazing. I have a pro straightener but it&#x27;s old and doesn&#x27;t have auto turn off, which I decided I needed as I kept forgetting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others say, it heats up quickly and is slim enough to curl your hair with too.</li>
    <li> This Ceramic hair straightener is the best I ever had!&lt;br /&gt;I have been slave of hair salons and hair dressers for 20 years...I never trusted myself enough to do my own hair or my 8yo daughter. I purchased this product to replace my old ceramic straightener at first I was skeptical because of the price but I read other reviews and said to myself: this many people cannot be wrong and I just went for it! I must say I do not regret it one bit! My daughter and I have not been to the hair salon in the last 2 months saving us $170 a month. My hair is permed and my daughter has very thick natural hair. Our hair is completely straight, shiny and have a professional look after each use! let me tell you this is the best Flat iron I have ever bought! This is a true bargain! Go for it!</li>
    <li> Does a great job! I have very wavy hair and this does a great job with out having to spend a ton of money.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is great! Makes my hair silky and shiny and straight the whole day. What&#x27;s not to love about it? 5 STARS!!!</li>
    <li> For a really cheap straightener, this one is great! Heats up fast and does the job quick! i wouldn&#x27;t suggest spending a ton of money on another straightener, this one is great!</li>
    <li> This is a great little flat iron. Got this for my younger daughter. It heats up fast and flat irons her hair in no time-especially compared to our old flat iron. Also, it doesnt create frizz like the old one (you would have to hold the old one in one place.  She can even flat iron her own hair now</li>
    <li> Love this straightener. Light and easy to use, adjustable heat settings, and easy to read LED on top. Great product value.</li>
    <li> Pretty flippin&#x27; great. After my last straightener caught on fire last week (yup...billowing smoke from behind the plates, loud crackling, the works) this is great. In all honesty, my mom has one that is exactly like it and it&#x27;s held up to daily use since I moved out of her house almost 5 years ago and glides through my sister&#x27;s natural hair with ease on one of the lowest settings, so it&#x27;s a powerhouse. Arrived quickly (gotta love that prime) and works fantastically. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a straightener leave my hair looking this sleek and feeling so smooth in a long time, at least since I moved out of my mom&#x27;s house and stopped using hers! For the price, exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like myself again! :) Would recommend to anyone in search of a straightener.</li>
    <li> Got this for $15 on amazon. It&#x27;s a great price for a okay flat iron. It heats up in good time, straightened my hair okay. Obviously it didn&#x27;t work like a CHI or Rusk and understandably so because its like one eighth the price. But if you are looking for really cheap flat iron that can actually straighten out your hair in a decent way this is good. my hair is medium thick and it got straight but not dead straight. it also didnt take long to work through my entire hair which is about medium length.&lt;br /&gt;what i really didn&#x27;t like was that the iron itself gives this burning smell when on. not overly unbearable but still there.</li>
    <li> This is my first straightening iron and it works great. I have tons of super thick wavy hair and this does an awesome job.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my girlfriend as a spare to use when she is at my house. Now she uses it more than her main one. She liked the selectable temperature know, and how thin it is. she said that the thinness makes it easier to do her hair with.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because it came up when I searched for 220 Volt European straightener. Got it in the mail and it doesn&#x27;t say that anywhere on the box or on the straightener. Just says 120 voltz (United States). I&#x27;m not even going to bring it with me on vacation because I know it&#x27;ll just fry to second I plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a decent flat iron for the longest. Although the best ones are the &amp;#34;professional/salon&amp;#34; flatirons, this one works wonders. It is very affordable, it heads up in about 20 to 30 seconds and you can change the temparture on it. The maximum temperature is 410 degrees I believe. Another great thing about it is, it is my favorite color. Highly recommended. By the way, I am an African American female with really coarse, thick hair even with a relaxer! This flat iron does the job I need it to do.</li>
    <li> awesome hair straightener for the price. I&#x27;ve been using it a few times and it does an excellent job !</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome flat irons... love how super fast it heats up! Digital setting...auto shut off if idle too long... ceramic .. hands down this is a super steal... quality is awesome.. shipping was fast... happy buyer!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! my daughter and wife likes it so much! Its a good value for money,Heats up to the required heat quickly.</li>
    <li> We ordered this product because it had good reviews. Used it when we received it and are very happy with the results. It hears up very quickly and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this, and was very suprised. It is very high quality. It does a great job! It is the best straighten I have purchased and it heats up in less than 30 seconds! I recomend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a straightener before and haven&#x27;t used it on my hair but I&#x27;ve been pleased using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Very convenient and easy to use hair straightener.  It does heat up quickly and gets extremely hot, so be sure to run it quickly through your hair and don&#x27;t linger (especially if your hair is fine).  I like that it has a clasp at the back to keep it closed and the controls allow you to raise or lower (or turn off) the temperature.  However, I am not sure what the actual tempurature settings are as they are not digital.&lt;br /&gt;This device does not turn off automatically, so remember to either push off the power button or unplug it.  All in all, can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and medium length and this iron did an okay job at straightening my hair. I would compare it with an Andis straightener with Andis being a bit better. The color is nice, the swivel cord is a plus, and I like how you can set different temperatures. Now for the dislikes. After a couple of months of use, it started pulling my hair and it seemed not to straighten as well as it did when I first started using it and I only lightly used it.  In the end, I had to buy another one because my sister spilled water on the iron and the water got in between the plates and caused some scary buzzing. Also, I experienced getting my hair straightened with a Babyliss Pro straightener and the results were dramatically better so that&#x27;s what I am buying next.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to tame the frizzies.  Works great.  I was borrowing my daughters 3 inch straightener, but that was too wide for my shorter hair.  This size is perfect for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using the same straightening iron I&#x27;d had since middle school (I am now 25 years old). It was expensive when I bought it and it worked so I figured I might as well keep using it. It took me forever to do my hair, it took forever to heat up, and it left my hair really crunchy. I thought that&#x27;s how straighteners just worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister saw me and was like GIRL WHAT ARE YOU DOING and showed me this thing. I was so impressed, I ordered this on Amazon Prime (yay 2 day shipping!) the same day. I am in awe. This little gadget lets you adjust the temperature, it has a salon-type cord that rotates, and the best thing is that it has an auto-shut off so if you accidentally leave it plugged in, you don&#x27;t have to worry. It heats up super fast, too. No more doing my entire morning routine (including eating breakfast) while waiting for a straightener to heat up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leave my hair silky and shiny and it straightens my hair in 5 minutes, if that (I have shoulder-length hair). I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it. The purple color is cute too :) I&#x27;ve had a bunch of straighteners in my life and this one is by far the best. And it&#x27;s not as expensive as some of the other &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; straighteners, either!</li>
    <li> This flat iron it amazing, it works really well and straightens hair the quickly. It heats up quickly and straightens the hair without causing too much damage.</li>
    <li> I got this 6+ months ago, and to this day it works like a charm! I don&#x27;t think there is one bad thing I can say about this product, other than when you are using it on it&#x27;s highest setting (410 degrees) The handle does become semi hot. I have thick wavy hair, and this straightener plows right through my unmanageable hair. Great for beginners and armatures alike!!</li>
    <li> I just got this product today... &amp; so far, I am soo happy I purchased it. It works well on my hair. I also tried it on futura fibers hair as well. :) I LOVE IT &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price. If I have any problems later on, I&#x27;ll make an update on it. This thing is awesome. :)</li>
    <li> I received this product in perfect condition and it arrived quicker than expected! However, it runs a little too hot (nothing less than 310 degrees). It slightly burned my hair, but thankfully the damage was not permanent.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other irons in the past.  Used a $100 Japanese brand iron, and own a $60 Bedhead brand; didn&#x27;t do much for my fly aways and gave me some static unless I used a finishing product.  My hair has tons of fly aways this iron tamed them.  Worked great in my daughters hair, which she was blessed with from me.  This iron works just like the $100 iron!!  BEST VALUE EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this product really quick.  It heats up fast.  You can see the temp on the digital screen. This is a great buy for the price..</li>
    <li> I am a strong proponent of hair conversion therapy. While some naysayers decry the process as prejudiced pseudoscience, frizzy-to-straight conversion therapy has been proven to work. This Remington S5500 uses a system of behavioral modification, psychotherapy, and reparative therapy to turn those frizzies straight.</li>
    <li> Recommended product. It has nothing to enviadar to other hair irons, heated faster, and smooth without pass again and again</li>
    <li> this straightener is the best I have own. I used Revlon and Conair but this is the best. when I go to my hairdresser he uses rusk... this straightener keeps my hair straight for about a week just like his but rusk is in a category by itself. great product even better price!</li>
    <li> I have to say I am very very impressed with this iron!  I have very fine hair that tends to get frizzy flyaways since I live in hot and humid Florida.  I use this product on the 370 degree setting as recommended by another buyer that has fine hair. Let me tell you.. even after 24 hours of non-stop rain my hair looks perfect and straight!  I took it recently to Washington DC and used it daily, knowing I would be outside in 90 degree weather all day, my hair looked perfect in every picture!  I highly highly reccomend this product and for the price it doesn&#x27;t get any better!</li>
    <li> This straightener is such amazing quality for the price! It has awesome features, like the digital screen and lightning fast heat-up time, as well as unexpected touches for the price point, like the swivel cord. Also, it gets super hot! I was never able to get my hair stick straight with my former Andis straightener; it just didn&#x27;t get hot enough, and it took for freaking ever to heat up. But this heats up immediately and, on the highest setting, gets my hair perfectly straight with just one pass through. I feel like this helps minimize any damage to my hair, because I only have to go over each section once and don&#x27;t have to hold it for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the outside of the straightener is curved, so you can&#x27;t really put it flat on its back. Maybe not a huge drawback during normal use, but it would be nice to be able to unplug and set it down to cool in a way where I wasn&#x27;t a little worried the plates might touch whatever surface it&#x27;s on (which is how I feel when I put it on its side).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, for this quality and this price... I would suffer through a lot worse, believe me.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener to curl my hair actually - it does just that.  I like the digital display of the temperature and my ability to adjust that according to my desired outcome.  This product would receive a 5-star rating, however, it has a horrendous smell.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I adjust it to a lower temperature the straightener STINKS!  The smell is a mix between burning plastic and some sort of chemical before it even hits my hair (so no - I am not smelling my own hair burning).  So, yes I get the curls I want from this product, however, my hair ends up smelling like the product which is extremely embarrassing.</li>
    <li> This thing does it all- a nice lock in for storage, the easy to read temperature screen, adjustable temperature settings, light weight, its thin plates make it easy to get close for an easy, close up straight look. Just remember to NOT wrap the cord around the straightener- it damages the cord. This straightener makes a long, hard task easier by its thin plates and variety of temperature. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Love the digital settings. And will fitveasily for travel, heat and cool settings with one touch andvyou are ready!! Good product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to use on an infrequent basis.  I have used it a few times at 370F which is considered a medium setting.  I have thick but not course hair, and this setting works extremely well.  It actually leaves my hair quite hot to the touch, so I could probably even take it down a few notches.  This iron straightens my bob-length hair in under 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up in under 2 minutes and has a locking function for storage.  If I had a ton of hair this would be a poor choice due to its size, but for my short hair it works great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener because mine was too large to straighten my bangs... now I noticed that I use this one more than my original! Gets hot and does the job quickly, and I have a lot of hair so that is greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Remington! You make my life easier. and my flowing locks even more flow-y.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but my friends sister is a hairdresser and this is the one she has. She uses it in my hair all the time so i know how it works. It works well on processed hair, mixed chicks hair, weave, everything. Its a really good iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the high ratings and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. I&#x27;ve never really tried a high end straightener so I don&#x27;t have that to compare to, but this is far better than the drugstore brand I had. Since my hair is very prone to frizz, I make sure I put a layer of hair spray on before flat ironing.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener! I&#x27;ve been using a crummy hair straightener for as long as I can remember, and finally decided to purchase myself a new one. The main requirement that I had was ceramic plates and temp controls which this product has both. It&#x27;s light and the purple looks just like the picture! In terms of how quickly a person will get split ends, I believe that it depends on a variety of different factors (how frequently you straighten, if you&#x27;re blow-drying and straightening, how high the heat temp is, and whether or not you&#x27;re using heat protector of any kind on your hair). I read somewhere that as you straighten your hair you should use the lowest possible heat setting, and aim to do one slow pass of the section of hair instead of going over the same part several times. I also use a heat protector and don&#x27;t straighten my hair every day. Thus far I&#x27;m very happy with the product and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I must say this strightner is amazing. I only paid 20.00 with shipping included. Ive had the same conair strightner since i was in 8th grade &amp; when it finally atopped working i had no idea what strightner to buy next. My grandma bought me the infiniti &amp; i hated it. It made my hair so frizzy &amp; dry. Then i was debating on getting the chi strightner but didnt want to pay $100.00 for one. I looked for days on websites &amp; finally found this one. Im so glad i decided to get this one. Its amazing &amp; makes my hair look so smooth. What used to take 2 hours to do my hair now tajes 45 min. Including blow drying time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used expensive straighteners in the past but couldn&#x27;t afford one this time.  Besides being a little rough to pull through my hair, this straightener works as good as the two I had before it. The only issue is that it makes my ends look a little like straw so I just curl them under with a curling iron.</li>
    <li> This works fine to get your hair more straight after blowing it out but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for styling. I wanted a new hair straightener after having my old one for years but after trying to do my normal styling with this I decided to turn it off and go back to my old one for that.</li>
    <li> I have always used regular curling irons until I got my latest sassy hairstyle which required the hair straightener. Only because I&#x27;ve never used one of these, did it take me some time to get used to how to straighten without leaving lines in my hair, but it really didn&#x27;t take me too long..and for the price of this one, it works great! i don&#x27;t have a problem paying for a great product..much more than I paid for this..but why do it when the reviews were so good! I love Amazon and product reviewing that so many take part in!</li>
    <li> this is a really good hair straightener. it heats up really fast and is very easy to use, which is definitely a thumbs-up. You might think that for such a good price it is bad but that is actually the opposite. I have thickish naturally wavy hair and the 350 setting works amazingly.</li>
    <li> As my old trusty straightener neared the end of its natural life, I began shopping for a replacement. I had planned to get a CHI, but in the course of researching models and prices I came across this one. I was skeptical despite the positive reviews, but at only $15 I figured the investment was minimal so it was worth a shot. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? I&#x27;m glad I did because it works great. I have shoulder-length medium to fine curly hair, and I straighten it nearly every day. I got a ton of compliments on my hair upon switching to the new straightener. I use it on the 370 or 390 degree settings, which is sufficient for me and gets the job done quickly. My stylist has commented that she is really impressed with the condition of my hair. The iron heats up quickly and shuts off automatically after an hour so I don&#x27;t need to sit at my desk all day and worry that I forgot to unplug it. I honestly have no complaints at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not super difficult to straighten, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that this would be suitable for someone with very coarse and unruly hair, but personally I am really glad I found this before shelling out for a CHI.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting,  but it&#x27;s pretty good for the price. I would&#x27;ve rather pay a little bit more for something better.</li>
    <li> heats up lightning quick, very easy to use, does have a plastic type smell the first couple of times you use it, but it seems to go away</li>
    <li> I have curly hair &amp; it works great.  It&#x27;s fast &amp; easy.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend the money for a CHI, this is the straightener you would want to get.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare them to, but they&#x27;ve been great to use, do the job fine, and I really like that you can choose the actual temperature instead of just picking a setting between 1 and 3. The plates are a little close to the edge so you risk catching your hand on them, but that&#x27;s the only criticism I have!</li>
    <li> Love my Remington S5500 hair straightener.  Used it on my shoulder length hair and the smoothness and no pulling of the hair was unbelievable. Good product for the price. Will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is my second flat iron, a replacement for a Conair oldey that I had borrowed from my mom. The Conair didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as I would like, but was still a really great product. I have very curly, thick hair (I&#x27;m biracial, black/white, if that helps). For years I would go to the salon to get it permed, then went natural, and decided to just get it straightened. I didn&#x27;t think I could get it as straight myself. Well this flat iron is AMAZING! I can&#x27;t believe I only spent $16 on a flat iron that I think works just as well as the pricier ones (my stylist uses the Chi brand). It has an auto shut-off, the plates spring back so I can squeeze tightly without killing my hair in the process - NOTE: there is some uneven spacing since the plates are so long (see one of the pics), but I just squeeze a little tighter and they clamp together. And a nice added bonus is that you can lock them closed for travel. LOVE this feature.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve played with the temperature settings, and get great results at 375 and 410. No need to singe my hair if I don&#x27;t have to. I do have to blow dry first and then I add a &amp;#34;flat iron perfector mist&amp;#34; by Garnier Fructis, to each piece as I go. I&#x27;m sure any heat protecting serum would work. Overall, fantastic product for the price, would DEFINITELY recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener!  I used my sister&#x27;s $100 CHI straightener just a few days before I opened this one.  I loved the way the CHI made my hair super straight and shiny in no time.  So when I used this one for first time, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be as good.  Boy was I glad that I was wrong!  Same exact result!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old hair straightener and I am loving it! My old one was ceramic but this is higher quality. It heats up so fast and it doesn&#x27;t destroy my hair! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Good flat iron. My hair is all natural and have been for 3 years now. No perms, no dyes. And it really do straighten my hair. I usually turn it up to 390 to 400 degrees and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Coming from a high end salvation army purchase, I thought I was living the high life. Until sadly one day my expensive find crapped out on me. Not knowing where to start I asked my cousin, a hairstylist, which brand was a keeper she suggested a pricey straightener. Being the cheapskate that I am I turned to trusty ole amazon. I came across this straighter, agreeing with the color and ceramic-e-ness of the plates i bought it. Not expecting much I plugged it in. Once it heated up to the assumed appropriate temperature I went to work. It hardly seemed like work. The plates are smooth and glided across my golden locks like butter. What would have taken a couple passovers with my previous straightener, I was achieving curl on the first try. The price is right for the amount of awesome this product produces. Boo-ya.</li>
    <li> Great price, great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product. Wanted something very affordable but good quality, so purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up fast. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for 3 months now and it still does exactly what I need it to do. It gets super hot and you can adjust the temperature up to 410 degrees. It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to handle and I love the color. It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for :) It&#x27;s affordable and it gets the job done quickly. I can straighten my hair and curl it with this iron so it&#x27;s good for more than one styleI try not to use it too often because as you know no matter what all flat irons can cause damage to hair if it&#x27;s used to often but aside from that it&#x27;s a great flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love Remington products. I love this flat iron and for this price, it still gets the job done. It gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t leave dents when straightening.</li>
    <li> kind of damages your hair. does the job though if you just need it as a backup iron.. . . ..</li>
    <li> I bought this item. As soon as I tried using it on my hair, the plastic around the straightener starting melting onto my hair!! Very awful, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> i WAS concerned about this product after reading reviews, but it is a nice flat iron. I have the most rough hair and it lays my hair nicely.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is very good. It gets hot super fast and it goes up to 410 degrees. I would have given it 5 stars because I wish it wouldn&#x27;t get as hot where u hold it closed. But other then that its great.</li>
    <li> Works well, heats up fast and I love the automatic shut off feature as I have a nasty habit of leaving stuff on!</li>
    <li> Just got this yesterday and I have to say I already love it. Works great I have thick wavy hair that has a mind of its own. Love the locking mechanism, perfect for traveling or putting in a drawer.</li>
    <li> This is a great cheap iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat control is great.  Only beef is that I feel like my hair sticks to it a bit.  My chi had much smoother plates.  Otherwise, pure gold for the price.</li>
    <li> I picked up a $50 Chi at a local discount store and was not happy with it. I purchased this one for under $15 and couldn&#x27;t be happier. This the 4th flat iron I&#x27;ve owned and by far the best.</li>
    <li> One of the best I have had. Heats up fast and works very well on my hair. Leaves it shinny and smooth</li>
    <li> Really liking this straightner</li>
    <li> my teen girls like it a lot</li>
    <li> Cheap and does the work!</li>
    <li> Flat irons are a natural girls best friend or worst enemy. I&#x27;m honored to tell you that this little purple double bladed gem and I are getting BFF bracelets engraved tomorrow. Man, what a fantastic device this is! First off, I&#x27;d like to coat this review with a little back story on my hair. For the first 12 or so years of my life, my parents greased, hot-combed, shampooed, and conditioned my hair every 3 or 4 weeks. And at that stage my hair grew like a weed. Luscious locks of well-loved hair sprouted from my well-cared-for scalp. If my hair was growing almost divinely, then hell hath no fury like a virgin relaxer. And like hell does best, it burned. My scalp and my divine locks of love were toasted, roasted, and lying dead in the sink not even a year later. Ever since then it&#x27;s been an embarrassing battle of trying to get back all of that love and adoration I got for having such  gorgeous hair. I lost friends, I lost respect, I&#x27;m pretty sure even my dog rolled her eyes at me once. So like a woman scorned (and burned too) I just gave up and decided that anyone who judged me by how I looked was a shallow idiot with no sense of self worth. And that may partially be true but I now understand that that view was more of a reflection about how I felt about myself and how low my self esteem had gotten since relaxer-gate. So after years and tears of living in the lie that &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care how I look, and anyone who does is a dummy&amp;#34;, a compliment from a coworker inspired me to try something new and gave me a much needed new outlook on beauty. As much as I hate to admit it,  beauty and fashion are core values to me. I adore creativity and living without my first expression of my creativity for so long left as burnt-out as my hair was. Suffice to say, this device&#x27;s smooth glide, beautiful appearance, easy temperature control, and easy styling options helped me once again take pride in they way I express myself through my hair. Thanks to this device, much like it&#x27;s easy tohandle temperature controls, I now realize that I have control over how my hair looks and how I present myself to to world. Thank you Remington! And Look luck to all of my natural, relaxed and everything else in between sisters who are struggling and overcoming just like I did.</li>
    <li> Quailty product at a great price; nicer than the one I have myself. May have to upgrade mine in the near future.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It makes my hair look great, it heats up quickly, and also cools down quickly. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now with no problems. Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I also use it to iron my shirts in the morning when I&#x27;m in a hurry. The size/shape is perfect for ironing a shirt collar.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this straightner from Target, and I used it forever. It really worked well, and was a great price. I decided I was going to stop using my mom&#x27;s and get my own, so I look up the same one. It looks the same, but it definitely does not work the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, there is a display screen that shows the temperature setting. The screen blinks blue till it is completely heated to the temperature you selected, then it should stay solid blue. Mine never stays solid, I like it at the 410 degree temperature, and it will not heat up that high. It won&#x27;t even straighten my hair without making it frizzy, and my hair isn&#x27;t that hard to straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it smells terrible. It smells like burning plastic. I can&#x27;t imagine that you&#x27;d want to use something that&#x27;s burning, no one wants to burn their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I am not happy with this purchase. I basically threw it away like the junk it is!</li>
    <li> Worked great.....for the ONE time I got to use it. The next time it was dead. And I waited too long to return it :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, and it seems pretty solid....but I&#x27;m guessing not since mine died. Could have just been a defective one.</li>
    <li> I had tried several cheap flat irons over the years, until I bought this one at Target about 2 years ago. It still works great (most of the cheaper ones only lasted a few months), and I used it almost every single day. I literally could not live without this. It stays hot even after I turn it off, which is perfect for doing a second pass over my hair and feeling confident that by the time I am done, it will have cooled down enough for me to leave the house without worrying.</li>
    <li> I have african american natural hair and straightened my hair for the first time with this. I didn&#x27;t expect it to actually work, but it got my hair straight with lots of movement and shine! Really impressive for being so cheap! Too be honest, I don&#x27;t plan to straighten my hair too much so if it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a really expensive one, I doubt I&#x27;d feel cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that it shut off a few times after it sat for about a minute, but I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was for safety reasons since I had to stop a few times or, because I had it cranked all the way up to 450 or what. It was bothersome, but heated up fast so still ok.</li>
    <li> this flat iron is awesome!, my chii cord got destroyed by a dog so i needed a replacement quickly. its heats up very well though its not a good as a chii ( doesnt leave hair as smooth) it still is very high quality and gets the job done well. especially for 15dollars. very professional (coming from an african american female)</li>
    <li> I am still using this a year later. Great product. I usually keep it around 350 degrees and it works perfect. I have rather thick hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s by far the best thing I got from Amazon so far! I bought it in 2011 and it still works perfectly! I have wavy hair and it works just fine, sometimes it might get too hot so be careful! ;) great deal!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair straightener for my daughter and she really like it.it gets hot really quick.</li>
    <li> I ordered it and love it. Im giving it 4 stars because it says static guard but when I straighten my hair I&#x27;m still having static issues. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this this straightener for over 6 years (purchased on Amazon in 2011) and it&#x27;s still going strong. It is narrow enough to use for curling and reaching those smaller/shorter hairs. I mostly use it for adding waves and fixing my bangs. Overall great product, will definitely buy again if my first one ever breaks...at this rate I&#x27;ll have it forever!</li>
    <li> bought this for a cousin of mine..she loves it..says it&#x27;s great...love the heat adjustments...it&#x27;s a good buy and i would recommend</li>
    <li> The search for the Right Item just ended after having this Unique Item.Excellent Product &amp; Very Fast Shipping with High Quality Export Packaging. Many Thanks. Strongly recommended to have and experience.</li>
    <li> Besides the smoke from the flat iron, I believe it&#x27;s the type of oils I put on my hair, they really work well.</li>
    <li> I have always used the CHI iron, but my sister swore by this product. I bought it and I have to say it&#x27;s so much better than the CHI. It&#x27;s literally a 1/4 of the price and your hair gets super straight.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. Heats up very quickly, rotates well on cord, and an incredible price. I have very thick hair and at 390, it only takes one or two passes to straighten. The last flatiron I had prior to this was from a CVS, probably 10 years ago, and I can&#x27;t BELIEVE how much better and more convenient this one it!</li>
    <li> If you need hair straightener and curlier, this product is the best and cheapest. You can also use it for to curve your hair. High quality loved it!!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Hard to beat for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly good straightener for the price. The auto shutoff is a necessary feature for a household of forgetful people and the temp settings have a nice range from gentle heat to sizzle. My only complaint is that there is no shutoff button - it has to be unplugged to manually turn it off, and it&#x27;s necessary to press and hold the button to turn it on - not always an easily accomplished task in the morning before coffee. It&#x27;s smooth on the hair and works great to straighten or make loopy curls.</li>
    <li> it is amazing ！！！get one girls!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Easy to use. Met all of my expectations. I especially love the digital reading. Gives it a more unique look than other irons I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> This thing is AMAZING! I love it. Granted my hair is fairly straight as it is so I only use this for a touch up, but this is just a fantastic straightener. The swiveling cord is a god send, it heats up in a minute or less, it gets really hot (I even used it once on my pants in place of an iron) but you can turn the heat to different levels depending on your hair and straightening preference. I have also used this straightener to curl my hair multiple times and it comes out looking great. I would definitely buy this again and when I bought it, it was because a friend who also has this straightener, recommended it and loves it as well. The straightener is an outstanding quality, especially considering how little it cost me. I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good quality flat iron for a great price!!! It does as it says. Although I&#x27;ve only used it on extensions and not my natural hair.</li>
    <li> Works great..funny smell. Heats up very quickly! Replaced my Chi with this one, and you can&#x27;t beat the low price.</li>
    <li> it does ok for the price</li>
    <li> Updated review after owning for about two years: One of the plates stopped working for no apparent reason recently unfortunately, but I will probably repurchase this. Only other issue was that it took a while to heat up, normally about a minute or more. This is a great straightener for the price. Feels somewhat cheaply made, but is light and easy to use, store, and travel with (especially because of its slim thickness and plate lock). I can straighten my hair at a lower temp with this flat iron than I needed to with others (I have finer but thicker medium length hair and can use 330 successfully), so I feel like I&#x27;m damaging it less. It&#x27;s not amazing, but very good and meets my needs! I also love the longer plates. My friends like it better than their more expensive ones. The only problem I have with it is that it does not heat up in 30 seconds for me. I&#x27;ve actually timed it several times and it takes over a minute.</li>
    <li> AWESOME quality! I was a little hesitant on buying this from amazon, but the price was too good so I went ahead and did it. It heats up SO quick and turns off automatically, which a lot of women..or men..should love! Hair doesn&#x27;t come out all staticy or dry looking. Comes out sleek and shiny! Very very happy !</li>
    <li> Works great. Cheap, heats up fast, and it straightens my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> The best Hair Straightener!</li>
    <li> I am very happy to order one them . I have used many other hair straighteners earlier but none of them had the quality what this one have. Its easy to carry. It is super light to hold. Straightens the hair perfectly in  one shot . you need not do it repeatedly to get it straightened. I would definitely recommend everyone to buy it .</li>
    <li> easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;extremely hot</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a long long time now. It is awesome.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and good quality</li>
    <li> I already owned an expensive flat iron (2inch) but I cut my hair short and was in need of a narrower iron to handle shorter hair.  I also didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot.  I went for this one because of the high rating and price, and I have no complaints.  In fact I&#x27;m impressed with the digital reader, the quick heat-up, the auto shut off and the swivel cord. One of the plates has a give so that it makes more contact with the hair when pressing it closed.  There were some complaints about both plates not moving, but I haven&#x27;t found an issue with it. One pass will get my hair totally straight and it only takes about 5 minutes from plugging in to straightening a pixie cut.  Its nice and slim and easy to travel with and put away. If you are looking for the same things, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great item! My hair I must say has been looking pretty awesome since the purchase</li>
    <li> These flat irons work better than my last pair. I like that you can see the temp. On my old ones it was just high low and med. what i hate is the smell. It smell like something toxic. Sometime the smell is too strong. I hope it eventually goes away.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the money. It straightens well and I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the issues other reviewers have mentioned about crimps where you clamp it down on the hair. I did notice the smell the first few times I used it but the smell has gone away. I would recommend to anyone with one condition - the outside area where the heating elements are gets really hot. You can&#x27;t hold onto the straightener there, you have to hold onto it on the lower area. I sometimes like to hold the area outside the heating element just for a tighter squeeze on my wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this flatiron! I got it Freshman year of college and six years later the buttons have started to get finicky (I have to press them a certain way to turn the iron on and it occasionally smells just heating up). I decided it was time for a new flat iron and NOTHING beats the value of this iron. 6 years and I used it nearly every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got the new one and never realized how worn my previous flatiron was. It still worked pretty damn well after 6 yrs as I was using almost daily.</li>
    <li> My previous iron broke and I needed to purchase another one fast and cheap. Found this at Walmart and had my doubts. However, it works fine. Heats up quickly and provides enough heat to straighten my coarse wavy hair.  The downside is that the handle gets pretty warm.  I also think the handle is too long and it doesn&#x27;t clamp down quite tight enough.  Yes, there is a burning smell something close to when you turn the furnace on for the 1st time after summer.  However, it&#x27;s tolerable.  I&#x27;m hoping it goes away with use.</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT... WILL RECOMEND..</li>
    <li> I love, and I mean LOVE, this straightener. Do not let the cheap price fool you. It&#x27;s a double win. It is the best straightener I have ever had, and I used to use Chi and then another fancy brand. This is so much better. I&#x27;m honestly confused as to why it received some bad reviews because it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s receiving bad reviews because it &amp;#34;burns your hair&amp;#34;...... Uh. I&#x27;m sorry, that&#x27;s the whole purpose of a straightener if you really think about it. You can adjust the heat. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> The heat settings on this straightener are what sold me; the last straightener I got did not have options and fried my hair!  This one is very adjustable and works for all hair types.  I has a good weight to it and straightens my frizzy hair easily.</li>
    <li> I have never had a hair straightener work until I bought this one. One of my girls has very curly stubborn hair and this works great on her.</li>
    <li> It heats really fast and It straightens real curly hair straight. I would recommend it to anyone. love it and it&#x27;s cheap too.</li>
    <li> I wasnt impresa i wish i could one better ir was disapointing suposly it was supposed to be awsome nd it wasnt  good ir geeks to fake</li>
    <li> It heats up really fast, although the plates get too hot to hold sometimes. But for $16, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, course, wavy hair. My hair same out perfectly straight and shiny. Other straighteners have done a decent job but I have had to touch up the next day after sleeping. Ii straightened my hair on Monday and it is now Thursday and my hair still looks great. I have gotten up the last 3 mornings and just brushed and sprayed my hair. This straightener is great and well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I needed a flat iron to travel with, so I bought this sucker at Target. I already have a [[ASIN:B001LF4I8I Remington S9950  Shine Therapy  Moisturizing and Conditioning Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener, 1\\&quot;]] (the blue one) and love it, and since I didn&#x27;t see that model in the store I bought this one. What a cheap piece of crap, it does not compare in the least to my other one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--This thing stinks, literally, when it&#x27;s on. You will think you forgot something on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;--It says that it has floating plates (plural). That is a lie. Only one plate floats and the other one is rigid. Also, you need to really squeeze the iron hard to get both plate surfaces to meet completely. Otherwise they only meet at the tip and snag your hair.&lt;br /&gt;--The plates don&#x27;t glide well to begin with and are prone to snagging! (see above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are problems that I have never had with any other flat iron. Ever. I don&#x27;t care how much it costs, this is a piece of crap at any price.</li>
    <li> I researched quite a bit before purchasing this straightener and it definitely paid off.  It heats up super fast!  Even with my, very thick, very wavy, long hair, I&#x27;m done in less than 10 minutes!  Great price too!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before making a decision to purchase the Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static Hair Straightener.  After my first use I knew I made the right decision.  It serves the purpose with very little effort and my hair remains straight regardless of the humidity.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This straightner works really well but it smells like smoke when it is on. Besides that smell, it does its job! I would recommended, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> My first flat iron was a Remington Wet to Straight when I was in 8th grade. That straightener lasted 7 years before I broke the cord. It was no surprise that when I needed a new one, I looked for Remington. My roommate at the time tried to talk me into getting the in-styler which I think is around $100. We purchased our straighteners around the same time, and she even said mine worked better. I live in a ridiculously humid/hot environment, and my hair previously wouldn&#x27;t even stay straight. With this straightener even sweat doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizz/curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t underestimate, and say this is the best straightener for the price. It is the best. period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this straightener over a year now. I still love it.</li>
    <li> This product gets SUPER HOT, but the plates are not very good for my type of hair. It didn&#x27;t hold on to the hair very good and it was not good at making my hair very straight. I would return them, but there&#x27;s a fee to do that and the fact that I&#x27;ve already used them. Maybe I&#x27;ll gift them to someone else that likes them</li>
    <li> I have tried straighteners in the past with no luck. None of them really ever created enough heat to do anything, not the case with this straightener! first off I have long, fine hair which is pretty much straight with a little bit of a wave. This product makes me hair PIN straight, almost too straight! it definitely works! heats up fast, straightens very well in little time. It does pull on the hairs a little bit but it&#x27;s not too bad. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this! highly recommend to anyone who wants super straight, shiny hair in no time</li>
    <li> WOW is all I can say about this flat iron. It is just awesome, it heats up soo fast and maintains that heat range. I also love the smooth texture, great if you want to do styles using the flat iron. The lock feature is pretty cool as well, so storage isn&#x27;t a problem. I love it for its cheap price and it is a must buy for the service.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price but this really is a great flat iron. The color and design are nice and sleek. I have fairly straight, fine hair so it worked great for me.</li>
    <li> (treezy8769&#x27;s fiancee) I havent busted out a stopwatch and timed the heat up time with a thermometer to verify, but it seems to take longer than advertised to get hot enough to use. Item did arrive quickly and brand new in the original box. It is still a very good straightener so far. Time will tell if this great deal turns out to be a case of \\&quot;ya get what ya pay for\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that it wouldn&#x27;t be as good since the price is so low but so far so good. The straightener works great for me. I&#x27;ve only had for a month though. But even if it fails I won&#x27;t be too upset since the price was so great.</li>
    <li> The heat up as soon as you turn them on. They have a auto shutoff after 1 hour for safety. When a straightened a friends hair , came out so straight and silky. She loved it!</li>
    <li> I have been reviewing and searching for a flat iron for a long time and this one is awesome, i love it... i am a beautician and this product gives me more than enough confidence to give my clients the best services ever. It heats up to 420 degrees and it even has a lock to keep the flat iron closed when you&#x27;re not using it. It automatically turns off when it&#x27;s not used for a certain period of time to avoid any danger when you&#x27;re not watching. I love this and i would highly recommend this to anyone wanting or thinking about getting it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little straightener.  I only use it occasionally so I&#x27;m not sure how it holds up for everyday use, but it heats up in like 30 seconds and stays really hot.  I haven&#x27;t messed around with the temp, so its still set at the manufacturer&#x27;s temp (370 maybe?).  But that seems sufficient to get my hair straight.  I have thick wavy hair, and this baby works like magic.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> The flat iron works fine but when I opened the package one section of  the wire was like it was melted into another part. I had to literally cut it apart.</li>
    <li> Works as good if not better than $100+ straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past!</li>
    <li> Worked better than expected</li>
    <li> The biggest problem I have with this is that the plates don&#x27;t meet up evenly. My hair is quite thick and slightly wavey, but mostly straight near the ends of my hair. It tends to snag once I reach the thinner portions of my hair (the ends) which can be aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works well. Gets the job done quickly and heats up in only a few seconds.</li>
    <li> This is a very inexpensive straightener, and it works just as well as the top dollar ones. It even comes with the movable plates so that you can curl your hair. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I always have to ask my friend for a straitener! It sucks using her straitener every single day befor school! So i decided to try and find one like hers, unfortunately couldnt, but u came across this one, and i recieved it last night&amp; so far i am in love&lt;3 haa :p but it works so good! My hair has been strait all day long! Usualy it starts to go wavey but not with this beauty&lt;3 and the beat part is the color mathes my blow dryer&amp; brushes :p haa</li>
    <li> Mom seems to love it!</li>
    <li> I love this iron! Easy to hold. Heats up very quick. I use this to get my hair a little more straight and also to curl it. Works great!</li>
    <li> I originally got this for my unruly bangs. I wanted something thin enough so that I could have more control when I straightened them. It worked out perfectly for that as well as for my short hair. I haven&#x27;t used it in a while, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would do with longer hair. I know several reviews mentioned a smell when it was turned on. I did smell it slightly at first but it went away after the second time I used it. I love that it heats up very quickly and I did not normally need it hotter than 310, but it does go higher in case you need it.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave these flat irons 4 stars was because nothing is perfect, but these are close to it. I gotten these flat irons a while back and they still work good as new. I have thick corse hair and they are unbelievable. these are the BEST flat irons that I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had my old Con Air ancient straightener since high school. I had developed a pretty sappy sentimental bond with it, so I wasn&#x27;t sure ifa new straightener could measure up.&lt;br /&gt;When I got a pixie cut, I needed the thinner style of straightener to grab onto the very short hair, hence purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been GREAT! Heats up in under a minute, you can choose your temperature handily, and it always turns itself off faithfully if I ever forget to unplug it.</li>
    <li> There is no reason to pay $90+ for a hair straightener - this one works great. It heats up fast and evenly, and it gets very hot. It eliminates friz and makes my hair nice and shiny. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The straightener does its job -- heats up fairly quickly and only takes one or two passes to straighten. However, the bottom part of the device where you typically use your hand to clamp it together gets REALLY hot, to the point where I burn myself pretty badly on the skin between my pointer finger and thumb, even though the straightener isn&#x27;t on too high of a temperature. I use it as a backup for when I need to shower and get ready for work at my boyfriend&#x27;s house, so I only really need to use it once every few weeks or so. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase as my main straightener though.</li>
    <li> Awesome price for something that works just fine ! Just put the right temperature that fits your hair&#x27;s texture and you&#x27;ll have a good result</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her new hair straightener.  This one is much better than than her old one that she lost---and it is half the price!  She loves the digital display, and says it is softer on her hair.</li>
    <li> I am growing out my hair form a pixie cut, and I finally have enough hair to upgrade from a tiny one setting straightener. I love this straightener, and the adjustable settings. It also heats up so fast! I haven&#x27;t tried the higher temperatures, I&#x27;ve only used the minimum which is 310 and it works for me.</li>
    <li> I got this a couple of weeks ago and it works just fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t compare it to the $100 hair straighteners they use in the salon, but those get so hot that I wouldn&#x27;t want to use them on my hair everyday anyway.  My hair is already straight for the most part though so I don&#x27;t know how this would work for someone with very curly or course hair.  Works great for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very good with styling products but this has been a dream to use. Had it at my doorstop in a matter of days. I even use it to iron the collar on my scrubs. Unconventional I know, but it works</li>
    <li> This straightner works great.  Nice size to handle.  I like the fact that you can lock it into a closed position.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price.  It is awesome.</li>
    <li> I got this product and i was very excited. This works ok to straighten hair but there is a few problems. One problem is when it is on it smells up my house, not the smeel of burning hair, but of burning plastic. I thought that is was just because it was new, and that after a while it will stop but i have had it over a month and used it many times and it will not go away. Another problem is that if you have thick course hair, i will take you much longer to straighten. There is a thing on this prduct so that you can lock it, i got mine and it does not work, i read the instructions and it still does not work.  What is good about this product is that it is very durable. I has fallen on the floor 2 0r 3 times and there is nothing wrong with it.  so if you are looking for a straigthener that works but has minor thing wrong with it, this is the one for you, it is a pretty good straightener for the price  Update:  I have had the straightener since 2013 and it is still working and I love it! of course it is worn out because of its age but it is still amazing. I can do my hair in a matter of minutes. I have think here and it only takes me about 25 to 30 minutes to finish! GET THIS STRAIGHTENER!!!! It is the cheapest and it is amazing!!!!! I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> What a waste!! It broke just after two months of using it! I am so frustrated and disappointed with this purchase. I wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! Well, actually I use it to curl my long hair (it&#x27;s the only trick that works to keep my hair curled...hit up youtube to learn how, lifesaver for stubbornly straight hair). It&#x27;s very affordable and my friends who have purchased much higher priced irons found this worked better for them when they borrowed it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener! Works great and goes all the way up to 410 degrees! I have frizzy hair and have a hard time getting it all to stay in one place without a good flat iron. This straightener does the job perfectly, especially for something so cheap.</li>
    <li> Great straightener for the price, acutally probably better than the price conveys. I have used it many times, it straightens my hair nicely and have even used to make big curls and I get a ton of compliments on. I have frizzy, curly hair and this works wonders. So happy I bought it...and at this price, can&#x27;t complain is something happens and I need to get a new one...but so far working like a charm. Definitely recommended</li>
    <li> Wife is happy with it. She&#x27;s had several straight irons and said this is her favorite yet.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERYTHING to get rid of the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and coarse and always horribly frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every hair product made, plus curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing ever worked until this.  I plugged it in, and it 15 seconds, for the first time in my life, my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;GET IT NOW!</li>
    <li> I am not the user, but the person I gave it to loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I saw her hair, very good pressing.  So I have to give it high marks.</li>
    <li> Heats up super quick!  Straightens hair in no time.  Love the auto shut off!</li>
    <li> Bought one for my wife, and another as xmAss gift , so far she loves it, no static , heats up fast and the finish product is wonderful. Very nice package. As described .</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned. I thought this would be like a good &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; iron but it QUICKLY became my favorite.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good price its OKay but would never buy another one.  It will straighten but is a struggle and forget it if you want to put a little twist to its</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron after reading some of the great reviews by other customers and because it was significantly cheaper than the higher end straighteners out there. But you truly get what you pay for with this product--a veritable piece of crap. I was extremely disappointed by the overall quality of this flat iron. The biggest issue is that the ceramic plates are not aligned correctly and do not meet fully, so when the flat iron is clamped down the plates come together at the top but gradually get further apart closer to the handle. This makes the quality of the straightening suffer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: Invest a bit more money in a high-quality flat iron with which you will certainly be more satisfied than this one.</li>
    <li> I most definitely reccomend this product. It&#x27;s very efficient and meets all the purposes I purchased it for, as well as others.&lt;br /&gt;Heats quickly. Styles quickly. Cut the time of doing my hair- whether it&#x27;s me using this to do waves, curls, or to straighten. It takes me 15 minutes now, tops! It took me about 45 minutes culr/waves and 25-35 minutes to straighten, before.</li>
    <li> The temperature of this flat iron ranges from 310-410 degrees. I have very thick, wavy hair and 310 straightened it perfectly in less than fifteen minutes. I don&#x27;t have to straighten each piece three times anymore. I love that i can use a lower heat and still get the results I want. My hair is dry so I wash and straighten it every few days. It stays very straight until I wash my hair again. It does not pull my hair or snag of the edges, the plates are very smooth. The iron is lightweight, but feels sturdy and durable. I recommend this flat iron to everyone; it makes your hair smooth, silky, and straight.</li>
    <li> Very good straightener! My daughter loves it, gets her hair pin straight! great price would definitely get this if your looking for a good straightener!</li>
    <li> Though I thought I was ordering the smaller iron(my mistake), I love this one. It heats up fast and does a great job of strightening hair. I think I&#x27;m in love with Remington...lol.</li>
    <li> Excelent price, excelent item. I love it Anti Frizz Hair. the iron has good size and versatility...I recomend used item</li>
    <li> This straightener works very well. It goes up to 410 or some degrees, but I use mine on the 330 setting. I have thin, little bit past shoulder length hair. It is usually straight, but if I&#x27;m having a bad hair day it&#x27;s what I go to! Also I love doing others&#x27; hair, and I straightened by friend&#x27;s (who has thick, wavyish curlyish hair) and it worked really well for her too, and she slept on it and it looked the same in the morning. So that proves that it works well for all different types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the outer part (the purple outside) of the heated metal gets pretty hot too. But the very tippy top is okay, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me. It can get hair very straight with just going down the hair once. It is very lightweight which is useful. I noticed that it also kills static when flat ironing the hair. I also really enjoy the lock system on the bottom part of the iron, right near the swivel cord (which I might add, is very good for keeping the cord untangled) so you can definitely minimize the space it takes up. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely is a must for people with all kinds of hair- for daily straightening or just quick touch ups in the morning. For the price and the high quality, you can&#x27;t beat it at all!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! The shipping is fast and efficient. The straightener heats up really fast and helps you get ready in just a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener based on the previous reviews and it did not meet my expectations. The only thing it really has going for it is it heats up fast. Otherwise if sucks. It leaves kinks in my hair. It snags and rips my hair out. Plus I have naturally smooth hair and by the time I&#x27;m done straightening my hair it is course and frizzy. This has never happened with any of my other straighteners. My last straightener lasted me 3+ years, I don&#x27;t see this one lasting that long.</li>
    <li> my first straightener is a conair which i bought at walmart for only 20 bucks. i was looking for a straightener that  performs like the chi. chi is not really in my budget right now. i got this in the mail two days ago and it is fantastic. it heats up quickly and it can also curl my hair! imagine that. i have coarse, frizzy and totally unmanageable hair. it takes me two hours everyday to make it into something more manageable. i would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> SWIPPED MY HAIR ONCE AND IT WAS JAPANESE. LOVE IT PRETTY SIMPLE TO DO MY BANGS OR SHORT HAIR, IM IN THE MILITARY SO IM ALWAYS IN A RUSH IT HEADED IN 30SECS AS IT SAYS IN THE ADD/REVIEWS, FOR THE PRICE IT WAS THE CHEAPEST BUT DOES ALL THIS I WOULD RECCOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> excelente el producto lo recomiendo, llego en buenas condiciones. el empaque es muy bueno, no estaba abierto y a tiempo!!</li>
    <li> I could not believe how well this worked.  Because it&#x27;s price was so low; I did not expect much.  But it works much better than my very expensive ceramic straightener.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron a year ago right before I was going to Europe for 2 months.  I had always been a loyal Chi user, but it was unclear if I could use it in Europe (I read some horror stories of the straightener frying despite the use of the proper adapters).  I had another really cheap travel straightener that I had been using for travel, but it didn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the Chi, so it took 3 times as long to style my hair.  After researching several flat irons I decided to try this one and I am so glad I did.  It&#x27;s dual voltage and it worked perfectly in Europe.  It also gets to temperatures over 400 degrees.  I have medium thickness hair that is a little wavy.  I have the temperature set to 370 and it works just as well as my Chi.  More than a year later and it is still going strong.  I would absolutely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this &amp;#34;straightener&amp;#34; which I use for curling. There&#x27;s nothing negative to say about it whatsoever. The multiple temperature settings are great. It&#x27;s super fast, easy to use and curls my hair in less than half the time it used to take to use a circular curling iron. I like how it has a closure clip for easy storage. Not much else to say but great product for a great price. :)</li>
    <li> Best thing ever she said.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent item for the price; I have fine, thin hair and I like to be able to dial a flat-iron to the lowest temp. I am also forgetful so auto shut-off is mandatory. This item has both of those features, and is effective at its job. It leaves my scraggly locks soft and shiny in a matter of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging, however, is a nightmare!! This is the most frustrating, potentially injurious package I have had to open in a LONG time. Get ready to slice off a digit or stab yourself with scissors unless you are super-careful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really straightened my hair before and wanted to give it a try but not spend a whole lot of money. I love this product it works great. Takes me about 20 mins to do all my hair and its pretty long and curly! I&#x27;d definatly recommened it!</li>
    <li> I got this a couple weeks ago and used it just for straightening at first but my friends getting married and wants curls so I figured I would do my hair first to see how well it would help hold a curl I didn&#x27;t even use hairspray and the curls lasted all day I&#x27;ve had plenty of straighteners and this is by far the best although 2 of my others were remington straighteners this one is at the top of my list</li>
    <li> This straightner is a very good quality, and has a great price. It heats up to 410 degrees and does so very fast.</li>
    <li> This works great. The display is a tad weird when its on 370°F.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!</li>
    <li> I have 4b hair and this device straightens my hair very well! I love that the heat settings are according to temperature (310-410 degrees F). This is very inexpensive, but works well.</li>
    <li> Heat up fast. Love the color.  Wish it has a stand.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty bad hair straightener</li>
    <li> WORST HAIR STRAIGHTENER I HAVE EVER OWNED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already straight hair and it&#x27;s very thin, it just gets kind of frizzy, when I use this it looks even more frizzy. It&#x27;s just awful- It&#x27;s basically conditioned me to never straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve written after using Amazon for years. I love this straightener. I&#x27;d never used one before, and I am very low maintenance when it comes to hair. I have fine, wavy hair that is frizzy and hard to manage. I usually go to bed with it wet and then throw it up in a messy hair clip or bun in the morning. I would never wear it down because it didn&#x27;t look good, it would always be dull, frizzy, and have volume in all the wrong places. I got this straightener, and I love my hair again. It takes about 10 minutes when my hair is dry for me to straighten it. Afterwards it&#x27;s glossy, straight, easy to manage, and I look like a different person. I can run my fingers through my hair and it&#x27;s so soft and easy to work with. This may sound strange, but I actually enjoy having hair again! It&#x27;s no longer just an inconvenience, it&#x27;s something I feel good about. This straightener is cheap, quick, easy to use, and makes me look so much better all around! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Loved it so much, very fast and smooth,my hair is wavy, but with this iron I straightened my  hair  like a professional.. Perfect !</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and very curly. Think Anne Hathaway in Princess Diaries (before her makeover). My hair is exactly like hers. I have had two straighteners which just don&#x27;t work. I would spend hours straightening my hair until it was perfect. Then, I would go outside, and BAM, it starts curling again. I also tried blow drying my hair straight, which actually works pretty well, but it doesn&#x27;t give me pin straight hair. I decided to buy this straightener after seeing the reviews and the low price (I&#x27;m a poor college student). I&#x27;m so glad I did! The swivel cord, the digital temperature control, and the long plates make it a great straightener. I can curl my hair with this thing too and it looks like I just walked out of the salon (I use 370 degrees to straighten my hair and 350 degrees to curl it). The icing on the cake is that it&#x27;s purple, which is my favorite color. Great straightener and great bargain. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product was just want i wanted. it came in very quickly and i have no complaints so i gave it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually somewhat surprised at all the positive reviews. My problem is that even on the lowest setting, the iron gets wayyyy too hot. I feel bad for my hair when I use it. My hair also constantly gets stuck in the plates. I refrained from reviewing when I bought it a long time ago because I thought I just had a defective one, but when I when to my sisters apartment the other day, I found that she bought this same iron and has had the same problems. It does straighten well though, and if you like high heat, you&#x27;ll definitely love this flat iron. If you have fine hair like myself, however, stay far, far, away. I unfortunately did not have the anti-static result(which is why I bought this in the first place), as the high heat made the static even worse. For now, I&#x27;ll be sticking to my Remington sleek and shine or Andis straighteners, and dryer sheets to reduce the static.</li>
    <li> This Remington flat iron does everything it claims to do. It heats up super quick and straightens hair on the first pass. Smoothes out all the frizzies from my fine hair. And it&#x27;s a phenomenal buy at only $15! This straightener saves me a lot of time and makes my hair look so much better than my old Conair did. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product. It&#x27;s working very well, 30 seconds and I can use, and if I don&#x27;t use turn off automatically, it&#x27;s very good, very safety. And the colour, I love it :) and the shape is very elegant. I hope I can use this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have natural 4C hair (for those who type their hair) and it takes a long time just to blow dry it but when it gets straight to where i need it using the chase method with the comb then this flat iron is the GREATEST tool that I have bought to straighten my hair.! Also it was time for me to get a new flat iron! I do not want to ever give it up</li>
    <li> Bought this because the old one I had for 7 years since I was 16 I lost it moving from new jersey to new york so I brought this one It works wonderful and remington is infamous for straighteners but for the price I got an amazing deal thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought it long back but this product is amazing.I does straighten the hair nicely. and it&#x27;s cheap too so perfect!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener!!!! It works amazingly!!!!!!!!! Definitely recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Does what I need it to. No problems. Good price</li>
    <li> Good quality, as advertised</li>
    <li> This is so cool you can adjust the heat very easily and it heats up within 30 seconds. It is very easy to use and the auto turn off works well. It flattens your hair fast and well. Great product!</li>
    <li> Omg!! This iron does not pull my hair!! Actually really smooth glades threw my hair!! Amazing! I truly love this!! Had it for a month now! So buy it!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, love it!</li>

    <li> I really like this iron</li>
    <li> Worked very well!! Heats up really fast! Great for my thick curly hair!!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, works great!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. can reduce the temperature 370, 350,310. east to use.</li>
    <li> Love this, my old one got ruined and this was a perfect replacement at an excellent price!</li>
    <li> great straightener, works very well but it does damage your hair very easily.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t pull hair. love it. i have other ones that constantly pulls my hair. this one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;it also heats up pretty fast so its easy to finish up to go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;glad i got it</li>
    <li> stopped working after a few months</li>
    <li> This straightner is the best! I have owned this straightner for a while now and it works great! I love the way it straightens my hair. I spent a long time looking for a straightner that really fit my needs and this one was it! Once i recieved the package, i was excited to try it out and i was impressed. It really made my hair look straight and it was awsome. You can change the setting on how hot you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Its an awsome straightner and i really trust remington. I really care about my hair and always look for the best products worth the price and this is worth it. Its one of my favorite straightners and i trust this brand with my hair. If your looking for a good straightner that does the job and lasts a long time, then this is the one.</li>
    <li> My wife have used quite of a few of these straigtners but she said this is the best one She has ever found and much better than the other ones she owned and which were more expensive than this one.</li>
    <li> I love this! It heats up so fast and straigtens my hair amazingly. I&#x27;m black and hispanic so my hair has a bit of a kink to it and its really thick but this smooths it all out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year now, it&#x27;s good at first but as time progresses, it does burn &amp; break hair off</li>
    <li> Super good product, gets the job done and is a pretty good price. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> The iron works really well on my hair.  I had one for 4 years and gunked it up with hairspray so I bought an identical one to replace it.  My major complaint: the unit turns itself off all the time.  Within 30 seconds of turning it on, it will turn off.  I can&#x27;t figure out why.  It will crackle and turn off.  I&#x27;ve seen others with the same problem.  So when it works it&#x27;s great, but good luck getting it to stay on.  If you decide to buy it, don&#x27;t be lazy like me and wait to long to look up the return policy.  I&#x27;m past my window.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of straighteners, and none compare to this! It heats up super fast, 5 seconds after I plugged it in and turned it on the plates were warm. It&#x27;s super sleek. I didn&#x27;t think much of the &amp;#34;floating plates&amp;#34; at first but it really does make a difference! My hair didn&#x27;t snag once; after one run through it was perfectly straight, no static &amp; no frizz. It also curls and crimps perfectly, that don&#x27;t fall out! I was brushing it out and the waves were still totally defined. For under $20 this is SUCH A STEAL! I don&#x27;t know how people can buy $100-200 straighteners when this one works the exact same if not better!! Save the extra cash, and get this one, you won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, I really do. I bought it as a replacement for my $90 Biosilk flat iron that was starting to go, but honestly I did not expect much considering it was under $20 and found it at Wal Mart, but I&#x27;m extremely impressed. It works better than my hair dressers digital Chi, works better than my old Biosilk AND faster than both. My old Biosilk I normally kept at a 240 degree heat setting because my hair is thin and colored, it took me anywhere from 10-15 minutes to straighten all of my hair and even still there would be static, but with the Remmington I keep it at 310 degrees and in not even 5 minutes I&#x27;m done and my hair is perfectly straight, zero static, very shiny and smooth. Less time I have to use the flat iron on my hair &#x3D; better for me and my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The plates glide easily over hair, doesn&#x27;t snag, pull or tear hair at all, very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself is nice, small and light weight and even locks so you can store it easily once it cools off. I love the big, easy to read digital display too, my old Biosilk just had an annoying dial.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be put off by the low price of this flat iron like I was at first, it really is a great little flat iron and very much worth the (small) price tag!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a few times but am very happy with the results.  I have spent the last 10 years buying straighteners that are over $100.  And they break in time just like anything else!  This straightener heats up quick, can quickly straighten my ringlet curls!  My only complaint is the temperature settings... it reads like an oven.  I lost the directions booklet already and am too nervous to play with any of the heat settings.</li>
    <li> Dont let the price fool you, its a great flat iron and an even better price. It doesnt burn my hair but it does leave it very straight and soft. I love it you cannot go wrong with this</li>
    <li> my daughter has a chai and this works just as good. i love it and recommend it. this is wonderful</li>
    <li> But it stopped working less than two weeks after I got it. Just stopped turning on. Up until then, I loved it. I&#x27;m hoping the replacement will work a lot longer!</li>
    <li> II had this flat iron for almost 5 years and it always worked great for me!  I have very thick wavy hair, and it always got it pin straight!  I love the color and the digital display.  It gets very hot very quickly!  This past weekend my son fell on it and broke it in half.  It would honestly probably still work if I tried to glue it, but I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a HerStyler, so I ordered one and am anxiously awaiting it&#x27;s delivery.  If that doesn&#x27;t work, I will DEFINITELY be re-ordering this one...heck, I probably should just to have as a backup.  You can&#x27;t beat the price!  I have tried several other $100+ brand flat irons and not one of them made me as happy as my Remington.  I generally wouldn&#x27;t even consider something so inexpensive in fear that it wouldn&#x27;t work.  When I bought it, the one I had before broke and I was low on funds.  Couldn&#x27;t have been happier with this product though!  I HIGHLY recommend buying- even if it it just for a backup.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the crazy expensive brands (chi, herstyler, etc), but it has done a fine job replacing my old worm out straightener. Have been using almost daily for a few months, and it is still working great! it almost seems to make my hair a little more frizzy initially, but once im done and run my fingers through, its all smooth and shiny. :) and you cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> This straightener leaves my hair shiny, while feeling soft and healthy. After about 2 weeks the numbers went out on the display, but the straightener still works fine. Would recommend for anyone looking for a great straightener at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love my straightener!  I use it every day and it always works perfectly!  It has lasted a lot longer than the last one I had (knock on wood that it doesn&#x27;t all of a sudden decide to die on me).</li>
    <li> Eventually it stopped turning on and off! It only lasted a couple of months. Now i have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Title says it all. It heats up in seconds with three different temp settings and it does actually minimize the static in my hair which is a huge issue.</li>
    <li> i have to say it - i&#x27;m impressed. all of my previous hair straighteners have cost at least a hundred dollars or more and so i really wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this thing. when traveling, i experienced a short in the electrical socket where i was staying while straighteng my hair with my old straightener and it fried it (as well as my hair!) i bought this as a cheap replacement until i purchased a higher quality (or should i say, more expensive) product...i figured that even though the reviews are fantastic...at this price it can&#x27;t really be that special. i was wrong. this straghter heats up quickly (in seconds!), and i am able to effectively straighten my long, thick, wavy hair in less than ten minutes (as little as five if i&#x27;m really in a rush) i absolutely love this straighter and no longer have plans to buy a facy expensive one, as i feel this one works better than any other that i&#x27;ve tried before. highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/13 - Still raving about this hair straightener. A few months ago my daughter had received a chi as a gift and I tried it out a couple of times to compare as I&#x27;ve never owned a chi...and totally hated it compared to this one. It still heats up within seconds and takes hardly any time to straightem my hair at all. Love. Love. Love.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this item. It warms up so quickly and I love the fact I have control o the temperature setting. I&#x27;ve never had one that allowed that and I have thick hair so it does the trick. I also love that the ceramic bars are longer than normal so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair getting stuck. I am VERY happy with this straightener!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair straightening wand with a super price. It heats up in 30-45 seconds. It is really easy to use, light and versatile. I have very thin fine hair and was concerned that the heat might damage my hair, however, to the contrary, it imparts a shine and my hair looks healthy. I am using it quickly though and not repetitively. A swift swipe is all it takes.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hair straightener that I have ever owned and being a 23 year old with long hair, I have purchased many. I will always stick to this straightener. Heats up fast and works GREAT!</li>
    <li> I have never had a static problem, until I started using this straightener! Every time I use it, I have static in my hair. My previous straightener was too old and could no longer heat up. I looked on Amazon for a new straightener with high reviews. This one was at the top of the list, so I figured I would give it a try. As soon as I saw the plastic packaging, I knew this was going to be a cheap product. The item itself is very light, and that&#x27;s never a good thing when dealing with a decent straightener. It claims to heat up to 410 degrees, but there is no way. It doesn&#x27;t do anything. It doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the frizz. The only thing this straightener does, is give me static. Lesson learned: don&#x27;t buy a $15 dollar straightener and expect it to work. I think I&#x27;ll just suck it up and spend the $100+ on a Chi straightener that actually works.</li>
    <li> I had this flat iron quite a few years ago and it really screwed my hair up. The ceramic plates were all wrong for my hair type. This iron was crushing my hair, burning it. The results was dry, damaged and dull. After a bit of research I purchased HSI and have been using it for almost 4 years. I would research heavily before purchasing any flat iron to make sure it works with your hair type.</li>
    <li> The heat regulator does not go down low enough for my permed and colored hair. Split ends are the result.</li>
    <li> doesnst work at all. i got this because I love remington products, but it doesnt heat up. wish i could send it back. when it heats up, it smells awful. very cheap.</li>
    <li> I did a fair amount of research before purchasing this. I have been using a different brand and I have been happy with it while it worked. I had that for 8 months and it just quit working. I paid a lot of money for that to only get 8 months out of it. It was starting to snag my hair and break it off. This Remington was priced much lower, so I simply had to try it. Well, I cannot even begin to tell you how great this is. I have only used it for 2 months but it is superb. Smooth glide over my hair. One swipe is all it takes. Shiny hair. Very comfortable to hold in your hand. An awesome purchase. Honestly, I may get another one as a backup. I am that impressed with this one. I love it. So glad I did not go out and get a high priced one. My hair looks better today than it ever has since I have been straigtening it. You must give this one a try, specially at this price.</li>
    <li> This is really the first flat iron I have ever gotten myself. I usually tend to just blow dry and go, but even with my short hair, I still need to smooth the mane down. This flat iron does an excellent job when it comes to controlling my hair. It&#x27;s easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I actually love this product and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good and reliable flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy this flat iron. (I had to buy it again cause the first one I gave it to my sister). I love this flat iron. It heats up very quickly and it gives you a nice and shiny look to your hair. It actually feels like your hair is much smother. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> OMG!its great but the smell ew!</li>
    <li> Very pleased ! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long and wavy hair and like others have mentioned this iron works extremely well for the price and beats other slightly more expensive brands and models. Only draw back is it does give you a bit of static but nothing a quick hit of hair spray won&#x27;t knock out.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron &amp; ive only had it for a day. This flat iron heats in 30 seconds, which is wonderful if your in a rush for anything. It curls, it sraightnings. The best flat iron &amp; does what you desire on the first try. Packaging was secure &amp; great. Got to me on the exact day the seller told me. I dont think i&#x27;ll ever need a new flat iron. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Does everything I expected and the price was great</li>
    <li> Nice job of straightening my hair and I like the price.</li>
    <li> Decent product for the price my only complaints are that it had a very strong plasticy smell when I opened the box and with the first couple uses also it kinda snags the hair in a way but overall not bad</li>
    <li> I have pin straight hair and tend to use my flat irons for curling or waving. That said, this item does the job but my curls usually fall flat within a few hours (for comparison purposes, a curling iron holds my curls for 24 hours). Overall, it&#x27;s a good straightener for the price.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and wavy. It works for me well. It becomes hot quickly, does not hurt my hair, and makes my hair flat. Also, it&#x27;s easy to use. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love the flat iron. It&#x27;s so easy and works great with straightening my natural hair. Amazing product. Love the color as well.</li>
    <li> Great straightener- heats up quickly!  Love this thinner model over the thicker ones.  I&#x27;ve had lots of straighteners over the years and this is one of my favorites.  And affordable!</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is wonderful. I admit  I never used one before, but is easy to use. It gives you  just the right shape and style!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank  You.</li>
    <li> I like the color and vvery cheap I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now or so and still working :)</li>
    <li> I had this straightener for 3 years and a year ago the power button started having problems but other than that.. I&#x27;m still using it and I love it! I&#x27;m about to order a new one so I don&#x27;t have to deal with the annoying power button. Definitely recommended! Heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, curls great too!</li>
    <li> 3 years later &amp; hasn&#x27;t failed me !!! Great buy !!!</li>
    <li> even came early! love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent...my Daughters and wife love it</li>
    <li> For this price... this is probably the best straightener you can find. My girlfriend loves this straightener... she said it&#x27;s almost comparable to her previous Chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has automatic shut-off and you can adjust the heat. It&#x27;s a good straightener for an ridiculously good price. If you need something to hold you over, or even a long term straightener, this is the one to get!</li>
    <li> Great straightener for a great price. Heats up within 30 seconds which is nice when in a hurry. I have long wavy hair and it straightens my hair quickly and easily. No complaints with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in december last year and received it in january, for the first few months it worked great and i had absolutely no problems, but when you turn it on it has a really weird kind of bad smell. After 7 months and 3 days ago, i plugged it in and it didnt work!!!!! i thought it might have been the jack i stuck it in but i plugged it in 5 different places.....NOTHING!!! THIS IS NOT WORTH $15!!! I WANT A REFUND!!</li>
    <li> i already have straight hair and i cut it into a bob but i bought it cause from one side my hair flips out and i like how this flat iron heats up fast and well since its already straight i wouldn;t really be able to say how well it works but i would think it would do a good job on really curly hair too like i said it heats up fast and i haven&#x27;t had a problem wit it since i bought it i love it!!</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my hair look amazing</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She seems quite happy with it. Good value for money. No need to pay more!</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve only had it for about 2 weeks, but it has been good so far. I can straighten, and curl my hair very well with this. Pretty purple, digital screen with back light makes it easy to use. And it heats up SO FAST! From when I turn on the power button, it takes no more that 1 minute to completely heat up. And the 1 inch size is perfect. Lightweight. Just YES (:</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron!!! I am an Black Woman with 100% Natural Hair. This got the JOB DONE! Of course I had to go through the rough task of blow drying my hair straight first, but that just made the flat ironing task easier and quicker! I used this flat iron combined with Pantene Medium Thick Anti-Frizz Spray! I spray my hair first blow dry it through and then flat iron, wrap it up at night and it last for 2 Weeks!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a flat iron for my teen to replace old one. Even on its worst day, the old one works better than this. It creates static! Even bought different sprays to see if it was just the weather causing the static. No! Like they say...you get what you pay for. Just ordered the hsi....hoping for better results. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have a very expensive flat iron n this is as nice as my expensive one for $15.00 I was delighted to see it worked, two settings, looked nice n was a Remington. Amazing for $15.00</li>
    <li> Worked good until it died 3 months after purchase.</li>
    <li> She loves it and never complains about it so must be a good one whatever it is.</li>
    <li> El producto es excelente, de muy buena calidad, Entregado en perfectas condiciones. Envio rapido y oportuno.  Recomenendado 100 % .</li>
    <li> I borrowed this straightener from a friend a while back and loved it so I had to get my own.  It works great and my hair actually stays pretty stratight all day long, unlike my Maxiglide that I bought from TV a while back that would straighten my hair but as soon as any type of moister hit, it would crinkle.  I will continue to use my Remington at this point, its pretty quick and painless!</li>
    <li> I had low expectations for this straightener bc of the price, but I was very impressed!  It smooths and straightens as well as my previous Chi.</li>
    <li> This straigtener is awesome. In a blind test i&#x27;m not even sure i would be able to tell the difference between this and a chi. Its works well and heats up quickly so even though I have Tons of hair this amazingly only takes about 15 minutes to straighten my hair and i don&#x27;t even have to put half of it up!</li>
    <li> The hard plastic shell was very difficult to open, I cut my hand several times and almost broke the hair straightener just trying to get it out of the package, I am disappointed and now wish I had just sent it back.</li>
    <li> This worked really great. I have had it for quite awhile and it&#x27;s been working. Two of my friends were so impressed by it that they asked me where I&#x27;d gotten it and I directed them here, and they ended up both buying one. Super recommended. I have really curly hair and it does the job. I can even turn the heat on lower to give myself waves instead of straight.</li>
    <li> This straightener is absolutely perfect. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because the price seemed very low, but am pleased now with the quality and how quickly it heats up. It&#x27;s great for wrapping your hair into curls and turning up ends as well. I would buy this again! It is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I just love this flat iron! Very light weight and does not pull my hair like some have. Temperature control can go up to 410 though I keep mine at 370. Thinking that might be to much so might have to drop it down to 350. It heats up in about 30 sec. of course it also has on/off switch and the cord seem of good length. For 15-20 bucks it&#x27;s a steal. I have seen some for twice to close to three times the price that well, I wont say was not as good, I can not say they were better either. Not sure what else I can say... oh I like the color though would love to see it in pink.</li>
    <li> I had just cut my hair off and my larger hair straightener is now too big. I have blonde thin hair, but A LOT of it. This straightener is perfect because it gets my shorter hair in the back and the edges are rounded so I can curl my hair perfectly with this too! It also heats up very quickly and does not fry my hair, it smoothens and gives my hair life!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, they recommend good quality product, will be a very good investment, enjoy it and they last much greetings</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2.5 years now. It has never given me a problem.its heats well and does a good job with my thick hair.</li>
    <li> My friend had introduced me with her designer flat iron.  Wanting one of my own, I started looking on Amazon.  I was shocked at what she paid for it, and decided to trying something more cost-friendly.  I thought this one would do.  Not too expensive if I didn&#x27;t like it.  From the moment I got it, I loved it!  My hair always comes out perfect.  My mom loved it so much, she is buying one too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my nieces, they loved it, said it worked better than their mothers more expensive brand straightener.</li>
    <li> Works really well, although it does sometimes snag my hair. It hasn&#x27;t caused me any issues, and I&#x27;ve owned mine for a couple of years now. I really have no need to replace it or buy another. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!!!! My first straightener the InStyler stopped working after a good 4 years. Was hesitant to buy this one but I did. No regrets in buying this product. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good straightener!</li>
    <li> It works real good. I absolutely love this thing. Very easy to use and effective. It does what is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is very good, strengthens hair exceptional well better than ones i bought before. It retains the heat ever well and comfortable to hold in hand</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron here about two years ago. It still heats up quickly and does the job! I have &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, African-American hair and it straightens it very well. It also straightens and curls the Brazilian hair I&#x27;ve worn excellently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story: Good for various hair types | Time-efficient | Well-Priced.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my little sister, she loves it and I really like it too. I think I am going to get one for myself!</li>
    <li> The wife loves it and uses it all the time</li>
    <li> i have had this straightener fo about a year and it still works great and i love it. Now it&#x27;s not chi or anything like that. It&#x27;s the best 20 straightener you can get! My hair is pretty unruly and doesn&#x27;t cooperate and this does pretty well with dealing with.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sis for Christmas.  She loved it.  Worth the money!  It is very cheap compare to the one in store.</li>
    <li> The best flat iron I have ever gotten. The price is great and it works perfectly, it really makes my frizzy hair smooth and sleek!</li>
    <li> I have to say this iron is awesome!! It heats up within seconds to the desired heat setting of your choosing. It is light weight too.  I have very thick and wavy hair and this thing is magic I&#x27;m telling you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many of you may know there are so many irons out there that tend to pull your hair because it was designed badly but this one doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this iron and would highly recommend it to all women who are looking for a great iron.</li>
    <li> works great, arrived quickly, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I used them at my cousins home, she having them is not what made me purchase them, the simple fact that it took me at the absolute MAX of 45 mins to curl my hair which is natural course grade esp after its washed an blow dryer. 30 sec heat up is just extra to me but helps tremendously when you only have an hour to get to work.  Moreover, these Remington flat irons are glorious I don&#x27;t use them everyday more like every 2/3 days not because im lazy but because the curls tend to stay for that amount of time USUALLY. I have a lot of Revlon product but the best is the red blow dryer, dries my dripping wet hair in LESS than 15 mins MAYBE 10mins. I highly recommend this item to anyone with natural hair fine medium or coarse grade of hair .</li>
    <li> Ok for a straight flat look but really sucks for flips/curls... dont last at all. Sucks and isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and gets my naturally curly and coily hair smooth and straight with just one pass. The cord is nice and long, also it leaves a silky finish to my hair and the shine lasts till wash day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my straightener for more than 4 years..it has worked good on me..</li>
    <li> My Hot Tools Helix hair straighter died last week and I needed a replacement.  I usually spend at least 50 bucks on hair tools but decided to go inexpensive because these things die all the time.  This is a very good product.  Yea it is 15 bucks but it works just as well as the $75 one that died on me.  This iron does produce a smell but it does eventually go way.  It straightens my shoulder length thick hair pretty quickly only requiring one or two passes.  The starting heat temp is 350 and goes to 430.  It does have an auto shut off after an hour and only one side of the ceramic plates is movable.  The other side is fixed.  It has a pretty long cord and it works well.  Go ahead and get this iron, if you are on the fence.  I was but I am glad I committed.</li>
    <li> in perfect shape. after all these months is working perfectly . i am happy with the purchase and recommend it</li>
    <li> Most hair styling products that you buy, if at a great price, tend to either break on you after a mild amount of usage, take forever to heat up, or are flimsy and don&#x27;t clamp or hold well.&lt;br /&gt;This little iron has been surprisingly great. It heats up so quickly that I don&#x27;t even need to wait or make myself busy while it heats. It also reduces the amount of damage feel to my course thick hair, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;It is super lightweight but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, and clamps down nice and evenly. I even use it to curl my hair sometimes because of the even grip and easy glide.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a straightener, but want good quality and efficiency, I would highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
    <li> I used this very infrequently in the past year and now the controls don&#x27;t work.To turn off I need to unplug it. It is impossible to change the temperature. It worked well for the dozen times I used it up until now. So I would not recommend. It does an adequate job straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it I finally got it</li>
    <li> Good for the price and for occasional use.  You do have to be careful not to move your hand up the iron when holding it closed because it is very hot at that end.</li>
    <li> gets the job done but still smells of an overwhelming chemical burn whenever I turn it on. I do like the temperature control though</li>
    <li> I was looking for a straightener that would heat up extremely quickly and would flatten my frizz in a heartbeat... and that is what this does! I cannot speak for the people using this to straighten thick or curly hair but I can say that this product heats up to 410 degrees in a matter of seconds. I normally would blow dry my hair while my old straightener heated but now I have to make sure the Remington does not burn something because of the quick heating and high temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like how this ceramic is better quality than others. I do not use heat protector and this straightener actually makes my hair soft and shiny once I am finished. It does not dry out my hair, which was my main concern considering the hot temperatures.</li>
    <li> I doubted that a new straightener could make a difference on how sleek my damaged hair looked or felt, but it really did. Not only it this straightener more efficient than my old one (that was admittedly from 6 years ago), but the ceramic plates dramatically reduced frizziness and made my hair feel gorgeously soft--  it feels like I used a hot oil treatment! It&#x27;s a humid day today but my hair looks awesome thanks to this little guy!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner because it was a great price, ceramic and had an automatic shut off.  Before purchasing the product I should have just listened to the reviews on here.  Yes, the straightner does it job but it is constantly pulling on my hair and breaking it off.  I also noticed after 1-1/2 months that there is a crack in the cord and the wires are exposed.  The crack is obviously just a product malfunction because I keep my hairdryer and straighter in a drawer of their own.  The hair pulling is a bad design though.  Off to buy a different straightener.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have very frizzy, wavy hair that is very hard to tame. I have purchased many straightening irons in the past. This is the BEST straight iron I have ever bought! We have been using it almost every day for about 6 months. It heats up quickly and straightens my hair the FIRST time. I could not believe it the first time we used it. I have never bought an expensive straight iron. I am sure those work but I refuse to pay $100 for one. I paid $20.00 for this one and I am going to order another one for back up.</li>
    <li> Item was a gift for a friend and have not used it myself</li>
    <li> Very high quality gadget. Reduces frizz and takes much less time to straighten well than my last one.</li>
    <li> I like how verstitile it is. Very useful for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> I have bone straight hair that doesnt curl. I bought this to curl my hair and it really did the trick! Amazing product!!</li>
    <li> This is very nice straightener. I must say it is very useful for my curly hair. But I must say it is very useful for thin hair not for hard nd thick hair....</li>
    <li> very inexpensive &amp; it does the job just like the salon!  I thank you Remington!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! it only takes about 10 mins to do my hair... it used to take 25 mins. i definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> A great price on a well-made product.  My hairdresser was very impressed with the quality and the low price.</li>
    <li> Just got this today. Love the color, heats up fast, and works extremely well. Great price for a great buy. Definitely satisfied :)</li>
    <li> Very satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Love it!</li>
    <li> constanly turning it self off</li>
    <li> This is really good for the price. It heats up so fast and easy to manage. If you have a fine hair this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few months now and really like it. It heats up quickly and does the job well. Seems to slip out of my hands a lot though - not sure if it&#x27;s because of the texture of if I&#x27;m just clumsy!</li>
    <li> Use it everyday and works great!  Would buy this one again.</li>
    <li> It looks like it wasn&#x27;t original</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Remington is a very good brand</li>
    <li> Love, Love I will need another one soon. Because my whole house uses this....</li>
    <li> Excellent love this flat iron and for the price #Winning</li>
    <li> This was a waste of my money! It does not get hot, it does NOT straighten my hair. This product sucks!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it said it did, less frizz and solf hair...</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, heats up really fast and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> So far so good! Get hot fast! Just wait to see how long will it stay in this good quality!</li>
    <li> I like this straightener a lot. I bought this one to replace my chi that I had for a few years and I love it. It&#x27;s cheaper than a chi and it works just a good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister, she has VERY thick and curly hair. We were a bit skeptic because it&#x27;s quite cheap, but it really did the job! The straightener is easy to use, it&#x27;s light and big enough to do bigger parts of hair. We used before going to a party and even when it had rained outside and the air had changed, her hair remained straight. She even slept with it and the next morning it was still straight. Would recommend it if you are looking for a not so fancy but an affordable and lightweight straightener that does the job.</li>
    <li> I actually REALLY like this flat iron! I had a professional one before and after 5  years it finally died. This on works as well, and I have tried several &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; one&#x27;s, some which were more expensive then this one! None of those made my hair look nice. This one does a great job, and it is smaller, so I can get around my face easier :) I&#x27;m going to buy another one for my daughter!!</li>
    <li> Love them! They came quickly and was excited to use them because of all the positive reviews especially since I&#x27;m currently transitioning to natural hair. Haven&#x27;t had a touch up in almost 5 months. Wish I could upload a pick but since I can&#x27;t I&#x27;ll just confirm that They worked great on my hair and my 13 yr old daughters hair. I have really thick hair, not coarse though and we&#x27;re both transitioning and I was able to go all the way to the roots with no problems. Some say 430 or 450 is the best temp but literally We wouldn&#x27;t have any hair. The highest temp for us is 390 We both have long curly hair but mines is longer and curlier and It didnt take a long time either maybe 1 hour but my only regret is not finding these sooner because my hair looks like silk as I only use healthy products such as L&#x27;oreal eversleek sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and a few dabs of organic pure coconut oil. Haven&#x27;t had them that long only 2 weeks but so far pretty Good!</li>
    <li> Received this as a birthday gift.  Love the auto shut-off feature and the barrel size.  Only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is that both the top and bottom of this straightener are rounded so you can&#x27;t set them down on those sides.  It has to lay sideways, which takes up more counter space and leaves the heating element more exposed.</li>
    <li> Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! No complaints at all. Best straightener I have ever used. My hair is normally super curly and resists straightening but I have had no problems with this.</li>
    <li> After my chi died I wanted to find something that would straighten my hair but not break the bank. After reading the reviews I tried this. It&#x27;s amazing. Heats up fast, makes my hair pin straight and has an auto shut off which gives me peace of mind. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> Works,But does not leave my hair shiny...  But its ok for an emergency, not my favorite though..... ... ... ..</li>
    <li> I bought this product one year and a half ago, and it has been great. My first straightener was also a remington, was a expensive one (50$) and it was not bad but this is the same quality and the same results for the half of the half.. I bought this one because in that moment I did not have enough money to buy an expensive one and I tought, well, it could work for a couple of months and it will be worth it.. well, I was wrong.. Its been almost 2 years and Its still works like the 1st day! Im very happy and I will definitely buy the same one again!</li>
    <li> I got this as a cheap iron I could have in my gym locker, so if something happened I wouldn&#x27;t be upset.  After using it a few times I will never purchase another $100+ irons again.  This has more features and better results for 10% of the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to award five stars to products, but this one really fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by introducing you to my hair. I&#x27;m Asian, so it&#x27;s black. It&#x27;s long. It is thick. And there is a lot of it. That said, I hate spending mass amounts of time primping my hair. Bad combo of high maintenance tresses and laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other straighteners before, but this one really takes the hassle and time wasting out of hair styling. Width is perfect both for straightening and for creating loose curls. Temperature settings are great: super hot enough to quickly style, but no issues with burning. Heats up QUICK. Grab is good — I can&#x27;t stand those straighteners that won&#x27;t let me grip my hair as I please (not that I&#x27;m clamping down with iron force, but you get my drift).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my only question is about the limited range of temperature settings. The iron only allows for three temperatures: 370, 390, and 410 degrees. Not that I&#x27;m complaining: I usually keep the iron on its hottest anyway. But found this to be curious anyhow.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and often flat iron it. This flat iron heats evenly has a great self turn off feature (after 1hr its off), takes less than a minute to heat up and allows me to control how much heat i use in my hair down to the degree. Also, it&#x27;s purple! How fun! I love this thing!</li>
    <li> It works fine for first couple of months. I like the temperature control model, and love the locker makes it easier to put into my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;But just after 6 months, it happens to not work several times. I tried to adjust the angle of the line, sometimes it helps.  But after some day last week, it&#x27;s broken for good. I can never turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it&#x27;s the outlet&#x27;s problem, cuz after I failed to use the straightener, other stuffs can not work either. But I changed to several outlets, all of them lost their power after being connected with the straightener. Then I can imagine what&#x27;s happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There hasn&#x27;t been anything strange, I never smell sth burned, never saw smoke. No drop to the ground, no water spattering to it. I was very happy before it started to occasionally fail, and I didn&#x27;t think to blame it at first. However, I was very disappointed, but cannot return it after such long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good experience with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Loving this straightener. Works really well. Wish I would&#x27;ve ordered a bigger width size.</li>
    <li> It works great.  It get my hair really straight and I use it to curl it as well.  It does not leave my hair smelling like burnt hair which is a big plus for me.  I love this flat iron and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because they worked really well on my hair and I have COARSE! hair. The Remington flat irons heat up in seconds just like it says! They perform an excellent job, for people with coarse hair will understand what I&#x27;m  talking about when I say it&#x27;s a hassle when getting the roots of the hair because of how hot the flat irons are when it touches your scalp well with these flat irons you don&#x27;t have to worry about it and get that close because they pick up everything. I would really recommend to people with coarse hair or anyone who want a cheap good quality flat iron to get these.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and wavy and this flat iron rolled through my hair with so easily I didn&#x27;t have to make a ton of passes to get it straight!! Good iron amazing price</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. I normally have it set up to 390 or 400 degrees to straighten my thick hair, but that might be too much for some people. So, definitely start at a lower temp. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I like that I can put the heat on very low. It heats up really quickly and does a great job. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair often, so I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself a pro, but this was really easy to use and self-explanatory. Also lightweight and slim.</li>
    <li> Heats up beween 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Nice tough feel to it and having a swivel cable is a plus too.  LCD is a good plus.</li>
    <li> god here really fast! and product is awesome. great flat iron for my thick hair! it heats up fast and gets extremely hot.</li>
    <li> It works! It even straightened my cousins really thick hair! She had been trying to get it straight for months.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love it! Would buy again. Used it at one of its lowest temperatures (which is still pretty hot) and it flatted my hair quick! Worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> This is my first hair straightner even though I don&#x27;t use it for that. I use it for the hair glitter and it is great for short hair and heats up really fast.</li>
    <li> Entrega a tiempo. Producto en perfecto estado, trabaja excelente. Muy recomendado. Ideal para las mujeres y muy seguro, tanto el producto como el sitio de compra.</li>
    <li> This product works good.</li>
    <li> Very nice, works well. Heat level is very high, starts with 370F</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington Flat Iron! I was disappointed in the first one Remington S9600 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch I had for only 4 months. It caused my hair to be staticy. So I decided to look for another Iron when I came across your Remington S5500 Digital Anti-Static 1 Inch.  When I purchased your Iron it was being advertised as Anti-Static. BEWARE it is not Anti-Static</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t iron my hair often and I only iron a few parts every day so this iron has worked fantastic for me. If you&#x27;re someone that loves straightening every day this may not be the best? But for me it does a great job! It&#x27;s slim and heats up very fast.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at walmart, but i wish i bought it here because its 4 dollars cheaper on amazon. This hair straightener is awesome and when mine finally dies, im just going to purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron, i use it every other day. Arrived before time and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price.  The flat iron heats up very quickly and is extreamly easy to use.  I have recommended this to all of my friends and no one has been disappointed yet.</li>
    <li> Product was brand new, and well packaged so that the item did not get damaged. Will definitely recommend to friends. :)</li>
    <li> Please dont go and spend $50 to $100 on a flat iron!  This one works just as well for a fraction of the price.  I love it and I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Its very good in doing what its suppose to do and its purple color made me love this iron even more</li>
    <li> I love this iron, works great, heats up fast and the temp can be turned down. It is small enough to get the shorter hair (A-line BOB cut) and big enough to handle the larger pieces.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good straightening and curling iron under 20 bucks. It&#x27;s not for wet hair sadly but it does the job for dry hair. I wish i bought their wet and dry model instead but anyhow... as i said, it has the perfect size for curling. And by the does not blowup when i plug it to 220v.</li>
    <li> One of the best hair straightener I have ever use. I thought I&#x27;ll try it out since its so cheap, won&#x27;t have much to lose. In less than 10 mins my hair ended up super straight,  even on the lowest setting which is 370 degrees.</li>
    <li> its great.. simply i love it</li>
    <li> For as cheap as the product is, it works really well. I am seriously impressed. Heats up quickly and straightens as well as a chi straightener. Definitely will buy this again.</li>
    <li> It gets really hot and lasts long. This is a great product compared to most straighteners. This is one of the best that I&#x27;ve come across in a very long time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STRAIGHTENER!!!!!!! It straightens your hair smoothly and it looks great afterwards. I doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out as your straighten it. It heats up super quit. I all around love it.</li>
    <li> Works well, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It is a really good product....Worth buying.....</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and got a new straightner because i was getting a haircut with bangs. I love this. It heats up really fast. It had a weird smell the first few times I turned it on but that has gone away. Small and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have a chi and wanted to try this out and it works just as we&#x27;ll even better than chi. You can change the temp/ heats up Im 30secs/ amazing!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as most straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Still a great little one though!</li>
    <li> I love the digital temperature and how quickly it heats up. This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> easy and smooth..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> The straightener is nice and works well, but the button to raise the temp. got stuck after the second week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for months now and I have absolutely no complains. It makes my hair straight without burning it to a crisp. I love the wide range of temperature choices. I have naturally loose curly hair, so I use 350 to do the basic straightening, 330 to get the bits by my ears and make everything curve the way I want, then 310 for my bangs and little bits. I have had no issue with it not working. To be honest I don&#x27;t even have to lock the temp part when I use it, I haven&#x27;t had the problem of accidentally switching it like everyone else is talking about. It&#x27;s a great straightener for a good price, and a cute color :)</li>
    <li> I have medium length, very thin hair. Most straighteners work pretty well for me, but some leave me with flyaways or make my hair feel dry and damaged. This straightener is absolutely perfect -- no flyaways at all, and the wide variety of temperatures lets me protect my hair. It works quickly and effectively. I always used to borrow my friends&#x27; Chi straighteners, and this is every bit as good, but for a fraction of the price. I can&#x27;t think of anything to complain about -- it&#x27;s really a perfect tool!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flatiron for my 11 year daughter for Christmas! She handle the iron extremely well and it worked wonders for her! In fact, Christmas morning she did her hair three times!</li>
    <li> Ever since I broke my last straightener I&#x27;ve been in need of a new one. I LOVE THIS ONE. The heat is perfect for my hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem to damage it. For the price and in general its good quality and i would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got tired of spending a lot of money on Chi&#x27;s that would break after a year, so she tried this. Her hair looks exactly the same. Not just being a guy, she said that the Remington was just as good.</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast haven&#x27;t used it only because I&#x27;m still using another one that&#x27;s exactly the same just a few years older and I love it works wonderful always leaves my hair perfectly straight soft and shinny heats up very fast as well.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. It heats up fast and it straightens very nicely. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons gets hot really fast just what you need but caution HOT they are</li>
    <li> Great Product! Got it in no time and it works great with all hair types! I would definetly recommend it</li>
    <li> I ordered this iron. Within a few days of reviewing, I strongly recommend this iron. Realized it just even reduced in pricing which even makes it more affordable. I have pretty wavy hair and lots of it. Within 20-25 minutes, my hair was straight. Amazing to say the least!</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener because I have been in the market for a new one. The one I currently have is a conair wet-to-dry straightener and it just was not cutting it for me anymore. I have really thick, long, curly hair and wanted one that would really do a good job. I could not afford a chi, like I wanted, so after reading the reviews for this one, I decided to purchase it. I am so glad I did! The price was unbeatable and the shipping was quick! I used it for the first time yesterday and I have never straightened my hair so quickly. I no longer have to go over the same spot multiple times like I use to. It heats up quickly and cools down quickly too. I love the color of it as well! Im sure I will want to straighten my hair more now that I have this awesome straightener! I would def reccommend this to everybody!</li>
    <li> This straightener is one of the best things I have ever bought.  I have very thick, curly, and sometimes frizzy hair.  I am able to use this straightener and  straighten my hair in half the time.  It looks really good too.  This straightener is also great for curling my hair, it is quick and easy, works really well, and the curls stay in, even after sleeping on the curls!  The only thing I have found wrong so far is the first time I used it there was a weird smell, but that has gone away after using it for a few times.  I assume it was only because the straightener was new.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews and even watching some video reviews elsewhere on this iron, I just had to try it. I had my eye on a more expensive one, considering all the other irons I had tried in this price range always left me disappointed. I went out and got this iron right away and was very fearful that my high hopes led on by other reviewers would be shattered once I used it. But instead of disappointment, I was DUMBFOUNDED. For under $20 I flat-ironed my hair within 5 minutes, took away most of the fizz I had and left a nice shine to my hair. I don&#x27;t have wavy hair, but I have thick, fizzy hair and now my hair feels lightweight and flat. I owned a high-end flat iron once and this cheap iron does SO MUCH BETTER! It heats up very quickly as advertised. It goes very nice throughout my hair, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with hair getting caught. I never wrote a review for anything before, but seriously, this is the best flat-iron I ever used. And the price makes it oh soo much more awesome!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on \\&quot;how horrible\\&quot; this straightener is, I got a little nervous.&lt;br /&gt;But as soon as I got it in the mail, I opened it and straightened my hair. Took all of 10 minutes. I am so surprised because this was only $15 bucks and I&#x27;ve had a straightener that was at least $50 and that one sucked. I am so happy I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And about the heat plates, they&#x27;re not aligned, but they push down against each other, so when you&#x27;re straightening your hair it just pushes together. If that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, heats up fast, get really hot, straightens my hair easily, very inexpensive. I would definitely recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. This is a decent item. Build quality is good. We also like the digital display onboard.</li>
    <li> My old straightener was on its way out...So I bought this one, fingers crossed because it wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive but had good reviews. I LOVE it! With very little effort my wavy hair is straight and shiny :)</li>
    <li> Does a good job straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> This really brought my attention I don&#x27;t know why... Wen I received it I thought that it was going to be a fake and not work at all but when I started using it I fell in love with it .. That&#x27;s why I bought a second one as a gift</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener a month ago, and it got here within two days. I&#x27;ve used it every single day since then. I absolutely love it 💜</li>
    <li> I always look at product reviews before purchasing items. The reviewers were very accurate in their descriptions of this product. I paid more for my daughter&#x27;s straightener and she is always using mine. I am going to purchase another for her so that she can stop using mine!</li>
    <li> Great purchase it was a replacement for my goddaughter as I had borrowed hers on a visit to Barbados and I kept it and I just love it love it.l Easy to handle and heats fast and definitely get hot.</li>
    <li> I wish I could just leave it at that one word, but amazon wants more so...&lt;br /&gt;This hair straightener is absolutely incredible! It makes my hair straighter, smoother, and softer than I have ever experienced even with salon straighteners!&lt;br /&gt;It gets a little hotter than others that I have used, so just be careful and take that into account with your hair type!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because I have the curling wand and I really love my wand . So undecided to give the straightener a chance . I am really glad I did , it straightens my hair really fast and leaves a nice shine to my hair . It heats up quick and gets the jod done and efficiently unlike some of the other straighteners I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, the feature that I loved most on this product was it&#x27;s little pull-out-button that clipped the two flat-iron plates together. It&#x27;s really such a simple thing, but it was actually such a space saving thing (for a flat-iron, at least). And I&#x27;ve gone through a couple irons and after a while they break down. This one lasted me a lot longer than I thought it would!</li>
    <li> Heats very quickly. I love the digital display and the capability to lock in the temperature. Be sure to pay attention to the recommended temperature for your hair type though. I could see burning your hair with these being a common problem. Love it though!</li>
    <li> This is the first such product I have purchased. I had no expectations or idea what to expect. It instantly heats, has a variety of heat settings, speeds up hair styling immensely. I love the color and the sleek design. It is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was two days prior to  the guaranteed date.</li>
    <li> This is perfect flat iron. I dont need to buy some expensive product anymore for my hair. Size is nice and perfect. Easy to use and easy to adjust the temperature. I really like it! Im using it straight and curl my hair. :)</li>
    <li> After I started growing out my hair, my little travel straightener couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore. This guy feels solid in my hand, heats up super quick, and applies heat evenly without me worrying about burning my hair. It also has the option to change the temperature, but the basic setting works for me. I would still recommend using some heat protection spray on your hair before using this on a regular basis to avoid getting straw-like hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! Leaves my hair look fab.</li>
    <li> I own a CHI 2 1/2\\&quot; flat iron but wanted a 1\\&quot; straightner for my shorter hair and I must agree with all the other reviews, this was the best $20 I spent (purchased this at Target) on a hair product!  It heats up fast and does what it needs to do.  I highly recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> The best part about this particular model is it will substitute as BIC lighter if you need to light a cigarette.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love this works oh so very good on my hair I got a lot of naps and it made me nap free love it</li>
    <li> Was delivered on time. Works great the best straightener that I have owned. Love it!!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this, it was being advertised as dual voltage (looks like it had been removed) and the remmingotn website still stays it is dual voltage but customer service says it no longer is, but refuses to remove the description I dictation dual voltage on their website.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed as I bought this for a Europe trip because I couldn&#x27;t take my chi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how well it works, I&#x27;ve used nothing but ancho for 5 years, it seemed to work adequate but compared to my regular straightener I was disappointed. I have thick wavy hair and it took too much work to straighten. Would have been worth it if it was dual voltage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a good straightener! It doesn&#x27;t snag, and its great for my damaged hair. I am totally in love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Remington! I have a curling wand and love it. And now I love my straightener. It heats up quick, my hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled and it makes my hair straight. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener for the price. It was designed with close attention to detail and works very well. it gets hot on the outside and is curved so that it works well for curling. I always have mine on the highest heat setting of 410 because I have very thick, very curly hair that would otherwise take 3 years to straighten. This one heats up in about 30 seconds and is very efficient and works well.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price! Definitely get your monies worth here</li>
    <li> Lllllllooooooove.!!! Itttttt.!</li>
    <li> Me encanto el producto, recibido en optimas condiciones y de la misma forma en que fue descrito por el vendedor. Recomendado 100%</li>
    <li> I love the way it glides with my hair...quick heat up too! The design is perfect for holding. I also like the color...although I am a pink girl...this color rocks!....Easy to use! Love my new magic hair styler! It can create cool soft curls too on its ends...!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because all the comments stated it was dual voltage. When I received the package it only stated 120, but i read a comment that said it only says one but works just fine in other countries. My first time using it was in South Africa, and it burnt out. I&#x27;m disappointed in this product because I only bought it for travel.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time as advertised</li>
    <li> I feel very happy with this purchase. was exactly what i have ordered&lt;br /&gt;and is working fine. very good product. thanks amazon !!!</li>
    <li> The good things no need to be recommended, buy it and then you will see. No more comments it&#x27;s needed</li>
    <li> Works great and heats up fast! If you have thick hair, I would get the wider plates but this size is perfect for thin or fine hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this straightener.  I have had at least a dozen other straighteners over the years and honestly, none of them stack up to this product.  I have fairly thick and rambunctious hair.  Some days its straight, other days wavy and then there are those wonderful days where it is just a frizzy mess.  Whatever the conditions, this product fixes it! It heats up fast and really gets hot, goes up to 410 degrees.  It really gets the job done.  I just split my hair in half, half up and half-down  and start at it.  I am done in a flash.  I have never burnt my hair or my hand using this product.  I had no complaints at all when it comes to this product.  I love the color; it is light weight making it perfect for travel or the gym.  I am so glad I purchased it, the price cannot be beat! I suggest if you are looking for a good straightener, search no further, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener a couple years and still love it!!</li>
    <li> Looked as if it had been used when I received it.  Returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price.  Straightens my curly hair quickly and also allows me to do different styles other than just stick straight.</li>
    <li> Great product! Wife&#x27;s enjoying it, heat up quickly and does agreat job.&lt;br /&gt;Very good value.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t straighten very well, heated up unevenly. Tugged on my hair and pulled out strands.</li>
    <li> excellent product 100% functional</li>
    <li> Heats up very quick and straightens hair nicely. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Convenient size and ready to use in seconds!</li>
    <li> Works fantastic! Love that for the price it works better than my previous (more expensive) straightener. Doesn&#x27;t snag hair and creates a smooth finish - which is a miracle coming from someone with naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> excellent product, what I asked was what got me</li>
    <li> Good straightener for a good price.</li>
    <li> Heats quickly and evenly, closes all the way, and is perfect for thick, curly hair like mine! I love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing Flat Iron. The color is perfect and it straightens hair Smooth and leaves an awesome Finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely Would Recommend This Product !</li>
    <li> This is a really good straightener. It gets hot and straights ur hair flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I put this as a rating 5 because this item is amazing it works amazing!! It was worth the price and what&#x27;s even better is that it&#x27;s my favorite color purple! At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was going to work but after receiving this item I fell in love. The next day I used it and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. It heats up fast and no static and it definitely smooths the hair.&lt;br /&gt; There is nothing I dislike about this I just love it!&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this product to anyone. Who ever needs a good hair straightener this is what you need! I promise you, this product is absolutely amazing!!</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and short and my daughter´s hair is thin and long. It works very well for we both, it´s is lightweight, heats fast and add shine to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Price and benefits are amazing! I do recommend this product and soon I will buy another one as a spare.</li>
    <li> I can straighten my hair in about 10 minutes with this straightener. It heats up very quickly and works great. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: 7 months later and this straightener is dying out on me. :/ my hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight for very long anymore, if it straightens at all. looking into getting a new one.</li>
    <li> great for a straight look. Different heat levels for the amount of straightness. Loose curls can be done as well. It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair, my hair curl up and get puffy. So far this flat iron has been keeping my hair straight. I don&#x27;t always put heat on my hair, however when I do it does the job. I&#x27;ve only use it on the front and edges tho but still my previous flat iron couldn&#x27;t even get that straighten. Also this can get your extensions bone straight I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> It was brand new. It straighten my course africa american natural hair. It stayed straighten for days. I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener last week. I had a Chi straightener for many years that stopped working. Before that i had a Paul Mitchell one. I love this Remington straightener!!! Its works great on my hair. I would highly recommend this to anyone and you cant beat the price. I just wish it came in other color choices like black or white, but other than that its an awesome buy!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener! Works great. I like the temp control. Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m frying my hair. Swiveling cord is also a good feature.</li>
    <li> I was worried that this was going to be sub standard because it was so cheap. My past straightener was about $150 and died in less than 2 years (I only use it twice a week). I did have the same issue as previous reviews, that perhaps it doesn&#x27;t meet up perfectly- but it&#x27;s really not a big deal. I have successfully been able to curl my hair with this one which I have failed at with previous straighteners (that&#x27;s probably more to do with technique than anything but still!) It heats up nice and quickly, and having the buttons on the side (not on top) mean I am less likely to accidentally turn it off.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GREAT OFFER</li>
    <li> It is inexpensive and works great.  I can use the lowest heat on my daughters hair and she&#x27;s not afraid of it.  It cuts doing hair time in half compared to using a hot comb.  There are not large chunks of hair falling out because of rough handling.  I wished I would have found this earlier.  I don&#x27;t have to use the highest setting to get my hair straight which is a plus for me because I have thick hair.  It has auto shut off which a necessity in my household when mommy is suppose to be at four different places at one time</li>
    <li> Excellent for coarse hair</li>
    <li> My daughter lives. She&#x27;s hard to please.</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t purchase this for my hair but rather to seal mylar food storage bags, lol.  Sorry I can&#x27;t comment on the hair side of things but I can say that it does a great job on the mylar bags!</li>
    <li> I like it. it goes up to 410 degrees. The only problem with it is when i straighten it it goes back to being wavy again. But that is the only problem I have with it</li>
    <li> This item works well it heats up fast i have had this product for over a month and have been using almost daily and have had no issues and i would recommend this product</li>
    <li> FREAKIN FANTASTIC!!!!</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to use!! Great value.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, good seller.  I love this straightener......I felt like my previous one was starting to pull my hair out, and this runs over my hair like nothing.  Good results!</li>
    <li> Best affordable straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. Only one I can curl my hair with. Only complaint is that a year after having it (and daily use) it still smells the that new product/plastic burning</li>
    <li> They did a great job on my hair and it&#x27;s Natural.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener it&#x27;s the best I have ever used . Ast first it smells worried but after awhile it goes away love this it heats up fast the heat goes to 410 I use it  on the the lowest n it&#x27;s good with that n I curl my hair with this n it&#x27;s nice the price is good so can&#x27;t go wrong with that its a must have</li>
    <li> My old flat iron died so I was desperate to get a new one. I read the reviews on this one and they were positive so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s great! Fantastic price and it&#x27;s everything the reviews said it was!</li>
    <li> This straightener works very well and is a great price. I accidentally bought a second straightener. (Slightly more expensive than this one.) I prefer this one! It does the job quickly and very well. My hair has never been pin straight before and I&#x27;m loving it. I can even flip my hair out or curl it towards my face with this straightener. I have wavy/curly hair that I try to blow dry straight. It never usually works, or if it does then it doesn&#x27;t work well. I have trouble spots that are hard to straighten and this straightener smooths them. I only went over each &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; section once and the &amp;#34;trouble spots&amp;#34; two or three times using the lowest setting. I think the digital display is awesome and I love the fact you don&#x27;t have to stick your fingers near the heating pads because the controls are on the side. (Not inside, like most straighteners!) This product is not dual voltage, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason. I have not had this for very long, so I cannot attest to how long the product will work. My favorite part about this is there is no burning smell. I&#x27;ve used it on all three settings and no smell! :)</li>
    <li> Great straightening iron for a great price. You don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money on other ones, this one is all you need. Definitely recommending!</li>
    <li> My Chi straightener stop working and I decided to order this one. Incredible result! It does smell a little burnt but it is new so I know it will fade away. I have really long curly hair and with my chi straightener it used to take me about an 40 minutes to straight now this one takes me less than 15!</li>
    <li> I love this tool at first I thought it would be just another hair straighter , I was wrong it only take my about 20 min to do my hair and I have very thick hair , all you have to do is turn it on and it heats up so fast , you can change the temperatures and everything , if your thinking about getting a hair straighter then get this one</li>
    <li> I had a chi straightener for about 6 years and I really wanted something like that one because I had it so long and I loved it! Then I found this one and I read the reviews and they were really good so I decided to get it. I was really surprised at how fast it came in the mail. Now, having used it for a few weeks it really is a great straightener. It&#x27;s also a lot less than a chi!</li>
    <li> i bought this product on may 10th and received it on may 13th. it came REALLY fast as you can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve waited this long to leave a review so i could like.. grow into it a bit and see if it lasted longer than a week at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works really amazing. one of the reviews i read on here said something about the temperature changing part being like changing the temperature on a stove, which is very true but i don&#x27;t really mind it. i kinda like it better than my old hair straightener (which was the instyler, can you believe it?) where you could only set it to low, medium and high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been straightening my hair with this product probably in between each week since i received it but i don&#x27;t use it a lot, as heat causes damage. if i straighten my hair, about 15 minutes later it&#x27;s not gonna be PERFECTLY straight, it ends up a little wavy WHICH I LOVE! it&#x27;s not the straightener that does that though, it&#x27;s my hair and i know that for a fact since it&#x27;s happened in the past with old straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, personally i set it to the lowest temperature this thing can do, which is 310. i don&#x27;t wanna go any higher because i don&#x27;t wanna risk really damaged hair - and it just so happens to work really great at that temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr: this product is really great, i suggest you buy this if you&#x27;re looking for something a little simpler than the \\&quot;instyler\\&quot; at least + it&#x27;s a lot smaller than it so i think it&#x27;s travel size depending on what you carry it in.</li>
    <li> This has been the case for any one of their products I&#x27;ve purchased!I finally parted with a (still working) 10 year old set of curlers, that I&#x27;ve used a million times and put through the wars! I&#x27;m ordering this straightener for the second time because my 2 year old decided to put the first one in the toilet!It&#x27;s on the way and I can&#x27;t wait to have it back! It gets HOT really fast and works like a charm!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Much better than expected for such an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Fast shipping! Will definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice straightener, heats up fast and the buttons are well placed so that you aren&#x27;t hitting them while trying to straighten your hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, better than others more expensive.</li>
    <li> Came on time love love love I brought this flatiron awhile bk and it was recently stolen I had to get another1</li>
    <li> Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good. It doesnt take a long time to make it hot</li>
    <li> Bought it April 2015, by July 2015 the power button would no longer turn it off. Now, August 2015...it won&#x27;t even go on. When it worked, it was great, but it should last longer that 4.5 months.</li>
    <li> Loveeeee this flat iron! It takes only seconds to heat up! It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair thanks to the ceramic plates and it looks very professional with the digital touch to it. I got my moneys worth and more!</li>
    <li> Arrived broken, wouldn&#x27;t turn on and then when it finally did it made clicking sounds and would turn itself off. Plastic felt flimsy and smelled strongly. Needless to say this item was returned.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener. And for how cheap it is, I wouldn&#x27;t not get it!</li>
    <li> That thing gets super quick ! Haven&#x27;t had a problem yet , I wasn&#x27;t gonna buy at First because of the negative review but I still did and it&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
    <li> Exacly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all! Does it&#x27;s job of making my hair straight. I prefer my hair bone straight however since it is on the thick side so my hair can&#x27;t be that way unless I put tons of product.</li>
    <li> I love my new flat iron</li>
    <li> It works on my type 4, coarse natural hair without a problem, and I love how the display looks. It&#x27;s not exactly the best, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This iron is pretty good for its cost . Well the pro is it irons really very well . I have curly hair . The con I would say it started burning my hair after some use</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my thin hair with no static</li>
    <li> Heats up really quickly, and is really easy to use. also love the color purple that makes it look fun!!</li>
    <li> The ceramic flat irons are ok. You know the saying you get what you pay for thats these flat irons their ok not the best at all and some times you might luck up and get something good for cheap but not this product i gave them to my 14yr old niece. I went and got baby bliss flats and they are really good</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase. Coming from an older straitner that took forever to heat up I was blown away how hot this thing got and how fast. Def worth the buy in my opinion. My only regret is not doing it sooner. My suggestion though is it gets extremely hot so do not leave it on ur hair long at all.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price of this item. I&#x27;ve very thick hair and little patience and this straightener works great. Heats up in seconds, easy to change temperatures and of course I love that it is purple. Don&#x27;t spend 100+ dollars on a straightener when this does the same thing for way cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for a cheap but salon quality flat iron.  My hair dresser uses a babyliss...I didn&#x27;t want to spend $135 on an iron when I go to the salon 2-3 times a month. So I read the reviews. All of the reviews on a variety of sites. The only flat iron that fit the bill (cheap with salon results) was this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived via Amazon Prime shipping I could not wait to open it and try it out. And I did just that! Oh my... People this iron does not behave like a under $20 iron. Seriously! If you are contemplating this iron....just go ahead and get it. It&#x27;s cheap...if you don&#x27;t like it (which I HIGHLY doubt) then its not real dent in your pocket. But I promise you will like...no love this iron! Real talk!!!!</li>
    <li> Its nice new and seamless :) works nice even on thick hair. :) recommended XD</li>
    <li> Every thing about this is perfect. Its the right size, not too big or too small, heats up really quickly, does a fabulous job. My only problem is (and its my biggest problem), after about 3 months, the temperature control didn&#x27;t work very well. Its a digital display where you press the + to increase and the - to decrease the temperature. That didn&#x27;t work well for too long. It gets stuck all the time, to the point where i have to unplug the unit to reduce or increase the temp, neither does it go off.</li>
    <li> Meh. For the price is does the job but I have to hit the On button multiple times so I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;s just not going to work one morning.</li>
    <li> Although it takes a while to straighten my hair and although it doesn&#x27;t come out pin straight, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. Lovely color and nice to handle.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, only wish they made a smaller one. It is easy to handle, you won&#x27;t regret this buy at all. I wish I discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> Great for price is cute works well. It does say it&#x27;s lowest setting is a little over 100 degrees but it only goes down to 310. I just use it fast before it heats up to much as to not damage my hair too much.</li>
    <li> I actually like this straightener better than my Chi!</li>
    <li> this was my first hair straightener i ever bought and it didn&#x27;t disappoint me at all! works perfectly fine for my hair and gives decent heat from very high to bearable.. all in all its worth to have this one at home for everyday use.. love this straightener!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener based on good reviews and the low price. Awesome purchase! It heats up quickly, the temp is adjustable and the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled. I would buy this again in a second!!</li>
    <li> Light, Small but super powerful. Takes a only a few seconds to heat up to max. Gets the job done asap which is exactly what I need with a busy schedule!</li>
    <li> This straightener is so good when my daughter has school it is quick and easy and she loves how it works thank you very very much!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the quality and ease of the straightener, but i feel it should start and maybe 100 degrees for thinner hair.</li>
    <li> This  flat iron works really well.  I particularly like the  thermostat feature. Makes hair super straight. Recommended for  extra coarse black hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick. I have a mixture of puerto rican and african-american hair. This may work well on thinner hair, but for me, it only gets the job done. Hair becomes frizzy by the end of the day. You don&#x27;t always have to spend a plethora of money to get the right straightner, but this one is truly a cheap piece of work.</li>
    <li> This straightener was a HUGE disappointment.  It has a very cheap plastic feel to it, which I could get over if it weren&#x27;t for its other problems.  Firstly, it smells terrible.  There&#x27;s a constant burning smell whenever the straightener is on.  I thought that maybe this would wear off with time, but it hasn&#x27;t.  The plastic gets very hot, so you have to hold it in just the right way while you use it or you risk burning yourself.  The worst thing about this straightener, however, is the plates.  They are simply not smooth enough to glide through hair, especially if you are trying to use it to curl your hair.  I have owned several other cheap straighteners in the past, and have never before had one that fails to glide through hair.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I need it to. It heats up quickly and gets my hair how I want it in a short period of time. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I needed a simple hair straightened that could straighten my frizzy, thick hair. The best thing about this straightener is that it heats up very quickly and it stays hot! Great buy for the price!  Review updated nearly 4 years later (06/27/2016): I still use this straightener every single day. It heats up within seconds and is great for little touch ups. I would not say that this is the best option to straighten an entire head of thick  hair as the plates are too narrow, but it is a great little straightened for touch ups and quick straightening!</li>
    <li> If, like me, you found this item by browsing for a dual voltage iron, then BEWARE. Remington makes (or at least made) a dual voltage version. And Amazon thinks it is supplying that version. But at the very least that is unreliable. I received a 110 only version. Amazon agreed it was their error, and shipped me a second and a third one. All of them are only 110. And these would definately need a transformer - not just a plug adapter - to be used safely with 220. See the description of this other remington iron http://www.amazon.com/Remington-S9950-Moisturizing-Conditioning-Straightener/dp/B001LF4I8I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while this may be a good iron, you will probably NOT get a dual voltage one. Dual voltage ones SAY THEY ARE DUAL VOLTAGE in the manual and on the item itself.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, works really well. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived within 2 days &amp; work really good . couldn&#x27;t wait to open it !</li>
    <li> I want to love this but i cant. The flat, ceramic beds are not flat! they are slightly curved. This makes it pinch on hair.</li>
    <li> I have owned this straightener for years and have been very happy. It made beautiful curls and glides through hair easily. It just now, after years of use, has started to diminish in quality. I very sadly had to upgrade. Although I was initially going to purchase the same flat iron a second time, I decided to go with another in the Remington brand that I found at Ulta. I&#x27;m sad to say goodbye to this particular straightener... It you purchase, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It works as they said it will, my wife like it, nice product</li>
    <li> works great and fast!</li>
    <li> It worked well. However it smells like something is burning. I used this about an year and now it is not working. Need another flat iron now, and I&#x27;m not going to buy this one again :/</li>
    <li> Ive used hair straightener for many years, like 11,12 years. and this was the first time that I bought an 1 inch one. But it is very good. It heats up pretty soon and cool down soon as well. I straighten my hair using it almost every week and I am satisfied with it,</li>
    <li> works perfectly and the quality is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them.&lt;br /&gt; i can&#x27;t use  the gift coupon  in my country. I am Latin American and my country these coupons are not valid.</li>
    <li> The things we really like best about this iron are 1) it auto shuts off - which has been a problem with my kid in the past, and 2) it has a variable heat setting so you don&#x27;t damage your hair any more than you want to (ha!).  Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> way better then the $100 straightener my husband bought me.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling since I don’t like to take my expensive iron with me.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> After about 2.5 years of having this, it still works great!</li>
    <li> When I bought this straightener it had great reviews, and lasted almost 4 years of straightener my hair every day. It&#x27;s the only straightener I&#x27;ve ever used that can tame my frizzy wavy hair in 10 min. or less. It finally stopped working after 4 (almost 5) years, so I came back to order the exact same one. I was suprised that it&#x27;s gotten such bad reviews lately but I went ahead and bought it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now and it works just like my last one- not a SINGLE problem. I have no idea why the other cusomers are having such a problem, it&#x27;s always been my favorite!</li>
    <li> I love this flat-iron. It gets really hot and it curls my hair easily. Good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more</li>
    <li> I love it. It does what I need and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a family member $16.99 during the summer.  She really likes it.  I decided to put this on my Christmas wish list and noticed the price had doubled!  Why?  I won&#x27;t be getting this for the double price.</li>
    <li> i love this straightener but it does not get as hot as i want it to</li>
    <li> I have super long thick hair and what usually takes me about 30 minuets to straighten my hair, only took me about 5 with this straightener, not only is it cute but a great deal!</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve only used this one time, and should my opinion change, I&#x27;ll update this review, but as for now - I am very pleased.  It&#x27;s lightweight, heats up quickly and, most importantly, left my hair shiny, smooth and straight with minimal effort.  My hair has a natural wave to it, and is fine, yet plentiful.  It&#x27;s about shoulder length, and only took me 5 minutes to straighten everything, and I have a layered cut.  The only weird thing was how smooth it ran through my hair. No pulling or grabbing at all. I&#x27;m sure this is how they should work, but the one I&#x27;m replacing is old!</li>
    <li> I have pretty curly hair and it can take up to an hour and a half to straighten it with some irons. This one only took about 45 minutes. Also, it heats up really fast. I love this iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and she loves the way it works for her hair type and hair style.</li>
    <li> I have 4 kids under 6 yrs old, so personal pampering time is limited! I have shoulder-blade length, medium weight, naturally curly hair. This straightener heats up quickly in the time it takes me to just comb out any tangles. Just once over all my hair takes 10 minutes give or take, depending on how many times I have to stop and tend to a child. But this straightener worked so well; quickly and perfectly. Not even one single complaint about the job it did on my hair (used medium heat). After sleeping on it, it still looked awesome, maybe even better? the next day. It cooled fast and stores easily. I am more than happy and would tell anyone to buy this. Other brands may seem to offer more but what more do you want other than perfectly straight, easy, and QUICK hair styles?</li>
    <li> thinking this was gonna be a waste of $20, i was soooooo wrong. this is the best flat iron ever. worth the price appose from $100 flat irons -___- but i love this ish, I just got it today and now I&#x27;m doing my hair, and I look fabulous!</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast, only need to go over sections maybe twice, smooth and straight finish! Works great on my medium thick, frizzy hair. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was a little adamant about purchasing this item when I read the negative reviews. But after doing a little research, I decided to purchase it and this ended up being a great item. First let me just address the concerns regarding the negative reviews. Yes this ceramic straightener does not close Flush. It touches at the end tip and widens as it goes back. This is actually not uncommon as most (if not all) straighteners do not close flush. You actually don&#x27;t need the straightener to close flush anyways because your hair will touch both blades due to its volume when you grab a bunch to straighten. It&#x27;s also better for the device if the blades don&#x27;t touch because if they do, the extreme heat from each blade will cause the ceramic parts to wear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the good, this device is light and compact. It comes with a led temperature light so you know exactly which temperature you&#x27;re using, heats up in about a min, has a swivel cord so no tangles, has an auto shut off in case you leave it on, and has a locking mechanism to keep it close. It works perfectly for me whether I&#x27;m straightening my hair or curling it. I&#x27;ve had no problems or issues with it and it&#x27;s smooth to use. I did have a couple of instances where it was bunching and pulling my hair but that was because I was applying to much pressure on the grip not because of the device itself. All in all its a great straightener at a great price with a lot of great features.</li>
    <li> If you are like me you have an older flat iron that only works half the time and takes ages to warm up. This should be your replacement one, it is well made and heats up so quickly. Straightened my hair with one pass, whereas my other one took 2-3. Has a nifty little lock that keeps it closed when not in use. Worth every bit of its low price!</li>
    <li> My 10 yr old daughter wanted to start straightening her hair sometimes. Her hair is fine, and given the previous reviews, I figured the price was definitely right for what this would do. I think it&#x27;s great and if you have relatively fine hair and/or fairly straight hair to begin with, you will not be disappointed. If you have hard to straighten hair, I have no idea. This is the best price + rating I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
    <li> I always knew that remington was a good brand. I have used their flat iron&#x27;s before. So when i went into stores and saw there outrageous prices i knew that i had to check amazon. I am so glad i did. for this price and knowing the history of the brand i was anxiously waiting for it to arrive. I used it today for the first time and i was soooooooooo damned happy about it. this flat iron is the best ever and i promise you that you wont need another one for a long time. the starting heat of it is 370 and it goes alll the way to 410 i used it 370 and it straightened my hair instantly !! it also curled my hair too . i am in love !! it also makes a good xmas gift !!</li>
    <li> I bought this at walmart a few months ago, and when I got it, I was so excited because I had a remington straightener before, and it was decent. So I figured, well the price is really good, and I researched straighteners for a while to pick one, and I ended up choosing this one..&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that the heat temperature goes up to 410 degrees, so that&#x27;s a plus. But I do definitely recommend getting serum for your hair or something so it isn&#x27;t damaged.  My straightener heats up in about a minute - a minute and a half when I set it on 410... And I usually straighten my hair in sections, so I will put it up, and it usually only takes about 10 minutes to straighten my whole head, and it&#x27;s a pretty good straightener and I recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> i use iteveyr week &amp; it heats up quick!! i use it all the time and i do pnt even bave to out it on 410</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used and the price point is just perfect.  This flat iron heats up really fast and I have been getting the greatest compliments on my hair each time I use it.</li>
    <li> My HairArt iron pooped out on me after I had previously repaired it 3 or 4 times.  I needed something really hot and inexpensive that would work...this did the trick!</li>
    <li> Its really good! I&#x27;ve boughten two. I lost the first one I bought then bought another one. I&#x27;ve had a chi but prefer this one!</li>
    <li> Just one thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this product was, the handle can get hot! But other then that I love how it straightened my hair!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener after my Chi finally died. It works amazingly well for the price. The only negative is that it smells like it&#x27;s burning my hair... this may be an operator error on my part with just having it too hot, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with Chis. Either way, this is definitely worth the price, and I love that it&#x27;s purple.</li>
    <li> This is very good product. Its cheap and it does the job. I was happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The more I use this flat iron the more shiny my hair becomes. It really does prevent frizz and it makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> Great for bangs especially but good for the entire head of course :).not bulky - easy to handle. For the price it&#x27;s especially a good deal.</li>
    <li> I recently got a pixie cut and I needed a straightener for when I do my hair in the morning. It heats up ridiculously fast, has great control, and left my hair looking flawlessly shiny! I would recommend this to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent</li>
    <li> Bought forever ago and still works great! great size for my styling my bangs and even my mom uses it every day and she has short fine hair and it works great for her! You can even curl your hair with this straightener creating soft beach waves without a curling iron! fits great in a carry on luggage and is small enough it wont take up a lot of room! Even without heat protectant product this straightener doesn&#x27;t damage your hair and keeps it frizz free and soft!</li>
    <li> My daughter had this flat iron for less than a year when it quit working. The control buttons were in an awkward place, and she kept shutting it off accidently when she used it. I would not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> i got my flat iron today and im in,love such a great produc, for a really good price. Makes mu hair look silky smooth</li>
    <li> Good item,  I got this item on time&lt;br /&gt;Good product for the price&lt;br /&gt;It was I expected when I order this.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! I have never used a better one. I love the digital temp display and the purple color. The 1inch plates are amazingly quick... even works on wet hair!</li>
    <li> Love it. My grand daughter has course big afro. I was able to straighten and even curl it! Its amazing</li>
    <li> Bought this just to &amp;#34;get me by&amp;#34; until I got a better one, but seriously it is still my favorite! Heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, temperature control, and is still going strong after having it for over a year. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be this wonderful, but it blew my mind!!</li>
    <li> Works really well and heats up pretty fast</li>
    <li> I guess i cant expect much for such a cheap price. So i cant say it isnt worth the money. I do like that it is auto shut off- bc im usually in a rush and forget to unplug it in the morning- so now im worry free.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical since it was so cheap but it works wonderfully. Great buy for a inexpensive price!</li>
    <li> excellent product I liked a lot and filled all my expectations surely buy again because I really liked the recomiento</li>
    <li> I used several straightener before. I wish I had bought this product from the beginning. It&#x27;s portable, light, beautiful and straighten my hair very well. The only problem is - it looks like there is a button to turn it on, but no button to turn if off. I have to pull the power line out form the outlet.</li>
    <li> I love my Remington Flat Irons! They have controlled temperature,so they shut themselves off which is an added bonus for those days i&#x27;m in a hurry &amp; forget to turn them off. They also leave my hair silky straight.</li>
    <li> Bought it from Walmart, just an FYI (was like 14 bucks there) but still wanted to give a review. Heats up pretty quick, and is compact enough that it works on shorter hair. Mine is in the &#x27;growing out a pixie cut&#x27; phase and is about chin length right now, this thing works perfect. A must have if you can&#x27;t stand to spend a bunch of money on a hair tool.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is salon quality. So far, it straightens my natural kinky (4b/c texture) dead straight after a blow out. It&#x27;s very sleek ans heats up quickly. It doesn&#x27;t tug or plug my hair and after two or three passes my hair is tamed without that burnt, fried smell. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron since 2011! I love it. I not only use it to straighten my hair but to curl it as well. I can get my hair straight with one pass. If/when this one ever dies on me I will definitely be purchasing another..</li>
    <li> quicker to be hotter. and easier to use</li>
    <li> I would like to start by saying that this device works as intended. The key part is that there is only 1 FLOATING PLATE!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after looking at all the amazing reviews about it.  The super low price was a huge plus, too.  So far I have only used it a couple times (because I try not to use too much heat on my hair), but I love the way it makes my hair feel.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.  If you are on the fence about it, I&#x27;m telling you it is worth a try so just go ahead and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**And don&#x27;t forget to use some heat protection every single time you put heat on your hair... EVERY TIME!!!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GG190I Nexxus Heat Protexx Heat Protection Styling Spray, 8.5 fl oz (250 ml)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00390MKOM John Frieda Frizz, Ease Heat Defeat Heat Protection Spray, 6 oz,]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005NIT3P2 Silk Elements MegaSilk Heat Protection Spray]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000KQ74AI Redken Smooth Down Heat Glide 5 oz]]</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!  Pick your temp, love the color, and the smaller wand.  I only use it on my bangs.....they curl up at the sight of moisture!!</li>
    <li> Good straightener. Decent quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a much thicker straightener for years, but I wanted one that was thinner because recently got an A-lign hairstyle.I needed a much thinner straightener because of how short my hair was on the back. I love remington products and this one works very satisfactorily. It heats up very fast and the curvy style allows you to also curl your hair. The only drawback is that it only heats up to 410.</li>
    <li> I rarely need to use a flat iron so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on one. This straightener works perfectly!  I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an african american woman with naturally thick and curly hair. This got my hair bone straight in less than an hour! It&#x27;s amazing. It left my hair soft and shiny... not hard and rough like my other straighteners that I paid over $100 for. Cheap price but not cheaply made. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Cheap. Love it. Works amazingly. I have thick hair with a curl to it as well so it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now got two high end hair irons in the bathroom closet and I&#x27;m using only this one. For $15 it&#x27;s a true bargain. It heats up quicker than the other two, and breaks many fewer hairs. It leaves my hair shiny and straight in half the time it takes with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With thick curly hair, and living in a humid climate, I&#x27;m passionate about hair irons. This one could be better than irons that cost 10 times the price.</li>
    <li> Loves this! I don&#x27;t have to wait for very long for it to get hot. Does the job quick. I&#x27;m in and out of the bathroom in no time.</li>
    <li> overall satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because if you don&#x27;t start on the top of your head close to your hair roots, you get a kink/crease in your hair.</li>
    <li> This straightener lasted me a whole year. I bought it at the beginning of 2014 and it burned out just two months ago in Jan 2015. So for the $16 you spend on it, it&#x27;s a pretty good buy. But I would invest in a little better quality of a straightener so it will last longer. The straightened gets very hot and did a good job on my coarse hair.</li>
    <li> i just got my straightener today and i already love it! i am in love with the color purple and i am so happy that this is purple.  shipping was super fast gotta love AMAZON PRIME!  but also the heat up time was so fast and it glides through my fine hair. i absolutely love it! im definitely throwing out all my crappy straighteners and keeping only one! where has this been all my life?! don&#x27;t waste another minute thinking about it ladies! just go ahead and buy it! you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> this flat iron gets really hot quickly.&lt;br /&gt;other flat irons that i have used snag my hair at the end but not this one. the sides are curved so you can actually add a curl at the end of your hair without it looking kinked.</li>
    <li> Works great even with my thick hair!</li>
    <li> Goes up to 410 and gets my 3c/4a hair straight 😃😃😃. Pleased with this one</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot from this iron based on the price, but after owning it for two years I am really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;(+) Heats up very quickly compared to other irons&lt;br /&gt;(+) Stays hot after multiple passes&lt;br /&gt;(+) Temp controls are helpful, making this work with fine or thick hair&lt;br /&gt;(+) The shape and size of the iron make it ideal for both straightening and curling&lt;br /&gt;(+) Works perfectly as curling iron because of the rounded edges and small size, it&#x27;s easy to turn and curl&lt;br /&gt;(+) Power cord is long enough and has a swivel where it attaches, it&#x27;s not going to get loose or break&lt;br /&gt;(+) The price, I mean come on... under 20 bucks.. it&#x27;s impossible to beat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons / Considerations:&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;(-) It&#x27;s not going to last forever&lt;br /&gt;(-) After 2 years of use, the temp controls stopped working&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it seems like two years of use is pretty good, considering it is a small plastic appliance that gets very hot and is used almost every day. Even the much more expensive irons will not last forever. At least with this one it&#x27;s inexpensive enough that replacing it is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best all around hair styling tools you can get for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on how to curl with this, check YouTube. Many of the videos will feature this exact iron.rch for \\&quot;how to curl with a straightening iron\\&quot; or similar, many of the videos will feature this exact iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the naysayers fool you and don&#x27;t get suckered into paying 10x as much for an iron that will probably break in about the same amount of time as this one. If this one does eventually break, the replacement cost is so low you won&#x27;t even sweat it.</li>
    <li> Heats up in less than 30 seconds! This is a huge time saver in the morning and it is super easy to tell what temperature is at with the digital display. I have frizzy hair and this keeps it straight until I wash my hair again. I have a Remington curling iron and hair dryer and I have never had a problem with them and this will I&#x27;m sure be the same. The automatic shutoff after 30 minuets is super helpful if I&#x27;m rushing and forget to turn it off. I love this straightener and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
