      <li>Good product,wonderfull well pack and look soo nice quality it took a while to get it since i live inDR but was worth the waiting!</li>
      <li>but once I washed them and let them sit they were fine</li>
      <li>Not only are they great quality but the case they come in is not a flimsy or cheap material.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy cheap brushes again, my fault.</li>
      <li>Brushes are nice, but the case was really flimsy.</li>
      <li>I would have liked one or two other styles of brushes to really complete this set, but I am very happy and not complaining.</li>
      <li>Overall good brushes.</li>
      <li>Nicely package, variety of brushes and it is soft.</li>
      <li>you are using the mineral makeup, it is probably still a good idea to use a larger-head brush for overall application of the product.  </li>
      <li>and I think they apply powders and shadows beautifully -- even better than some of the brushes in a more expensive set I have.  </li>
      <li>Pretty soft and nice...</li>
      <li>They are very soft and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Great for everyday makeup application.</li>
      <li>Fantastic and high quality brushes just as the description says!</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are also nice if you use wet foundation and then use these brushes to finish with a light powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But they&#x27;re pretty cool</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and easy to dry.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also some significant fall-out from the brushes, particularly the face brushes.</li>
      <li>They do smell like paint when you first recieve them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I have extra blush brushes now, but I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
      <li>using most of them for blending or if I&#x27;ve forgotten to clean my other brushes.</li>
      <li>I preferred my old set (eco or environmentally friendly) from Walmart.</li>
      <li>; so far have come out clean and re-fluff with no problems.</li>
      <li>You have to pretty much guess what each brush is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>But if you need to use concealer or concentrate on certain areas -- I have Rosacea myself --</li>
      <li>I would say if you&#x27;re looking for dirt-cheap brushes, reconsider that because you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Very sturdy.</li>
      <li>The quality is really what I am looking for.</li>
      <li>it is nice to use these brushes for prep and then go over your entire face and neck with the larger brush to finish -- without ending up with too much product on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad and actually applies pretty well.</li>
      <li>Many of the brushes are oddly shaped.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them and would order from this company again.</li>
      <li>Just wished they were more firm</li>
      <li>My one concern with brushes is that they&#x27;re soft - and these are very soft!</li>
      <li>Very soft.</li>
      <li>They are very soft</li>
      <li>The brissles are so soft too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I would be able to apply foundation with any of these brush.</li>
      <li>My 28 year old niece loves this set!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re decent enough, but really they&#x27;re far too soft to hold pigment</li>
      <li>, these brushes are pussy-willow soft.  </li>
      <li>They are so soft and</li>
      <li>they are like professional brushes without the price - ive been using them for a couple months now</li>
      <li>She threw away all her old brushes and now is just using these.</li>
      <li>and no bristles have fallen out for me so far.</li>
      <li>eye shadow brushes were probably the only decent things here.</li>
      <li>There is enough variety in this set to pretty much take care of all your needs for applying any type of dry makeup -- and the smaller brushes for the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; products like eye shadow, lipstick or gloss.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have brushes from Bare Minerals and they are labeled (Buki, Heavenly Face, etc.)</li>
      <li>My only issue is the blush brush is almost too soft, so I just use my MAC one.</li>
      <li>No hair fall out, no loose parts.</li>

    <li> strong smell!! brushes work good though</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent . I bought them as a gift for my daughter and she loved them!!! Not only are they great quality but the case they come in is not a flimsy or cheap material. Very sturdy. Highly recommend them and would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re decent enough, but really they&#x27;re far too soft to hold pigment/apply powder/blusher, etc. There&#x27;s also some significant fall-out from the brushes, particularly the face brushes. I would say if you&#x27;re looking for dirt-cheap brushes, reconsider that because you really do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye shadow brushes were probably the only decent things here. But it&#x27;s really not worth it for the whole shebang of mediocrity.</li>
    <li> The only brushes that were soft were the few blush brushes.  The rest were awful!!!! Can&#x27;t use any of them.</li>
    <li> A very nice set of makeup brushes for a reasonable price.  There is enough variety in this set to pretty much take care of all your needs for applying any type of dry makeup -- and the smaller brushes for the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; products like eye shadow, lipstick or gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using the mineral makeup, it is probably still a good idea to use a larger-head brush for overall application of the product.  But if you need to use concealer or concentrate on certain areas -- I have Rosacea myself -- it is nice to use these brushes for prep and then go over your entire face and neck with the larger brush to finish -- without ending up with too much product on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also nice if you use wet foundation and then use these brushes to finish with a light powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sturdy.  The ones I have &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; so far have come out clean and re-fluff with no problems.</li>
    <li> My husband bought these brushes for me and they are very nice! The brissles are so soft too!</li>
    <li> They were good and the price was right. The quality is really what I am looking for. I don&#x27;t think I will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes and my girl stealing from me all the time because they work so good</li>
    <li> I like the look of the brushes, they are comfortable to use, and there are so many of them, it provides a nice variety of brushes to use. The one thing that I really do not like is the pouch that it comes with. It looks different than in the picture. It is a thin plastic. It also gets dirty pretty fast on the outside and on the inside, so I suggest getting something other than the pouch to hold the brushes.</li>
    <li> My mother would collect pussy-willow buds and use them to apply eye shadow and powder.  As a teen, I did the same thing.  I&#x27;d forgotten how wonderfully a pussy willow bud applied shadows and powder and how deliciously soft they felt on the skin (no dragging)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, these brushes are pussy-willow soft.  I love the feel and I think they apply powders and shadows beautifully -- even better than some of the brushes in a more expensive set I have.  These have become my fave.  I can apply a lot or just a little with near-perfect results.  I would have liked one or two other styles of brushes to really complete this set, but I am very happy and not complaining.</li>
    <li> great product at a great price with super fast delivery! Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice set for the price.  My 28 year old niece loves this set!</li>
    <li> They are okay. Not the best.  I preferred my old set (eco or environmentally friendly) from Walmart. For about the same price.</li>
    <li> Nice for the price. They washed well. The case is a bit cheezie, but ok. Ok for the price. I may write another review after I use them.</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice, but the case was really flimsy.</li>
    <li> They arrived on time, but as soon as I opened them, I was overwhelmed by the chemical/paint/gas smell. After you air them out, it doesn&#x27;t smell anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem well enough. They would be better if the handles were labeled. I have brushes from Bare Minerals and they are labeled (Buki, Heavenly Face, etc.) You have to pretty much guess what each brush is supposed to do. Sucks if you are a beginner.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful quality for the price!!! My only issue is the blush brush is almost too soft, so I just use my MAC one. All of the others are great!!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of these brushes.Bought them as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she will love them.</li>
    <li> Love them. They are sturdy brushes</li>
    <li> I got these as part of a lightning deal. Many of the brushes are oddly shaped. Some are just a little too long, some are too thin, some are too wide. They made putting my make up on more difficult. I&#x27;m glad I have extra blush brushes now, but I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;be using most of them for blending or if I&#x27;ve forgotten to clean my other brushes.</li>
    <li> I loved them.  They are so soft and the cheatah case just put the finishing touch on it.</li>
    <li> I was pretty disappointed with the quality of these brushes. They DO NOT hold pigments at all. I am basically using 1 of the brushes for concealer. The brushes were hard, except 2. And those 2 I don&#x27;t use because they don&#x27;t hold pigments well. Lesson learned...I won&#x27;t buy cheap brushes again, my fault. I will just stick with M.A.C brushes. Smdh.</li>
    <li> Fantastic and high quality brushes just as the description says! No hair fallout. Great for everyday makeup application. Easy to clean and easy to dry. Wish there was a blending brush also but there wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup brushes I have ever used.  They are very soft</li>
    <li> I just ordered this set of brushes three days ago and I already have them with just standard shipping! Overall good brushes. No hair fall out, no loose parts. They&#x27;re good brushes for what you pay. Very soft. I was worried that powders wouldn&#x27;t apply well because of the synthetic hair but it&#x27;s not bad and actually applies pretty well. The small brushes are nice my only complaint is the eye liner brush hairs were extremely bent. I don&#x27;t know if they will reshape but that&#x27;s the only brush that came slightly damaged. The case is really cute, it has a funky smell but nothing atrocious and it&#x27;s handy for travel and keeping them together in one place. They&#x27;re definitely not high end but they&#x27;re good for a quick fix.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous! Cannot wait to try!</li>
    <li> Nice quality great price</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! They are very soft and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Great set for a gift item.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for the price. Definitely a great buy.</li>

    <li> Nicely package, variety of brushes and it is soft.</li>
    <li> got some gold point for this one</li>
    <li> These are really nice for the price. My one concern with brushes is that they&#x27;re soft - and these are very soft! Carrying case is really handy and no bristles have fallen out for me so far. Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> they are like professional brushes without the price - ive been using them for a couple months now and i love them</li>
    <li> LOVE my brushes.  Ordered these on a whim and truly didn&#x27;t expect the quality they turned out to be.</li>
    <li> Pretty soft and nice... Just wished they were more firm I&#x27;m not sure if I would be able to apply foundation with any of these brush. But they&#x27;re pretty cool</li>
    <li> A couple brushes have broken (came unglued) where the wood meets the black metal.</li>
    <li> excellent brush set, I like there are all sizes. they clean up well and apply makeup nicely. The only brush this set is missing is a stippling brush.</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes. The cover is not that attractive, but serves its purpose.  Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Good product,wonderfull well pack and look soo nice quality it took a while to get it since i live inDR but was worth the waiting!</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my Mom. She threw away all her old brushes and now is just using these.</li>
    <li> a little dusty when i blew on brushes.... soft brushes though..</li>
    <li> Great brushes awesome price and the case is super cute! :)</li>
