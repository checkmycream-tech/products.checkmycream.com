### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This salve is GREAT!!!  </li>
      <li>AWESOME!!  </li>
      <li>The best stuff on the planet.</li>
      <li>It comes in a delightfully retro tin containing .8 oz of the product.</li>
      <li>And it works best of all as a lip balm/gloss</li>
      <li>- I think it smells and works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>The best part for me is the color of it...</li>
      <li>I was given this by a friend, and it&#x27;s great!  </li>
      <li>But the best part is that the tin is airtight.</li>
      <li>Oh my gosh, this stuff is amazing!!  </li>
      <li>You put it on and it smells delicious, and feels SO GOOD, and it lasts FOREVER while still looking great.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great for chapped hands from work.  </li>
      <li>Its also great for healing acne scars, cuts, chapped knees and elbows, and frayed cuticles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great as cuticle conditioner too.</li>
      <li>Its great as a primer for mascara, lipgloss, and eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>Smith&#x27;s rosebud salve is amazing!</li>
      <li>Is it as good as they claim?</li>
      <li>Good for hands as well.  </li>
      <li>Feels good, smells good, works good.  </li>
      <li>As a lip balm, I am very, very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>(glad I didn&#x27;t!).</li>
      <li>All I know is that this stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>However, there are several things that are wonderful about it.</li>
      <li>I had heard that it was the best lip balm ever, and I almost ordered several of them</li>
      <li>Especialy when it is winter and your hands and face are dryest the most.</li>
      <li>It may be the most versatile mini-tin in the universe.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>Better than vaseline, way better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much more than a chapstick and not as \\&quot;done up\\&quot; looking as a lipgloss.  </li>
      <li>I used a dab on my winter dry heels--they look great now!  </li>
      <li>I wash my hands a lot because of being around a child and this is the best a relieving that dry feeling after the washing.  </li>
      <li>, I just thought I&#x27;d see if it was available online.</li>
      <li>It is good (makes lips soft), but guess what, so is Vasoline.  </li>
      <li>(it depends on how much you put on, more &#x3D; more shine).  </li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t exactly tasty, it smells more of a lotion than a lipbalm.</li>
      <li>It is great for any dry or irritated skin...</li>
      <li>this product is great for dry, chapped, or windburned skin, diaper rash, or blemishes.</li>
      <li>This delightful salve works beautifully as a delicately scented lip gloss/balm.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to order a couple more while I&#x27;m on here.</li>
      <li>Plus the soft rose scent is a bonus.</li>
      <li>I used to love Burts Bees, but they are definitely second favorite now.  </li>
      <li>and when I put this on and it gets absorbed they are nice and silky soft.  </li>
      <li>and has a very pretty, feminine scent.  </li>
      <li>So I got this the other day at Sephora and put it on, smells good but nothing special.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the five bucks.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It was first invented in 1892.</li>
      <li>By the way, it doesn&#x27;t take much - I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a bit better because it is not totally 100% patroletum.</li>
      <li>and i still love it as a lip balm, and it also soothes the chafing i get on my arms from running almost instantly.</li>
      <li>A tip from a make - up artist lead me to use it on my cheeks and brow bones lightly for a soft glow, as well as using it as pomade or anti frizz agent in my hair, and a brow tamer to use with your brow brush.</li>
      <li>just cuz celebrities and whoever use this doesn&#x27;t mean its great.</li>
      <li>a tin handy to keep lips smooth, hydrate dry cuticles and to moisten and protect dry or chapped skin.</li>
      <li>And the normal texture, while somewhat Vaseline like, is more solid than petroleum jelly.</li>
      <li>Really, that is all that this product is.  </li>
      <li>As for the comparison with Vaseline, are you really going to cart around a tub of Vaseline in your bag?  </li>
      <li>It makes my lips silky smooth, (I&#x27;ve been using it regularly and even my boyfriend pointed out how my lips feel softer!)</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>Yeah, I agree that this product has too much hype.  </li>
      <li>I had heard about this stuff for years, but I had never been able to find it, so when I was placing an order for other products</li>
      <li>This mild formula contains essential oils and is always soothing and healing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>every little boo boo got a dab of Rosebud and it made things better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather go with a cute little container of this salve.</li>
      <li>It is not thick at all.</li>
      <li>but today I forgot it in my truck for maybe an hour, and its turned into pure liquid wax that won&#x27;t even open without getting everywhere.  </li>
      <li>I exercise out in the cold and this is a great product for the outdoor</li>
      <li>Also, like with any tin... you have to use your finger to apply it - not terrible, but definitely a negative.  </li>
      <li>I use it on myself as well at my 13 month old for diaper rash so far.</li>
      <li>the lip balm, moisturizer, wild hair tamer is considered the gold-standard of lip balms.  </li>
      <li>My lips are soft and smooth after a few days.  </li>
      <li>It has a delightfully subtle rose scent, it does exactly what vaseline does,  but its cheaper, slightly tinted, compact, and has been around longer.</li>
      <li>Skin abrasion, dryness, irritation -- all common mild irritants in the woods or during foreign travel -- are alleviated in a simple way with the product.    </li>
      <li>I live in Texas where the triple-digit temps last for months during the summer.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft and really smooths out and repairs rough cracked hands.</li>
      <li>an odd tidbit: it glows blue under a black light!</li>
      <li>This salve is petroleum jelly (yeah, just Vaseline) that is slightly tinted (not enough to show even on my pale lips), and slightly scented (smells good, but not worth the price).</li>

<li> I gave it a 4 out of 5 due to the fact that the other reviews were right in that it doesn&#x27;t last too long on your lips.</li>

<li> It stays on the lips just as long as Vaseline does -- and for me, that is not long.</li>
<li> I was hoping for a thick, long-lasting, slightly tinted balm -- I got overpriced and over hyped pink Vaseline in a cute tin.</li>
<li> It works as a highlighter to give you glowing cheeks, and if you exfoliate your lips with a toothbrush before applying the Salve, it will last twice as long.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s soft, supple, slightly rose-scented and slightly tinted, but goes on clear.  </li>
<li> But the thing is, this balm actually cures my chapped lips unlike other things.</li>
<li> I have REALLY dry elbows</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m a P.O. employee, paper really sucks the oil out of your skin!)Much to my amazement, the hangnail had completely healed in 6 hours time!</li>
<li> skinned knees, bug bites, sunburn, and chapped skin, rough elbows.</li>
<li> It was less than presentable condition when it arrived cracked.  </li>
<li> person-- a dab on lips and cheeks protects AND adds a little blush of color.  </li>
<li> Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is chapstick, moisturizer, perfume and lubricant all in one neat little retro package.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a tin, so I dented the metal a little just</li>
<li> I plan on getting a few to add to Christmas gifts, too.</li>
<li> The only thing that stinks is it was nearly impossible to open at first.  </li>
<li> Just use a little!</li>
<li> BUY IT, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
<li> just a subtle tint...</li>
<li> It was thick, deep ,irritating and painful.</li>
<li> Another use I have found is when I have a cold and my nose is raw from blowing it</li>
<li> If you still have any doubts about this stuff, you&#x27;re crazy.  </li>
<li> Celebrities, beauty editors and beauty addicts worldwide go crazy for it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My folks turned me on to this stuff when i was a kid and i still love it as a lip balm, and it also soothes the chafing i get on my arms from running almost instantly. Another use I have found is when I have a cold and my nose is raw from blowing it, i put it on the sore spots before bed and the rawness is gone when I wake up, even if i&#x27;m still blowing my nose. an odd tidbit: it glows blue under a black light!</li>
    <li> Skin abrasion, dryness, irritation -- all common mild irritants in the woods or during foreign travel -- are alleviated in a simple way with the product.    Very small container size makes it about right to have for such contingencies as part of a personal kit.</li>
    <li> So I got this the other day at Sephora and put it on, smells good but nothing special.  I&#x27;d read on here about the melting thing and thought, I&#x27;ll just keep it with me, but today I forgot it in my truck for maybe an hour, and its turned into pure liquid wax that won&#x27;t even open without getting everywhere.  It&#x27;s alright, but just cuz celebrities and whoever use this doesn&#x27;t mean its great.</li>
    <li> I really like this product - I think it smells and works wonderfully.  As for the comparison with Vaseline, are you really going to cart around a tub of Vaseline in your bag?  I&#x27;d rather go with a cute little container of this salve.</li>
    <li> It was less than presentable condition when it arrived cracked.  Go with the metal ball roller type from another brand if you want quality.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4 out of 5 due to the fact that the other reviews were right in that it doesn&#x27;t last too long on your lips. However, there are several things that are wonderful about it. this product is great for dry, chapped, or windburned skin, diaper rash, or blemishes. A tip from a make - up artist lead me to use it on my cheeks and brow bones lightly for a soft glow, as well as using it as pomade or anti frizz agent in my hair, and a brow tamer to use with your brow brush. I&#x27;m getting ready to order a couple more while I&#x27;m on here. For $5 I can carry around a tin that does several things for me in one. I think it&#x27;s worth it. By the way, it doesn&#x27;t take much - I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months!</li>
    <li> This salve is GREAT!!!  Especialy when it is winter and your hands and face are dryest the most. I wash my hands a lot because of being around a child and this is the best a relieving that dry feeling after the washing.  I use it on myself as well at my 13 month old for diaper rash so far. Leaves skin soft and really smooths out and repairs rough cracked hands.</li>
    <li> All the hype about this product isnt just hype. Those who say it has no fragrance must not have a keen sense of smell. It has a delightfully subtle rose scent, it does exactly what vaseline does,  but its cheaper, slightly tinted, compact, and has been around longer. Its great as a primer for mascara, lipgloss, and eyeshadow. It works as a highlighter to give you glowing cheeks, and if you exfoliate your lips with a toothbrush before applying the Salve, it will last twice as long. Its also great for healing acne scars, cuts, chapped knees and elbows, and frayed cuticles. So if you like an all-in-one for $5, this is it!</li>
    <li> Smith&#x27;s rosebud salve is amazing! Just this evening I had a really bad hangnail at work. It was thick, deep ,irritating and painful.Although I had trimmed it closely, I knew that it was a nasty sign of the cold weather ahead. I liberally applied the salve, maybe once every 1/2 hour while working the mail (I&#x27;m a P.O. employee, paper really sucks the oil out of your skin!)Much to my amazement, the hangnail had completely healed in 6 hours time! My co-workers were in awe. Guess who is getting Rosebud salve for Christmas?</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  It makes my lips silky smooth, (I&#x27;ve been using it regularly and even my boyfriend pointed out how my lips feel softer!) and has a very pretty, feminine scent.  The best part for me is the color of it... just a subtle tint... and it&#x27;s all you need.  It&#x27;s so much more than a chapstick and not as \\&quot;done up\\&quot; looking as a lipgloss.  The only thing that stinks is it was nearly impossible to open at first.  It&#x27;s a tin, so I dented the metal a little just so I&#x27;d have a place to pry open each time. Also, like with any tin... you have to use your finger to apply it - not terrible, but definitely a negative.  I used to love Burts Bees, but they are definitely second favorite now.  I just purchased my second tin of Rosebud salve and can&#x27;t wait for it to get here.</li>
    <li> I just had to see what all the hype was about. I had heard about this stuff for years, but I had never been able to find it, so when I was placing an order for other products, I just thought I&#x27;d see if it was available online. I just got it today. What a disappointment! I had heard that it was the best lip balm ever, and I almost ordered several of them (glad I didn&#x27;t!). This salve is petroleum jelly (yeah, just Vaseline) that is slightly tinted (not enough to show even on my pale lips), and slightly scented (smells good, but not worth the price). It is not thick at all. It is too oily, and does not last.  It stays on the lips just as long as Vaseline does -- and for me, that is not long. I&#x27;ve heard that this is also used on the face. I do not plan to try that -- I would never put Vaseline on my face, so I won&#x27;t use this stuff that way, either. I was hoping for a thick, long-lasting, slightly tinted balm -- I got overpriced and over hyped pink Vaseline in a cute tin. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Yeah, I agree that this product has too much hype.  It is good (makes lips soft), but guess what, so is Vasoline.  Really, that is all that this product is.  You can buy a much larger container of Vasoline for the same effect as this product.</li>
    <li> I was given this by a friend, and it&#x27;s great!  As a lip balm, I am very, very satisfied.  My lips are soft and smooth after a few days.  It&#x27;s great as cuticle conditioner too. Better than vaseline, way better.  I plan on getting a few to add to Christmas gifts, too.</li>
    <li> Is it as good as they claim? There&#x27;s no doubt- the lip balm, moisturizer, wild hair tamer is considered the gold-standard of lip balms.  Celebrities, beauty editors and beauty addicts worldwide go crazy for it. It&#x27;s soft, supple, slightly rose-scented and slightly tinted, but goes on clear.  Well worth the five bucks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for chapped hands from work.  Feels good, smells good, works good.  Just use a little!</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sephora for $5. I would expect it to be cheaper online but I guess not. If it were a choice between Vaseline and Rosebud Salve, I would choose the latter. It&#x27;s just a bit better because it is not totally 100% patroletum. The smell isn&#x27;t exactly tasty, it smells more of a lotion than a lipbalm. But the thing is, this balm actually cures my chapped lips unlike other things. I just don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is an all-purpose skin preparation. It was first invented in 1892. This delightful salve works beautifully as a delicately scented lip gloss/balm. It comes in a delightfully retro tin containing .8 oz of the product. One container lasts me for about 10 months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep a tin handy to keep lips smooth, hydrate dry cuticles and to moisten and protect dry or chapped skin. This mild formula contains essential oils and is always soothing and healing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Why all the reviews treat this like a salve is supposed to be a lip balm...NOT.  If that is all Rosebud Salve was, then it would be called &#x27;Rosebud lip balm.&#x27; This was a medicine cabinet staple when I was growing up 40 years ago. every little boo boo got a dab of Rosebud and it made things better. skinned knees, bug bites, sunburn, and chapped skin, rough elbows. whatever, this stuff solved the problem, that and a mother&#x27;s touch....</li>
    <li> The best stuff on the planet. Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is chapstick, moisturizer, perfume and lubricant all in one neat little retro package. I&#x27;m kidding about that last bit...maybe. All I know is that this stuff is amazing. I use it on my lips all the time, but I&#x27;ve also used it to help heal windburn and blemishes, to give my cheeks a glow for a night out and to soften my torn up cuticles. It may be the most versatile mini-tin in the universe.</li>
    <li> I read a review that said the salve melted in her car. I just wanted to add this. I live in Texas where the triple-digit temps last for months during the summer. I&#x27;ve left the tin of Rosebud Salve in my car. Yes, it got liquid-y in the Death Valley-like temperatures, but it returns to it&#x27;s regular consistancy when cooled. And the normal texture, while somewhat Vaseline like, is more solid than petroleum jelly. Plus the soft rose scent is a bonus. But the best part is that the tin is airtight. So if the salve melts, it won&#x27;t get all over your purse, car, pocket, etc.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, this stuff is amazing!!  It works for everything.  I have REALLY dry elbows and when I put this on and it gets absorbed they are nice and silky soft.  One of my friends swears that it works wonders on pimples, although I haven&#x27;t tried that myself.  And it works best of all as a lip balm/gloss (it depends on how much you put on, more &#x3D; more shine).  You put it on and it smells delicious, and feels SO GOOD, and it lasts FOREVER while still looking great.  All of my friends are always asking me what is on my lips and if they can have some too!  If you still have any doubts about this stuff, you&#x27;re crazy.  BUY IT, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
    <li> I picked up a tin on a whim @ Sephora..  AWESOME!!  It is great for any dry or irritated skin... I used a dab on my winter dry heels--they look great now!  I exercise out in the cold and this is a great product for the outdoor person-- a dab on lips and cheeks protects AND adds a little blush of color.  Good for hands as well.  I do wish it came in a larger tin though...</li>
