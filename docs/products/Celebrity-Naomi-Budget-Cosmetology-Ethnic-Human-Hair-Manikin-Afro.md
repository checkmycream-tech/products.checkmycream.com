      <li>I love this mannequin..</li>
      <li>I love everything about this one.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love the manequinn but it would be more helpful if the mannequinns hair was a closer match to a more curly hair texture.</li>
      <li>Its more of an ethnic mix with a curlier hair type.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for beginners.</li>
      <li>I have a five month old daughter who has a head full of beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>Primarily coily or Cottony..</li>
      <li>when I get ready to braid my daughter&#x27;s hair it will look semi-decent on the first try!</li>
      <li>I bought this expecting a more accurate representation of african american hair type.</li>
      <li>Fast speedy service.</li>
      <li>(afro textured hair is not a matted frizz ball of hair, it is a real hair texture??</li>
      <li>not really an afro as it appears more like a curl</li>
      <li>This item came  so fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The roots were straight and the ends matted and tangled because they just teased the hair to create a fro?</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for real afro hair manikin this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>The hair is very versatile.  </li>
      <li>They pass this manikan off as having coiled hair or black hair but in actuality, once you wash it you realize it&#x27;s more Caucasian or Biracial hair.</li>
      <li>For a starter manikin with shorter hair its a decent product.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I use it to learn new techniques and when my nieces come over, it keeps them busy.</li>
      <li>Wow, do you not think we are going to know the difference..</li>
      <li>Got it for my 12 year old daughter to teach hair braiding.</li>
      <li>ok not exactly what I expected for it works</li>
      <li>I could tell from the first touch as I pulled the Manniquin head out of the box that it was not real afro textured hair.  </li>
      <li>maybe 3a, the only reason i give her 4 stars is the shedding so far</li>
      <li>However the roots are straight and when you wet the hair, the hair turns wavy.  </li>

<li> Although its not what I expected, it is helping my with my braiding techniques.  </li>
<li> I wet the hair, and it just fell into very loose wavy curls?</li>
<li> You can wet hair and it turns curly.</li>
<li> this is obviously not textured afro hair and the curls die out after you wash the unit... and it sheds something awful but as far as i need it practicing flat twists, briads, and roller sets.. its fine</li>
<li> sorta loosens once its wet , not worth 50 bucks to me  </li>
<li> Please find real afro textured hair for your Afro Manikins because this was a serious disappointment.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t braided hair since I was a little girl, so I knew I needed practice before I started trying to style my baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed</li>
<li> I was going to try and work with it, and it was horrible?</li>

    <li> This manikin appears in the picture to have tighter textured hair.  However the roots are straight and when you wet the hair, the hair turns wavy.  Although its not what I expected, it is helping my with my braiding techniques.  For a starter manikin with shorter hair its a decent product.  If you&#x27;re looking for real afro hair manikin this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> They pass this manikan off as having coiled hair or black hair but in actuality, once you wash it you realize it&#x27;s more Caucasian or Biracial hair. The only way to keep the fro is DO NOT wash the hair.</li>
    <li> Yes, everything was good and to my expectations..</li>
    <li> Wow!  This item came  so fast. I love everything about this one.  The hair is very versatile.  I use it to learn new techniques and when my nieces come over, it keeps them busy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Got it for my 12 year old daughter to teach hair braiding. Its perfect. Very authentic.</li>
    <li> ok not exactly what I expected for it works</li>
    <li> The hair was not AFro textured at all. It was loosely curled hair that had been teased to mimic afro textured hair? I could tell from the first touch as I pulled the Manniquin head out of the box that it was not real afro textured hair.  I was going to try and work with it, and it was horrible? The roots were straight and the ends matted and tangled because they just teased the hair to create a fro? (afro textured hair is not a matted frizz ball of hair, it is a real hair texture?? Primarily coily or Cottony.. I couldn&#x27;t do any of the styles that I needed to do for this hair type because this manniquinn head does not have one strand of afro textured hair on it. I wet the hair, and it just fell into very loose wavy curls? Wow, do you not think we are going to know the difference.. Please find real afro textured hair for your Afro Manikins because this was a serious disappointment.  I want a refund!</li>
    <li> You can wet hair and it turns curly. Great for many ethnic styles</li>
    <li> Love it. Just what I needed</li>
    <li> I have a five month old daughter who has a head full of beautiful hair. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t braided hair since I was a little girl, so I knew I needed practice before I started trying to style my baby&#x27;s hair. This manikin has allowed me to practice and redo cornrows over and over so that (hopefully!) when I get ready to braid my daughter&#x27;s hair it will look semi-decent on the first try! Wish me luck!</li>
    <li> Great, love everything about it texture of hair and skin  Wo uld recommend it to everyone in the cosmetology field</li>
    <li> Hair not as described not kinky at all.</li>
    <li> I love this mannequin.. Her hair is definitely not &amp;#34;afro&amp;#34; textured... Her hair is like 3b hair maybe 3a, the only reason i give her 4 stars is the shedding so far everything else has been great!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting a more accurate representation of african american hair type. Its more of an ethnic mix with a curlier hair type. The type that does not stay plat when you do it. Additionally, the hair on the mannequin comes out very easily.</li>
    <li> i agree with everyone else not a afro at all. this is my second attempt at trying to get ethnic human hair manikin. This is just the same i got that was cheaper.  The picture looks one way and the merchandise sent looks another way this is not acceptable at all oh Well another return.</li>
    <li> I love the manequinn but it would be more helpful if the mannequinns hair was a closer match to a more curly hair texture. When the doll arrived it did not have the same appearance as the one on the website.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for beginners.</li>
    <li> Good for all students . An excellent choice . Fast speedy service.</li>
    <li> The quality of the hair is not what it descibes. The picture is nothing to what it looks in person. I was very disappointed</li>
    <li> Gift for friend; she loved it.</li>
    <li> this is obviously not textured afro hair and the curls die out after you wash the unit... and it sheds something awful but as far as i need it practicing flat twists, briads, and roller sets.. its fine</li>
    <li> not really an afro as it appears more like a curl sorta loosens once its wet , not worth 50 bucks to me  wont be purchasing again</li>
    <li> brought this for my god daughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I was really looking for an afro manikin, this was just a perm with small rods</li>
