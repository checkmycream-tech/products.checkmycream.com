<li> It was what I expected</li>
<li> Not what I really expected.</li>
<li> I also found them not exactly what I wanted: to hold neck scarves, so small, some heavier and larger.</li>
<li> The pieces are crudely made and one fell apart the first time I wore it.</li>
<li> I know they&#x27;re inexpensive, but that doesn&#x27;t excuse workmanship so poor.</li>
<li> Could use with very thin scarves only</li>
