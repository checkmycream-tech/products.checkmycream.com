### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best &#x27;Barby leg&#x27; my wife has ever used.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I have a couple cuticle trimmers that work great</li>
      <li>This one is fabulous - so happy to find it - Amazon is the BEST!!!</li>
      <li>I had one of these I used for years and loved it.</li>
      <li>a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is my favorite nail tool.</li>
      <li>I used the Revlon cuticle trimmer for many years but this seems to have either been resigned or they&#x27;ve changed manufacturers in whatever country</li>
      <li>I will continue to search out a better model in the stores.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this product, easy to use and of course I can travel with in while I am on the road.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a cuticle trimmer in the past and it worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Seems like some people really like it because it&#x27;s duller and \\&quot;more</li>
      <li>Buy this item somewhere else, it&#x27;s great but not worth $20.</li>
      <li>I use this for hangnails far more often than trimming cuticles.</li>
      <li>Maybe one or two work well enough to use more than twice, even when a cuticle softener is used.</li>
      <li>The pusher was the right angle, and it worked really well.  </li>
      <li>The cap also doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
      <li>I should have just gone to the store and gotten a better one same-day for about the same amount of money if not less when you factor in shipping.</li>
      <li>Only buy Revlon original.  </li>
      <li>I agree with many of the other reviews.  </li>
      <li>I buy them because I can rarely find them in local outlets.</li>
      <li>I eventually just went back to the cheaper models but using cuticle gel and being more careful.</li>
      <li>These use to be awesome, but the new ones are very poor quality!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s tough, rubberized and even comes with a gold cap to cover the business end of this handy tool.</li>
      <li>but this one is not sharp and basically tears my cuticles rather than trimming them.</li>
      <li>product is defective, it is not sharp at all, does not trim cuticles.</li>
      <li>so i have to be careful not to cut too much cuticle</li>
      <li>But even cutting tiny hangnails, this trimmer is great for about five or six uses, then it dulls to the point of uselessness.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I got a lemon, but this tool is not sharp enough to actually cut (toenail) cuticles.  </li>

<li> Just as I expected.  </li>
<li> Tried other brands (when I could not find Revlon) and none of them worked well.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s not as bad about cutting my cuticles as the cheaper trimmers, but it&#x27;s not nearly as sharp either-</li>
<li> It is so dull that it rips your cuticles instead of cutting them and makes them look worse than before..</li>
<li> The cutting blade is so dull on some items that it Pulls skin rather that cutting it.</li>
<li> Useless.</li>
<li> This thing is way overpriced for it&#x27;s mediocre performance.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s not as bad about cutting my cuticles as the cheaper trimmers, but it&#x27;s not nearly as sharp either- I eventually just went back to the cheaper models but using cuticle gel and being more careful. This thing is way overpriced for it&#x27;s mediocre performance.</li>
    <li> I like it because it does what it supposed to do without hurting like some others that are too sharp.</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the other reviews.  These use to be awesome, but the new ones are very poor quality!! Jagged, uneven manufacturing just rips and tears. Awful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a cuticle trimmer in the past and it worked wonderfully. This one barely cuts at all and actually makes a bigger mess out of my cuticles. I was very sad about this as the handle on my last one broke and was anticipating having a new one at home and in my desk drawer at work. The cap also doesn&#x27;t stay on very well. I will continue to search out a better model in the stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a longtime.  The cutter trimmed neatly, and it wasn&#x27;t too aggressive as long as you were careful.  The pusher was the right angle, and it worked really well.  They&#x27;d last about a year before I&#x27;d replace them, which was a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, these seem to have been redesigned.  The pusher is too blunt and dull to work will.  Instead of pushign the skin back, it just rides up over the cuticle and hurts.  The shape of the cutter doesn&#x27;t trim as well and it is dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.  It is a very poor design.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite nail tool. I seem to lose them all the time so I came here hoping to stock up, considering they were priced at .04. But $19.98 for shipping?? What&#x27;s that about? Buy this item somewhere else, it&#x27;s great but not worth $20.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot you can say about this, other than it&#x27;s well made and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a lemon, but this tool is not sharp enough to actually cut (toenail) cuticles.  It&#x27;s almost a rounded edge rather than actually sharp. Useless.</li>
    <li> I use this for hangnails far more often than trimming cuticles. But even cutting tiny hangnails, this trimmer is great for about five or six uses, then it dulls to the point of uselessness.  One of those tools that you need to work when you need it to work.</li>
    <li> Best &#x27;Barby leg&#x27; my wife has ever used. If you don&#x27;t know what that is you likely don&#x27;t even use this jewel to trim your cuticles. It&#x27;s tough, rubberized and even comes with a gold cap to cover the business end of this handy tool.</li>
    <li> I had one of these I used for years and loved it. When it could no longer be used I bought another revlon cuticle trimmer. It has been redesigned and it works horribly. It no longer works as it States on package. Bad product</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have a big problem with my cuticles getting thick and splitting, especially in cold weather. I have a couple cuticle trimmers that work great but this one is not sharp and basically tears my cuticles rather than trimming them. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Lacks sharpness; Typical Chinese-made product. The cutting blade is so dull on some items that it Pulls skin rather that cutting it. Maybe one or two work well enough to use more than twice, even when a cuticle softener is used. I buy them because I can rarely find them in local outlets.</li>
    <li> I used the Revlon cuticle trimmer for many years but this seems to have either been resigned or they&#x27;ve changed manufacturers in whatever country it&#x27;s being made.  It has a rounded blade that is too short to even \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the dead skin and is utterly useless.  I&#x27;m sort of furious about this.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> Only buy Revlon original.  Wonderful product, works perfectly.  Tried other brands (when I could not find Revlon) and none of them worked well.  This one is fabulous - so happy to find it - Amazon is the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> Seems like some people really like it because it&#x27;s duller and \\&quot;more safe.\\&quot; Well, I have never had a safety issue with a cuticle cutter before but maybe that&#x27;s just me.... It is so dull that it rips your cuticles instead of cutting them and makes them look worse than before.. but it does get rid of them with maximum effort. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this product and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Also the shipping took forever. I should have just gone to the store and gotten a better one same-day for about the same amount of money if not less when you factor in shipping.</li>
    <li> it has really sharp blade so i have to be careful not to cut too much cuticle or i cut my skin !</li>
    <li> Dies not deserve a star. Product arrived a month later, after I requested my refund for not delivered. Bad service. They did not refunded it, they just shipped it anyway. Worst of all...product is defective, it is not sharp at all, does not trim cuticles. Just buy one in your supermarket, of course, buy different brand. It will save you Lots of time and disappointment.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product, easy to use and of course I can travel with in while I am on the road.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The way the blade is designed on this tool prevents it from being used on human cuticles unless you have massive gorilla-sized fingers!</li>
