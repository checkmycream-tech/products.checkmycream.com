<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product.  Love what it does for my hair</li>
    <li> it works pretty well on normal hair. i have highlights and it has dried it out a bit, but i have serious highlights. i think for normal hair it would be great. the conditioner is awesome.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conitoner! my hair is so soft and healthy! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner its just the best.makes your hair feel soft and healthy</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite brand for shampoo and conditioner. Smells great! Love how I don&#x27;t need a detangler  because the conditioner is awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom and she loves it. It&#x27;s a good product for people with dry hair.</li>
    <li> Great products and price</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Good price :)</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is just what I was looking for to make my hair soft and smooth.  Everyone is telling me they love my new hairstyle but this is the only thing I have changed.</li>
    <li> Excellent service! Great product!</li>
    <li> Biolage is the only shampoo and conditioner that really work for my hair. This set smells very nice and does a good job of moisturizing. I wash my hair daily. This set is great for daily use and will last a while.</li>
    <li> This stuff is hands down the BEST for maintaining moisture in long hair in a dry climate.</li>
    <li> I tried so many shampoo and conditioner in my life and i have to be honest, this is the best one ever! I love the way it leaves my hair so soft. I can leave my hair wet and once they are dry they are soft. Before this shampoo i had to dry my hair or they would end up hard and crazy looking. The smell is ok,Great product!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING product, and amazing price. Seriously can&#x27;t beat it. My hair is super soft after washing and conditioning. A little goes a long way with this product! I&#x27;m hooked</li>
    <li> It made my head itch.</li>
    <li> This has saved my hair. For a while my hair had lost its shine. After using this product for only a week people started to compliment me on how refreshed, shiny, and healthy my hair looked again. It&#x27;s wonderful that the conditioner comes in the bowl container too. The squeeze bottles used to make getting this thick condition next to impossible to get out.</li>
    <li> I love all the biolage products. This is a great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Not a great shampoo/conditioner after using hydra-therapie :( made my hair greasy at the and of the day and lots of static throughout the day.</li>
    <li> its really a great product for your hair specially if your hair looks like dry or without shine, try this product and you will see the big different in the health of your hair, i recomend you it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it keeps my color damaged hair under control.</li>
    <li> With the Biolage Color Care Therapie Cera Repair Pro 4, my hair is in much better condition using these products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for over 1 year. It leaves my hair very clean, soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> Came as described and on time. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> For Christmas, a co-worker gifted me an identical set of Matrix Biolage shampoo and conditioner shown in Amazon&#x27;s picture. I&#x27;m typically a Pantene girl and hesitated to use the set, but ended up running out of shampoo before a wedding event and used it one evening. Well...I fell in love with the scent! It was floral heaven! I didn&#x27;t use the conditioner that night, because I didn&#x27;t know how my hair would react to a &#x27;too effective&#x27; or &#x27;not effective enough&#x27; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next night I did use both the shampoo and conditioner. It worked well. I switched between using Biolage and Pantene. In April, I searched on Amazon for the identical set of Matrix Biolage. I received my purchase fairly quickly from HAYWARD BEAUTY. It sat in our hallway closet for about a month, which is the same amount of time my initial gifted set sat in our hallway closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, I used the set ordered from HAYWARD BEAUTY via Amazon for the first time. I could tell right away that the SCENT IS NOT THE SAME. It makes me doubt the authenticity of this Biolage set sold by HAYWARD BEAUTY. Or at the very least, I think the set that I received must be past its shelf life. I Google searched whether shampoos/conditioners have an expiration date/shelf life and they most certainly do. One of my daughters actually said I smell like some kind of bug spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the shampoo still suds up considerably and the conditioner still works to make my hair easier to detangle. Currently Hayward Beauty is not selling this specific set. I&#x27;m sure they have since sold all of these old sets. So sad that this particular seller chose to sell either an inauthentic or expired set of shampoo/conditioner. &#x3D;/ So...buyer beware!</li>
    <li> great price fast delivery</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! You can&#x27;t beat the price and the product is great! I straighten my hair everyday and it definitely keeps my hair moisturized.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and Conditioner. I have very dry and thick hair and this makes my hair soft, shiny and smell really good.</li>
    <li> Always love this stuff. Great product, leaves me feeling like I just left the salon. Love the smell and how soft and happy my hair feels after using it</li>
    <li> I originally thought that this made my hair a little greasy quicker, but after going without it, I realize that it gave my hair more curl.  The moisture is necessary.  When it gets too dry then my hair gets flighty and straight and doesn&#x27;t want to cooperate.  If I use this at night and then braid my hair while it is damp before I go to bed, the next morning, I can take my hair out and have nice wavy hair that lasts all day with a little help.  If I use a drier shampoo, my wavy hair won&#x27;t even last an hour or two.  I always use this conditioner on my ends after I towel dry my hair and I never rinse it out.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner on my scalp or newer hair (up to 6&amp;#34; long), it doesn&#x27;t need it, just the ends and they always need it.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair looks and smells great using this shampoo and conditioner.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is ok. The conditioner is not all the convenient in shower- it&#x27;s more for when someone else is washing your hair, like in salon I suppose. And, the conditioner feels like not smoothing hair out as well as other Matrix conditioners I&#x27;ve used. I have to apply a lot, and every where. I won&#x27;t get this set even for the price, just because of the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for hair.  Only need about a nickels worth for medium length hair</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> It was everything i expected</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Good product. Good price. :)</li>
    <li> I used to like these product, however this time they don&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
    <li> Best value in higher end shampoo and conditioner? Smells great, lathers very well. Conditioner is really nice.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this shampoo and conditioner!!! I have very long, thick, wavy hair that can be difficult to manage and keep moisturized, and this makes it feel and smell amazing... A little conditioner goes a long way and your hair feels like silk afterwards. Best stuff I&#x27;ve used and this is for a great price!</li>
    <li> Superior conditioning at a phenomal price for the pair.</li>
    <li> Love Biolage just wish they hadn&#x27;t changed their formula, I prefer the color last version better, for some reason conditions my hair better and less tangles than this one but got a great deal and it&#x27;s good to change it up now and then. Worth what I paid. Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo.  The hair conditioning balm keeps my hair silky and smooth. Love the stuff.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast! Great product!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Don&#x27;t love the jar the conditioner comes in.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner set okay. It is not my favorite. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Always a great product.  FYI you can buy this for almost half this price at Marshall&#x27;s</li>
    <li> BEST S AND C IVE AVER USED!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is very dry and this makes it smooth and the smell is wonderful. The reason for the 4 stars is the container for the conditioner is inconvenient in the shower. It would be better in a tube or bottle.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than in the store! Totally worth the wait!!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
    <li> Good product and price. Fast delivery. All good!</li>
    <li> Huge fan of the Biolage line. Hydrasource is even better than the older hydra line. Stopped itchy scalp and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Great but better on dry hair</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic! My hair has never been this healthy before! And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner but I&#x27;m disappointed in the time its taking to arrive. I will be buying this from the salon from now on.</li>
    <li> this shampoo and cond has always been one of my favorites.  The smell is so nice and refreshing.  This does not leave my hair to dry or to oily.  it is just perfect for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> great price and wife happy as can be</li>
    <li> The BEST shampoo and conditioner made for your hair. EVER. I have tried about every brand on the market and I always come back to these two. I will not stray again.</li>
    <li> Great price. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for years. Every time I try to switch and use something else I&#x27;m always disappointed. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product, I have really damaged hair due to so many times I changed my color in less than 2 weeks and this conditioner is making a big change. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a good shampoo and conditioner, but not as good as other Biolage products I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> great product and good experience</li>
    <li> biolage user for 30 years</li>
    <li> Love these hair products</li>
    <li> I have bad split ends and dryed out hair. I don&#x27;t dry it with the hair dryer much don&#x27;t straighten or curl it much. I rinse with cold water to lock in conditioner and I am gentel towel drying it and use a biotin oil. But my hair was still dry. I went to a salon and got a hair treatment it completely got rid of my split ends for about a week. I ordered this because it was the highest rated shampoo and conditioner combo. I used it one time and it was just as effective as the $20 hair treatment I just got at the salon. Using it everyday I&#x27;m sure is going to keep the spilt ends away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have a very oily scalp and never condition it, even though the shampoo is hydrating it did not make my scalp oily.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!  Packaging was great too, no leaks!!  Would definitely buy from again!!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair products. Leave your hair shinny and smooth.</li>
    <li> Favorite Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
    <li> I used them together and I didn&#x27;t get the result that I expect. However, I use them separately and they work just as I want</li>
    <li> Great products and received fast, will order again.  My hair is dry and over treated Biolage is the best for moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Only thing it was wrapped weird with a peice of tape across each peice but they are the true products. Only reason i buy this is since its so much cheaper than the hydrating biolage which is better. But this is so much better for my hair than the regualr brands at target or whereever.</li>
    <li> I like it I has use it before that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
    <li> Biolage works magic. I naturally have very brittle hair even though I don&#x27;t dye it and rarely use heat on it. I&#x27;ve been using Biolage consistently for the last three months and the difference between my hair then and now is night and day. I can feel that my hair is stronger, softer, and it even grows faster too. It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but I personally think it is so worth it. The containers are big so it lasts a pretty long time too. The only reason I take off one star is because I wish the conditioner didn&#x27;t have a twist top like a jar.. It can be very inconvenient to open when I&#x27;m in the shower. It would be much more convenient if it had a pump or was just like the shampoo bottle. Otherwise, I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Biolage, but stopped using it a while back because I had a sensitivity to the chemicals in their ingredients. Now that they have a more natural line of products, I am able to use it again. Thanks Matrix!</li>
    <li> Came in good quality.</li>
    <li> would be great if they came in a different type of dispenser. Its difficult to open in the shower. Otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and perfectly packaged!</li>
    <li> Super high quality. A friend turned me onto the shampoo, and I couldn&#x27;t go back. The conditioner is also of a super high quality. Nice scent, not too heavy. Really improves my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product and love the fact that I can purchase both of them together at a great price.  Much cheaper than buying in a salon</li>
    <li> Great product. My wife and I use the same shampoo now.</li>
    <li> Great hydration. Love it</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this stuff. It lasts forever</li>
    <li> Old lady is in love with this.</li>
    <li> Good deal ships fast!  I love the conditioner as it really softens my hair.  I try to leave it in for 15-20 mins every couple of weeks, besides regular use when showering.</li>
    <li> What a deal! I have extremely thick, course hair and Biolage has been a lifesaver for me. This combo is perfect for me considering that the shampoo at most places can run 25.00 alone! Will continue to purchase my monthly supply from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.  Makes may hair so soft and manageable ( I have naturally curly, wavy Hair).  I am trying to find a smaller container for the shampoo just too large for my shower.  I received the product very fast. I am very happy and would purchase again and recommend to a friend.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I always order this product and always from Amazon.  I use nothing else on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Like how my hair feels rehydrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved biolage but could never justify the price! Love the affordableness of getting it on here!</li>
    <li> luv the shampoo, this is a great conditioner</li>
    <li> My hair was great while I used this.  It was hydrated, my second day hair wasn&#x27;t oily.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it three stars... It worked for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big problem was that it completely broke out my face.  If you have temperamental skin, I&#x27;d either stay away or try using the smaller bottles first (the reason I got the bigger ones is they were cheaper than what the stores around me were selling).</li>
