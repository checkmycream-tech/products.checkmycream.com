      <li>Love the aroma.</li>
      <li>first day on the bus wearing it, a lady was enamored and kept trying to figure who smell so good.</li>

      <li>I will use it very sparingly for a LONG time and probably buy another bottle just to use more frequently.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an older fragrance that still does the job.  </li>
      <li>The classic line for this scent was: &amp;#34;Peppery and potent&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>It is unique, wears well as a year round scent and offers a full line of products if you like what you smell.</li>
      <li>The sense of smell is powerful and personal.</li>
      <li>Try it; very masculine stuff.</li>
      <li>i am going to do this review for the first and last time.</li>
      <li>Never disgustingly heavy like some men&#x27;s cologne or after shave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Same high quality product.</li>

    <li> great product best price very lucrative many comments are recommended when I look for certain things great  thank you very much&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite. Love the aroma. All kinds of compliments.</li>
    <li> Been using this for many years, and always have people ask what I&#x27;m wearing so it must smell as good to others as it does to me.</li>
    <li> my dad&#x27;s fav. i am going to do this review for the first and last time. i have been buying this cologne for my dad for about 8 years now. and he loves it. so if you are 50 + and like STRONG scent this is for you.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and arrived on time too.</li>
    <li> My father owned a women&#x27;s department store in a small town. He carried Estee Lauder products and introduced Aramis to my boyfriend who later became my spouse. We have been married 40+ years and this is the only cologne he uses. Over the years, many women have come up to him to comment favorably on his cologne. With his body chemistry it is phenomenal. I love it when he puts it on while I am gone and I walk into the house and smell it. It permeates throughout the house. Better than putting on a fragrant candle.  .</li>
    <li> Husband has been wearing it for years and thought it was lighter than the origian</li>
    <li> I was just about to mail off some gifts when I noviced this item haad arrived, I like it some much I kept it for myself!</li>
    <li> INCREDIBLE price. Half of what it cost at a DISCOUNT mall store. Same high quality product. My dad died in 1997, and my brother in 2000. They both wore Aramis. I have been using both bottles since they passed but had a little left in each one. When I got this I pulled the caps off and put what was left of my dads and brothers cologne into this bottle so I feel like they are still with me when I put this on. I will use it very sparingly for a LONG time and probably buy another bottle just to use more frequently. I love this smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn it off and on since the 70&#x27;s. No cologne gets the attention of as many women as this does.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell as always.  Never disgustingly heavy like some men&#x27;s cologne or after shave.&lt;br /&gt;My husband was almost out of it and I got another bottle of it for him for Christmas.  The spray&lt;br /&gt;is so nice.........and the price was better than on some sites.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aramis for 40 years and it is by far my favorite colonge. Nothing comes close to it in my opinion. Women love it. You don&#x27;t need alot.</li>
    <li> Purchased for son for Christmas.  He was very happy.</li>
    <li> first day on the bus wearing it, a lady was enamored and kept trying to figure who smell so good. Finally I asked her if this is what she was smelling and after a whiff, she said yes. Well I blacked out after my chest and head got so big!!! I plan on trying the Tuscany soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;Concentrate&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The sense of smell is powerful and personal. There really is no way to know if a cologne works for you without firsthand experience. The classic line for this scent was: &amp;#34;Peppery and potent&amp;#34;. I cannot improve on that. It is unique, wears well as a year round scent and offers a full line of products if you like what you smell. That&#x27;s the key--try it. If you like it Amazon will save you money even with shipping costs.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne from my high school years and it remains the top cologne for me.  You just can not go wrong with Aramis.</li>
