      <li>I bought this lip balm on a whim, and I have to admit that it&#x27;s one of the better Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products I&#x27;ve tried in a while.</li>
      <li>Love the tinted lip balms.</li>
      <li>I like a tinted lip balm consistency to be a bit more like a lipstick, and not a runny gloss.</li>
      <li>It stays almost &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, so it smears easily, and comes off VERY easily.</li>
      <li>This goes on so nice and gives me a nice light color not heavy like lipstick and moisturizes nice!  </li>
      <li>Also, these balms are very moisturizing and feel really good on my lips.</li>
      <li>Keeps lips nice and pretty</li>
      <li>Love the Sweet Violet color.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s nice having a more natural beauty option.</li>
      <li>The color is really nice and it was really moisterizing .</li>
      <li>The color is a quite pretty purplish pink, and application is flawless, providing protection with a splash of color.</li>
      <li>The Sweet Violet shade is flattering, but when applied it&#x27;s almost too light for my olive skin tone.</li>
      <li>Sweet Violet is a nice soft purple mauve color.</li>
      <li>I just had to get another one, so I decided to try out sweet violet.</li>
      <li>I decided to go with the shade Sweet Violet.</li>
      <li>LoL.&lt;br /&gt;Great color but not too dark and feels great on my lips.</li>
      <li>This is a new color, and now my favorite.</li>
      <li>I bought it in both Sweet Violet and Pink Blossom, and have a yellow-toned fair complexion.</li>
      <li>while ordering I thought it will be just 1 balm, but I really was interested in this color since you can&#x27;t find it anywhere, but it turned out to be 4 of them &#x3D;).</li>
      <li>Love these lip balms, light sweet flavour, very sheer kiss of colour.</li>
      <li>This is a great everyday product.</li>
      <li>Very creamy and smooth .</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think is worth 6 bucks.</li>
      <li>The composition of this stick feels very nice on my lips but smells and tastes a little waxy.</li>
      <li>although it is more sheer and light than a lipstick, that is exactly what is desired/expected in a tinted balm - I love how it keeps my lips soft and conditioned, not sticky like a gloss</li>
      <li>Still searching for the right tinted lip balm</li>
      <li>The problem with this is that the product has a tendency to wipe, or slide right off.</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>Moisturizing and just the right amount of color for me.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to be violet because it is more of a fresh pinkish red with a purple undertone.</li>
      <li>The balm was delivered very fast.</li>
      <li>Also its very nourishing!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
      <li>Red dahlia is a better color for me, sweet violet is more purple than I expected.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but I expected the color to be a bit more opaque/buildable, but I really like both as they are.</li>
      <li>I can really see the tint.</li>
      <li>I tend to use Pink Blossom more, though.</li>
      <li>and it is more moisturizing than other colors I had.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re better moisture-wise than Chapstick and other lip balm brands I&#x27;ve tried..</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like any make up on my face, but this gentle touch on my lips wakes up the natural coloring of my face.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product but is getting 4 stars because it&#x27;s way overpriced; the tube itself is the same size as a regular chapstick</li>
      <li>(This will not be exciting if later on the package price</li>
      <li>Tint is very natural looking .</li>
      <li>so I guess the other reviewers got lucky</li>
      <li>They both lend a sheer but noticeable wash of color, and are very hydrating.</li>
      <li>Color doesn&#x27;t last, wish it didn&#x27;t use hydrogenated oils, but I have to say my lips really like this.  </li>
      <li>Enough to make you look like you have a pulse, but not enough to look like I have lipstick on, which is exactly what this looks like after application.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know quite how to explain this, but here goes: This tinted lip balm is a deeply pigmented, highly moisturizing one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping: a pink in the purple category, but not PURPLE.</li>
      <li>color is very suitable for me，or any other who has a little bit dark lip color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>barely there&#x27; pigment.</li>
      <li>At first, I was disappointed by the lack of color, but then after making closer comparisons I began to really like it, as it made my lips look like a healthy peachy nude.</li>
      <li>I will start with me being truly surprised by the actual size of the lip balm.</li>
      <li>like the other Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balms, the effect is subtle and nice.</li>
      <li>I first bought this a few days ago in Tiger Lily.</li>
      <li>I have a light skin with dark blond hair and green eyes and this shade goes well with me.  </li>

    <li> I bought this lip balm on a whim, and I have to admit that it&#x27;s one of the better Burt&#x27;s Bees lip products I&#x27;ve tried in a while. The packaging is almost a bit over the top - the lip balm is in a container, in another container. The Sweet Violet shade is flattering, but when applied it&#x27;s almost too light for my olive skin tone. When compared to similar lip balms like Baby Lips, Alba Tints, and Ulta brand it&#x27;s nice having a more natural beauty option. As this balm seems lacking in color AND a bit pricey, I&#x27;m not certain I&#x27;ll reorder. But until then, this tube should at least last all summer.  ;)</li>
    <li> This goes on so nice and gives me a nice light color not heavy like lipstick and moisturizes nice!  It&#x27;s a plus not having harmful chemicals in it also!  I would order other colors too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product . Very creamy and smooth . Tint is very natural looking .</li>
    <li> Loved the color. Unfortunately, I was pretty disgusted after putting in on, and wiped it off as quickly as possible!</li>
    <li> nice little hint of color and feels great on lips</li>
    <li> I love it sooo much!&lt;br /&gt;This color is very suitable for me，or any other who has a little bit dark lip color.&lt;br /&gt;It aloso has a good moisturizing effect, even better than the lip stick of FRESH.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer for lips!</li>
    <li> Love the tinted lip balms. This is a new color, and now my favorite. I&#x27;m never without it. Hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> Sweet Violet is a nice soft purple mauve color. It&#x27;s hard to find a purple lip balm, and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I keep one of these everywhere......kind of like my reading glasses! LoL.&lt;br /&gt;Great color but not too dark and feels great on my lips.</li>
    <li> Horrible! And not the lip balm...I wouldn&#x27;t know. ..I received an empty container.</li>
    <li> As with most Burt&#x27;s Bees products, this lip balm does not disappoint! The color is a quite pretty purplish pink, and application is flawless, providing protection with a splash of color.</li>
    <li> Great color great lip balm. Keeps lips nice and pretty</li>
    <li> I will start with me being truly surprised by the actual size of the lip balm. Yes, it is small. When applied the balm feels very smooth on my lips. I decided to go with the shade Sweet Violet. It turned out to be a great choice. To me it seems like it is more of a mauve shade. I have a light skin with dark blond hair and green eyes and this shade goes well with me.

    <li> although it is more sheer and light than a lipstick, that is exactly what is desired/expected in a tinted balm - I love how it keeps my lips soft and conditioned, not sticky like a gloss</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday product. I bought it in both Sweet Violet and Pink Blossom, and have a yellow-toned fair complexion. They both lend a sheer but noticeable wash of color, and are very hydrating. There is a slight scent to each, but nothing overpowering. I don&#x27;t know why, but I expected the color to be a bit more opaque/buildable, but I really like both as they are. I tend to use Pink Blossom more, though.</li>
    <li> Love these lip balms, light sweet flavour, very sheer kiss of colour.</li>
    <li> I first bought this a few days ago in Tiger Lily. At first, I was disappointed by the lack of color, but then after making closer comparisons I began to really like it, as it made my lips look like a healthy peachy nude. I just had to get another one, so I decided to try out sweet violet. The color is sheer but but has a slight purplish pinkish tint to it. Very satisfied with the results and I will be itching to try out other colors in the future. Also, these balms are very moisturizing and feel really good on my lips. They&#x27;re better moisture-wise than Chapstick and other lip balm brands I&#x27;ve tried..</li>
    <li> Cute color. I can really see the tint. Came in the cute case. Beeswax feels good.</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last, wish it didn&#x27;t use hydrogenated oils, but I have to say my lips really like this.  Will buy again.  Red dahlia is a better color for me, sweet violet is more purple than I expected.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm their best product for lip protection. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering taste or smell. The color is excellent, however do not expect it to be intense.  They have perfected the texture and it does prevent chapped lips. The cardboard packaging does seem unnecessary...</li>
    <li> These are fine. Tint is a barley there tint. Not a regret but not a must have either. Still searching for the right tinted lip balm</li>
    <li> Definitely did not get 4 tubes so I guess the other reviewers got lucky or I got ripped off. The composition of this stick feels very nice on my lips but smells and tastes a little waxy. The color is very sheer but does add a noticeable hue to your lips. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice product but is getting 4 stars because it&#x27;s way overpriced; the tube itself is the same size as a regular chapstick and I don&#x27;t think is worth 6 bucks.</li>
    <li> The color is really nice and it was really moisterizing . It wasnt good for layering though , it tends to flake.</li>
    <li> I saw another reviewer saying this was for four tubes, but I didn&#x27;t want to count on that in case that was just a packaging/sending mistake. But no: I got four tubes, too! (This will not be exciting if later on the package price reflects this---but when I ordered, the price was about the same as one single tube in the store.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about the color, which looked quite neon/magenta/purple in the photo, but it&#x27;s not garish at all: like the other Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted lip balms, the effect is subtle and nice. It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping: a pink in the purple category, but not PURPLE.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know quite how to explain this, but here goes: This tinted lip balm is a deeply pigmented, highly moisturizing one. Sounds like a good thing, right? Well, yes and no. I find the lip balm to be TOO moisturizing. Almost greasy. The problem with this is that the product has a tendency to wipe, or slide right off. It stays almost &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, so it smears easily, and comes off VERY easily. Almost like Vaseline, actually. I like a tinted lip balm consistency to be a bit more like a lipstick, and not a runny gloss. The color is deeply pigmented, almost too dark for my tastes. I like a &#x27;barely there&#x27; pigment. Enough to make you look like you have a pulse, but not enough to look like I have lipstick on, which is exactly what this looks like after application. So add to that how &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; it is, and it becomes a bleeding, sloppy mess. This is the FIRST and only Burt&#x27;s Bees product that I have not liked. I trust the company and will continue to use the other products, just not the tinted lip balms.</li>
    <li> Love the Sweet Violet color. Don&#x27;t expect it to be violet because it is more of a fresh pinkish red with a purple undertone. Very suitable for spring and it is more moisturizing than other colors I had. Love this!</li>
    <li> Moisturizing and just the right amount of color for me.</li>
    <li> The balm was delivered very fast. The color is looking gorgeous on my lips! Also its very nourishing! while ordering I thought it will be just 1 balm, but I really was interested in this color since you can&#x27;t find it anywhere, but it turned out to be 4 of them &#x3D;). Overall, I&#x27;m really satisfied.</li>
