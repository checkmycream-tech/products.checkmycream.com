<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works!! I initially used a different product for about two weeks but my razor bumps kept getting worse then I did more research and decided to try this product. I applied it in the evening before going to bed  and the results were unbelievable when i woke up in the morning! It didn&#x27;t even take 24 hrs!</li>
    <li> I really like the larger bottle!</li>
    <li> Having had really sensitive skin my whole life, I have tried many products upward of $50.00 to try and take care of my razor bumps.  I have used every technique and razor possible.  Finally a product that does what it says.  I saw immediate results in the 1st week after using bump patrol.  The irritation level is down along with the annoying redness.  This is not a cure all as I still have some irritations as I need to shave often for work, but out of all of the products I have used this one definitely stands out as one that I would recommend.  Took a star away as it does not completely take away all the redness and bumps.  However, when I forget my bump patrol when I travel the difference in my irritation is significant.  If you have tried other high end products like myself with no success, I would give this a shot for $8.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin that often gets very red from shaving. Before I found this product it was pretty annoying and I always felt like my neck was on fire. When someone finally gave me this aftershave, my world changed. When you apply it after shaving it burns bad, but in a good way. You can feel it working it&#x27;s magic, and the burning stops within 30 seconds or so. Only on a rare occassion does my neck still get red at all after using this, and I now shave everyday with no worries of my neck being red the rest of the day.     The only negatives I see with this product:  1) It has a strong alcohol smell that sticks with you all day unless you rinse your neck off 10 minutes after applying.  2) It is somewhat sticky on the neck, and again I tend to rinse it off after about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I got Bump Patrol for my 17 year old son to help with eliminating, or at least reducing, the irritating bumps he gets when shaving.  He also has some acne and shaving really irritates that.  I have only seen this product in some of the Walgreens where I live and only in the African American section.  My son says this is the absolute best and his skin now remains smoth and he does not get the irritated bumps he was having trouble with. It&#x27;s a shame that this product might be limiting potential sales to people who might not look in the African American section as there are others with this problem too.  It really works!</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used this product for many years; it has always given me good results. Apparently my face is sensitive to razors, it gets very irritated and razor bumps if left untreated. This product reduces the irritation and razor bumps to almost none existence when I use it regularly. The key is to use your razor and this product according to the manufactory recommendation. The only thing I would recommend is a couple of different sent; musk would be good. This is a good product for me; I plan to keep purchasing it.</li>
    <li> My shaving techniques have typically not brought on razor bumps in my 15 years of shaving. Over the past year the bumps began to appear below my jaw line. I tried a few products with no avail. I decided to try a tiny bottle of this stuff that I found on a clearance rack in Wal-Mart or Target... does not really matter where. What does matter is that it out performs anything that I tried. When I use it, I actually feel like it is giving a deeper and cleaner \\&quot;after shave burn.\\&quot;  So, I started buying the large bottles here on Amazon. The razor bumps have cleared up over the course of about 3-4 months. (I also made a change from one electric razor to another. Sorry I do not have model numbers. My new razor is Phillips Norelco and it has a 3 head surface with a cleaning dock.) Now personally, I do not like the funky little smell that the Bump Patrol leaves on my face, so after I apply the Bump Patrol, I wait a few seconds then put on something to hide the smell, such as \\&quot;Dolce &amp; Gabbana The One\\&quot; after shave cream. You know one of those nice smelling, but extremely worthless aftershaves that comes with the purchase of cologne. I highly recommend Bump Patrol to anyone with a razor bump problem as it works wonders for me. I hope it works for you too.</li>
    <li> Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked within 24 hours as advertised. Very rare to come across products that work as advertised &amp; are priced moderately. The troublesome razor bumps had all but disappeared within one week of treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now and it has helped virtually eliminate the painful and unsightly shaving bumps that I periodically suffered for many years before that.  Using a sharp razor (I change mine once a week) and a non-irritating face soap (Cetaphil or generic equivalent) before shaving also helps.  I&#x27;m a 50-ish \\&quot;white guy.\\&quot;  So count me a loyal customer.  Wish it were easier to find at the local drugstore.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and your bumps from shaving will disappear.  I&#x27;ve noticed you only need very little to make this work so the bottle will last longer than you think.  I haven&#x27;t tried other products so I don&#x27;t know if there are comparable solutions to shaving bumps however this one works as advertised.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Others have posted how horrible the smell is.  It does smell bad, but it is luckily not a strong smell.  It goes away rather quickly and when it dries, I put on a different after-shave and that seems to take care of it.  As far as how the product works - they are not lying - give it 48 hours and you are good to go.  My neck is ultra-sensitive and I have used all of the sensitive skin products, but it still looked like I shaved my neck with a dull cheese grater - even an electric razor caused breakouts for me.  Now I use this after I shave and I don&#x27;t have any problems.  PROS:  Works just as advertised, keeps the bumps from coming back  CONS: smells bad, stings a tiny bit  OVERALL: The performance more than makes up for the bad smell - and the smell goes away rather quickly.  Give it a shot, I hope it works as well for you as it does for me.</li>
    <li> Pros:    As for as alcohol based after shaves, this one worked the best  I don&#x27;t mind that good burn feeling    Cons:    Sticky  The bottle&#x27;s label will start to shed rather quickly, it gets everywhere and sticks to things.  I have been experiencing better results with using an all natural after shave  Dries my skin out      It was good while I used it, but i&#x27;ve more on to more natural after shaves. My skin is much smoother, no burn, and no bottle stickin stuff everywhere</li>
    <li> This product is hands down bumps&#x27; worst enemy. Even though its loaded with alcohol, i dont get dry skin. Completely fixed my ingrown problem. Wouldn&#x27;t even think of shaving without it !</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I have used it for three years and it has never failed.  Nothing else even comes close to Bump Patrol.</li>
    <li> An acquaintance bought me Bump Patrol from a local store last summer after I started started shaving with razors and, consequently, developed numerous razor bumps. I applied it frequently, per directions, in the hopes of relief. My skin got darker, the bumps persisted, and Bump Patrol took very long to get rid of the bumps. In my quest for a more effective shaving technique and shaving tools (including aftershave creams that minimized ingrown hairs), I did not pay enough attention to my darkening skin (quite evident when comparing pictures). With rapidly growing hair and dark skin, it wasn&#x27;t as pressing a factor as the constant resurgence of hair bumps and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all changed 2 weeks ago. After shaving my face and head with a razor, I developed bumps everywhere, even on my scalp. To curtail it, I applied Bump Patrol all over my face and head over the course of 3 days. Big mistake! The bumps healed after 1 week. However, I am now left with the most ridiculous amount of black spots all over my face and shaven head. It&#x27;s the first thing anyone that talks to me brings up. The occurrence of the black spots was so sudden and so encompassing that I&#x27;m left completely unsure as to how to deal with the dark scaring all over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed it took me so long to realize Bump Patrol was the single item in my grooming solution that was causing the discoloration of the skin. I&#x27;ve certainly learned a vital lesson here: do your research before you trust products \\&quot;that work for everyone.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;// If only products could be rated negative stars ...</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to every one suffering with razor bumps, psoriasis and eczema.  It works really fast.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic and the only reason I started to use this was because I received a free sample when I purchased an electric shaver.  To my surprise, this stuff actually works.  I wish I had this when I first began shaving.  Probably would have saved me a lot of headaches from trying to deal with razor bumps.  Not the best smelling stuff but fortunately you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  I will be a customer for life...or at least until someone makes a product that works just as well but smells better.</li>
    <li> Tried this product years back and as the saying goes - you don&#x27;t know what u got until it&#x27;s gone. When i ran out, I tried about 3 other products with very limited success and had to go back to Bump Patrol early this year. Haven&#x27;t been disappointed since then!</li>
    <li> works well for men or women on any shaved area that produces bumps. May also be used as an exfoliate, just test to make sure the acidic content doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many after shaves.  Of all of them, Bump Patrol has given me the best results.  My face isn&#x27;t so irritated anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works well under my neck for razor bumps/burn. I have been using it for 6 years now and Amazon has a good bulk pricing for it.</li>
    <li> Really works. Stumbled onto this when I was on vacation about five years ago. Ran into a CVS near my hotel room looking for what I usually used, can&#x27;t remember it didn&#x27;t work like Bump Patrol, picked this up and followed instructions and it worked as stated within couple hours. Been using this ever since, good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bump Patrol since 2001 and I could not find any other treatment and or prevention product in the market that could beat it.  I have used it to treat irritated skin bumps caused by ingrown hair.  For treatment of existing bumps,  I apply it to my skin and leave it for like 10 hours and the bumps will dry out and disappear and if there is any hidden ingrown hair, I would be able to see them and get rid of them. For preventing future bumps, I apply it after shaving and leave it for a minimum of three hours and it has given me very good results.  From my experience, the more time I leave it on the skin without washing, the better the results I get.    However, it does not prevents the ingrown hair bumps completely.  The shaving style you use will help a lot when you shave in a correct and smooth way.  The problems with bump patrol include a chemical like smell which would go away in less than an hour and the glossy look on the skin especially when you apply a significant amount which could be fixed if you apply a thin layer of bump patrol to your shaved area.  Another problem is that if you apply it to a shaved area that has a small razor cut, sometimes a white or a milky color will be there around the cut which sometimes becomes difficult to remove within the first one hour or so.   Overall, I recommend this product for anyone who has an ingrown hair or shaving bumps problems but it has to be used with precaution.</li>
    <li> the smell is a bit strong but it gets the job done it did take a little while before i saw any difference like 8 days but give it a chance it works</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Problems quickly eliminated. Highly recommended product!! I have used this product previously and was very satisfied with the results. Found it here at Amazon and the price is much cheaper than other places.</li>
    <li> Truly does work but you must apply it after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get nasty unsightly razor bumps on my neck. I no longer get them when I use this... this is the only thing that has worked for me. I&#x27;ve spent over $100 on various &amp;#34;aftershave&amp;#34; products and this is the only thing that truly works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodluck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had razor bumps from shaving all my life.  I had to begin shaving with clippers and keeping a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Once I started graying, I need to shave closer.  And, then the razor bumps returned.  I bought this product (as I&#x27;ve bought countless others only to be disappointed).  This product smells TERRIBLE!  But, it works.  IT WORKS AWESOME!!!!  The smell goes away within a few minutes because it dries fast.  I began shaving closer with the clippers (still a bit gun shy about using a full-on razor).  I use this stuff and I get NO razor bumps.  If you FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS, you will NOT be disappointed.  And, you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.  I use 3 drops per cheek.  And, 6 drops for under the throat.  Also, I got a great deal of scarring from my razor bumps.  This product healed my razor bumps and the scarring began to fade (not part of the deal.  I think I was just lucky).  Very, VERY happy with this product!  This is the ONLY aftershave I will use.  You can spray your cologne over it after it dries and it&#x27;s like it was never even there.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> omg i just bought this product last week and i was actually reading the reviews and all, i was lalala here we go again,they probably paid someone to write positive comments about their products, but trust me this product really really reallllllllllly works, i wish i had a picture to show you guys. what this product does is magic, first it dries up any existing bump on ur face then it starts clearing it off, and then it actually prevents any new stubborn nasty bumps from coming back and my face is smooth and bumpless :) Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Husband swears by it!  Never any razor bumps ❤️</li>
    <li> Meets and exceeds expectations.  Purchased this and the shave gel.</li>
    <li> I know this product is marketed to men who shave their faces, but I&#x27;ve used it for years on my bikini area and it works wonders.  I&#x27;m EXTREMELY prone to ingrown hairs and bumps that lead to insightly black marks. Yuck. I use this stuff at the end of my shaving protocol and I barely have any problems with bumps at all anymore.  It does burn a little, especially if you use the extra or maximum strength versions. But the sting only lasts about 30 seconds. Well worth it for the benefits afterwards. I highly recommend it. I keep this stuff stock-piled in my bathroom. I never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic about this product because I didn&#x27;t know if buying it from the internet was a good idea. However, when i received it, I was very happy with the results. The price was incredible for the amount I got. Also received the package on time &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> im a brother and when i get shaving bumps its real bad but with this im looking smooth as a baby ive used it for 10years and will never switch!</li>
    <li> I love to shave my head with a razor, but the razor bumps on my head discouraged me from doing it more often.  This product, so far, has been outstanding.  I was skeptical, but after watching their videos on the company&#x27;s website about  how to shave, when to shave, how often to shave and how to use the product...the razor bumps are negligible.  I just bought more.  I&#x27;ll make 5 stars after a month...so far 1.5 weeks.</li>
    <li> Finally something that works against red irritation! I&#x27;ve been trying everything to get rid of red irritation bumps on my neck after I shave. This does the trick. Be forewarned that it stings, but only for a second and that means it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I used to have severe razor bumps on my neck and I tried every solution there was.  When I came across bump patrol in Walmart (before they stopped selling it) I was skeptical at first but after using for one full week I was floored by the results.  Since then, I have been using bump patrol for over 5+ years and it is still works on my sensitive skin. My wife loves it, I love it, this is one awesome product!</li>
    <li> Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;Best aftershave on market</li>
    <li> Works great, I can really see a difference in my skin. I think I&#x27;ll start using it on my head when I shave that as well.</li>
    <li> Since I began using this stuff, I&#x27;ve had only ONE in-grown hair/hair bump on my face &amp; neck area.  Prior to this, I would typically get at least 5 or 6 annoying hair bumps per week -- which would ultimately lead to blemishes.... This product was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> this stuff is a miracle!  i used to get the worst razor burn/bumps that would turn pustular by days end!  &amp; oddly enough ONLY on my neck-- but ive been using this stuff for almost 2 years now &amp; never had the bumps/burn.&lt;br /&gt; i Highly recommend you use it Sparingly, the days i accidentally put more than a few drops i get this sticky/tacky film on my neck that feels gross.  but avoid excess use &amp; you&#x27;re good to go, worth the $$!</li>
    <li> Works for white dudes as well. Miracle in a bottle. I used to get terrible razor bumps and ingrown hairs. Stuff really works. Just mousturize after.</li>
    <li> 100 % recommend this product. Works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried to control my shaving bumps. You will love it!!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! 2 days, gone. Doesn&#x27;t burn or leave skin feeling too dry or scarring like other brands. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This product works. I have been using it for over a year now and it&#x27;s usually a harder product to find. I personally apply after shaving and usually twice a day (morning and night) until my facial hair starts coming in. Not only does this help with bumps it also helps tremendously with ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Everything was very good</li>
    <li> Husband has used this for years. This is the only product that works for him.</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it in my sensitive bikini area to keep the razor bumps away..along with there other products...they work like a charm! :)</li>
    <li> This product works great for after shave and razor bumps - and prevention of them.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and it does have a very strong odor I don&#x27;t particularly like, but the product works great!</li>
    <li> I use this continually on my bikini line after shaving and it worked wonders. A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ll never use anything else. It works!</li>
    <li> I am a woman and I buy this for my bikini line.  It works great!  No more shave bumps.  Don&#x27;t over use it though because it will make your skin peel.</li>
    <li> great for razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Used daily for years. Excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> I had no problems for the first 15 years of shaving then all the sudden last January I started to get severe razor burn/bumps and tried all the recommendations of shaving routines, creams, razors, etc.  nothing worked.  I was so frustrated and was contemplating growing a beard or laser removal.  I saw this product at a local store and decided to give it a shot. It had immediate impact and by the third day I was not getting razor burn/bumps after shaving!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do if I didn&#x27;t have this after shave.  I have used it for about 10 years and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> i have to shave daily for work, which i hate. this stuff has made it a breeze. gone are the days of unsightly and uncomfortable bumps and ingrown hairs. use consistently and you are guaranteed satisfaction. also, you can use this immediately after shaving, wait 5 minutes, and apply the aftershave or moisturizer or whatever, of your choice with no interference or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that a small piece of the cap snaps off EVERY bottle and thus becomes impossible to be kept closed, resulting in blue stuff all over the lid and the constant need to keep the bottle upright. This is especially annoying when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product is so good that i will not let this minor packaging malfunction take away from its deserving 5 star review.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a year.  Great product for men with curly hair and ingrowns.</li>
    <li> great product, ive been using this for years</li>
    <li> I love it. My face love it. Excellent product. I would recommend this to all the men that are have bumps problem.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. Found this in a local store initially, then they stopped carrying it. Purchase here at Amazon was quick and worry free. I use it after shaving with an electric shaver, and it helps remove any burn post shave.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  At Walmart, the 2 oz bottle costs around $7 so getting double the quantity for only $1 more is an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I shave my head with the schick hydro and use bump patrol.  No bumps whatsoever.  Had razor burn and bumps on the back of my head for a while until I started using this stuff. With in 1 single us I could tell it was working.  1 week later no bumps at all.</li>
    <li> Does what I expect it to do.  I have been using this product for many, many years.  It is a reliable product.</li>
    <li> It works great for me, but it&#x27;s 2 ounces, not four ounces as on the Amazon item I&#x27;m looking at now.</li>
    <li> Very effective.  It stings but hey, no pain, no gain, right?</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff! I&#x27;ve tried very product under the sun for razor bump and ingrown hairs and this is the only one that has worked for me. It keeps my face from breaking out after I shave. The only issue I have with it is that it has a nasty smell that lingers on your face. Whenever I turn my head I get a whiff of something unpleasant.</li>
    <li> item was not seal before placing the cap. Not safe to carry, can easily spilled.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my boyfriend I was amazed on how quick it worked. My boyfriend says it&#x27;s the best product that he&#x27;s ever has used. He never wants to run out of this product. Thanks amazon:-)</li>
    <li> A tad strong but it does the job very well with great results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have many razor bumps to begin with, but this solution only eliminated 30% of the bumps. Been using it for the past month and a half.</li>
    <li> works great, removes bumps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bump Patrol for about six years now, and I can&#x27;t go w/ out it! It helps me control my face and neck from breaking out w/ bumps (ingrown hairs). Occasionally, every other shave, I&#x27;ll get two or three tiny bumps, but nothing out of control b/c this product really helps.</li>
    <li> My male friend stated hat this product was very helpful and worth the money and would recommend it to anyone with coarse facial hair...</li>
    <li> This is the best razor burn serum ever!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product for preventing razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I ordered these products because I have purchased them in the past and I know they work to prevent razor bumps well</li>
    <li> Used to get plenty of razor bumps. Not anymore. This stuff works great and I have sensitive skin. Burns a little going on but only for a short time. Recommend this product if you suffer from razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, good price!</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Goood results against my bumps.</li>
    <li> Product is great. seller is great. Everything was as expected.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many many years. Works very well. I have no more razor rash problems.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. I really don&#x27;t have anything to say more about it! Just slap it on after shaving, and it will moisturize and prevent those bumps from reappearing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product severalm years and I am completed satified. will order more soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Lorenzo Young</li>
    <li> Great product, Great Price</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Still have razor burn.</li>
    <li> Great price for the size.  I&#x27;ve seem this price on the 2oz package.  I&#x27;ve been using Bump Patrol for years, alone with another bump eliminator.  I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works but I still get ingrown hairs but my face doesn&#x27;t have the noticeable bumps.  I&#x27;m even able to use a safety razor now, before I could only use a depilatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some will wonder if it is Bump Patrol or the other bump eliminator that I use that is giving me the results.  I got razor bumps every time I shaved.  It wasn&#x27;t one or two bumps, it was severe.  Products work different for everyone.  I found a combination that works for me and it includes Bump Patrol.  I would start with a smaller size, but if it works for you this is a good price.</li>
    <li> As a black guy, I&#x27;d been dealing with ingrown hairs since I started shaving at 15. They were unsightly and they hurt. I bought bump patrol at CVS one weekend and used it Sunday night. This was back in 2009. Here&#x27;s my thoughts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.The stuff works in 24-48 hours. There&#x27;s no question about it. My hair bumps stay gone when I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;2. You only need a little bit.  I shave every day or every other day and it lasts for nearly a month if not long.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s not just for men. My wife has used it and any hair bumps she&#x27;s had have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. It burns a little when you put it on. Probably more than other aftershaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is wonderful and I&#x27;ve recommended it to people with the same problem.</li>
    <li> great stuff work well</li>
    <li> This stuff is good.  I use it for my bikini area</li>
    <li> The only thing that works for my razor bumps. Use it religiously. I never go without it. Whenever I run out my skin breaks out. All the evidence I need.</li>
    <li> Works great for husband product was recommend by my brother. Great product for black males who have issue with razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, for those with razor bumps.  I use after every razor shave and before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> This works so well.  No other one works as quick.  The price is better than local prices.</li>
    <li> This works great if you have trouble with bumps. Just apply to affected areas and you would see results in about 24 hours. I hightly recommend this.</li>
    <li> The only thing that has ever worked for my razor burn is Bump Patrol.  I used to have to buy it at a local national store, but it was only available in the 2 oz package and cost $8.  This is the same bump patrol I&#x27;ve come to love but in a larger, more economically priced package.  If you&#x27;ve never used bump patrol, it has a strong alcohol odor when applied and can feel slightly sticky for the first 10 minutes after application.  Not in a distracting manner - just something you notice if you touch your face shortly after use.  The alcohol smell disappears very quickly and the final application actually smells quite pleasant afterwards.  As far as results - I went from enough razor burn on my neck to look like a teenage kid&#x27;s acne war to no razor burn in two uses. (Each use was after shaving once a day.)  If you have any issues with razor burn and haven&#x27;t had any luck dealing with it, you have to give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Really helped with bumping</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for twenty years and for whatever reason my face decide to start getting shaving bumps. So I replaced the razor with more expensive ones an yet the same problem persist. I was at Walmart yesterday trying to decide if I would just try a different shaving cream; but I saw this instead. So I purchased it with several other items; when I got home I went directly into the bathroom and put some on my beautiful chocolate face without even shaving. The next morning while brushing my teeth I happen to notice that most of my bumps had shrunken so small they were barley noticeable. I have literally spent will over $300 in the pass few months fighting these razor bumps. Who would ever thought I would find the answer to my facial problem in a small blue bottle. People it really works; I have heard a lot of people complain about the smell... my bottle had NO smell at all. I also order another bottle right here on Amazon. If you notice beside the comment it says Verified. That means the person actually purchased the produce. GOOD  STUFF!!!!!!</li>
    <li> ACTUALLY DOES PREVENT RAZOR BUMPS 😊</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff out there. It not only prevents razor bumps on theface, it also starts to make your skin look better in about 15 minutes after use. Is great for those who bodys shave, even in sweaty and high friction areas. If your one that body shaves like bikini areas, i recommend bump patrol maximum strength as it last longer because of the vitamin E and helps it spread farther.</li>
    <li> My husband literally lives off of this stuff. His black with extremely sensitive skin. Without this product he can&#x27;t shave without huge skin outbreaks. We&#x27;ve gone to extreme lengths to make sure we have this in the house at all times.</li>
    <li> I am an african american male of 20 years of age and i have facial hair growth on chin sides and above lip. and i HATE it. ive been shaving and suffering from bumps/discoloration since i was 17. i used this  stuff for 2 weeks and you can SEE the differences after each day of using it! my goal is to have a beautiful completely flawless beard area ( i do drag performances)and im confident continue use of this product will help.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son who just started shaving.  It is working well, as far as, keeping him from getting razor bumps.  The product works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the military, where you either shave, or grow a messy, ungroomed beard. I shaved, and shaved until there were bumps and blood galore. I tried this because it was the only thing I could find. Cleared my face within a week, and prevents more bumps. Buy this product!</li>
    <li> Never knew how to deal with razor bumps. I&#x27;d pretty much just washed my face with Neutrogena and hoped for the best.. this stuff works miracles...i get NO RAZOR BUMPS anymore.. i was very skeptical but you must try this if you have razor bump issues.</li>
    <li> Delivered just as promised</li>
    <li> My wife had written the first review for me. She is correct, Bump patrol is the first and only product to help me with razor bumps. I buy a case at a time.  It is a must have.</li>
    <li> My son uses this and he loves it. He won&#x27;t use anything else. It is the only thing that works on his face.</li>
    <li> I have been using bump patrol for many years after stumbling upon it by happen chance and after trying many other so-called bump control products that did not work. I have had nothing but success with this product as it does what it is suppose to do. In addition, the bump patrol shave cream enables my razor to glide effortlessly across my face, resulting in little to no irritation. I have also discovered that by applying oil to my face after applying shaving cream, my shaving experience is phenomenal ! Now that I have discovered the benefits of applying oil with my shave cream, I will NOT shave without. I highly recommend the bump patrol products.</li>
    <li> Highly effective formula</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the Air Force and the military is sooo big on making us keep this fallacious appearance of today&#x27;s \\&quot;professional man\\&quot; looking standards so THANK THE BLACK GOD for bump patrol lol this is the only stuff that has ever worked for me. Before that I always got harassed for having a shaving waiver but the folks who don&#x27;t have to deal with our problem usually hate on a brotha for having a small beard or just don&#x27;t even care to understand that shaving hurts, scars up, and blemishes brothas faces. I recommend this product to all my military brothas out there if they are making you shave or you just tired of the man riding ya back about your medical waiver.</li>
    <li> Best bump control I ever used.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit diluted compared to the smaller bottle. (this is my second time buying the big bottle)... To me the smaller bottle is more potent!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2, 4oz bottles of Bump Patrol, because I like to keep an extra bottle or two in reserve. When I opened one of the bottles last night, I noticed it was only half full....they are emptying half of the bottle and doubling their profit! They say they are selling you 4oz but it is only 2oz for a 4oz price! Do not purchase from these people!!</li>
    <li> My husband used to buy this from walmart but it&#x27;s no longer available. Per my hubby, this is the best aftershave out there - it does wonders for bumps!</li>
    <li> This is a great product...I am happy that it comes in a bigger size..it really works for my hubby.. it makes his face so smooth. Plz keep it in stock..I heard it ws being discontinued in some places..</li>
    <li> This bump patrol works I love it</li>
    <li> This thing actually works. Been using it for about 4 years now!</li>
    <li> I am very thankful for this product!</li>
    <li> My favorite aftershave. I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. It burns but it does its job well.</li>
    <li> useless. no effect after one month.</li>
    <li> I am not african american and it still works great for me. I have been using this product for years and it works great to prevent razor burn and bumps on your neck if you have coarse facial hair.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend likes this stuff. Always repurchases it</li>
    <li> A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I can finally say (at the age of 29) that I can shave my scalp with an actual razor because of this product. I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for almost 10 years! Bought and tried multiple other solutions to avoid/get rid of razor bumps but nothing has ever worked until now! All bald and black men should use this product along with the bump patrol shave gel!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using various different methods to prevent bumps. Everything from Aftershave, electric razors, wet shave, magic shave no shave. By far, this is the best product I have found. I just find it weird that I only found it in a store in Michigan so far and no where else. Good thing there&#x27;s Amazon!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say we love a product that is an unpleasant necessity, but this stuff really works for us - keeps bumps under control.  It&#x27;s not intended to be a wonderful scented &#x27;after shave&#x27; - it&#x27;s designed to help with razor bumps - wherever you shave.  Bump Patrol original formula works better than any of the other many products we&#x27;ve tried, so we&#x27;ll continue until we become immune...if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Very small amount is required. I have always used Gillete Fusion razors but felt as if I was missing something. Even with the expensive Fusion Razors always had in-growns. Bought the shave cream along with the after shave (a must have to minimize bumps). Only drawback to the after shave is that it dried my left hand that I use to apply it, but it does not have that effect on my face or neck. I now only place a dab of the after shave on the tip of my fingers and apply.  I also apply on the back side of my neck to eliminate any bumps as I also shave my head every morning. Overall an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It would probably work great for anyone prone to razor bumps on their face (or other body parts) after shaving with a razor. I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it. It has an alcohol sort of smell to it and of course, it burns when you put it on your skin. The burning goes away very quickly. I use it for my bikini area and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Nothing but alcohol in a bottle</li>
    <li> Ordered for my dad. Arrived in 2 days in a box (I ordered 6). He is happy, I am happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bump Patrol for about 2 years now.  I used to struggle with shaving bumps all over my neck, but as soon as I started using this product, the bumps stopped.  I use this in place of a regular aftershave.</li>
    <li> This is the best product of its type I have ever used. That includes the Bump Patrol shaving cream. The combination of the shaving cream and after shave essentially eliminate ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> This product initially was good, but it sort of fizzled after a while, and I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;It may or may not work for you...not sure</li>
</ol>
