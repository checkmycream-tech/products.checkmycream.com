      <li>Excellent item, fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Amazing shaver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s rotary shavers for years as I found they worked much better on my legs than women&#x27;s shavers.  </li>
      <li>My WDF-3000 does better than that</li>
      <li>I have too many scars, scratches, imperfections, etc.</li>
      <li>I love it and use it all the time.</li>

      <li>Buy it - you will love it, too.</li>
      <li>I would except better packaging.</li>
      <li>She wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
      <li>This Remington WR5000 Women&#x27;s Rotary Shaver does not give as smooth and silky shave as advertised!</li>
      <li>Update:Still using this for even more years.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love this shaver.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It works great - the way the older Norelco men&#x27;s shavers used to work on my legs.  </li>
      <li>Have used this for two or three years now and it is very dependable and does a good job.   </li>
      <li>She decided it worked fine, so I ordered this Remington WR5000.</li>
      <li>Quick to use and love it being cordless.</li>
      <li>I use it in gentle, circular motions, and it leaves my skin nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin silky smooth.</li>
      <li>But I use this in circular motions all over my legs, and it leaves a smooth, stubble-free finish.</li>
      <li>razor head moves smoothly without any pinching or pulling.  </li>
      <li>The only pleasant part is that it feels a bit like a massager on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the shaver but this particular one didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>In my estimation, this is a very good, solid shaver, flexible and soft triple heads, and I like the pretty pinky/lilac color!  </li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>It is good for around the legs, but it leaves a rash when doing other areas and does not do underarms.</li>
      <li>My experience is that this shaver leaves a nice, smooth finish, shaves as close any other electric shaver, and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The real death knell for this shaver for me is that it takes many passes of it to shave my legs completely.  </li>
      <li>And I have fair white skin and dark almost-black hair, so I would surely notice any stubble.</li>
      <li>This is the 2nd one I have purchased and not disappointed!!!!  </li>
      <li>I get just as many nicks as if I were to use a razor, but it&#x27;ll do for someone who is too shakey to use a regular razor.</li>
      <li>It works more smoothly compared to other shavers I have owned!</li>
      <li>I am no longer able to shave my legs standing up in the shaver and use it on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>this razor works great especially around the knees and ankles.great deal$10 less than thru remington plus no shipping.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a gentle electric.</li>
      <li>This shaver works very well, not as close as a blade</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>that having a shaver do such a nice job and at the same time not cause any pain is a pleasure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not comparable to a razor on your legs, but gives a much better closer shave than the other style of women&#x27;s shavers.    </li>
      <li>Since my leg hair does not grow in a uniform direction this shaver works much better for me than other types I have owned.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s possible that it just does better on a different hair type than mine, but if you have fine/soft leg hair, skip this razor.</li>
      <li>But when my old Norelco finally died, I discovered that the newer men&#x27;s shavers were modified to work better on very short men&#x27;s face hair and didn&#x27;t work very well on longer leg hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend its purchase.</li>
      <li>But I highly recommend this for women&#x27;s legs.</li>
      <li>, also it&#x27;s so loud the whole house knows you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
      <li>The shave is not any smoother than a normal electric shaver.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine, thin, and light colored, so I don&#x27;t have to shave often, but when I do, I want it to go efficiently.  </li>
      <li>This one is comfortable to use and very quiet but unfortunately only shaves about as close as 1-day-old stubble (after a blade).</li>
      <li>Most electric shavers leave small stubbles.</li>
      <li>but well enough for a quick last minute fix.</li>
      <li>It feels soft on my skin (legs) and has never nicked me.</li>
      <li>This shaver works so much smoother than regular shavers.</li>
      <li>I was sensitive to this shaver in this area.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 61 yrs old.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It recommends not to use it on arm pits, but my wife does any way, she says it hurts a little but not bad.</li>
      <li>If you go over the area a couple times OR push a little harder you will have a very smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>As with other electric shavers does not cut as close as a real razor.</li>
      <li>If you try to shave straight up and down, it will not catch the hairs as well and may miss some ....</li>

<li> Cant believe I waited soo long before buying a rotary shaver.</li>
<li> Be careful around the upper thighs -</li>

<li> Be careful on backs of thighs and inside thighs.</li>

<li> but I wanted to try something new since it can be irritating to my skin</li>
<li> I have VERY sensitive skin and blade shaving is near impossible.</li>
<li> And after about 8 years it finally died - it would no longer hold a charge and the blades were getting dull.  </li>
<li> but seeing these reviews makes me think I just wasted my money.</li>
<li> At least I don&#x27;t cut myself.  </li>
<li> This product is awful - leaves patches and doesn&#x27;t even cut the hair (1/4\\&quot; long, thin) on my legs.</li>
<li> Returning this piece of badly engendered hunk of plastic immediately.</li>
<li> I hate this product I thought I could shave with this</li>
<li> I hate blades.</li>
<li> This is the worst electric razor I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
<li> Also, I&#x27;ve never had razor burn from any razor before, but this one gives me nasty burns on my armpits every time I use it</li>

    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and blade shaving is near impossible. So I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a gentle electric. This one is comfortable to use and very quiet but unfortunately only shaves about as close as 1-day-old stubble (after a blade). My WDF-3000 does better than that but I wanted to try something new since it can be irritating to my skin, also it&#x27;s so loud the whole house knows you&#x27;re shaving. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one especially if you&#x27;re used to using a blade.</li>
    <li> This is the worst electric razor I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but it still nicks my skin.  The directions tell you NOT to use it on your underarms.  I now know why, it will kill you.  I can&#x27;t even shave my thighs with it without getting cuts.  The only place I can use it is from my knees to my ankles.  I definately would not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used men&#x27;s rotary shavers for years as I found they worked much better on my legs than women&#x27;s shavers.  But when my old Norelco finally died, I discovered that the newer men&#x27;s shavers were modified to work better on very short men&#x27;s face hair and didn&#x27;t work very well on longer leg hair.  Then I found this shaver at a local store two years ago and tried it.  It works great - the way the older Norelco men&#x27;s shavers used to work on my legs.  It&#x27;s also lighter weight than men&#x27;s shavers.  It&#x27;s not comparable to a razor on your legs, but gives a much better closer shave than the other style of women&#x27;s shavers.    I&#x27;ve never used it on my underarms as I used a disposable razor for that.  But I highly recommend this for women&#x27;s legs.</li>
    <li> Works very well. As with other electric shavers does not cut as close as a real razor. Since my leg hair does not grow in a uniform direction this shaver works much better for me than other types I have owned. As for underarms and other areas, the instructions specifically state that it is NOT recommended for use other than legs.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a women&#x27;s rotary shaver for some time. I was disillusioned with the foil head shavers.  It gets the job done and I agree with one other review - it&#x27;s meant for your legs only. Be careful around the upper thighs - I was sensitive to this shaver in this area.</li>
    <li> this razor works great especially around the knees and ankles.great deal$10 less than thru remington plus no shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the Remington name and the price.  It is good for around the legs, but it leaves a rash when doing other areas and does not do underarms.</li>
    <li> I am hacked off.  I just got mine in the mail and there in the directions it says legs only no underarms.  What did you think I wanted this for?  Just to use on my legs and then have another razor for the rest.  NOT.  I think you should say up front this is just for legs.  I&#x27;m going to try it anyway but seeing these reviews makes me think I just wasted my money.</li>
    <li> After charging for the recommended time and using the shaver it doesnt even deserve to be called just that. This product is awful - leaves patches and doesn&#x27;t even cut the hair (1/4\\&quot; long, thin) on my legs. Returning this piece of badly engendered hunk of plastic immediately.</li>
    <li> This Remington WR5000 Women&#x27;s Rotary Shaver does not give as smooth and silky shave as advertised! I get just as many nicks as if I were to use a razor, but it&#x27;ll do for someone who is too shakey to use a regular razor. I give it a Good rating.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love it and use it all the time. Often when I use to shave with a regular razor, my legs itched, but they don&#x27;t at all with this shaver!</li>
    <li> I got this because the rotary razors have always seemed to me like they&#x27;d deliver a smoother shave (being multi-directional).  However, after 2-3 months of using it, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s pretty much useless for me.  The shave is not any smoother than a normal electric shaver.  Also, I&#x27;ve never had razor burn from any razor before, but this one gives me nasty burns on my armpits every time I use it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real death knell for this shaver for me is that it takes many passes of it to shave my legs completely.  My hair is fine, thin, and light colored, so I don&#x27;t have to shave often, but when I do, I want it to go efficiently.  The only pleasant part is that it feels a bit like a massager on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend this razor.  It&#x27;s possible that it just does better on a different hair type than mine, but if you have fine/soft leg hair, skip this razor.</li>
    <li> I know from other reviews that the shaver doesn&#x27;t shave as close as some people would like and if I were in my 20&#x27;s, I would probably agree.  However, I am no longer looking for perfection in a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor head moves smoothly without any pinching or pulling.  I have too many scars, scratches, imperfections, etc. that having a shaver do such a nice job and at the same time not cause any pain is a pleasure.</li>
    <li> Cant believe I waited soo long before buying a rotary shaver. Leaves skin silky smooth. Be careful on backs of thighs and inside thighs. Blades can nip ya!! Giving a couple as gifts for christmas. :~}</li>
    <li> my wife enjoys it. Quality product. it is great to see her with no cuts on her legs. It recommends not to use it on arm pits, but my wife does any way, she says it hurts a little but not bad.</li>
    <li> I love the shaver but this particular one didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to shave close enough.  Even when it said to give it 3 times I still did not feel that it did give a close shave.  It does shave but not close enough.</li>
    <li> Listen this is the best shaver for women that you can get. This Remington gets the close stubble and does a good job on the underarms as well.I don&#x60;t have to shave but every 2 weeks and my legs are silky.This is a good shaver for women or men.</li>
    <li> I hate this product I thought I could shave with this but it actually cut my skin whenever I try to use it . I tried returning it but no luck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the description that they give is totally overrated</li>
    <li> Excellent item, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> When I got the product it wasn&#x27;t even in the same package! It was in a smashed in the package. I am going to take a risk and hope it works, but for the money I paid for this. I would except better packaging.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the best ladies shaver ever made. I also ordered two more as Christmas gifts. I highly recommend its purchase.</li>
    <li> This shaver works so much smoother than regular shavers. It works more smoothly compared to other shavers I have owned!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shaver. It feels soft on my skin (legs) and has never nicked me. I use it in gentle, circular motions, and it leaves my skin nice and smooth. I saw another reviewer say that it only shaved as close as 1 day stubble (and that worried me a bit, but I wanted a triple head shaver so I took a chance), but that has NOT been my experience with this shaver. My experience is that this shaver leaves a nice, smooth finish, shaves as close any other electric shaver, and is exactly what I was looking for. Does it shave as close as a razor blade? No, but no electric shaver does. It definitely leaves NO stubble on my legs. And I have fair white skin and dark almost-black hair, so I would surely notice any stubble. I think the key is to shave in circular motions. If you try to shave straight up and down, it will not catch the hairs as well and may miss some .... maybe that is what happened with the other reviewer, I don&#x27;t know.  But I use this in circular motions all over my legs, and it leaves a smooth, stubble-free finish. Now, when I use a razor, I can go 2 days without having to shave my legs because my razor actually seems to lift the hair up and cut the hair just below the surface. But with any electric shaver, this one included, I can only go 1 day until I shave again because it simply cuts at surface level.  In my estimation, this is a very good, solid shaver, flexible and soft triple heads, and I like the pretty pinky/lilac color!  :)</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well, not as close as a blade but well enough for a quick last minute fix. At least I don&#x27;t cut myself.  Haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet.</li>
    <li> Have used this for two or three years now and it is very dependable and does a good job.   Update:Still using this for even more years.  Still runs perfectly.</li>
    <li> Amazing shaver. I am no longer able to shave my legs standing up in the shaver and use it on my dry skin. No irritation or rashes.  Quick to use and love it being cordless.</li>
    <li> Has only one setting and so it is a little rough on the skin going so fast.</li>
    <li> I had this one before.  And after about 8 years it finally died - it would no longer hold a charge and the blades were getting dull.  I love, love, love this shaver. I have had many electric shavers over the years. I&#x27;m 61 yrs old.  And this is the closest shave you will ever get with an electric shaver. Most electric shavers leave small stubbles. If you go over the area a couple times OR push a little harder you will have a very smooth shave.  I hate blades. I am always knicking myself and bleeding. I can shave my legs with this and watch TV. It&#x27;s not the best for the under arms. But Love it for legs!!!!  The only shaver I will EVER buy!!!! Worth the money. This is the 2nd one I have purchased and not disappointed!!!!  Buy it - you will love it, too.</li>
    <li> When my wife told me she wanted an electric shaver because she could no longer see her leg hairs in the shower I asked her what she wanted. She wasn&#x27;t sure so I let her use my Norelco shaver as a test. She decided it worked fine, so I ordered this Remington WR5000. She says she is happy with it.</li>
