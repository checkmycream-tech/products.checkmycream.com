### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent addition to a post work out shake</li>
      <li>It mixes best with my protein shakes.  </li>
      <li>I have no idea how they captured that taste so perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This used to be a very good product.  </li>
      <li>I start taking this product five times a day for build bone strengt and is working very good</li>
      <li>I would add it to my protein shakes which used to work great.  </li>
      <li>great price.</li>
      <li>I find the best way is just to spoon it in my mouth and then chase it with a lot of water maker sure not to breathe in the powder.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff if you can handle the medicinal taste.</li>
      <li>each use, for about 30-45 minutes after taking ~4g of this product, my body feels like a furnace from the inside - in a good way.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read lots of good things about it, so</li>
      <li>very pleased with the experience</li>
      <li>It makes you warm</li>
      <li>I was able to overcome my bench-press plateau that has been haunting me for over a year.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing...</li>
      <li>but if you&#x27;ve ever used powdered BCAAs before you should be able to adjust to this no problem.  </li>
      <li>have more energy.</li>
      <li>Great price - super fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>It does not taste good, and really if you are taking leucine then you should know why you are taking it and understand that its not Gatorade powder.</li>
      <li>contains 2.5g of leucine (the distribution in the popular brand of whey by ON), or you can just take 2.5 of straight leucine and get most of the benefits.</li>
      <li>Asking for tasty, easy to mix leucine is like asking for flammable water.</li>
      <li>shipped very quickly.</li>
      <li>I love this product, first time buyer of this supplement.</li>
      <li>Leucine is an amino acid with a unique chemical structure.</li>
      <li>It is very fine, does not mix really at all.</li>
      <li>got what i ordered and it was mailed to me quick-</li>
      <li>I have been doing some light lifting for about 1-1/2 years (started at age 35), initially losing 40 lbs then basically just kind of coasting.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He said this would give the ideal window for the body to break down the leucine without having to isolate it first</li>
      <li>it cannot convert to glucose, but still provokes an insulin response, making it useful for atheletes trying to stay in ketosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But is cost effective way to take in extra nutrition instead of BCAAS.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re interested in this product</li>
      <li>I give this product 5 stars due to nice pricing of product and quantitity of product.</li>
      <li>I like the way my workouts and body are responding to pure Leucine supplementing which is why I am ordering another tub.  </li>
      <li>This product seems pure the test of which it does not mix well in water.</li>
      <li>I am finishing this one and ready to buy another I combine with shakes</li>
      <li>Very hydrophobic.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide any real noticeable benefit.</li>
      <li>When you digest them,  your body breaks them down into all their individual amino acid components, releasing them in your bloodstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leucine has been shown to be the most important amino acid in rebuilding muscle.</li>
      <li>Like all true leucine it won&#x27;t mix in water or any fluid for that matter.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re serious enough to pay for and take a supplement, you should know that most of what goes into a product to help it taste good actually takes away from the desired result.</li>
      <li>I am comparing to the exact same brand and noticed that even the one that I purchased from this seller came in an older packaging.</li>
      <li>Now it is a heavy dense white powder and it makes my protein shake taste like a mouth full of chalk no matter how much water I hadd.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Another benefit of leucine is that unlike many other amino acids (including the other two bcaas)</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s probably not due to this product alone, but in the six weeks I have been taking it (4g, 3x weekly)</li>
      <li>Great price, bad taste</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t really sure how to switch to building muscle, especially starting out somewhat late in life, so I researched from different sources and changed my routine and nutrition around some.  </li>
      <li>One trainer/nutritionist suggested taking pure leucine with only water immediately following lifting, and wait ~1 hour before taking any other type of recovery meal.  </li>

<li> but seriously tastes like burning rubber smells.</li>
<li> Have tried just dumping a scoop or two in my mouth and taking a swig of somthing but its almost worse then just mixing and drinking.  </li>
<li> Helped with recovery combine it usually with a flavored amino as the leucine alone is disgusting.</li>
<li> /&gt;And this is, without a doubt, the worst tasting product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
<li> Terrible.  </li>
<li> Tastes terrible.</li>

    <li> I have been doing some light lifting for about 1-1/2 years (started at age 35), initially losing 40 lbs then basically just kind of coasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t really sure how to switch to building muscle, especially starting out somewhat late in life, so I researched from different sources and changed my routine and nutrition around some.  One trainer/nutritionist suggested taking pure leucine with only water immediately following lifting, and wait ~1 hour before taking any other type of recovery meal.  He said this would give the ideal window for the body to break down the leucine without having to isolate it first (some additional researched I did supported his advice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With each use, for about 30-45 minutes after taking ~4g of this product, my body feels like a furnace from the inside - in a good way.  Also, it&#x27;s probably not due to this product alone, but in the six weeks I have been taking it (4g, 3x weekly) I was able to overcome my bench-press plateau that has been haunting me for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing... I don&#x27;t understand people rating a supplement down based on taste.  If you&#x27;re serious enough to pay for and take a supplement, you should know that most of what goes into a product to help it taste good actually takes away from the desired result.</li>
    <li> Its leucine. It does what its meant to do, activate protein synthesis. It is very fine, does not mix really at all. Very hydrophobic.  I find the best way is just to spoon it in my mouth and then chase it with a lot of water maker sure not to breathe in the powder.  It does not taste good, and really if you are taking leucine then you should know why you are taking it and understand that its not Gatorade powder. Its an essential amino acid that your body needs, and this brand and company has it.  The leucine is leucine...you are getting what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well but seriously tastes like burning rubber smells. I have no idea how they captured that taste so perfectly.  Its rough.  Have tried just dumping a scoop or two in my mouth and taking a swig of somthing but its almost worse then just mixing and drinking.  Like all true leucine it won&#x27;t mix in water or any fluid for that matter.  So you  just have to man up if you want to take it.</li>
    <li> This product seems pure the test of which it does not mix well in water. The purer this amino is the harder it is to mix in water</li>
    <li> I use this to supplement my post workout and noticed that this specific batch did not appear as the newer batch that I have previously received from a different seller. It did not have the &amp;#34;glimmer&amp;#34; to the powder as the other batch had. I am comparing to the exact same brand and noticed that even the one that I purchased from this seller came in an older packaging. It did not mix as well either. Overall it gets the job done but I am dissatisfied with the variance as compared to the other one that I had previously purchased.</li>
    <li> I bought the product based on the one review that existed for it at the time. My shake contains 3-4 oz of coconut milk, 12 oz of water, a scoop of vanilla flavored protein powder, and a scoop (5 g) of leucine. The taste of the leucine overpowers everything else. Had I known about the taste, I would have bought pills instead.</li>
    <li> I start taking this product five times a day for build bone strengt and is working very good a feel a diference on my body and&lt;br /&gt;I have more energy. I am finishing this one and ready to buy another I combine with shakes and I hardly feel the taste.</li>
    <li> Helped with recovery combine it usually with a flavored amino as the leucine alone is disgusting. Mixes well if you let it settle for a bit.</li>
    <li> I take 3 svgs. a day: 1 in post w/o shake, 1 in a mid-afternoon shake and 1 with my ZMA before going to bed.  It mixes best with my protein shakes.  It takes some getting used to but if you&#x27;ve ever used powdered BCAAs before you should be able to adjust to this no problem.  I like the way my workouts and body are responding to pure Leucine supplementing which is why I am ordering another tub.  I would recommend this to anyone who trains with weights.</li>
    <li> I love this product, first time buyer of this supplement. It makes you warm cause your body stay in a anti-catabolic state.</li>
    <li> Good stuff if you can handle the medicinal taste.</li>
    <li> Tastes terrible. Does not blend by shaker cup, must use blender. Doesn&#x27;t provide any real noticeable benefit. But is cost effective way to take in extra nutrition instead of BCAAS.</li>
    <li> This used to be a very good product.  I guess the formula has changed for some reason.  It used to be an almost weightless and airy cystal like powder with no flavor.  I would add it to my protein shakes which used to work great.  Now it is a heavy dense white powder and it makes my protein shake taste like a mouth full of chalk no matter how much water I hadd.  Terrible.  I will try another brand next time.</li>
    <li> In the 15 or so years of working out I&#x27;d estimate that I&#x27;ve taken over 100 different supplements - proteins, creatines, pre-workout stuff, post-workout etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is, without a doubt, the worst tasting product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I&#x27;ve read lots of good things about it, so I&#x27;m going to tough it off for awhile, but it is rough....</li>
    <li> this product is a key component in my strength and conditioning protocol. great price. shipped very quickly. very pleased with the experience</li>
    <li> got what i ordered and it was mailed to me quick-i have no complaints -im totally satisfie</li>
    <li> Great price, bad taste</li>
    <li> Great price - super fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Leucine is an amino acid with a unique chemical structure. Its physical properties include being hydrophobic (doesn&#x27;t mix with water) and bitter. Asking for tasty, easy to mix leucine is like asking for flammable water. If you alter the chemical structure, you don&#x27;t have the same chemical anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in this product you probably know the importance of protein intake for exercise recovery and muscle growth. Proteins are bundles of amino acids. When you digest them,  your body breaks them down into all their individual amino acid components, releasing them in your bloodstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leucine has been shown to be the most important amino acid in rebuilding muscle. Essentially, you can take 32g of whey contains 2.5g of leucine (the distribution in the popular brand of whey by ON), or you can just take 2.5 of straight leucine and get most of the benefits. Think of it as a protein replacement with an extremely low calorie value and an even lower price (90 cents for the serving of whey vs. 17 cents for the 2.5g of leucine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to put on weight you are probably getting plenty of protein in your food, but if you are on a strict calorie deficit or even fasting, leucine could be the key to maintaining muscle mass with a marginal contribution to your calorie intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit of leucine is that unlike many other amino acids (including the other two bcaas) it cannot convert to glucose, but still provokes an insulin response, making it useful for atheletes trying to stay in ketosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget about mixing this with water or a shake though. Just scoop it onto your tongue and wash it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serious Nutrition&#x27;s product is cheap and the real deal, as evidenced by its hydrophobia and disgusting taste. This container will last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars due to nice pricing of product and quantitity of product. Also due to the fact it&#x27;s difficult to find pure lucine. Excellent addition to a post work out shake</li>
