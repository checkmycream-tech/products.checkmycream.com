      <li>if amazing!</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this from a perfume seller and loved it</li>
      <li>It arrived this week and I&#x27;m just delighted to add it to my perfume collection.</li>

      <li>\\&quot;Exceptional-</li>
      <li>This is not at all an exceptional fragrance on my list.</li>
      <li>Most of all I&#x27;m really happy with Amazon.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this perfume!</li>
      <li>I had rec&#x27;d a sample of this from another vendor and fell in love with the scent!</li>
      <li>I love this parfum!</li>

      <li>It arrived in perfect timing just for me to go back to school and have everyone smell just how exceptional I am!</li>
      <li>It tastes ok, but the robust flavor you love is replaced by synthetic filler.  </li>

      <li>I love this perfume</li>
      <li>im glad</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t received this item yet but surely will not accept the shipment.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>again i love it</li>
      <li>I love this perfume</li>
      <li>and she enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>Nice light</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>When I saw it on Amazon for a much better price, I thought I hit the jackpot.  </li>
      <li>I love it, it smells just like the sample it isn&#x27;t strong at all.</li>
      <li>For me I love that it&#x27;s so strong</li>
      <li>The seller shipped it very quickly as well.</li>
      <li>My girl loves it smells great last awhile to without being over the top.</li>
      <li>the only thing I can say about this scent is beautiful....</li>
      <li>I love the fresh floral scent, that is light yet lingering.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy this fragrance.</li>
      <li>Smells cheap.</li>
      <li>I received this for free with a purchase from fragrancenet.com.</li>
      <li>It is light with a freshable note.</li>
      <li>Combine that with free shipping and you truly have a bargain.</li>
      <li>because this fragrance is exceptional...light fresh exotic scent...</li>
      <li>It has a clean finish that seems to linger in the air after you are gone.</li>
      <li>In an age of perfume-haters, it&#x27;s great to have a scent that is more like a young fresh Spring breeze, and not a heavy fragrance that makes people sneeze.</li>
      <li>Fragrance is awesome and very subtle and sexy.</li>
      <li>Love the perfume,but it doesn&#x27;t stay all that long once it&#x27;s sprayed,but nice scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and light, not over powering.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing to find a new scent that is this exciting.</li>
      <li>The perfume is pretty strong with a woodsy citrus scent.</li>
      <li>It is romantic, soft and clean and just smells good!</li>
      <li>Loved the scent it was just didn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite perfume</li>
      <li>As for me it&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
      <li>This product has a wonderful smell, but it doesnt last long.</li>
      <li>I like Pleasures, on occasion, but I never have liked Aspen or any similar scents (Cool Water, etc...).  </li>
      <li>I bought this parfume for m&#x27;y wifie ,found as expected ,awesome smell and last all day</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price you pay.</li>
      <li>High quality perfume at fantastic prices...</li>
      <li>Will be back for more.</li>
      <li>,that&#x27;s exactly how this smells and feels like.</li>
      <li>So unfortunately I do not recommend this company.</li>
      <li>Delicious scent smells soft and delicate fragance very romantic&lt;br /&gt;is prefect size for the price , come on time too</li>
      <li>I think this could work with certain chemistries, however.  </li>
      <li>So I think the rich feminine scent is really alluring in general.</li>
      <li>When I first opened it, I actually liked the slight spicy scent, but within seconds my eyes began to burn and I stepped back quickly and capped it.  </li>
      <li>but I think people who like floral or just really feminine scents will like it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much else to say.  </li>
      <li>I tried it and was not to much of a fan but the smell lasted ALL day and began to grow on my.</li>
      <li>Very Pricey but the scent</li>
      <li>I found it too sharp and overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>i love this fragrance i tried finding it other places</li>
      <li>Smells soft and good and the smell last for a long time.</li>
      <li>One of my new fav&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>It is not easy to find and like all scents it is better to try a sample before buying anything.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s time for a new bottle or two.  </li>
      <li>Despite the strong scent I find that it doesnt last for long (~4 hours)</li>
      <li>but i could only find it at first on fragrance.net.</li>
      <li>I alternate this one with another fragrance I use for everyday use because it is not overpowering but light enough and still manages to linger for a full 8 to 12 hours.</li>
      <li>like I did, any off name brand stores or sellers will not do-and you will find that it&#x27;s either too strong or just plain stinky.</li>
      <li>This is a slightly sweet, slightly spicy scent that is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Subtle but lovely.</li>
      <li>It smells overly artificial, cheap, has no depth, and is way too strong.  </li>
      <li>It has a very sharp, citrusy,heavy smell,like it contains alcohol mixed with cheap  fragrance without the essential perfume oils.</li>
      <li>a little on the minty/masculine side (the Aspen) and very sharp/crisp floral (the Pleasures).  </li>

    <li> My girl loves it smells great last awhile to without being over the top.</li>
    <li> Very Pricey but the scent if amazing! Stronger than the sample too!!!</li>
    <li> This is a slightly sweet, slightly spicy scent that is not overpowering. It has a clean finish that seems to linger in the air after you are gone. The spray is slightly stronger than the sample, so be careful how much you use. It is well worth the price you pay.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. This is my second time buying this. I alternate this one with another fragrance I use for everyday use because it is not overpowering but light enough and still manages to linger for a full 8 to 12 hours.</li>
    <li> A lasting scent. If you start your morning off with it, it&#x27;s definitely still around in the evening. Beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh floral scent, that is light yet lingering.</li>
    <li> Amazon writes this item is eligible for Prime shipping. After my order was shipped that sent an email with expected delivery date after 10 days. I called their customer service and all they could say is \\&quot;Sorry\\&quot;. I had ordered this to gift it to someone and the reason I pay for Prime membership is to get a 2 day service. I haven&#x27;t received this item yet but surely will not accept the shipment.</li>
    <li> After receiving a sample of this perfume, I ordered some for myself.  It seems somewhat stronger than the sample but still acceptable.  Don&#x27;t over-apply or you will be detected from a long way.</li>
    <li> the only thing I can say about this scent is beautiful....lovely scent!this is a scent I will purchase when I am needing more.</li>
    <li> I got the item but th bottle of the perfume was broken, so I sent an email with pictures saying what happened. They told me to send the item back. I did it, and was informed that the refund is in process. It&#x27;s been almost two months since then and I still haven&#x27;t received the money back. So unfortunately I do not recommend this company.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing to find a new scent that is this exciting. While scent can be subjective, or vary from men and women&#x27;s affinities, this one has gotten rave notices from all in my proximity, who notice the subtle divine traces around them. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of a younger and lighter, and a pinch spicier version of Estee Lauder&#x27;s White Linen. In an age of perfume-haters, it&#x27;s great to have a scent that is more like a young fresh Spring breeze, and not a heavy fragrance that makes people sneeze.</li>
    <li> I had rec&#x27;d a sample of this from another vendor and fell in love with the scent! It makes you feel &amp;#34;exceptional&amp;#34;. However, the best price was here at Amazon. It arrived this week and I&#x27;m just delighted to add it to my perfume collection. It is romantic, soft and clean and just smells good! One of my new fav&#x27;s! Mollyd847/Chicago</li>
    <li> the perfume itself was excellent but the price was horrible I can get it at 1 800 perfumes for 30 some dollars</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this from a perfume seller and loved it and my husband also loved it!  It was sort of expensive so I decided to wait to buy it.  When I saw it on Amazon for a much better price, I thought I hit the jackpot.  Unfortunately, I cannot return it and it is awful!  It smells nothing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s time for a new bottle or two.  Love this parfum!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this parfume for m&#x27;y wifie ,found as expected ,awesome smell and last all day</li>
    <li> Love it.  I don&#x27;t have much else to say.  Fragrance is awesome and very subtle and sexy. Will be back for more.</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance, it smells wonderful, and I get noticed a lot when I wear this fragrance. Exceptional has a light flowery scent that&#x27;s not too strong. The scent lasts awhile, which makes it a good bargain, and I get lots of compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s a great everyday fragrance, and the price wasn&#x27;t bad. I recommend the seller, because they got this delivered to me very quickly, and in great condition. I&#x27;m very happy with the seller, and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Most of all I&#x27;m really happy with Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan here.  I found it too sharp and overwhelming.  It has incredible staying power, which is great if you like it!  To my nose, it&#x27;s as though Aspen and Pleasures were mixed... a little on the minty/masculine side (the Aspen) and very sharp/crisp floral (the Pleasures).  I like Pleasures, on occasion, but I never have liked Aspen or any similar scents (Cool Water, etc...).  I think this could work with certain chemistries, however.  I&#x27;m going to have my mom try it to test that theory, since perfumes smell completely different on her, than I.  I&#x27;ll update afterwards!</li>
    <li> I received a sampler vial of Exceptional from Fragrance.net with another perfume I ordered.  When I first opened it, I actually liked the slight spicy scent, but within seconds my eyes began to burn and I stepped back quickly and capped it.  That is my reaction when I find myself allergic/sensitive to a perfume.  So if you are, be careful. I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It arrived in perfect timing just for me to go back to school and have everyone smell just how exceptional I am! hehe. I love it, it smells just like the sample it isn&#x27;t strong at all. It&#x27;s perfect. If you want to have the legitimate product where it smells wonderful I suggest ordering from an &amp;#34;actual perfume store&amp;#34; like I did, any off name brand stores or sellers will not do-and you will find that it&#x27;s either too strong or just plain stinky. Thank youuuuuuuuuuuuu! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Very good production!</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this fragrance. Subtle but lovely.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Exceptional perfume from the FragranceNet with the purchase of Covet perfume.This is not at all an exceptional fragrance on my list.It has a very sharp, citrusy,heavy smell,like it contains alcohol mixed with cheap  fragrance without the essential perfume oils.This perfume evaporates almost instantly,it has zero staying power.Someone below mentioned that this perfume reminds him of the $5 knock offs one buys from  the Family Dollar,that&#x27;s exactly how this smells and feels like.It reminds me of an unisex type cologne rather than $54 perfume.A total rip off for this price in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this parfum! The scent is fresh and light, not over powering. Great price as well! It, however, does not stay all day.</li>
    <li> Smells soft and good and the smell last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume!</li>
    <li> Love the perfume,but it doesn&#x27;t stay all that long once it&#x27;s sprayed,but nice scent.</li>
    <li> Overall, not a very pleasant scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like complete crap, but that being said, I find this fragrance to be quite cloying.  It smells overly artificial, cheap, has no depth, and is way too strong.  I&#x27;d liken it to the diet or low-fat version of your favorite food.  It tastes ok, but the robust flavor you love is replaced by synthetic filler.  It doesn&#x27;t offend me on fist smell, but wearing or being around this stuff for any extended period of time would make me sick.  Definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Delicious scent smells soft and delicate fragance very romantic&lt;br /&gt;is prefect size for the price , come on time too</li>
    <li> This product has a wonderful smell, but it doesnt last long. Too expensive for something that will only smell for a few hours.</li>
    <li> Not good. Smells cheap.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this perfume in the mail. I tried it and was not to much of a fan but the smell lasted ALL day and began to grow on my. I love this perfume and I receive a lot of complements on it. The seller shipped it very quickly as well. I will be ordering this again. This is my new favorite perfume</li>
    <li> I received this for free with a purchase from fragrancenet.com. The perfume is pretty strong with a woodsy citrus scent. Despite the strong scent I find that it doesnt last for long (~4 hours)</li>
    <li> High quality perfume at fantastic prices...I was honestly shocked at the price of this perfume.  Combine that with free shipping and you truly have a bargain.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Exceptional-because You Are\\&quot; is very good for summer. It is light with a freshable note. Good for a facultative going out.&lt;br /&gt;Only, it is dificult to order from [...] for people who are not US citizens. And should wait to long to get it.</li>
    <li> 5stars because this fragrance is exceptional...light fresh exotic scent...love!!! Absolutely love it..will purchase again..and recommend to others..again i love it</li>
    <li> i love this fragrance i tried finding it other places but i could only find it at first on fragrance.net. im glad i found it amazon for a cheaper price and its the same product</li>
    <li> so based on her tastes.. I have to give it 5 stars. It is not easy to find and like all scents it is better to try a sample before buying anything. In this case however, my mom received a sample from FragranceNet when I sent her another present and she enjoyed it. It is hard to rate anything that is scent related due to tastes... but if you like it give it a five star and if you don&#x27;t EXPLAIN why YOU don&#x27;t like it but don&#x27;t give it a one rating because you bought it and don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> DAUGHTER LOVES THIS FRAGRANCE</li>
    <li> Nice light fragrance- I like that it blends well with my body scent and does not stay perfumy.</li>
    <li> Loved the scent it was just didn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I only like floral scents, like I use the blue bottle Curve and Tommy Girl and freshwater orchard Secret body mist. But my sister who likes fruity and some sugary scents like vanilla also loves it. So I think the rich feminine scent is really alluring in general. For me I love that it&#x27;s so strong I only need a little to last all day. I&#x27;m not sure what other perfumes smell like this but I think people who like floral or just really feminine scents will like it. As for me it&#x27;s my new favorite and I can&#x27;t wait to put it on as I like to save it for special days and occasions because it&#x27;s kinda expensive. Although I could definitely wear it everyday!</li>
