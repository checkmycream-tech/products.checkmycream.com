      <li>Smells great too :)</li>
      <li>and I really love it!</li>
      <li>first off, it smells amazing!!!</li>
      <li>This bottle lasts longer since I don&#x27;t need to use as much to be effective.  </li>
      <li>It smells great and appears to be rich when squirted out, but it did nothing for my frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I love the sleeker the butter conditioner.</li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>nothing fancy, just a simple, great conditioner!  </li>
      <li>love the smell</li>
      <li>these are wonderful for dry, processed hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m Strong.</li>
      <li>But I do like it, it leaves my hair nice and soft and washes out nicely.</li>
      <li>this conditioner left my hair smooth and smelled great</li>
      <li>Puts so much moisture back into my hair and it smells awesome!</li>
      <li>oddly and amazingly, it is one of the best shampoo/conditioners i have used, next to Honey</li>
      <li>sweet and nutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>This stuff is interesting, it has a sweet smell, and it is pink.</li>
      <li>I normally only use salon products, so am happy to find something reasonably priced that actually works.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for-</li>
      <li>Its good for every few days!</li>
      <li>Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Packaging wise, when I receives the item, it was individually sealed in it&#x27;s own bag so that in the event that there was leakage (there was not), it would not get the other items in the package wet.  </li>
      <li>i have very wavy hair, kinda curly.</li>
      <li>If you have damaged hair, this will help make it appear much smoother.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell of this shampoo.</li>

      <li>i definitely would not recommend for really super thick or super curly hair though, as the conditioner is very light, like i said.</li>
      <li>Have been using the shampoo &amp; conditioner for a few days now, &amp; love the way my hair feels &amp; looks.</li>
      <li>Its a decent conditioner, but not something I would recommend if you need to use conditioner everyday, because this stuff is pretty intense.</li>
      <li>I thought given the word Butter is used in the name that this conditioner would be lush.</li>
      <li>this conditioner felt so light and didn&#x27;t mix through my hair well, as it has the dry hay-like feel when wet, however,  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a big relief since I have that type of luck normally.</li>
      <li>it is a very creamy conditioner too, and if i brush it through and rinse, even in the shower wet, my hair feels softer and even thicker somehow.</li>
      <li>It was dry and frizzy and now its soft.</li>

<li> It was dry and frizzy and now its soft.</li>
<li> This shampoo/conditioner combo has left my hair sleek and soft without looking greasy or weighed down.</li>
<li> This conditioner was no different than any other regular one.</li>
<li> my hair always feels incredibly dry yet moisturizing formulas always make my hair feel just as dry as it did before.</li>
<li> so if you have wavy/curly hair that feels really dry, maybe this will work well for you too.</li>
<li> I cut my hair short recently and was having trouble with it fluffing it up.</li>
<li> It does not live up to its name.</li>
<li> when dried, my hair is thicker and my wavy/curly hair is extra wavy/curly.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t use hair dye or other harsh products on it.</li>
<li> It tends to weigh my hair down a little since I have wavy/curly hair.</li>
<li> Having daughters with very long and thick hair, we go through A LOT of conditioner in our house.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner, along with the matching shampoo, for a few months now</li>
<li> Would not recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t need heavy duty moisture and or oil</li>
<li> Yes, I can buy conditioner at the dollar store, but it is always poor, thin quality and does not hydrate hair like it should.  </li>
<li> Some conditioners are difficult to get out and leave your hair feeling oily, but not this one!</li>
<li> This conditioner was terrible on my african-american 4a/b hair.</li>

    <li> this conditioner left my hair smooth and smelled great</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great!</li>
    <li> Yummm so wonderful! I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo. It does a good job of moisturizing but it does have silicones in it. It tends to weigh my hair down a little since I have wavy/curly hair. So I limit the use to once a week and use something else in between times. If you have damaged hair, this will help make it appear much smoother.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried in my life! Puts so much moisture back into my hair and it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I cut my hair short recently and was having trouble with it fluffing it up. This shampoo/conditioner combo has left my hair sleek and soft without looking greasy or weighed down. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> Smells good and got it for about a dollar! No complaints! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Have been using the shampoo &amp; conditioner for a few days now, &amp; love the way my hair feels &amp; looks. Smells great too :) I normally only use salon products, so am happy to find something reasonably priced that actually works.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I thought given the word Butter is used in the name that this conditioner would be lush. It isn&#x27;t. It smells great and appears to be rich when squirted out, but it did nothing for my frizzy hair. My hair isn&#x27;t damaged either. I don&#x27;t use hair dye or other harsh products on it. This conditioner was no different than any other regular one. It does not live up to its name.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for- nothing fancy, just a simple, great conditioner!  Also, smells great.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> mmmmm.  love the smell</li>
    <li> these are wonderful for dry, processed hair. Would not recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t need heavy duty moisture and or oil</li>
    <li> first off, it smells amazing!!! sweet and nutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;secondly, i initially doubted this would work well in my hair, but i bought it for the smell. oddly and amazingly, it is one of the best shampoo/conditioners i have used, next to Honey I&#x27;m Strong. i have very wavy hair, kinda curly. my hair always feels incredibly dry yet moisturizing formulas always make my hair feel just as dry as it did before. i have realized the problem is my hair is fragile and needs something smoothing and protective. this conditioner felt so light and didn&#x27;t mix through my hair well, as it has the dry hay-like feel when wet, however,  it is a very creamy conditioner too, and if i brush it through and rinse, even in the shower wet, my hair feels softer and even thicker somehow. when dried, my hair is thicker and my wavy/curly hair is extra wavy/curly. i quite dont understand why, but it works so well. so if you have wavy/curly hair that feels really dry, maybe this will work well for you too. i love it. i definitely would not recommend for really super thick or super curly hair though, as the conditioner is very light, like i said.</li>
    <li> This conditioner was terrible on my african-american 4a/b hair. It worked the same as if I just put water on my hair. It provided no slip for detangling. I prefer their Hydralicious Reconditioning Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use lots and lots of products. This one works well. It softens and smells great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is interesting, it has a sweet smell, and it is pink. I was expecting it to be brown because of the bottle, but its a pinkish color. Its a decent conditioner, but not something I would recommend if you need to use conditioner everyday, because this stuff is pretty intense. Its good for every few days! But I do like it, it leaves my hair nice and soft and washes out nicely. Some conditioners are difficult to get out and leave your hair feeling oily, but not this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner, along with the matching shampoo, for a few months now and I really love it! My hair is softer, fuller, and looks great! The smell is great too!</li>
    <li> I love the sleeker the butter conditioner. It made my hair real managable. It was dry and frizzy and now its soft.</li>
    <li> Ordered this conditioner as a subscribe and save item with a coupon.  Was a great value at the price!  Having daughters with very long and thick hair, we go through A LOT of conditioner in our house.  This brand never disappoints.  Yes, I can buy conditioner at the dollar store, but it is always poor, thin quality and does not hydrate hair like it should.  This does!  This bottle lasts longer since I don&#x27;t need to use as much to be effective.  Smells great and does not leave a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging wise, when I receives the item, it was individually sealed in it&#x27;s own bag so that in the event that there was leakage (there was not), it would not get the other items in the package wet.  That&#x27;s a big relief since I have that type of luck normally.</li>
