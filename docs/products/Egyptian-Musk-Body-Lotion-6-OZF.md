      <li>Not a strong smell, NICE.</li>
      <li>I was really tickled to have found this, Musk lotion of any kind is hard to find.  </li>
      <li>I found this at a local store for a better price - wanted to post a review here for other considering it.&lt;br /&gt;This was like a flashback to incense shops of old, like a blend of many different woodsy smells that make up a musk - this one is not flowery though for just a few minutes after application</li>
      <li>It smells exactly like the body oil and the smell lasts all day long.</li>
      <li>It smells like if it were old, spoiled.</li>
      <li>The lotion is not thick enough, and it barely has the scent.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Egyptian musk. There are so many varieties. This lotion is so lightly scented, that you can still pile your musk oil on top and it&#x27;s never too loud. I wish it was stronger in scent.</li>
    <li> I like the scent; it doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I would like but the fragrance is nice and better than the oils I have purchased on line.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the scent. It&#x27;s dull. Lotion is ok.</li>
    <li> This product was lightly scented and goes on smooth. I greatly enjoyed the texture and smell. Egyptian musk is my favorite!</li>
    <li> This literally had no scent. I was not happy with this purchase as it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Egyptian musk, but this is a cheaply made product.  The lotion is not thick enough, and it barely has the scent.  Philosophy has a product called Grace that has a similar smell, but is a much better product.</li>

I heard good things about this and have had excellent experience with Tom&#x27;s Incense in the past, but this is absolutely not something I want or will ever use.  Waste of money and the gamble.  It says delicately fragrant... which should read unscented.  Smells like packaging cardboard really.  I don&#x27;t like it at all.  I have also never rated a 1 star before but buyer beware!  Skip this product.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance that is light and lasting. The lotion soaks inti the skin quickly without leaving a film or oily sensation in the hands.</li>
    <li> This lotion is nice however; the scent is very light.  I was hoping for a stronger scent because I love the Egyptian Musk scent!</li>
    <li> It starts smell like Egyptian musk, then it changes to a plastic smell. I was hoping it would have been a higher end lotion that smells like the real Egyptian musk oil that I have</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I used this product. It smells like if it were old, spoiled. I will not ever buy this again. Sorry</li>
    <li> wonderful scent and creamy moisturizer!</li>

    <li> Not a strong smell, NICE.</li>
    <li> If you like the smell of Egyptian Musk, you will love this lotion. It smells exactly like the body oil and the smell lasts all day long. It goes on smoothly and feels great on your skin. I am now a forever user if this lotion.</li>
    <li> I found this at a local store for a better price - wanted to post a review here for other considering it.&lt;br /&gt;This was like a flashback to incense shops of old, like a blend of many different woodsy smells that make up a musk - this one is not flowery though for just a few minutes after application I noted the musk scent that you first smell kind of disappears and a different fragrance takes over....and then the musk returns, I was worried for a moment but was very and pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the label that said to &amp;#34;shake before use&amp;#34; and some reviews here may have experienced settling separation vs an outdated product, not sure - all I know is mine was not runny, and is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is not greasy, rubs in, covers well.  The fragrance is indeed a non-flowery form of musk, to me like a Jovan product.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a sandalwood scent (no, this is not like a sandlewood) and happened across this product and am very happy with my choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price point is excellent, lotion quality is superior, scent is just great, not overpowering.  I will use this as a scented moisturizer in my aftershave rotation of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to either men or ladies, and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> In looking over the reviews there seems to be an issue with whether or not this has a fragrance. I assure you the one I got did and my wife loves it. It was a Christmas gift and it had the Egyptian Musk fragrance we both expected. It was very noticeable, but not overwhelming. Maybe the other bottles were old? Maybe a different brand? My bottle was the same one pictured and it was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> The body lotion is thick and smooth.  The fragrance is light. I really like the way it smooths on my skin.</li>
    <li> The lotion is too runny and very little scent.</li>
    <li> When I use this lotion and layer with the oil I get so many compliments on how nice I smell</li>
    <li> smells wonderful and not greasy at all</li>
    <li> Smells clean and fresh. Very true to scent.</li>
    <li> Great smelling lotion.</li>
    <li> Fragrance a little off, but the lotion is nice.</li>
