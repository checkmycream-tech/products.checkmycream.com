      <li>and my skin is looking better after a month</li>

      <li>I love this mask.</li>

      <li>After washing it off my skin is very smooth and silky and feels very fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>My favorite product has been the FPEM, as the results were absolutely tremendous.  </li>
      <li>Everyone always says &amp;#34;you have such great skin&amp;#34</li>
      <li>The best thing to do is buy a green papaya and make your won mask.</li>
      <li>Sooooooooooooooooo not as good as the original formula many years back.  </li>
      <li>Nice and smooth and works like the old product used to.</li>
      <li>My sense is that the elimination of the parabins is good, but it seems like they may have cut back on the papaya</li>
      <li>It does feel nice, like any amount of pampering always does, but I miss the old Zia.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t expect to look 18 again, but I&#x27;d like to have as good a skin tone as possible for a 51-year-old ex-sunbather</li>
      <li>It makes your skin look so fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It is a super exfoliant, and it also gives me a bit of a glow.  </li>
      <li>and it came quickly with out a glitch.</li>
      <li>The Zia line as a whole is quite strong, and the Papaya Enzyme Mask is my particular favorite.</li>
      <li>i think that for the price &amp; size this mask is definatly worth trying for those who like to take care of skin.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin fresh and glowing.</li>
      <li>Above expectation my second time purchase will continue with this product happy to have found it</li>
      <li>Many of my friends starting using it as well &amp; really like it as well!</li>
      <li>So, I first apply the Zia Ultimate Exfoliate (3 drops/squirts on my moistened face) then apply the mask on top of that.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t swear it&#x27;s actually doing anything, but it does make me feel better</li>
      <li>I credit it as the single most powerful contributor to the quality of my skin at 50.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m starting to get sun spots (OK, they&#x27;re really age spots</li>
      <li>All of these prior reviews sound like they were for the old formula of the Papaya Enzyme Mask, which was indeed fantastic and did wonders for my skin.</li>
      <li>exfoliates gently.</li>
      <li>It does nothing, absolutely nothing for my skin anymore.</li>
      <li>Zia wrote a book a while back call something like, &#x27;Fabulous at Fifty&#x27;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m much less enthusiastic about the new packaging, which is a tube rather than a jar.</li>
      <li>Do NOT waste your money and Zia: PLEASE GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION.</li>
      <li>I have to agree with another customer, and the salesman at my local organic store, and say that the new owners of Zia have failed to produce the amazing papaya enzyme facial that I once loved.  </li>
      <li>I happen to have an old jar of Zia Fresh Papaya Enzyme Mask that I forgot in the back of a drawer, so I pulled it out to compare to the jar I just received, after being extremely underwhelmed by my longtime favorite.  </li>
      <li>If I miss a few and use something else i can tell and cant wait to get more of my mask.</li>
      <li>Used the new product once, will be throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zia</li>
      <li>Those of us who are fans should probably bombard the new company (Hain Celestial Group) with emails about this.  </li>
      <li>I had used this product in the past and it was more like a serum.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve purchased most of my products off amazon, and i usually review the product after use.  </li>
      <li>use this mask about once a week, putting it on my freshly washed face and letting it dry for 15 minutes or so.  </li>
      <li>The previous SUPERIOR formulation which I believe was changed a few yaers ago was on par with a peel from a facialist.</li>
      <li>extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This was the ONLY papaya enzyme peel on the mass market that worked wonders and really made a change in my skin.</li>
      <li>they had a gold mine with the old formula.  </li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s nothing for than a heavy coating of \\&quot;green\\&quot; carrot oil which KILLS the exfoliating enzymes and necessitates a double cleanse and tone session just to get the \\&quot;mask\\&quot; off- a bottle of hydrogen peroxide for 1.50 does more than this joke.</li>
      <li>I put warm water on a washcloth with a small amount of mask and go over my face then get another dab with my finger and spread it on, with long enough to brush my teeth and then take it off with the washcloth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>ZIA PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD RECIPE!</li>
      <li>20 minutes later, rinse and WOW.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve used other zia products, i really like the anti aging body wash and the bamboo scrub.  </li>
      <li>The first ingredient used to be green papaya concentrate, now it is sunflower oil, then water.  </li>
      <li>This new stuff, although the ingredients are exactly the same, is weak.  </li>

<li> This stuff&#x27;s not cheap, and I don&#x27;t really get the switch - especially as several other Zia products are still packaged in the round jars.  </li>
<li> My skin after application now looks dull and dry instead of clear and glowing.  </li>
<li> This is my go-to product when I&#x27;ve been on a plane or other dry environment, or if I have a date or an event to go to.</li>
<li> Like some of the other comments, I have been a devoted user and fan of ZIA products for 20+ years.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, when she sold the company not only did the packaging change from simple to plain ugly on everything except the Ultimate&#x27;s line, but some of the products changed and I think the FPEM was the most changed.  </li>
<li> It went from being the most valuable discovery, to completely worthless to me.</li>
<li> hands down...</li>
<li> It used to work miracles, and in fact remove those little white hard bumps from under my eyes.  </li>
<li> Others did mention that there is less papaya in the formula, and I believe they are correct.  </li>
<li> The first time I used it there was some very faint tingling, but I haven&#x27;t had any other reaction to it at all.  </li>
<li> Hate the texture, no longer smells the same, is a horibble color and most importanatly, is a massive disappointment from a performance perspective.  </li>
<li> The formulation today is sticky and the heavy oils kill the enzymes.</li>
<li> Contains nothing harsh.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts, but my skin&#x27;s tone is uneven</li>
<li> it tingles when i first put it on..not a painful tingle, but</li>
<li> Not very effective alone.  </li>
<li> small</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been on a campaign to improve my skin lately, and bought this product as part of my battle plan.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t like the thick paste of this mask as well.</li>
<li> I am so angry that ZIA changed the formula of this once rivalled product.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad b/c</li>
<li> This stinks!</li>
<li> I would hate for the company to ever stop making it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had used this product in the past and it was more like a serum. I don&#x27;t like the thick paste of this mask as well.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love my Zia Fresh Papaya Enzyme Mask. I have been using it for maybe 20 years. Everyone always says &amp;#34;you have such great skin&amp;#34; I attribute most of that to this product. I wash my face with it every day. If I miss a few and use something else i can tell and cant wait to get more of my mask. I put warm water on a washcloth with a small amount of mask and go over my face then get another dab with my finger and spread it on, with long enough to brush my teeth and then take it off with the washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;We just moved to another state and I could not find my Zia so I ordered it here and it came quickly with out a glitch. Thank you!</li>
    <li> All of these prior reviews sound like they were for the old formula of the Papaya Enzyme Mask, which was indeed fantastic and did wonders for my skin. I don&#x27;t know why the formula was changed, but it seems like whatever made this mask work has been removed! It does nothing, absolutely nothing for my skin anymore. What a shame. It went from being the most valuable discovery, to completely worthless to me. What happened? The texture, the color, scent and ingredients..all altered. I&#x27;m so bummed!     I was told by the woman at the health food store where I&#x27;ve purchased it, that it&#x27;s no longer bouncing off the shelves the way it used to, and the reason is that it simply isn&#x27;t what it used to be.</li>
    <li> Zia products rock.....hands down...</li>
    <li> The Zia line as a whole is quite strong, and the Papaya Enzyme Mask is my particular favorite. It is a super exfoliant, and it also gives me a bit of a glow.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.    I&#x27;m much less enthusiastic about the new packaging, which is a tube rather than a jar. It&#x27;s much harder to control the amount you&#x27;re using, and I think I&#x27;m just going to have to cut open the tube when I come to the end of it.  This stuff&#x27;s not cheap, and I don&#x27;t really get the switch - especially as several other Zia products are still packaged in the round jars.  In any case, this is a very satisfying beauty product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on a campaign to improve my skin lately, and bought this product as part of my battle plan.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with breakouts, but my skin&#x27;s tone is uneven and I&#x27;m starting to get sun spots (OK, they&#x27;re really age spots but they&#x27;re the sun&#x27;s fault) that I&#x27;d like to de-emphasize.  I don&#x27;t expect to look 18 again, but I&#x27;d like to have as good a skin tone as possible for a 51-year-old ex-sunbather so I can actually go outside without makeup and not frighten small children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mask about once a week, putting it on my freshly washed face and letting it dry for 15 minutes or so.  I like that it&#x27;s colorless so I can sit in the living room and watch TV while it dries without looking like a member of the Munsters.  The first time I used it there was some very faint tingling, but I haven&#x27;t had any other reaction to it at all.  After washing it off my skin is very smooth and silky and feels very fresh and clean.  I can&#x27;t swear it&#x27;s actually doing anything, but it does make me feel better and my skin is looking better after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this, but I&#x27;d suggest using a small amount the first time until you know how your skin will react to it.</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in my skin texture. I would buy this product again and recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with another customer, and the salesman at my local organic store, and say that the new owners of Zia have failed to produce the amazing papaya enzyme facial that I once loved.  It used to work miracles, and in fact remove those little white hard bumps from under my eyes.  This new stuff, although the ingredients are exactly the same, is weak.  It does feel nice, like any amount of pampering always does, but I miss the old Zia.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other comments, I have been a devoted user and fan of ZIA products for 20+ years.  My favorite product has been the FPEM, as the results were absolutely tremendous.  I credit it as the single most powerful contributor to the quality of my skin at 50.  Zia wrote a book a while back call something like, &#x27;Fabulous at Fifty&#x27;...can&#x27;t quite remember.  I followed her recommendations and can&#x27;t be happier with my skin now that I&#x27;m there.  Unfortunately, when she sold the company not only did the packaging change from simple to plain ugly on everything except the Ultimate&#x27;s line, but some of the products changed and I think the FPEM was the most changed.  Hate the texture, no longer smells the same, is a horibble color and most importanatly, is a massive disappointment from a performance perspective.  My sense is that the elimination of the parabins is good, but it seems like they may have cut back on the papaya which is what gave it its magical power.  I keep using it on the basis that some amount of it is better than none, but what a massive disappointment.  You can boost the power of it with the Ultimate Exfoliant liquid, although it has been minimized as well.  Those of us who are fans should probably bombard the new company (Hain Celestial Group) with emails about this.  That&#x27;s my next email!  Join me if you agree.</li>
    <li> The previous SUPERIOR formulation which I believe was changed a few yaers ago was on par with a peel from a facialist. The formulation today is sticky and the heavy oils kill the enzymes. The best thing to do is buy a green papaya and make your won mask. Sad that Zia sold her company and it mostly went down hill. Even Smoother is still what it was but without the dual process of the peel it won&#x27;t resurface skin. Do NOT waste your money and Zia: PLEASE GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION.</li>
    <li> Used for years great stuff !!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a skin care product junkie.  i&#x27;ve purchased most of my products off amazon, and i usually review the product after use.  so as for this mask, i love it!  it tingles when i first put it on..not a painful tingle, but like a light fizzy cleaning tingle (if that makes any sense :P)  also, there is no scent, which i like b/c i like products that are natural, and added scents are just a waste in my opinion since they dont improve the product at all.  i&#x27;ve used other zia products, i really like the anti aging body wash and the bamboo scrub.  i think that for the price &amp; size this mask is definatly worth trying for those who like to take care of skin.  my face felt softer &amp; my skin looked brighter after one use.  i love using it with my weleda moisturizer it gives a nice dewy look.</li>
    <li> Zia papaya mask smells good and makes your face feel smooth and nice. It works without hardening on your face and it rinses off easily. It also helps to keep brown spots off your hands. Contains nothing harsh. Very good price and easily purchased.</li>
    <li> I have used this poduct for many years (15+) &amp; love it!  I apply in the morning &amp; leave it on while getting my coffee, etc. then wash&lt;br /&gt;my face.  I would hate for the company to ever stop making it.  Many of my friends starting using it as well &amp; really like it as well!</li>
    <li> This is my go-to product when I&#x27;ve been on a plane or other dry environment, or if I have a date or an event to go to. It pushes moisture into my face. It minimizes fine lines and gives my skin a healthy glow. The texture is wonderful, and it smells like honey! Great results in 10 or 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve used this product for years!</li>
    <li> Sooooooooooooooooo not as good as the original formula many years back.  Not even the same texture.  It&#x27;s too bad b/c they had a gold mine with the old formula.  I won&#x27;t bother to buy again.</li>
    <li> I am so angry that ZIA changed the formula of this once rivalled product. This was the ONLY papaya enzyme peel on the mass market that worked wonders and really made a change in my skin. Now it&#x27;s nothing for than a heavy coating of \\&quot;green\\&quot; carrot oil which KILLS the exfoliating enzymes and necessitates a double cleanse and tone session just to get the \\&quot;mask\\&quot; off- a bottle of hydrogen peroxide for 1.50 does more than this joke. ZIA PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD RECIPE! This stinks!</li>
    <li> I happen to have an old jar of Zia Fresh Papaya Enzyme Mask that I forgot in the back of a drawer, so I pulled it out to compare to the jar I just received, after being extremely underwhelmed by my longtime favorite.  Used the new product once, will be throwing it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zia removed parabens, which is a good thing, but must they coat my skin with beeswax like a grocery apple?  And there are lots more chemicals.  The first ingredient used to be green papaya concentrate, now it is sunflower oil, then water.  The product used to smell like honey and fruit.  Now it smells like furniture polish.  My skin after application now looks dull and dry instead of clear and glowing.  I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this product</li>
    <li> I love this mask. I have been using it for years. It makes your skin look so fresh and clean. It works better than department store brands and at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Used this for years.  extremely sensitive skin but this works like a charm and no redness.  You&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Superior quality lovely results! Above expectation my second time purchase will continue with this product happy to have found it</li>
    <li> an essential for me...  exfoliates gently. couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> Not very effective alone.  Others did mention that there is less papaya in the formula, and I believe they are correct.  So, I first apply the Zia Ultimate Exfoliate (3 drops/squirts on my moistened face) then apply the mask on top of that.  20 minutes later, rinse and WOW.  Nice and smooth and works like the old product used to.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Keeps my skin fresh and glowing. I&#x27;ve used it for years and when my local health store quite carrying it I was greatful to find it on amazon.</li>
