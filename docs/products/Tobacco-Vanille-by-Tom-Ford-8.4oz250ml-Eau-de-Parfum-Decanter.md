      <li>Best fragrance on the market</li>
      <li>If you like to smell good purchase this now!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The seller was great, timely, all that.  </li>
      <li>sure you pair this perfume with a sexy-sophisticated outfit and a great attitude; because the combination will make you feel irresistible!</li>
      <li>It is an excellent winter fragrance and it lasts most of the day on my skin.</li>
      <li>i absolutely love this one, it smells great !</li>
      <li>But gave to my dad and he loved it so.. all about your taste.</li>
      <li>But my husband took one sniff and loved it.</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>The tobacco is not over powering and the vanilla creates an amazing blend.</li>
      <li>The scent evolves the longer you wear it, and leaves a nice lingering aroma.</li>
      <li>I replacement was sent to me courteously and promptly.</li>
      <li>Good that they have the more affordable sample sized bottles</li>
      <li>I go out on a limb, do some research and found something I thought would be nice online...</li>
      <li>This the not the sophisticated scent I imagined it would be.  </li>
      <li>I spray some of the Tobac Vanille and then a couple of hits of Guerlain Cuir Beluga which is more vanilla</li>
      <li>Glad to find this product.</li>
      <li>I thought it was better for men than women.</li>
      <li>Scent was ok.  </li>
      <li>Got a lot of compliments but not my favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not AXE, that&#x27;s for sure, but it&#x27;s not O. Spice either.  </li>
      <li>With all this said, the smell is very unique.  </li>
      <li>The strongest scent I get is Benzoin -- a tree resin with a very sweet honey/vanilla/firewood smell.  </li>
      <li>Second, the smell is incredible.  </li>
      <li>Shipment was just fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even made my own from pure ingredients a number of times.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong at first but doesn&#x27;t hang around.  </li>
      <li>Amazing, durable scent which gently transforms throughout the day and one spray is all you need.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance just to chill in and smell right after my shower....</li>
      <li>Very masculine, I think I love it more than my wife does though.  </li>
      <li>It certainly IS pricey but the scent has incredible lasting power.  </li>
      <li>It is now my special date perfume.</li>
      <li>It is something that harkens to an older tradition of tobacco and leather which clearly forms a great combination.  </li>
      <li>Only take a tab and people will comment on how good you smell.</li>
      <li>I will be saving for a full sized bottle of this.</li>
      <li>Soon will purchase it full  size</li>
      <li>If your goal is to impress women this is definitely a good look and definitely something you want to smell like</li>
      <li>That combination is great, though I like to mix it with my regular cologne to enhance the uniqueness of the scent and make it more of a daily wear smell.  </li>
      <li>(My normal cologne is more of a lime, grapefruit, bergamont, cedar smell).  </li>
      <li>True this sample is very very tiny, but the scent is amazing.</li>
      <li>Tobacco fragrance was much too strong- not a smoker soo....would not recommend .</li>
      <li>and we both loved the shops where loose tobacco was for sale.</li>
      <li>Well worth it...</li>
      <li>, JUST RIGHT.</li>
      <li>I will most likely buy the full bottle.</li>
      <li>After about half an hour of this stuff on my chest I was hooked for good.</li>
      <li>Very much like the smell in a pricey tobacco shop.</li>
      <li>but wish it had more lasting power...</li>
      <li>This is my first cologne from the tom ford line</li>
      <li>Upon first impression of Tobacco Vanille hitting my nose I had my doubts...</li>
      <li>and I wanted to try it first</li>
      <li>It is exactly like you would expect.</li>
      <li>i wasnt expecting such a strong tabacco smell</li>
      <li>When I got my Tobacco Vanille in the mail after a week of very patient waiting, I doubted it was the real thing</li>
      <li>They work very well together.</li>
      <li>I can tell the difference between the real thing and fakes.  </li>
      <li>It lasts and is very sensual.  </li>
      <li>I love benzoin by itself, but it&#x27;s a pain to work with due to its viscosity.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very basic sweet vanilla.  </li>
      <li>It is a sweet vanilla scent that will drive the opposite sex insane.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>If I could afford the full size bottle I would definitely buy.</li>
      <li>It actually lasted for a couple weeks and the smell is tremendous.  </li>
      <li>Product was decent</li>
      <li>This price is ok but the same size 8.4 oz on Tom Ford&#x27;s site or Neiman Marcus is the same $525.</li>
      <li>i dont know how it compares to the normal size bottle as I have never tried it.</li>
      <li>Neither is terribly long lasting on me but the TV is better.</li>
      <li>Very sharp but warm at the same time.  </li>
      <li>but with a very soft suede sense to it.</li>
      <li>just need the pipe to make the illusion complete!</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this cologne out first before selling a kidney to buy a bigger bottle of it</li>
      <li>I order a lot of things through amazon and this is the first time I had a purchase that ended with no resolution and total dissatisfaction.</li>
      <li>Once I got it, it was clear Tom Ford delivers.  </li>
      <li>Who knows if this is actually the real fragrance, but I&#x27;m not feeling it.  </li>
      <li>I bought this mainly out of curiosity because of the mixed reviews.  </li>
      <li>Also I tend to absorb perfumes to the point that few of them last very long or are very strong.</li>
      <li>a little worried, good but, not amazing.</li>
      <li>This one may look sketchy with the gold labeling, but it is definitely high quality true Tom Ford cologne (at least the stuff I got).  </li>
      <li>Next, I get the very unmistakable scent of a humidor at your local pipe tobacco/cigar shop.  </li>
      <li>The seller promptly responded to an initial inquiry concerning one of the vials I ordered being less than full.</li>
      <li>To me the sillage is about average although I note that many people consider it heavy.</li>
      <li>Initially there is a vanilla smell but it rapidly disappears and you are left with a very soft tobacco smell.</li>
      <li>Worth the price for a small quantity.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my second teeny bottle of this stuff.  I love it!  I wish the bigger bottle weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> This sensual perfume will have all the men and women in the office sniffing you. LOL&lt;br /&gt;Just a little dab around the wrist and neck go along way. It is a sweet vanilla scent that will drive the opposite sex insane.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you pair this perfume with a sexy-sophisticated outfit and a great attitude; because the combination will make you feel irresistible!</li>
    <li> I concur with the other reviewers comments on the scent of this product. It is something that harkens to an older tradition of tobacco and leather which clearly forms a great combination.  The seller promptly responded to an initial inquiry concerning one of the vials I ordered being less than full. I replacement was sent to me courteously and promptly. I would definitely do business with them again.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance on the market</li>
    <li> Product was decent but I would probably never buy a bottle because of the price. Good scent for those heavy leather jacket, cold days. Got a lot of compliments but not my favorite cologne. I received my sample promptly though.</li>
    <li> This smells just like any other oil you could buy on the street and it doesn&#x27;t last. When I tried to return it I got no response from the seller even after sending a message to them through Amazon. It&#x27;s a rip off and I can&#x27;t believe Amazon has a relationship with a vendor like this. I order a lot of things through amazon and this is the first time I had a purchase that ended with no resolution and total dissatisfaction. Not a good look Amazon.</li>
    <li> Who knows if this is actually the real fragrance, but I&#x27;m not feeling it.  Reminds me of something my grandfather would wear - like that Copenhagan crap.</li>
    <li> If you like to smell good purchase this now! Worth the price for a small quantity. Well worth it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Only take a tab and people will comment on how good you smell. Purchased as a gift and friend loved it!!</li>
    <li> So, I had no cologne, perfume, whatever you want to call it, and I got sick and irritated from previous brands I have tried. I go out on a limb, do some research and found something I thought would be nice online...but the price tag did scare me off for a little while. When I got my Tobacco Vanille in the mail after a week of very patient waiting, I doubted it was the real thing so before I opened the plastic, I researched and learned there were no copies being sold. Upon first impression of Tobacco Vanille hitting my nose I had my doubts... a little worried, good but, not amazing. After about half an hour of this stuff on my chest I was hooked for good. I absolutely LOVE this stuff! Amazing, durable scent which gently transforms throughout the day and one spray is all you need. Not overwhelming, not irritating, JUST RIGHT. MMMMMMMMMMMM How DID you do it, Mr. Ford?</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance just to chill in and smell right after my shower....just need the pipe to make the illusion complete!</li>
    <li> I get compliments from this cologne....but wish it had more lasting power...I would have given it a five then. i dont know how it compares to the normal size bottle as I have never tried it.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on a recommendation from a perfume website.  Don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;cigary&amp;#34; smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great, timely, all that.  It&#x27;s the product I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this product. I will be saving for a full sized bottle of this. Good that they have the more affordable sample sized bottles</li>
    <li> This is my first cologne from the tom ford line and I wanted to try it first so I got this sample and I was amazed. The tobacco is not over powering and the vanilla creates an amazing blend. It is an excellent winter fragrance and it lasts most of the day on my skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this cologne out first before selling a kidney to buy a bigger bottle of it so I bought this tiny amount.  It actually lasted for a couple weeks and the smell is tremendous.  Very masculine, I think I love it more than my wife does though.  Wearing it at work, I received numerous compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Tobacco fragrance was much too strong- not a smoker soo....would not recommend . Tom Ford has several other fragrances which I prefer.- was looking for something &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; but this was not it</li>
    <li> I love this.  It lasts and is very sensual.  I wish I could afford a larger bottle.  It is now my special date perfume.</li>
    <li> This price is ok but the same size 8.4 oz on Tom Ford&#x27;s site or Neiman Marcus is the same $525. Your not saving any money at all</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly out of curiosity because of the mixed reviews.  I am a bit of a cologne connoisseur.  I pride myself on my ability to reverse-smell the various essential oils and resins used to create colognes and perfumes.  I&#x27;ve even made my own from pure ingredients a number of times.  I can tell the difference between the real thing and fakes.  This one may look sketchy with the gold labeling, but it is definitely high quality true Tom Ford cologne (at least the stuff I got).  Second, the smell is incredible.  I was dubious that they could capture the rich tobacco smell or if they did, that the vanilla would throw it off or be fake smelling.  Once I got it, it was clear Tom Ford delivers.  It is exactly like you would expect. The strongest scent I get is Benzoin -- a tree resin with a very sweet honey/vanilla/firewood smell.  I love benzoin by itself, but it&#x27;s a pain to work with due to its viscosity.  Next, I get the very unmistakable scent of a humidor at your local pipe tobacco/cigar shop.  Very sharp but warm at the same time.  Additionally, I get slight hints of clove,cedar, and nutmeg.  That combination is great, though I like to mix it with my regular cologne to enhance the uniqueness of the scent and make it more of a daily wear smell.  (My normal cologne is more of a lime, grapefruit, bergamont, cedar smell).  It certainly IS pricey but the scent has incredible lasting power.  One spray literally lasted all day, and I can&#x27;t say that about most of my other colognes -- even expensive ones.  With all this said, the smell is very unique.  If you don&#x27;t like the smell of tobacco and vanilla... don&#x27;t buy it.  I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.  If it is too expensive, you don&#x27;t like the smell of cigars or tobacco or vanilla... then you probably won&#x27;t like this.  Duh.  Don&#x27;t be stupid people.  As for some people describing it as an &amp;#34;old person smell,&amp;#34; I disagree.  It&#x27;s not AXE, that&#x27;s for sure, but it&#x27;s not O. Spice either.  If I had to describe it, I&#x27;d say its a little Indiana Jones, especially when mixed with a little leather and lime.</li>
    <li> This the not the sophisticated scent I imagined it would be.  It&#x27;s a very basic sweet vanilla.  I cannot smell any tobacco notes at all.  Overall I&#x27;m not impressed, and would certainly never spend the nearly $300 on a full size bottle.  A lot of hype that the fragrance never delivers on.</li>
    <li> i wasnt expecting such a strong tabacco smell it smells like a tabacco shop.  I know i dont want to smell like tabacco.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this one, it smells great ! I can&#x27;t get enough of it. Soon will purchase it full  size</li>
    <li> True this sample is very very tiny, but the scent is amazing. I will most likely buy the full bottle.</li>
    <li> I just thought I would try it out so I purchased a small sample. Initially there is a vanilla smell but it rapidly disappears and you are left with a very soft tobacco smell. Very much like the smell in a pricey tobacco shop. I thought it was better for men than women. But my husband took one sniff and loved it. He used to smoke a pipe and we both loved the shops where loose tobacco was for sale. I spray some of the Tobac Vanille and then a couple of hits of Guerlain Cuir Beluga which is more vanilla but with a very soft suede sense to it. They work very well together. The best of both worlds. Neither is terribly long lasting on me but the TV is better. To me the sillage is about average although I note that many people consider it heavy. Maybe I use it a little sparingly. Also I tend to absorb perfumes to the point that few of them last very long or are very strong.</li>
    <li> I read in my people magazine that some Superstar wears this scent and I thought I should buy a sample for my husband who is quite picky on what scents he wears. He LOVES it! It is a very small bottle for the price but all one needs is a couple of drops. I plan on buying him the regular sized bottle for his birthday!</li>
    <li> I did not receive the Tom Ford vanilla tobacco mini cologne. I only received the Tom Ford Noir Mini cologne.</li>
    <li> I did not like this sent. But gave to my dad and he loved it so.. all about your taste.</li>
    <li> Scent was ok.  I actually got it for my car.  It&#x27;s very strong at first but doesn&#x27;t hang around.  The bottle does not look like the picture, maybe because I got a really small one.  Shipment was just fine.</li>
    <li> The smell of this cologne is bar none. The scent evolves the longer you wear it, and leaves a nice lingering aroma. Buy this before you purchase the bigger bottle for $200 at department stores.</li>
    <li> If I could afford the full size bottle I would definitely buy. I&#x27;ve been through over a hundred colognes in my life and none quite like this. If your goal is to impress women this is definitely a good look and definitely something you want to smell like</li>
