      <li>Works perfectly!</li>
      <li>Great product and rapid turn around by company!!  </li>
      <li>While it lasted, it was great: smells great, works like a charm.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how wonderful it is to not look like I haven&#x27;t even bothered to get clean (which I am...</li>
      <li>I bought this product and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!  </li>
      <li>love the product, works great.</li>
      <li>so you can go one or two more days without washing it!</li>
      <li>I used this product on days 3 and 4 and it looks amazing.  </li>
      <li>Gets the oil out, gives volume, leaves a nice smell, and no powder residue.    </li>
      <li>So, I really liked this product for the 3 times that I was able to use it before it ran out.</li>
      <li>and i bout it over a month ago and still going strong!</li>
      <li>However, after I used it, I could hear more air escaping.      </li>
      <li>(I attribute the residue to the defective packaging-less air and more powder in the bottle.)     </li>
      <li>The Rockaholic Dry Shampoo IS AWESOME!!</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>a strong odor (</li>
      <li>It smelled strong of a lemon/citrus scent.</li>
      <li>However, you&#x27;ll be lucky if you can use it more than once.</li>
      <li>This product smelled great and was simple to apply (shoot &amp; spray!).</li>
      <li>lightly citrus)&lt;br</li>
      <li>He said that they will be able to provide me with a one time complimentary replacement that should arrive in 7-10 business days.      </li>
      <li>I returned it to Beauty Brands where I originally purchased it thinking the can had a leak.  </li>
      <li>This would be a great item to take with you on a road trip, camping, or any where you might not be able to wash your hair for a few days.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it three times, and I will be lucky to get another use out of it.</li>
      <li>I have been a loyal PSSSST user but decided to try this based on reviews I heard.</li>
      <li>The second day there was more residue, but I was able to brush it out while blowdrying.  </li>
      <li>so quickly-</li>
      <li>The were great and exchanged it for a new bottle, but the same thing happened.  </li>
      <li>Its by far the best and its less pricey.</li>
      <li>then its worth it.</li>
      <li>They sent me a complimentary product and instead of keeping it in my bathroom I kept it in my bedroom and it has lasted longer this time.</li>
      <li>It does work and is effective -- but like EVERYONE else here, after only TWO uses, it was gone.  </li>
      <li>I received a reply from them right away,  telling me there was defect in the bottle- that it has been corrected</li>
      <li>Although I love TIGI products and I also loved this one, but it is waaaay to much money for only about 4 applications and as another reviewer wrote, \\&quot;it gives you the impression that there is still product left in the bottle when it empty\\</li>
      <li>and they are shipping me out a new bottle for free.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work as fast as I hoped, it took about an hour or so for the product to absorb the oil and my hair to look un-greasy but it DID WORK!</li>
      <li>The first day I used it, there was no powdery residue.  </li>
      <li>i love it and will definitely continue to use it and suggest it to my friends!</li>
      <li>I hope the packaging gets fixed on this product, as it is such an amazing time saver.  </li>
      <li>They sent me complimentary two new bottles.</li>
      <li>This product does absolutely everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I was not over doing it by any means because my hairstylist did mention it runs out fast.</li>
      <li>It was really irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, I called the TIGI head office there is a number on the back of the bottle and told them about my problem and they let me know the old bottles were defected and promptly sent me two free replacement bottles three days after I called them!</li>
      <li>I can normally go 2 days without washing my hair.  </li>
      <li>I am in love with the idea of dry shampoo and as this is the first one that my hairstylist showed me, I bought it for $18.95 but was alarmed when I found that I&#x27;ve only gotten 4 uses out of the can and have only had it one week.</li>
      <li>I contacted the company and they said they were having some problems as it was a new product.</li>
      <li>TIGI - if you&#x27;re reading your reviews you should already know about this and pull the product until it&#x27;s fixed!</li>
      <li>After reading reviews about the defective packaging, I checked my bottle and sure enough it was half gone by the time I got home.  </li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m not able to get a shower on a regular basis now, I can&#x27;t wash my hair very easily.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny or soft like i have heard some people complain about on here</li>
      <li>They blamed it on a chemical \\&quot;reacting\\&quot; when it shouldn&#x27;t be, and said the problem is fixed.</li>
      <li>After having my can for over 6 months &amp; several uses, it still works like brand new!</li>
      <li>Similar to previous reviews, this product completely rocks the few times you are able to use it before it runs out.</li>

<li> but it does do what it is supposed to do, which is dry up the oil</li>
<li> recommend Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
<li> As in the other reviews, I used the bottle three or four times, and then all of the sudden it was empty.</li>
<li> I must have purchased this after they fixed the defective cans because i use mine at least twice a week</li>
<li> but like everyone else, i got one use and then the can was empty.  </li>
<li> I am curious to hear what the reviewer says that contacted the company.</li>
<li> I literally had mine a week and used it maybe 3x before it was empty.</li>
<li> Total waste of money.</li>
<li> But it&#x27;s a total waste of money with that life span.</li>
<li> BIG WASTE.</li>
<li> I used it three times and went to use it this morning and the bottle was empty.  </li>
<li> I use this probably twice a week, sparingly, and after five uses, both bottles were empty.</li>
<li> I used it 3 times and then went to use it and the bottle was empty.</li>
<li> I bought this product for half price, because my bestfriend has a cosmetology license.</li>
<li> what a waste.</li>
<li> I agree that this product is a waste of money.  </li>
<li> I am disabled and broke my leg.  </li>
<li> So, needless to say, I will be trying another brand although I LOVE Rockaholic products :(</li>
<li> *Unable to edit stars....would only give it 1-2stars at the moment</li>

<li> Finally, I complained to the company.</li>
<li> &quot;  Very frustrating.  </li>
<li> This was a horrible waste of $20.00!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The cans are definitely defective.  I went through three returns and finally did a test on my fourth can.  After you&#x27;ve sprayed it, if you put your ear to the nozzle, you can hear the air leaking.  There&#x27;s no way to stop it (I&#x27;ve tried everything).  Until the maker of the cans can fix it then do not buy.  You will be wasting your money.  TIGI - if you&#x27;re reading your reviews you should already know about this and pull the product until it&#x27;s fixed!</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely everything it&#x27;s supposed to do. Gets the oil out, gives volume, leaves a nice smell, and no powder residue.    However, you&#x27;ll be lucky if you can use it more than once. Put the bottle up to your ear after you spray it.  I bought one of these, it ran out after two uses. I bought another one. It ran out after one use. Finally, I complained to the company. They blamed it on a chemical \\&quot;reacting\\&quot; when it shouldn&#x27;t be, and said the problem is fixed. They sent me complimentary two new bottles. Well, this time I used them and put em up to my ear. I realized it wasn&#x27;t a \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; problem, but the bottle leaks air and product. I use this probably twice a week, sparingly, and after five uses, both bottles were empty. Don&#x27;t buy this product! It works well, but you&#x27;re paying twenty bucks for two uses. what a waste.</li>
    <li> I only used the product once, went to use it again and it is gone!  There is still some product in the bottle, but it won&#x27;t dispense.  This was a horrible waste of $20.00!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I am in love with the idea of dry shampoo and as this is the first one that my hairstylist showed me, I bought it for $18.95 but was alarmed when I found that I&#x27;ve only gotten 4 uses out of the can and have only had it one week. So, needless to say, I will be trying another brand although I LOVE Rockaholic products :(</li>
    <li> I used it 3 times and then went to use it and the bottle was empty.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal PSSSST user but decided to try this based on reviews I heard. It does work and is effective -- but like EVERYONE else here, after only TWO uses, it was gone.  At close to twenty bucks a can, this stuff should have lasted a lot longer.  Total waste of money. Back to PSSSST at $5.99 a can for me.</li>
    <li> So, I really liked this product for the 3 times that I was able to use it before it ran out. I wasn&#x27;t overdoing it - but all I got was 3 uses. While it lasted, it was great: smells great, works like a charm. But it&#x27;s a total waste of money with that life span.</li>
    <li> The Rockaholic Dry Shampoo IS AWESOME!! Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought two bottles and both seemed to run out out of nowhere, I called the TIGI head office there is a number on the back of the bottle and told them about my problem and they let me know the old bottles were defected and promptly sent me two free replacement bottles three days after I called them! Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I must have purchased this after they fixed the defective cans because i use mine at least twice a week and i bout it over a month ago and still going strong! it doesn&#x27;t make your hair shiny or soft like i have heard some people complain about on here but it does do what it is supposed to do, which is dry up the oil so you can go one or two more days without washing it! i love it and will definitely continue to use it and suggest it to my friends!</li>
    <li> love the product, works great. but like everyone else, i got one use and then the can was empty.  i have tried another brand with the same result.</li>
    <li> As in the other reviews, I used the bottle three or four times, and then all of the sudden it was empty. I knew I could not have used it  up so quickly- so I contacted Tigi.  I received a reply from them right away,  telling me there was defect in the bottle- that it has been corrected and they are shipping me out a new bottle for free. So long as this one lasts longer than the last one then I like it!</li>
    <li> I had the same problem as everybody else. My stylist did as well. I used the product 2 times and it evaporated. I contacted the company and they said they were having some problems as it was a new product. They sent me a complimentary product and instead of keeping it in my bathroom I kept it in my bedroom and it has lasted longer this time. I&#x27;m not sure if the steam from the shower had something to do with it?</li>
    <li> Although I love TIGI products and I also loved this one, but it is waaaay to much money for only about 4 applications and as another reviewer wrote, \\&quot;it gives you the impression that there is still product left in the bottle when it empty\\&quot;  Very frustrating.  If they lowered the price to about $3 a can then its worth it.</li>
    <li> I am disabled and broke my leg.  Since I&#x27;m not able to get a shower on a regular basis now, I can&#x27;t wash my hair very easily.  I bought this product and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!  I can&#x27;t tell you how wonderful it is to not look like I haven&#x27;t even bothered to get clean (which I am... there is such a thing as bed baths).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Convenience&lt;br /&gt;Not a strong odor (lightly citrus)&lt;br /&gt;No white powdery look&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I give it 4 stars.  If it were about $5 cheaper, it would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Bought it from the salon for $22. The hairsylist demo&#x27;d it on my hair there then I got to use it once at home before it ran out. I was not over doing it by any means because my hairstylist did mention it runs out fast. BIG WASTE. so disappointed because it does work well but I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for half price, because my bestfriend has a cosmetology license. It smelled strong of a lemon/citrus scent. I didnt like that. The bottle felt sturdy. But like everyone else, I only used it 3 times, and somehow the bottle leaked! and 3/4 of the bottle was gone! It was really irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Batiste dry shampoo. Its by far the best and its less pricey.</li>
    <li> Great product and rapid turn around by company!!  But, product must have leaked out of container or only gives you the feeling of something being in the can. Emailed the company so will let you know how it&#x27;s handled.    ***Unable to edit stars....would only give it 1-2stars at the moment</li>
    <li> Similar to previous reviews, this product completely rocks the few times you are able to use it before it runs out. I literally had mine a week and used it maybe 3x before it was empty. What a bummer! I am curious to hear what the reviewer says that contacted the company.</li>
    <li> I also had a problem with this stuff leaking out.  I returned it to Beauty Brands where I originally purchased it thinking the can had a leak.  The were great and exchanged it for a new bottle, but the same thing happened.  I used it three times and went to use it this morning and the bottle was empty.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> I can normally go 2 days without washing my hair.  I used this product on days 3 and 4 and it looks amazing.  I have thick, but fine dark brown hair that tends to be on the oily side.  The first day I used it, there was no powdery residue.  The second day there was more residue, but I was able to brush it out while blowdrying.  (I attribute the residue to the defective packaging-less air and more powder in the bottle.)     After reading reviews about the defective packaging, I checked my bottle and sure enough it was half gone by the time I got home.  I put the spritzer up to my ear and could hear and feel air escaping the bottle.  I put the cap back on, and it seemed to stop it because this morning I could no longer hear anything.  However, after I used it, I could hear more air escaping.      I called TIGI this morning and told them that the packaging was defective.  He asked me to describe how so.  He said that they will be able to provide me with a one time complimentary replacement that should arrive in 7-10 business days.      I hope the packaging gets fixed on this product, as it is such an amazing time saver.  But, I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again if the bottle they send is defective.</li>
    <li> This product smelled great and was simple to apply (shoot &amp; spray!). It didn&#x27;t work as fast as I hoped, it took about an hour or so for the product to absorb the oil and my hair to look un-greasy but it DID WORK! However that was all it did (as noted on the can), it didn&#x27;t add any shine or softness so my hair still looked dull, and somewhat unclean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect last for about a day (or however long it takes for your hair to become greasy). This would be a great item to take with you on a road trip, camping, or any where you might not be able to wash your hair for a few days. I plan on keeping the product in my cabinet for future use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would like to mention that while reviews have talked about the can \\&quot;leaking air\\&quot; or not working after a couple uses. After having my can for over 6 months &amp; several uses, it still works like brand new!</li>
    <li> I agree that this product is a waste of money.  I&#x27;ve used it three times, and I will be lucky to get another use out of it.</li>
