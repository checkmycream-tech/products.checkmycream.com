<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for years.  It is the most effective deep cleansing cream I have come across.  It is gentle and deep cleansing and does not dry my skin out.  I have tried many \\&quot;good\\&quot; cleansers and this is the only one I have found that does not leave my skin dry and flaky after use.</li>
    <li> It can be a little bit strong - almost has a tingly sense to it sometimes. Definitely be careful around the eye/nose/mouth area. It is very refreshing and gets you clean without stripping your face of its moisture. It has a light fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
    <li> It has a minty feeling which I think is good to know prior to purchase but it does not burn or tingle. It&#x27;s cooler, clean feeling and I like this stuff alot! Will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> This does not dry out your skin like a lot of cleansers tend to, and the smell is absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> I like to try everything when I find a brand I like. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, and though my favourite of their facial scrubs is their Peach and Willow Bark one, this is still top notch. Just a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I was blessed with good skin so it&#x27;s usually a challenge for me to find just a basic deep cleanser for my face that I could use daily. After sifting through pages of acne soaps I found this stuff. Not that I am crapping on acne soaps or anything. The medicines in them just make my face either feel sticky after washing or it actually causes me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this though! This is gentle enough for my sensitive skin to get it nice and clean without over treating symptoms that aren&#x27;t there. It also gets my make up off really good, though if I&#x27;m on the go I usually just use the little wipes that are also made by Burt. I am a big fan of most of his products (except for the avocado hair goop stuff. that was horrible!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that is dries my face a tiny bit more than I would like. It&#x27;s not like the sahara desert or anything. Just dryish. Easily cured with some lotion which you should always wear anyway. Always moisturize! Your face will thank you 20 years from now.</li>
    <li> I had been using this face cleanser for a little over a year now. I bought this product when I had mild acne and it seemed to do the trick. The texture of the cleanser is thick and creamy, but a face cloth is needed to take off the product. I have sensitive skin and this product ends up leaving my nostrils a bit flaky and red.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a drugstore brand cream cleanser.  Most of them contain menthol which I find can irritate and dry my skin so I decided to try the Burt&#x27;s Bees. I looked at the ingredient list and didn&#x27;t immediately see menthol, so I purchased the product.  I should have looked harder.  Menthol is the 20th listed ingredient - out of about 35 ingredients.  I actually found this \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product more drying than other drugstore brand cream cleansers.</li>
    <li> Hands down this is the best face wash ever. I have been using it for two years now and my skin looks and feels great. Its gentle yet effective and leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and smelling good. I dont think I will ever use another face wash ever again. I am very pleased with this deep cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 7 years and LOVE it...until this week.  I bought a bottle and when I washed my face with it, I noticed this disgusting smell! I thought maybe they had changed the ingredients, so I checked, and no changes.  I brought it back and bought another, praying the last one was a fluke because I really do like how this feels on my skin.  It absolutely stinks--it reminds me of horse manure. This is upsetting because now I have to find another face wash!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It is very refreshing and leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean.  Brevity is apparently not a good thing for a review but I can&#x27;t think of a single other thing to add.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I purchased this product after trying it once at a friend&#x27;s house. I loved how minty and cool it felt on my face when I first used it and I thought it was very refreshing. It was good at removing makeup and great at waking me up in the morning with it&#x27;s minty feel. The only complaint I have about this product, not a minor one in my opinion, is that it leaves a persistent residue on your face that lasts all day. The residue feels like a waxy layer and I could smell and feel it on my face throughout the whole day. I stopped using this product because my face didn&#x27;t feel clean with this residue and I was starting to break out because of it. If they formulated this product to wash off clean, I would certainly use it!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product is kind to my skin leaving it soft and feeling clean.  When I wash my face with this it feels like a tingle which I love.</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with acne since I hit puberty, and a ton of it. This is the first product I&#x27;ve EVER had work in the least. I&#x27;m so excited! After one use my acne had been greatly reduced. Now on day 3, all that&#x27;s left is some of the larger ones (that have reduced in size every time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so grateful to Burt&#x27;s Bees for creating this wonderful product. It&#x27;s become part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Gives a deep clean feeling.  Doesn&#x27;t take much, so each one lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Really nice. Cleans well without over-drying my skin (I have dry skin) and has a nice tingle. Will probably opt for something more natural next time, but for a big-box-store face wash this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> It smells so good! I love it.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Burt&#x27;s Bees!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels AMAZING and feels so soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also NOT harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> I get patches of red, flaky skin around my nose and between my eye brows.  This helps get rid of it.  I can see how the smell may bother some.  I like it, though.</li>
    <li> Love the way the cream feels on my face . The bit of peppermint make your sink feel very clean.</li>
    <li> Very creamy with a nice scent. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Very mild but refresh. This is my fifth time to order it.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It has the menthol feeling that I like and I can feel that it cleaned my face without stripping it.</li>
    <li> Wow!  The menthol in this product wakes my face up like nothing else and leaves it tingling for quite some time.  I LOVE this sensation; others may not.  It&#x27;s also nondrying and great smelling.  Say &amp;#34;Hello!&amp;#34; to my new favorite cleanser.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s bees products I have come to find are just perfect combination for my adult blemishes.... I use this to wash with the blemish stick to spot treat and the acne face cream..... my makeup never looked so smooth on my face.....</li>
    <li> While I think it did what it was supposed to do I didn&#x27;t care for the thick/dense texture of this product.  In addition&lt;br /&gt;it clogged my bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> Nothing removes mascara and foundation better than Burts Bees.  This stuff is the bomb.  It is a bit tingly but it is more refreshing for me than it is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use anything else but this cleanser, and my skin is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> This stuff feels very cleansing and purifying. However, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my skin has done a 180; really bad breakouts. Previously i had been using Ren&#x27;s face wash for sensitive skin, which worked well but was expensive. Maybe don&#x27;t use this stuff if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a heavy, greasy, oil-based cleanser.  Various oils + glycerine are the main ingredients.  I did like the refreshing feel of the menthol.&lt;br /&gt;At first I liked this product; it really made my face feel soft, but then noticed I was having some minor breakouts (unusual for me.).  So after about a week, I washed my face just with regular soap and a washcloth after using this cleanser.  I could not believe the dirt, makeup and grime this stuff left behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be good for you if you have dry skin, and never wear makeup.  I can&#x27;t believe they market this as a &amp;#34;cleansing cream.&amp;#34;  Cream &#x3D; yes.  Cleansing &#x3D; laughable.  I think it deposits more oil on my face than I was trying to wash off in the first place.  My tube has been put in the shower for body wash.</li>
    <li> Love the face wash.  It really does make your skin feel tingly-fresh and clean.  HOWEVER... what is with the pricing?  The price is &amp;#34;$9.65 ($4.82/count)&amp;#34;.  What does this mean?  It seems to say that you will pay $9.65 and get two, but that is not the case.  You will only get one.  And when you check with Amazon to find out what &amp;#34;/count&amp;#34; means, they will say that it does not mean that you get two, it just means that one costs $9.65.  That is crazy pricing!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this cleanser. The thick cream feels great going on, it removes foundation and blush well, and my skin feels clean and refreshed after. I have dry, somewhat sensitive skin and this cleanser has caused no irritation. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> I has being using this product for several years and it is quiet good, left my face very soft and clean and although it has a bit of perfume, it goes away very fast and it is very refreshing. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! The only thing I dislike about it is that it doesn&#x27;t foam it&#x27;s more like a cream. I got over that because it helps keep my face clear, along with apple cider vinegar and calendula cream. Helped get rid of my acne completely.</li>
    <li> I cannot stop raving @ the results of my using Burt&#x27;s Bees Deep Cleansing Cream, Soap Bark and Chamomile; it is an excellent product.  I have very sensitive skin and have tried many other products.  To date, this has worked wonders for me as it not only does a wonderful cleansing job, I also find it very soothing for my extra dry sensitive skin.  I have already told family and friends about Burt&#x27;s Bees Deep Cleansing Cream, Soap Bark and Chamomile and will also purchase other of theor products including their Moisturizing Cream.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing it works really well and it leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed it is simply the best</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face wash! It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin and I love the tingling sensation when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has worked very well for me and I rarely have breakouts now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is know for the quality of their products and their success. I&#x27;m more then pleased with the cleansing cream.&lt;br /&gt;Carol L.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been ordering Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark Cream from Amazon for years. The soap is a thick paste with a tingly menthol scent and feel. We LOVE it. However- this was NOT what came in our recent order. The container looked the same, but when I flipped open the lid I saw the Burt&#x27;s metallic seal was not on it. And when I squeezed the product into my hand, it was a runny, pearlescent liquid that smelled similar to a cheap hand soap! I hope other people haven&#x27;t been fooled by this because I&#x27;d hate to think what they are putting on their face!</li>
    <li> I was kind of iffy about getting this some people had complained that it didn&#x27;t clean deeply because they used the burts bees toner after and saw residue and makeup left over.i gave it try anyways I don&#x27;t really use a toner so I think I might get that too later on. this product worked for me I love the smell and how cooling it feels on my face really wakes me up in the morning! Which is a plus! And cleared up my acne even though that it wasn&#x27;t this product main purpose.</li>
    <li> It feels relaxing on my face and I love the smell of it. It&#x27;s like Noxzema but with better ingredients.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this cleanser probably is not for every skin type. I would say it works best on combination skin, which is what I have. Oily t-zone, dryer cheeks. I have used this morning and night for about 5 years. Im 32, and constantly people tell me I have the skin of a 21 year old. I sometimes use a toner with this, but not every day. I think its important to not use too much. I use about a dime size amount on my washrag and thats perfect. I love the fresh feeling, and honestly cannot start my day without it! I will probably use this product until Im too old to use my hands anymore.</li>
    <li> I really did not like the feeling of this product on my skin.  For me it went beyond tingly and felt more like burning.  I do not have sensitive skin and am never bothered by different products.  I rewashed my face and threw the cleanser out.  Thankfully it was only a trail size for a trial size multi pack.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the ONLY thing that has ever kept my face clear. If you are struggling with acne and have tried everything else, try this! It controls oil really well without drying out your skin.</li>
    <li> If ur sensitive to products and have allergies this works really. I use it on a daily bases with no problems. Just be more cautious when ur out in the sun more.</li>
    <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees Deep Cleansing Cream with Soap Bark and Chamomile is the only facial cleanser I use because it is a cream cleanser that tingles like Nozema, but without the harsh ingredients. Most importantly, it cleans my skin well and gets deep down into the pores to help keep my acne and blackheads away naturally. It even helps tone and firm up my skin. Everyone keeps saying I look like a teenager and I keep saying, &amp;#34;No, I am 30.&amp;#34; They keep asking what I am using and the only thing I can say is this cleanser. It has to be or all the herbal tea I drink. This cleanser not only keeps my skin youthful and bright, but it also helps keep it soft and well balanced unlike other facial cleansers. However, I still follow up after with a good moisturizer to help further nourish and protect my skin. Of coarse, that is a Burt&#x27;s Bees Product too that also works Marvelous!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product. Very refreshing for your skin. Glad I did order.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old ordered this and absolutely loves it.  It&#x27;s her go to face cleanser and as far as I can tell it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> Has a nice smell and feels good on my face when I wash with this cleanser, but the pros don&#x27;t go beyond that.  It does NOT deep clean, or clean much at all for that matter.  I have to use tons of eye makeup remover and toner on my eyes and face afterward to get all my makeup off.  Without toner or makeup remover, my face feels like it is covered in a light film.  I started using this in the morning just to get my face ready to apply moisturize and makeup, not to take off makeup before bed.</li>
    <li> I do not feel it can remove oil from my face . I do not like it</li>
    <li> I remember trying to use this as a late teen and it didn&#x27;t work for my oily skin or acne, at all. I&#x27;m now 23 and I&#x27;ve recently switched to more sensitive skin products, as my acne has calmed down and is exclusive to around my monthly menstrual cycle only. I missed this scent; It&#x27;s nice and fresh, yet not overpowering. There&#x27;s no foaming and it&#x27;s sort of like washing your face with a cold cream. My face felt very soft afterwards and I did not suffer from any breakouts. In fact, the scent lingers a bit even after rinsing (not in a bad way) and it&#x27;s pretty relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is really good for someone suffering from cystic or teenage acne, but then again, everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I think this cleanser is best suited for dry, combination, or sensitive skin types.</li>
    <li> I feel tingly on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great, natural, face wash that leaves your skin feeling very clean.  There is a menthol ingredient that is cooling and really refreshing, which is the main reason why I like the face wash.  If you are not a fan of mentholated beauty products, then you will probably not like this face wash.  It has a very thick, creamy consistency to it.  I use it as my back-up face wash when I run out of the expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product, smells great.</li>
    <li> Love that cooling effect it causes and it&#x27;s so smooth and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Great face wash, very gentle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years, and I highly recommend it.  It leaves your face feeling refreshed and clean, but not tight, as some cleansers do.  I really love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, this is a great cleanser. It also doubles as a great mascara remover. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but worth the price.</li>
    <li> Close your eyes and picture you&#x27;re in a meadow filled with the freshness of &#x27;Pureness &amp; Tranquility&#x27;, that&#x27;s what this scent remind me of; filled with a subtle hint of a dewy morning breeze. &#x27;Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream&#x27; I found is not too over-powering to the senses with heavy perfume and dyes as a lot of mainstream beauty products that make over-exaggerated claims; great job Burt&#x27;s Bees. A quick sniffer under the nostrils the scent is considerably light and dewy with a slight lemon-grass undertone; it doesn&#x27;t make my nose twitch as a lot of your more perfume-base cleansers as you&#x27;re taken off guard with their strong demeanor and robust undertones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself: Let&#x27;s be honest, it&#x27;s not my absolute favorite facial cleanser, it lacks that deep-cleansing after-affect, that little something &#x27;extra&#x27;. However, it does have that smooth-texture feel while applying it, so it&#x27;s not rough or damaging and leaves your skin with a nice tingling sensation. I think this is ideal for all ages and safe enough for small children as well as anyone with sensitive skin. However, to recapitulate it does leave some sort of a &#x60;tingling&#x27; type after-affect so would recommend that anyone with sensitive skin get a sample first if applicable. I know it will do wonders for people with drying skin because it is a &#x60;cream-based&#x27; item than traditional soap-based; which should be avoided whenever possible (dry-skin) users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ** I highly recommend following up with (Gentle Facial Cream by Dari-Natural: 4oz - $12.99)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Website: shop.dari-natural.com/main.sc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They might have a limited array of products to offer but who says great things doesn&#x27;t come in small packages/quantities. Each product is made of all natural ingredients and benefits and they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** If you&#x27;re like me who like to add some of my own remedies try adding some (Wheat Germ Oil &amp;/or Hemp Seed Oil) to the moisturizer; stir with a wooden Popsicle-stick (NEVER use Metal); a dab of water, and leave over-night in your refrigerator to set. You can leave in room temperature moving forward and because these ingredients are all natural it has a much longer shelf-life than any department store brands. Speaking of department stores...why does &#x60;WGO &amp; HSO&#x27; sound familiar? Look on the back of any major brand moisturizers and you will find they ALL use these two active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some benefits to consider&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering what is wheat germ oil good for, consider the following benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this oil include curing skin conditions like psoriasis and eczema. It works effectively to heal burns and skin ulcers. As an external application it is very helpful for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wheat germ oil is beneficial for the general health of the skin as it improves circulation of blood in the skin when used externally. It also helps the skin cells that may have been damaged due to the scorching heat of the sun. It also fights off conditions like dermatitis and reduces scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health benefits of this oil include improving the overall working of the heart. Research has shown beneficial effects of octacosanol and specifically policosanol in improving cardiovascular functions. Policosanol has been found to be effective in controlling production of cholesterol by the liver. It is believed to raise the level of &#x27;good&#x27; cholesterol and reduce that of &#x27;bad&#x27; cholesterol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wheat germ oil is known for its antioxidant properties. Hence it helps in preventing the skin from bearing the signs of aging. It is probably this reason that it is added to other carrier oils. However, it is used in lower amounts to prepare carrier oil blend as it is high in nutritional value.&lt;br /&gt;Linoleic acid, oleic palmitic and stearic fatty acids are the essential fatty acids present in wheat germ oil. These essential oils cannot be manufactured by the body. Hence they should be taken externally as they improve the immune system, the nervous system and help in healthy cell growth and regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wheat germ oil is particularly high in a long chain saturated primary alcohol called octacosanol. This compound was reported by some athletes in the 1960s to enhance their performance. Octacosanol in particular was believed to increase endurance and muscle strength in sports persons. Though there isn&#x27;t much scientific evidence about its beneficial effects in improving fitness or athletic performance, some studies have shown that octacosanol and policosanol cause a mild improvement in reaction time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hemp Seed Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning, Memory and Immune Boost&lt;br /&gt;Hemp seed extract has an unidentified compound in it that may help to promote learning, memory and immune function. It may stimulate the brain enzyme known as calcineurin, according to the University of Michigan. Calcineurin plays an essential role in some brain synapse activities, according to J. Luo, who studied its effect on immune response and memory in mice and found that it improved both. The study was published in the journal Pharmacology, Biology and Behavior. In a second study on mice featured in Acta Pharmacologica Sinica, Luo noted that calcineurin helped to improve learning and memory that were impaired by chemical drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E Effects&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hemp seeds are a source of vitamin E, which can help to boost immune function and alleviate symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, according to the University of Michigan.Vitamin E also has a role in red blood cell formation in your body, and helps your body utilize vitamin K, which helps your blood stick together, or coagulate, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFA Benefits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hemp seeds are rich in essential fatty acids. The oil in the seeds is a source of the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid, ALA, as well as omega-6 fatty acid gamma-linolenicacid, or GLA, advises the University of Michigan. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation in your body. They also may lower risk for cancer, heart disease and arthritis, advise the experts at the University of Maryland Medical Center. These fatty acids also are important for your brain performance and memory. GLA also may be an inflammation fighter, according to UMMC. In fact, GLA might reduce your nerve pain symptoms if you are diabetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more at (livestrong.com) - what-are-the-benefits-of-hemp-seeds/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more at (Buzzle.com) - [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; is a company known for providing merchandises without all the added junk. Their products are genuine and made with the intention of good and wholesome vs trying to make a mere buck. I have a long history of using their products so was quite excited about trying this one; please keep in mind this is not a soapy type texture but as indicated a cream-base texture which is great for someone who has problem/dry skin. Soapy residues tend to have a drying residue that is why it is recommended to follow-up with a day/night moisturizer. &#x27;Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream&#x27; you can actually skip a day with your moisturizer and your skin feels fine; and because it is a cream-based cleanser it take no time to rinse off; so not to worry if you&#x27;re in a bit of a hurry. Make sure to towel-blot your skin; don&#x27;t rub or you will over-dry; always keep a couple drops of water behind to keep your skin its absolute best with moisture. Just as what you put in your body is as equally important what you put on-it. Your skin retains water &#x3D; moisture and thus will help from everyday toxins and the smothering dry UV rays/ sun. Now, is the perfect time to follow-up with my aforementioned &#x60;moisturizer&#x27; technique; don&#x27;t forget to dab a little under the eyes, as well as any crow&#x27;s feet/fine-lines around the eyes. I&#x27;ve found by using this product I no longer have to buy a separate &#x27;enhancing-eye-cream,&#x27; but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Burt&#x27;s Bees Soap Bark &amp; Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream&#x27;: it&#x27;s like stepping back to childhood innocence...for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal-oily T-zone area type problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is &#x27;Awakened1&#x27; and I hope this review helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ** See all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34AZ5B6CCBLPN/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;sort_by&#x3D;MostRecentReview</li>
    <li> I always look forward to a shower as I conveniently have Burt&#x27;s bees products all over my bathroom. This specific product has been the best face wash I have tried thus far leaves a great cool feeling after use. After weeks of use I have seen improvement on the texture of my skin. I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Trying to find something gentle instead of my Estee lauder which is pricey. But - after using this I ordered two of the Estate Lauder. The Bee&#x27;s cleanser was VERY drying. My face was pinched and taunt. It did take off 98% of makeup though. It made me look 10 years older</li>
