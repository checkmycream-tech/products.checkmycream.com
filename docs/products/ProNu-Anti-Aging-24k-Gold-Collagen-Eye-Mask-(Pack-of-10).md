      <li>I was surprised and delighted to see my eyes look so refreshed.</li>
      <li>i had bags and shadows under my eyes and this product cleared it up and are smooth and pretty.. i would recommend this to everyone !!</li>

      <li>I left these one for about 30 minutes and the results were amazing!</li>
      <li>So clean up is just a toss in the trash.</li>

      <li>it stung, but quickly de-thawed.  </li>
      <li>Overall these are a great product that I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with each of their products individually and as a whole.</li>
      <li>this eye mask is super.</li>
      <li>Plus they&#x27;re super moist and don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be leaving this feedback on each of the items I bought and will most definitely be purchasing more when I need it.</li>
      <li>The skin under my eyes is also very smooth and soft now.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re somewhat goofy looking when you put them on, but they work wonders to refresh your eyes - making you look more young, awake, and alive.</li>
      <li>They arrive in a really nice box and each set of 24k gold eye masks are individually wrapped.</li>
      <li>These are definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>but so far I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>These are definitely a fun way to get some relaxing in while anti-aging.</li>
      <li>These are great And really helped my dark circles.  </li>
      <li>The directions on apply were very clear and easily understood.</li>
      <li>They stay on without sliding pretty well.</li>
      <li>After my first time of using these I could tell the skin around my eyes looked firmer/smoother.  </li>
      <li>I bought these because the reviews were so positive.</li>
      <li>I love the product however the insructions could have been more clearer it doesnt side which side to apply.... or left or right eye, and they do slide down face</li>
      <li>My skin is looking better than it has in a long time after using their products.</li>
      <li>However,it seems to really work.i followed the directions,and it really DOES make a difference with the wrinkles around my eyes!</li>
      <li>I bought this along with several of their other products and I&#x27;m absolutely happy.</li>
      <li>I decided to try these masks and they really seem to help...</li>
      <li>SO, that having been said, I don&#x27;t know if these work wonders when you don&#x27;t really need them, but for those nights of no sleep, put these in the fridge for 5 minutes, use these in the morning</li>
      <li>I am going to try sleeping with them, as I think they could remain very moist for an extended period of time - and hopefully maximize the results of the serum that they are soaked in.</li>
      <li>They stay in place the whole time.</li>
      <li>Then I went through a period when I was intensely involved in a project at work</li>
      <li>and I have to use 3x a week to get much faster results which I do</li>
      <li>and they felt very soothing under my eyes.</li>
      <li>I tried putting them in the crisper drawer of the fridge, and that did not do much.  </li>
      <li>I tried using them without refrigeration, and that did not do much.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t really feel refreshed or notice a difference after weeks of using once a week.</li>
      <li>I have really noticed a difference in the brightness of my skin under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>They really perk up your eyes and leave you looking refreshed.  </li>
      <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>I received these for Christmas after looking over reviews I really wanted to try them.</li>
      <li>so it really didn&#x27;t surprise me.</li>
      <li>I tried them this morning while I got ready for work.</li>
      <li>or if I&#x27;ve spent many restless nights awake</li>
      <li>35 year old woman with crow&#x27;s feet that weren&#x27;t going away with regular moisturizers, mild darkness and not so mild under eye puffiness.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d say these work great for dark under eyes, dry skin, and to tighten the skin!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> used this product twice, and i must say it is great !! i had bags and shadows under my eyes and this product cleared it up and are smooth and pretty.. i would recommend this to everyone !!</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference after putting it on, but should be used pre-event or photos as it doesn&#x27;t work as a long-term treatment.</li>
    <li> Still using them....just not sure if they really work.</li>
    <li> I have to say,I was a little skeptical of this product at first.However,it seems to really work.i followed the directions,and it really DOES make a difference with the wrinkles around my eyes! I wish I would have thought to take a before&amp;after picture</li>
    <li> I would use these every day if I had the time.  They really perk up your eyes and leave you looking refreshed.  And I have bought other eye masks at a much higher price.  These are definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is good if you want to give yourself an &#x27;at home&#x27; spa treatment. The masks feel nice, and are certainly relaxing. However, I did not notice anything beyond a temporary (3-4 hours maximum) reduction in eye puffiness. The instructions advise to use 1 time per week, so if you are using this for line or wrinkle reduction, this product alone will not work. I would not use these alone to treat any skin concerns, as it is simply not effective enough. However, if you have an event, or will be in photos that day, these are nice to use beforehand. I probably would not buy again as I did not feel these did anything that an ice pack couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference all they are are soaked gels ment to hydrate the skin.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the reviews were so positive. I tried them this morning while I got ready for work. They stay on without sliding pretty well. I had to push one closer to my eye a couple of times the first few minutes, but I liked that I could do things rather than having to lie down for 30 minutes. When I took them off, my eye area felt moisturized, but still looked a little puffy. A few minutes later, once my eye area had dried, it felt tight. So I looked in the mirror again to see if I noticed any difference, and wow... The area was brighter and tighter. It&#x27;s been a couple of hours now and my under eye area still feels tight, but hydrated, and the skin is brighter. The puffiness is still there a little, but I did get botox in the area a week ago for smile wrinkles, and I read that it causes under eye puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;d say these work great for dark under eyes, dry skin, and to tighten the skin!</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite eye masks! Since I&#x27;ve started using them, my eyes are less puffy with less bags and crows feet! They apply very easily and don&#x27;t leave  a sticky residue on my skin!</li>
    <li> They come with no direction on which way to put them on.  They slid off my face if I stood up... and I didn&#x27;t really feel refreshed or notice a difference after weeks of using once a week.</li>
    <li> I have dark under eyes from my grandfather, these didn&#x27;t  help.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my eyes this product doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Sucks that I am already addicted, need to order at least two more boxes, we&#x27;ll I am 28 college student and work full time as a nanny so imagine how I must loom exhausted all the time dark circles and even lines under my eyes trying everything to get rid of, not easy. For cream I have been using the bobbi brown under eye hydrating cream since my under eye lines are due to dryness, and this eye patch really makes a difference,  though the lines are not completely gone, I do see improvement in my dark circles and I have to use 3x a week to get much faster results which I do, I think if you have serious under eye issues use 2-3x a week.</li>
    <li> Excellent  for  swollen  eyes  . Especially  if you  have  allergies.</li>
    <li> These eye masks are incredibly cooling and relaxing. I wore them while working on homework at a computer, and they hardly moved on my face. They&#x27;re somewhat goofy looking when you put them on, but they work wonders to refresh your eyes - making you look more young, awake, and alive. I put them on for about an hour and a half, and they still seemed very moist when I took them off. I am going to try sleeping with them, as I think they could remain very moist for an extended period of time - and hopefully maximize the results of the serum that they are soaked in.</li>
    <li> Nothing out of the ordinary, also it slides too much, therefore quite hard to keep them in place.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference.  Still have dark circles.  Oh well.  They do feel good when I have them on.</li>
    <li> This is a great product just what I was looking for. I leave it on for almost an hour while I am lying in bed. I am very happy with the results. I feel hydrated, less puffiness and dark circles have diminished I will re-order.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I like it. That is the one I am looking for. Thank you</li>
    <li> These are great And really helped my dark circles.  It&#x27;s not a permanent change so far- but makes me look really tested the next day.  You don&#x27;t have to close eyes while wearing them- but you will have to lay down as they tend to slip off.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with several of their other products and I&#x27;m absolutely happy. My skin is looking better than it has in a long time after using their products.I&#x27;m happy with each of their products individually and as a whole. I&#x27;ll be leaving this feedback on each of the items I bought and will most definitely be purchasing more when I need it.</li>
    <li> They just work. period. I was surprised and delighted to see my eyes look so refreshed. 35 year old woman with crow&#x27;s feet that weren&#x27;t going away with regular moisturizers, mild darkness and not so mild under eye puffiness. These erased the evidence of my insomnia. I leave them on for at least an hour.</li>
    <li> After my first time of using these I could tell the skin around my eyes looked firmer/smoother.  I have decided to save these for a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; night out! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I am a fan of masks and this eye mask is super. I used it as directed. When I took it off, the skin around my eyes looked more hydrated and smooth. I have been hearing about use of gold particles in skin care and this was the easiest way to try it. I am glad I did. I&#x27;ll continue to use it once a week to maintain the results. The box it self is very pretty and the eye mask are stored very securely. it gives my eyes the rested look. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing. Great price  Temporarily refreshes under eyes for hydrated dewy look. I use before going out or morning after bad night of sleep.</li>
    <li> This a nice product to use when you just want to relax. It says you can use them cold or hot although I have only used them cold and straight from the package. I left them on for about an hour and they felt very soothing under my eyes. The coolest feels great. The eye masks are something you need to do lying down or they may slide. I have only used them a couple times as it says to use once per week but I have noticed that they help with the bags under my eyes. My eyes don&#x27;t look as puffy and tired. The skin under my eyes is also very smooth and soft now. These are definitely a fun way to get some relaxing in while anti-aging.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s impossible to keep them in place! And also my eyes were burning while I was using it.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have really started to notice the aging process taking effect! I have bags under my eyes and just an overall puffy feeling to them. I have tried every cream or serum out there and nothing seems to take the puffiness away. I jumped at the chance to get a sample of these and share my experience with them here with you. They arrive in a really nice box and each set of 24k gold eye masks are individually wrapped. I would suggest using these when you have time to lay back, relax and close your eyes as they are pretty saturated with liquid and they start to slide down your face. I noticed a little irritation to my eyes but closing them helped with that. I have sensitive eyes so it really didn&#x27;t surprise me. I left these one for about 30 minutes and the results were amazing! My puffiness and bags were totally gone! I couldn&#x27;t even believe it! Overall these are a great product that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the BEST beauty products I&#x27;ve tried for eye puffiness. No joke, I was seriously blown away after just the first application. I could tell a huge difference immediately afterwards and other people noticed too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it does anything different than regular moisturizer.</li>
    <li> really really happy with my eye masks! they feel so luxurious! i have puffy under eye bags and dark circles too, and with these i have seen such a big difference! my eyes are noticeably brighter less puffy and my fine lines are disappearing and my skin looks and feels firmer and softer! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I work 10 hours a day which is a crazy schedule.  As I get older I have noticed the little fine lines around my eyes that my mom call laugh lines.  Grr!  I don&#x27;t feel like I am old enough to have these little lines.  I have used the collagen eye mask for the last few days and I have noticed by eyes are not as dark and the little &amp;#34;Laugh&amp;#34; lines are not as prominent.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from bags under my eyes for a greater part of my life. Even with feeling restful they are still there. These eye masks have helped a little to reduce the puffiness under my eyes. They have also relieved some of the darkness. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s something from wearing glasses or if I&#x27;ve spent many restless nights awake but this can be a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I received these for Christmas after looking over reviews I really wanted to try them. I decided to use them tonight &amp; they feel great on the eyes! They seem to stick nicely, however I have a face mask on &amp; don&#x27;t want to rick them sliding dons into it. They are large &amp; fit nicely around the eye. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for 3 weeks now at the recommended pace of once per week. I have not noticed any change in the bags under my eyes, though the mask does feel very soothing while it is on my face and for a few hours after.</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to figure out how to best use these.  I tried using them without refrigeration, and that did not do much.  I tried putting them in the crisper drawer of the fridge, and that did not do much.  I finally put them directly on the fridge shelf, and that made them nice and cold - very soothing.  Then I tried putting them in the freezer for about two minutes, and they immediately froze and were too frozen when I used them - it stung, but quickly de-thawed.  So, that having been said, I did not notice any difference the first few times I used them, but the truth is I had gotten a good night sleep and did not have a lot of lines, puffiness or bags or dark circles under my eyes.  Then I went through a period when I was intensely involved in a project at work and I was not sleeping - at best getting 5-6 hours of sleep at night no matter what I did - my brain would not shut off.  It was at that point that I noticed new lines developing under my eyes, eye puffiness, dark circles, etc.  You know the routine.  It was at that point that I used these ( I was horrified going to work looking so awful - the eyes are where it shows), and I immediately noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my under eye area.  The horrible wrinkles that had started to form were less visible.  The area looked brighter.  The puffiness gone.  SO, that having been said, I don&#x27;t know if these work wonders when you don&#x27;t really need them, but for those nights of no sleep, put these in the fridge for 5 minutes, use these in the morning (I do about 1 hour if I have the time) and it will improve the appearance of fine lines and puffiness under your eyes.</li>
    <li> I love the product however the insructions could have been more clearer it doesnt side which side to apply.... or left or right eye, and they do slide down face I used them when I was extremely ill ans seen results.  I wish there was more inside package . I called the number on bix inly to find out it is not in working  order ... I wanted to order more but with the small flaws the price &amp;quantity is giving me hesitstion  at the moment :(</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d try something new, but it does NOTHING.  At least some of the creams give a little tightening. This, this was just slimy and dumb.</li>
    <li> I have really noticed a difference in the brightness of my skin under my eyes.  I have had dark circles my entire life.  Now that I am closer to 50 years old.  I notice them even more.  I decided to try these masks and they really seem to help...</li>
    <li> This is second time to order this product. Came extractly 10 patches. The price is reasonable. I use twice a week. I like the result.</li>
    <li> I feel so luxurious and pampered when I use these. It&#x27;s like having a spa in my home. I feel so relaxed and refreshed after each use. And my skin around my eyes looks and feels amazing. I was fortunate even to be offered these at a great price to try and provide my honest unbiased opinion. I love these mask. They are individually wrapped in beautiful packaging. So clean up is just a toss in the trash. I can feel the effect of these for days after using them and I can tell my skin is healing. The bags around my eyes are greatly deflated and the skin hydrated. The skin feels so soft to the touch. These are going on my gift list for friends.</li>
    <li> These are great for targeting just that under eyes area. I have puffiness, and dark circles. The blessings of being a mother that runs on no sleep! The little under eyes masks help me with. I was so happy to be give the opportunity to test these out at a very special price, and share my opinions and experiences. These eye masks have gotten rid of the puffiness, and made my skin more firm and tighter. They also got rid of the dark circles. My eyes look bright and youthful now! I like that these are easy to apply. They stay in place the whole time. The directions on apply were very clear and easily understood. They have a light fresh scent to them, that stays on your skin even after application. Just a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> amazing. Does what it says it will do. Perfect to do the day of your wedding or big event</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement after using this product, but it feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order these again. I&#x27;ve tried them a few times and they don&#x27;t work. No results. Plus they&#x27;re super moist and don&#x27;t stay on. Almost slimy feeling. Constantly had to keep pushing and moving them into place.</li>
    <li> Honest and bias....&lt;br /&gt;These things feel so good. They&#x27;re nice and cool and just amazing. They feel like puddy almost. They&#x27;re a little moist. I love the way they feel under my eyes. Your suppose to use once a week for 30 mins. But the way they make my eyes feel I want to keep on for longer periods honestly. I can see why they help with puffy, eyes. (Careful not to get too close to eyes, they may make them tingle a tad.) I can&#x27;t say enough good things. Over time I&#x27;ll see how good of results I get but so far I&#x27;m in love. I want more already. Thank you.</li>
