<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pleased with the  product.</li>
    <li> I used the product the other day it smelled so good.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why this got such great reviews. It smells like strong bubble bath or something, and feels so soapy that I would be afraid to use it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My caress bar soap smells much nicer than this. I am going to put it in my guest bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with this Aveda smells much nicer.</li>
    <li> Love it! So much more reasonable through Amazon than the department stores. Great product and lathers nicely!</li>
    <li> After watching too many Philosohy promos on a popular shopping network, I finally decided to try some of their products. This was jus so so. Pretty color, which I can do by adding mica to any clear shower gel. Smell was nice, but doesn&#x27;t last past the point of drying off. Small amount for the money. Did NOT leave my skin feeling moisturized. My Tone body wash leaves a much nicer feel, for a much nicer price.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time today. I am in love! The smell is so delightful. It is so clean and good smelling. I can&#x27;t really describe it, but it&#x27;s awesome. I am going to start giving this as a gift to family members. I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone would dislike it. So happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and makes my kiddos smell so clean. I gave it 4 stars because it is NOT a decent shampoo for my fine, straight, long hair. I need higher-end products, but I still enjoy the scent of this one.</li>
    <li> Smells unreal.  I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced in general but it&#x27;s so great smelling it&#x27;s hard to resist.</li>
    <li> Love love love! The shower wash is great for layering along with moisturiser and perfume for everyday wear</li>
    <li> I think this is an all right shower gel, but I don&#x27;t really see what all the hype is about.  (I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different shower gels lately as this is one product in my routine that I can vary without really worrying about the consequences.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did work to remove sweat after a workout.  It didn&#x27;t lather very much, though.  It rinsed off in the shower without leaving residue on my skin (always appreciated).  I feel like I had to use quite a lot of it on my pouf sponge, though -- perhaps because of the low lathering capabilities.  (I&#x27;m actually surprised it didn&#x27;t lather much for me because it contains sulfate surfactants.)  I wish it didn&#x27;t contain artificial dyes; however, I did not have any reaction to the ones that were included (see the full ingredients list by scrolling down on the main product page).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this had a light, pleasant floral scent.  The scent didn&#x27;t stick around after my shower (so you&#x27;d be good to layer other scents on top without worrying about interference).  I don&#x27;t use this as shampoo because (1) the sulfates aren&#x27;t good for color-treated hair and (2) I find that multi-use products usually aren&#x27;t actually all that great for multiple uses.  But that option is available if you are interested in minimizing the number of bottles of product you keep in your shower.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells devine! It seems to me that the smell lingers on your skin way after you come out of the shower, which I don&#x27;t mind one bit. I give it 4 stars because it is overpriced in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Are you using the same product I just did? I waited a long time to request this as a Christmas gift and I am so disappointed I&#x27;m throwing it away in tears.  I smell like worse than an old lady Jean Nateyou come up on in the supermarket.  I&#x27;ll go to the Dollar Tree and get something that smells good.  UGH!!!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this shampoo under any circumstance!!!! I used the shampoo a few days ago and it made my hair so dry. My scalp was itching and my hair felt so coarse. My mother used the same bottle of shampoo a few days later and her hair started falling out in clumps. It fell out so much that she started having small bald spots! Do not use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Thank you for the shipment. It arrived on time and packaged well. I love Amazing Grace Shower Gel. As soon as it runs out, I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I love how this smells!</li>
    <li> Whenever I need an emotional pick-me-up I turn to Philosophy&#x27;s line of feminine, light, perfect scents.  Whether it is the \\&quot;Amazing Grace\\&quot;, \\&quot;Pure Grace\\&quot;, \\&quot;Inner Grace\\&quot; or the \\&quot;Unconditional Love\\&quot; line using them always makes my spirits rise, the day seem brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a portion of a gift to a very special friend. Working with her these past 22 years has been an amazing journey and a privilege.  I hope she experiences many wonderful days as she explores the world of retirement.  How could she not?  She will be wearing this delicate, delightful scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the product!</li>
    <li> If you like a subtle, clean fragrance, especially for summer, Amazing Grace is for you. And the other great thing about it is that a little goes a looooong way, so this 16 oz. bottle will probably last a good long while, and at Amazon&#x27;s great price, what&#x27;s not to love? Plus this is the greatest shampoo ever, I can&#x27;t believe how clean and bouncy my hair is. My favorite hair stylist even said something about how great my hair was looking. In my experience, a combined shower gel/shampoo type product usually isn&#x27;t such a good shampoo, but Philosophy in its usual style managed to make a product that treats both your hair and your skin equally well. Love this product! And thanks, Amazon, for carrying the Philosophy line.</li>
    <li> Love showering with this! Makes me feel luxurious, moisturized, clean :).  It has good lather, without being drying.  Great scent, my husband LOVES it.  I keep  bottle in my locker at the YMCA ,home, and travel bag.  Love it, and follow up with the Lotion-set up for a great day!!!!</li>
    <li> This gel smells great, feels great, and Amazon&#x27;s price was terrific. I haven&#x27;t used it as a shampoo, because I color my hair and am afraid this would be too harsh. It would definitely make your hair smell good though! The scent is very nice, light but very pleasant in the shower, although not really strong enough to linger once the shower is over. I actually bought the cologne in Amazing Grace after using this shower gel and am thinking of getting the body lotion.</li>
    <li> For my daughter who introduced me to it a few years ago. Love the fragrance and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t regret it. All of their products are awesome and you can&#x27;t go wrong. Light scent but lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Again, I&#x27;m so happy to find one of my favorite lines of bath products on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughter-in-law and she loves this!</li>
    <li> First, let me start by letting you know I have sensitive skin. However, Philosophy products work fine for me. I love the fresh yet romantic smell of Amazing Grace and recommend layering the subtle scent by using at least the body wash and moisturizer. To me, Amazing Grace is classic.  A scent you will always use and want to use daily.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here as I&#x27;m spoiled by Amazon&#x27;s quick deliveries.  I had gotten a small bottle as a gift when I spoke to a Women&#x27;s group. I was sort of disappointed as I didn&#x27;t notice it smelling as good, or as strong (which I wanted) as the one I got.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a Philosophy product..and I am satisfied.  The shower gel is a little hard to squeeze out, but not a big deal.  I have noticed the bottom of my feet are softer.  I gave it four stars because the scent does not last as long as others reviewed...I am thinking if you bathe in it, maybe it will...but showering it fades within a couple of hours...for me anyway...could be different with others body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of the Amazing Grace shower gel... but about 1/3 rd into the bottle, all of a sudden I noticed the scent of the gel didn&#x27;t smell like it did when I first bought it.  It&#x27;s almost like it lost scent or something.  At first I thought it was just me, like maybe I was used to it or something.  But this has never happened before on other scented products.  My hubby sniffed it but he said it didn&#x27;t smell very strong either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m still using the rest of the bottle but won&#x27;t be purchasing this one again.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of Grace that I have gotten and I love it.  I have not used it as a shampoo however ~ only as bath wash.</li>
    <li> This was hard to rate. If I were rating the scent alone, I&#x27;d give it a 5. It&#x27;s multi-dimensional &amp; lives up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have severe arthritis and Fibromyalgia so it makes this stuff nearly impossible to deal with. I bought the 32oz. size because it&#x27;s the Only size that comes with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is so thick that it takes 30 seconds to get one full pump out of it and it takes a lot of strength to do that.&lt;br /&gt;* With the 16oz size, you have to pick up the entire bottle to get product out - something that&#x27;s almost impossible for someone in pain because it&#x27;s heavy and too big around.&lt;br /&gt;* Squeezing the bottle is very hard to do.&lt;br /&gt;* I was going to give this as a gift, but the person has rheumatoid arthritis and I&#x27;m so glad I tested this out on myself first - there is no way she could use this.&lt;br /&gt;* This product is first &amp; foremost a bubble bath, so it takes a LOT of water and time to rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;* I found this to be the most drying body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that 3 Star Reviews usually get lost in the mix, but I hope this helps someone save money and avoid pain &amp; frustration.</li>
    <li> Este lo compre para un regalo para mi mamá, ella ya lo habia probado y le encanta el aroma. Llego a tiempo y sin ningun daño. Tiene un delicioso olor para la ducha.</li>
    <li> It was a great opportunity to purchase my Amazing Grace from this vendor. Love love love the price and the product came earlier than expected! Will buy again and again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love the scent because it smells so clean but this does dry my skin out.  I could tell even after I used it the first time.  Plus not very sudsy.</li>
    <li> For my sister for Christmas.  Was on her wish list.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I received my order containing Philiosphy Amazing Grace Shower Gel; however, as soon as I opened the bottle I was in tears. The shower gel is odorless!!! I&#x27;m angry because I wasted money and time by ordering this from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Smells great but the scent fades QUICKLY and it does not lather!! It is really one of the most pleasant scents I&#x27;ve encountered, but come on, make it last longer than 5 minutes after getting out of the shower!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years;one of the reliable fragrances for ladies,girls.My only problem is weakness in grip so that I can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;squeeze through the cap. I take cap off and pour small amount on shower mesh ball. Product is excellent,will reorder again.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting amazing grace for a long time but it was too expensive.  This was a good price and a very nice transaction.</li>
    <li> Makes your skin feel like silk</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s O.K., but not worth the cost.  It smells nice, but I found the scent didn&#x27;t last on my skin or hair.  The lather is not very rich either.  The only thing that really stood out about this product to me, was the packaging.  I like what it says on the bottle.  I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This body wash is great! I love all the Amazing Grace products. The scent is light, clean, and pretty. Best way I can describe it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now and it just makes my skin feel so soft and clean.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly and as described! My daughter loves this and I ordered one for her birthday. It came frozen, but the temps outside were really cold, just glad it didn&#x27;t break. I will be ordering again, maybe when its warmer outside.</li>
    <li> This is always a gift option for my Mom. This is her all time favorite scent. She loves to drown herself in this soft, powdery, feminine aroma.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of vanilla fragrances?  &amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34; is an option and one you&#x27;ll enjoy. The Cosmetic Source Plus price of $15.72 (before shipping) is the best value I was able to find. At this price, one can afford to build a signature shower collection of calming, rich, soothing body fragrances. The scent of Amazing Grace blends light notes from fruit and roses and is pleasantly intoxicating, I literally closed my eyes and inhaled the scent for nearly a minute before heading for the shower. This gel is an affordable gift of feminine luxury.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and creamy and soft but have other stuff that works great and is much cheaper and would buy again and again.  Not going to purchase this again due to high cost and other things out there that are just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> Great product and I would recommend it.  We use it often and I bought more this year and will share information with others.</li>
    <li> Light clean smell.  I always feel pampered when using this.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! Ithe smells soooo devine. Soft and addicting!;) I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> its the best,such a fresh and clean scent I highly recommend thisa for anyone,,everyone would love it.  It has to be a favorite.</li>
    <li> Love the nice smell that lingers most of the day.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this wash. You can use it in your hair or on your body. The scent is even more wonderful when layered with the same scented perfume or body lotion. It lasts all day but it isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
    <li> It was a blind buy. I really didn&#x27;t know the smell and I was very pleased when I received it. It&#x27;s a scent I&#x27;ve never smelled before, but I love it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells fresh air, flowers, clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say that the smell doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ve only used it in my bath, and the smell stays in my bathroom for several days. Even when I take daily showers with another shower gel. Each time I enter my bathroom, it&#x27;s the Amazing Grace scent that I smell ! On my skin, after a bath, it stays long enough for me : the evening (because in the morning, i take a shower anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I must say is that I love Philosophy bottles. It&#x27;s always written some nice stuff on it. Definitions, lessons of life, etc. I like reading them.</li>
    <li> excellent - thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance that Philosophy has..I bought this bottle to take to the gym.  After the smelly gym, it is heavenly. :)</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that the scent is no longer there.  I read that before purchasing but didn&#x27;t want to believe it so I ordered it anyway.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and couldn&#x27;t do without it.  My bathroom always smelled like Amazing Grace and I loved it.  Now I no longer smell it at all, the scent is just gone.  That&#x27;s what I paid for so I will no longer buy it unless it is returned to its former scent.  As it is, I can find something much cheaper than this without a scent.  It&#x27;s no longer the product I knew and loved.</li>
    <li> Tried this product based on others telling me that continual usage would help deter mosquitoes.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints so far and like the light scent for my allergies.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love, love this Amazing Grace by Philosophy. The best scent in the whole world.  I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> I only use Philosophy Shower Gels, love the fragrance, and all the foam.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the smell</li>
    <li> Not using this either.  I do hope the recipient of this gift likes it.  I do not use this because it is too expensive for my budget.</li>
    <li> I like it but it does not lather up like i thought it would and also the fragrance does not stay with me at all.</li>
    <li> LOVED ALL oF there products if you haven&#x27;t tried them you should. Makes your skin feel baby soft and a&lt;br /&gt;Really clean feeling. This one Grace is my favorite product.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou</li>
    <li> This used to be one of my favorites.  However, my recent purchase had no scent at all, so I returned it.  Read other reviews who claimed the same problem so sadly this product is no longer something I will buy.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and it feels great on the body, I just wish the packaging wasn&#x27;t so awful. It becomes really difficult to dispense any liquid without having to squeeze the thick bottle which is pretty tough to do with wet, soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you pay for this you would think you would get a pump but as it is I can only give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is not the same as the original tall bottle of Amazing Grace Bubble Bath which I couldn&#x27;t find.  I bought this for the wonderful fragrance I liked in the bubble bath, but this is nothing special.  Not worth the big price tag.  I&#x27;m so disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this coupled with the lotion and perfume, but the shower gel scent is strong enough to leave a lasting scent even without the layering.</li>
    <li> Smell is almost too faint to notice. Would like it to last . What&#x27;s the point of the scent if you can&#x27;t smell it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife after smelling it on a secretary. The smell fills the room with a WONDERFUL CLEAN scent.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it and so do I.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite personal products.  Such a subtle, beautiful scent.  I can&#x27;t wear anything heavily scented and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> The bottle I bought didn&#x27;t smell any different than a bottle of unscented Aveeno shower gel I have. Overrated and overpriced, in my opinion. Never again.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy Amazing Grace.  It smells great, but it is easy on my very sensitive skin.  Win, win, absolutely.</li>
    <li> Like the Pure Grace, it makes my skin really soft, but I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance as much as Pure Grace.</li>
    <li> Was received well as a gift</li>
    <li> diffmarilyn bothroyd  too mamy words requirederence in listed price was19.93 charged 20.18  Will order more at 19.92 if available  thank yo very much.</li>
    <li> ...that&#x27;s all I can say! This shower gel is out of this world... it smells better than the perfume even, and that&#x27;s saying a lot!</li>
    <li> I love Amazing Grace Shower Gel, I love how it cleans my skin and I love the smell. I have been trying to find it at other places besides QVC because I can&#x27;t buy from them any more. I am so glad that I found Amazon so I can order it. And it is very reasonable in price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my niece and she absolutely loves it.  Amazing Grace is her favorite fragrance, and she especially likes the shower gel.  While I have never used this fragrance myself, my niece, who is very discerning in choosing her beauty products....swears by this one.  She LOVES it, so I will rate it with FIVE STARS*****.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff  The smell is so clean and fresh, this is probably the 10th buy of it since my daughter gave me some as a gift , 5 years ago.  I wont be able to afford it as I am retiring and this was a good buy</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy products.  Amazing Grace is my favorite scent hands down. Love Love Love.  It is floral but not overpoweringly so.  There are also nice notes of citrus (grapefruit) and musk earthiness. This is a bigger size and takes me about 8 months to get through.  If you just want to test out the scent, you should go for a smaller bottle.  If you are an Amazing Grace addict like myself, this is the way to go!  If Amazon could give you the ability to grant a single 6 star review for every 100 reviews you write, I&#x27;d use that bullet here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the scent of Amazing Grace and was expecting this to be as wonderful as the body lotions and perfumes I have used in the past. Sadly It didnt live up to expectations at all. The smell wasnt so good and was gone in a few minutes anyway. Absolutely not worth the money and no better than something you could buy at Walmart for 3 bucks. Such a shame as I really do love Amazing Grace.</li>
    <li> My sister and mother loved this as a Christmas gift.  I should have gotten one for me. Next time I will.</li>
    <li> I use this as a body wash (not as shampoo as listed on the bottle).  Bought it after I tried a sample and fell in love with the light, clean scent.  It doesn&#x27;t lather too much when using the body pouf in the shower...much better with a sponge.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time at a friend&#x27;s house. The smell is heavenly. It suds up quickly and cleanses your skin well. The scent is meant to be light and it is exactly that. If you&#x27;re looking for something strong and fragrant, try elsewhere. If you want something subtle and feminine, use this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderfully soft, feminine fragrence that feels floaty. It makes the skin soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfumes and I don&#x27;t usually use body wash, but a friend gave me Amazing Grace bath gel by Philosophy a while back and I decided I&#x27;d give it a try. I absolutely LOVE the scent of this body wash. It&#x27;s light, not perfume-y and leaves my skin soft with just a slight scent.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law loves it.  I always get it for her for Christmas.  She especially loved the scent of this one.  It is something that I will continue to buy for her in the future.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I like shower gels that make my skin feel hydrated after I get out of the shower... this one didn&#x27;t deliver. It&#x27;s a 3-in-1 combo (shampoo/bath gel/bubble bath) which I usually stay away from but it was priced right and Philosophy is a pretty good brand. Also, I know it&#x27;s pink so I didn&#x27;t expect it to smell masculine, but it smells really girly.</li>
    <li> Love all amazing grace products. I am not a big fragrance person either. It&#x27;s so light and the hint of it lingers perfectly. I like the gel and I have used it as a shampoo, and it&#x27;s a little heavy, but it makes your hair smell awesome.  A must have if you love amazing grace.</li>
    <li> I anxiously awaited and received this product in a timely manner via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent from the bottle is ever so &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and welcoming, but like Bath &amp; Body products it is meant to be layered with the other items, lotion, body spray, etc.  I&#x27;n not looking to invest in those that this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it 3 or 4 different times and have noticed itching the next day...I&#x27;m doing a process of elimination currently, as this is really the only &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; thing I&#x27;ve added to bathing, laundry, lotions...so time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years as a body wash and a shampoo. I do not like shampoos that have a fruity, overpowering perfuming scent to them. Amazing Grace is just right. I get compliments all the time. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> In the past I have found sometimes that a product might have a little longer shelf life than desired and have an old stale plastic smell (especially when dealing with their conditioner)  when being shipped from an unknown supplier. I did not find that with this product. It was promptly delivered once the order was placed and the product was perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used philosophy for years and love the scent of Amazing Grace.  I&#x27;ve tried other scents which were good too, but I always come back to this one.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Ok, I have not actually used this.  But my wife has.  She insisted I buy this for her as she said it would make her &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  Well...you can see from the five star review...this husband is sold.</li>
    <li> This product exceeds any written description.  It is clean smelling and not overpowering.  I am allergic to many of the popular fragrances sold in specialty stores but have not had any issues from the Philosophy product line.  I am hooked !! I work in the healthcare industry and many of the people I come in contact with comment on \\&quot;how good\\&quot; I smell and want to know what fragrance I am using.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love this product. It&#x27;s great for bubble baths as well as showers and for shampooing.</li>
    <li> I have been a Philosophy girl for years and was just hooked.  Always got great compliments from my patients.  My fav was Amazing Grace, but loved Pure and Inner too.&lt;br /&gt;But something has happened to it.  Now it just smells like chemicals.  I am so very disappointed.  The smell is not the same.  I have even written to the company, and did not even get an answer.  Philosophy whatever you did to the formula, please put it back the way it was, I miss it so much!&lt;br /&gt;I do think the smaller bottles still have some of the original scent.  I was buying the huge bottles, I was even on auto ship...................so sad!!  :{</li>
    <li> I have tried other Philosophy products and loved them.  When I saw how popular this product was, I decided to try it.  It is a nice product.  Feels good, smells great....but the scent is so delicate that it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. I am not a fan of strong perfumes...they give me awful headaches, but if this gel was scented just a little stronger, it would be perfect.  Thinking about ordering the scent in another product so I can layer it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Amazing Grace!  My husband bought me a gift pack for my birthday last year and I&#x27;ve been purchasing it ever since!</li>
    <li> This was my first bottle of anything Philosophy, but it won&#x27;t be my last. I&#x27;ve been using it for months (and I shower a lot); it lasts and lasts in the bottle. You don&#x27;t need a lot of gel on you loofah or cloth because it foams up luxuriously. At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but considering how long it has lasted, that&#x27;s not a problem. The smell is sweet and light. I don&#x27;t want a scent that overpowers because I&#x27;m sensitive to odors. When I bought it I was comparing ingredients, and it came out on top or I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. I may try some of Philosophy&#x27;s other scents, but then I&#x27;m pretty happy with this one.</li>
    <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t use a body wash on my hair, even though it says \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; on the bottle.  But this product is the perfect balance for my type of hair, which is fine, straight and average thickness.  My hair is colored and I recently got a body perm and the shampoo works great.  I used to have to wash my hair almost every day but not anymore.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It is great and it is just the beginning of smelling wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 8 years..I use it ias a body wash...Haven&#x27;t used it as shampoo..</li>
    <li> It smells really good! For body wash, it&#x27;s clean enough; but for face and hair the cleaning power is insufficient.</li>
    <li> Love Philosophy products!!  I use the facial tint, face scrub, and body spray!  I recommend this to those who like light scented products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, because it tends to dry out my skin a little, but I love the scent so much! It&#x27;s light, clean and feminine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this due to the reviews.  This stuff has no major fragrance and it is half the price at Sephora.  Beware these products can not be returned.  So you better love it!  Totally disappointed....</li>
    <li> Love this and the scent is so refreshing. I have very sensitive skin and this is wonderful It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I will be ordering more when this is gone.</li>
    <li> I love Philosophy Shower Gel.  It leaves a wonderful scent and its not overpowering.  It lasts a long time.  This was my 2nd purchase.  I plan to try another fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love Philosphy.  Great product.  It really smells great and lathers great.  Can use to wash your hair as well.</li>
    <li> Great product and shipping timely.  Just a tiny bit of this marvelously foaming and scented bath wash and you can feel wonderfully clean</li>
    <li> This smelled great the first time I used it, but after that it barely had any scent in the bottle and on my skin.  For the price, the scent should last.  Disappointed, since there are so many rave reviews about this product.</li>
    <li> Phiosophy products are the best,there&#x27;s not one bad scent among them. When you see philosophy you know you can&#x27;t go wrong. I bought this as a gift for my niece. I Love giving philosophy and I Love to recieve philosophy.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this item, I did read the earlier reviews so I cannot say I wasn&#x27;t warned. I found it true that the fragrance, however lovely, did not last. I did find it lathered well, using my shower pouf. What I did not expect was the astringent quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product daily for awhile, I found my skin becoming very dry and requiring additional application of lotion (which also killed this product&#x27;s fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to wash my hair every day but after a few applications, my hair began to frizz out, as it was very dry. I guess the ingredients label says it all, not much but chemicals in there.</li>
    <li> Love this clean fresh scent!</li>
    <li> a good product according to my wife. I would recommend and would buy again. need to check if they make this product for men also.</li>
    <li> I, bought this product because it &#x27;s something that i really like.  I, usually get it from QVC.  I, would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of those &amp;#34;almost great&amp;#34; scent experiences, and because it is so close to good, it is all that more disappointing. Will not buy again. Scent smells off somehow, and is so light NOBOBY smells it on me, not even myself. Big fat waste of money. I&#x27;m a consumer who will spend the money when I find something truly great. This is not it.</li>
    <li> I already wrote a review of Philosophy&#x27;s Amazing Grace body cream. I just love the fragrance of Amazing Grace. My favorite thing about the shower gel is after your bath the fringe stays on your skin for a long time...as in hours. I was surprised the first time I used it, I had had my shower about two hours prior to greeting my daughter for dinner. The first words from her after a hug was , &amp;#34; Mom you smell so good, what is that?&amp;#34; I was thrilled. Also the gel is very creamy &amp; thick so it goes a long way. I found I could get smaller more affordable sizes from Amazon than from another source on TV.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my mother on Mother&#x27;s Day. She loved the product and scent. I was very satisfied with the shipping, product, and smile on my mother&#x27;s face when she received it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. I wish it was cheaper - I love layering fragrances..and this is the start of something beautiful!</li>
    <li> I just love it! Leaves my skin feeling so silky soft, and refreshed. Would&#x27;ve loved it to be more lathering. Other than that, would highly recommend it! I will be purchasing another bottle!</li>
    <li> You just have to love Philosophy!  Amazing Grace is the perfect fragrance and I get numerous compliments!</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible.  It smells like really strong soap.  It is not sudsy or creamy.  I just don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews.  As a matter of fact, this is so bad I feel like I&#x27;m being &amp;#34;punked&amp;#34;, either by Amazon or Philosophy. I never return things, but this is going back.  I will use my Rain Bath shower gel, which is much better and less expensive.  I read that the company was sold and perhaps the recipe has changed but I would never purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this whole system...I use it as body wash and not shampoo. It is light and adds the extra bit of oomph to my overall scent. It lathers well... I use the lotion as well. I  have  been using if for about 2 months and I  LOVE it!!!! I get at least 2 compliments everyday...but not \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot; but \\&quot; You smell so good!\\&quot; My husband can&#x27;t stop smelling the crook of my neck. I even had a man in the grocery store stop me with his wife in tow and say \\&quot; I&#x27;m a married man and I am not trying to hit on you, but you smell really good!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW- I also use Philosophy&#x27;s Purity face wash and I like that just as much. People have been asking me over the last 3 months what make-up I use to make my skin look the way that it does, but I don&#x27;t wear any foundation or cover-up :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pricey line, so see if you can find the travel size to see if you like it before you buy it. A little bit goes a long way. I have all the products that I regularly use on the Amazon Subscribe and Save, which gives you a discount and you change the time between shipments very easily. :-) Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this stuff - but do not, EVER use it in your hair! It will dry the living daylights out of it! It smells amazing, and it lingers all day! Philosophy stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t go wrong getting this for my wife as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves the soft fragrance and the convenience of using a shower gel that also keeps her skin soft.</li>
