      <li>I have tons of nail colors, many from OPI, and this is probably my favorite.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but not what I thought it was</li>
      <li>This polish had a more purple look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful nice dark color for the winter time or anytime.</li>
      <li>Was happy to find OPI at this price...results for me were waaaaaay too purple and not enough &amp;#34;black-purple&amp;#34; as it appears in the photo.  </li>
      <li>Great color, easy application, stays on long and attract attention.</li>
      <li>My new favorite color!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super rich and creamy application.  </li>
      <li>Very dark purple but beautiful.</li>
      <li>Still a very pretty color</li>
      <li>No sparkles, not too loud, just a beautiful, deep eggplant-ish purple.  </li>
      <li>This color is a very nice dark purple shade.</li>
      <li>So Pretty!</li>
      <li>a fun twist, layer Polka.com over this.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>need a good black color</li>
      <li>Price was reasonable, shipping was quick.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly the color I wanted.</li>
      <li>The color you see on the screen is exactly the color the polish comes out to be.</li>
      <li>I have Maybelline&#x27;s Express finish pretty in purple.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok something different</li>
      <li>Pretty color</li>
      <li>It looks nearly exactly as it does in the photo and the color works</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really a pretty color.</li>
      <li>Definitely a bit more noticeably purple than the photo..</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to anyone that wants a stellar color to add to their collection.</li>
      <li>they are all with red undertones or pink undertones or bright as all heck.</li>
      <li>Super pretty deep purple.</li>
      <li>It looks great on my nails and wears very well with a base coat and top coat.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a vibrant color when I got it.</li>
      <li>One of my new favorites.</li>
      <li>This one is a deep, rich purple with blue undertones.</li>
      <li>Based on the photo I expected a true purple, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>After Dark, this  color is unique and contrasts skin tone well.  </li>
      <li>In fluorescent light (i.e. restaurant, bathroom) the color looks near black.  </li>
      <li>It starts out deep purple like eggplant but after you wear it for about a week it starts to turn more black.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very deep purple that goes on really well.</li>
      <li>The color represented in the photo is much darker than the actual color in person.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very deep purple and very flattering.</li>
      <li>really like this dark eggplant color from OPI.  </li>

<li> really like this dark eggplant color from OPI.  </li>
<li> It is a lot darker than expected and at first glance looks like black or dark blue.</li>
<li> I probably would not buy this color again, and am not sure when I would wear it again as I was looking for more of a red black (which ended up being the Black Cherry Chutney) instead of a purple black.  </li>
<li> it would like to say it took to long</li>
<li> I was hoping for a dark color, resembling the picture, but in natural sunlight it looks like a really dark purple.  </li>
<li> Thought I was getting black, especially with the name.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d say that the nails in the picture for this product look a little dark, but I suppose you could get that tone with enough</li>
<li> I bought it because I was running out of my other purple-blue color</li>
<li> Expected it to be that dark</li>
<li> but I thought it was black</li>
<li> Black Cherry Chutney.</li>
<li> I use it with the black shatter</li>
<li> ALL YEAR ROUND (not just fall &amp; winter).  </li>
<li> I was disappointed to find that the color is a much brighter purple in person.  </li>
<li> but I think it was just me anxiously waiting for it!</li>
<li> Very disappointing...</li>
<li> Also disappointed to find out that I can&#x27;t return it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is such a great quality of nail polish and it&#x27;s a perfect fall color. It&#x27;s such a deep purple. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This color is a very nice dark purple shade. It looks great on my nails and wears very well with a base coat and top coat.</li>
    <li> This color is freakin awesome!! The perfect fall color!!</li>
    <li> Great color, easy application, stays on long and attract attention.</li>
    <li> Beware before buying! The color represented in the photo is much darker than the actual color in person.  I was disappointed to find that the color is a much brighter purple in person.  Also disappointed to find out that I can&#x27;t return it!</li>
    <li> Thought I was getting black, especially with the name.</li>
    <li> No sparkles, not too loud, just a beautiful, deep eggplant-ish purple.  My new favorite color!  Price was reasonable, shipping was quick.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this color!! Very dark purple but beautiful. It starts out deep purple like eggplant but after you wear it for about a week it starts to turn more black. Still a very pretty color</li>
    <li> Great autumn color and great quality polish!  OPI produces great quality and stylish colors and textures in their polish lines.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and great quality.</li>
    <li> Color differed from what was shown. Expected it to be that dark and it&#x27;s a vibrant color when I got it. It&#x27;s ok but not what I thought it was</li>
    <li> The color is a deep grape.  It looks nearly exactly as it does in the photo and the color works ALL YEAR ROUND (not just fall &amp; winter).  I highly recommend to anyone that wants a stellar color to add to their collection.</li>
    <li> Not the color I wanted</li>
    <li> Was happy to find OPI at this price...results for me were waaaaaay too purple and not enough &amp;#34;black-purple&amp;#34; as it appears in the photo.  Chipped after one day but I did not use a top coat, to be fair.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE! It&#x27;s exactly the color I wanted. I have many purples but I they are all with red undertones or pink undertones or bright as all heck. This one is a deep, rich purple with blue undertones. I bought it because I was running out of my other purple-blue color I have Maybelline&#x27;s Express finish pretty in purple. Love the color.</li>
    <li> When you purchase a nail polish online all you trust is the picture. The color of the polish here is ink. The item in person is violet. I don&#x27;t like it at all. Very disappointing...</li>
    <li> I have tons of nail colors, many from OPI, and this is probably my favorite. It&#x27;s a very deep purple and very flattering. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love love love this polish! It&#x27;s a beautiful nice dark color for the winter time or anytime. It&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> This color is awesome, the online picture doesn&#x27;t even do it justice. One of my favorites. Super pretty deep purple. Great for any season.</li>
    <li> Based on the photo I expected a true purple, which is what I was looking for.  It is a lot darker than expected and at first glance looks like black or dark blue.</li>
    <li> LOVE this color!  And it goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> A gorgeous deep eggplant colour which is perfect for a fall/ winter mani/pedi. Formula is not streaky is opaque in two coats. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*For a fun twist, layer Polka.com over this. So Pretty!</li>
    <li> The color is absolutely gorgeous. I love it would like to say it took to long but I think it was just me anxiously waiting for it!</li>
    <li> In my opinion OPI is one on the top nail polishes out today. If you prefer darker shades then this is definitely for you. It only takes 2 coats to get the desired look.  It&#x27;s like a combined grape and purple</li>
    <li> Great color, and of course, the OPI quality is awesome. The purple is a good match for anyone looking to create designs or show their team spirit for the Baltimore Ravens. I use it with the black shatter and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s your standard OPI quality nail polish.  I bought this color, Midnight in Moscow and Black Cherry Chutney. I was hoping for a dark color, resembling the picture, but in natural sunlight it looks like a really dark purple.  In fluorescent light (i.e. restaurant, bathroom) the color looks near black.  I probably would not buy this color again, and am not sure when I would wear it again as I was looking for more of a red black (which ended up being the Black Cherry Chutney) instead of a purple black.  I think it would work well for Halloween or some sort of clubbing.  I think of this more as a weekend color rather than a work color.</li>
    <li> Pretty color but I thought it was black need a good black color it&#x27;s purple but it&#x27;s ok something different</li>
    <li> This polish had a more purple look. It&#x27;s really a pretty color. I love it. Only needs one coat</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. It&#x27;s a very deep purple that goes on really well. One of my new favorites.</li>
    <li> The color you see on the screen is exactly the color the polish comes out to be. I also got the product timely after my order.</li>
    <li> Long:&lt;br /&gt;I really like this dark eggplant color from OPI.  Goes on like a dream - you could definitely get away with only using one coat.  It&#x27;s a super rich and creamy application.  So used to seeing \\&quot;black\\&quot; purples like Lincoln Park After Dark, this  color is unique and contrasts skin tone well.  I&#x27;d say that the nails in the picture for this product look a little dark, but I suppose you could get that tone with enough coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short:&lt;br /&gt;This is a good one.</li>
    <li> Beautiful polish. transaction went beautifully, as expexpected</li>
    <li> Deep, beautiful purple! Definitely a bit more noticeably purple than the photo..&lt;br /&gt;.still a smashing color.</li>
