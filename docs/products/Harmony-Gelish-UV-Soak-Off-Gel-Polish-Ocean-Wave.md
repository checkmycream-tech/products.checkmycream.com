      <li>Gelish is a great range of products, and this is a particularly nice colour if you can find the clothes and season to fit it.  </li>
      <li>This gelish polish works very nice with either my UV light or my LED light.</li>
      <li>Beautiful bright blue color.</li>
      <li>It was wan&#x27;t sure if I would like the color from the online pics.</li>
      <li>I received lots of compliments and it looks adorable with Vegas Nights.  </li>
      <li>Again love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to have it in my collection</li>

      <li>Glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Great seller - fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Yes, this one has to be my favorite.</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this color.  </li>
      <li>love the Gelish product.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>but I loved it so much that I put it over Plum &amp; Done</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s still pretty, just nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>It might be okay to use on a full nail</li>
      <li>In direct sunlight however, the color looks very bright and very shimmery.     </li>
      <li>If you put a coat of regular clear on your nails after 5-7 days the gel will stay perfect for another week.</li>
      <li>Instead it is a bright, almost neon blue.  </li>
      <li>thank you very much for the product, remains haunted, I loved it, thanks for the attention and the speed with which they work, 100% recommended, greetings and thanks</li>
      <li>I love Ocean Wave - it is my favorite shade of blue - does require up to three coats, but</li>
      <li>This is a very pretty color.</li>
      <li>Very very pretty color.  </li>
      <li>It is also still very pretty.</li>
      <li>Gelish products work well and last a long time if applied perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This color is so pretty!</li>
      <li>cure each coat and then 1 coat of Ocean Blue, cure and top it off!  </li>
      <li>This color blue is my favorite of all and my nail clients too!</li>
      <li>This is a fun color and goes on well.</li>
      <li>well worth it</li>
      <li>If you are able to get enough layers of the color built up, it does turn out to be a good looking blue like pictured.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s probably what makes it such a lovely color.</li>
      <li>The color is exactly as shown in the picture.  </li>
      <li>If you look closely you see some shimmer, but for the most part, it&#x27;s just blue.</li>
      <li>Very pretty but very clear.</li>
      <li>with just two coats the color was vibrant!</li>
      <li>It really makes a statement.  </li>
      <li>I agree with others that it feels very nautical and beachy.  </li>
      <li>Very shimmery.</li>
      <li>Item was shipped fast and was as described.</li>
      <li>It is also very transparent and almost requires 3 coats to appear opaque.</li>
      <li>I will say that Gelish has been MUCH better than some other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments while wearing this color, more than any other Gelish shade I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a neon, but it&#x27;s quite vibrant, especially in direct sunlight.     </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re anywhere with natural sunlight (direct or not), the color looks more like its name, ocean blue.</li>
      <li>This color is very sheer and requires 3 coats for full coverage.  </li>
      <li>Based on the picture of the item, I was expecting Ocean Wave to be a deep, sophisticated blue.  </li>
      <li>That brings me to another point: the color looks a bit different in different lighting (even more with this Gelish color than others).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a middle of the road blue.</li>
      <li>Ocean Wave is a very pretty, metallic blue.</li>
      <li>I think with more practice, I&#x27;ll be able to get a thin enough coat on that it won&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty vibrant blue.</li>
      <li>- i always get compliments on my blue nails - a real crowd pleaser!</li>
      <li>The first coat of the color barely had a tint of blue in it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lighter blue, which I prefer (at least right now) to super dark blue.  </li>
      <li>Love the colour, but this one is a little thick.</li>

<li> Some of my nails are still a little transparent in places, but that&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m neurotic and pick out the flaws.</li>

<li> I used three coats and it still looks a little streaky.</li>
<li> I wore it for 12 days (about how long I wear the other colors before getting bored).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I would call it neon though.</li>
<li> I always use 3 very thin and even coats paying careful attention to seal the raw edge on the ends of the nails.  </li>
<li> and I hardly ever have problems with chipping or peeling.</li>
<li> This color takes at least 3 coats if not 4.</li>
<li> The bottle I have is crazy thin, I ended up putting on 4 coats of color + the base and top coats curing between each.</li>
<li> I put the base color on (usually 2 coats)</li>

    <li> Ocean Wave is a very pretty, metallic blue. I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a neon, but it&#x27;s quite vibrant, especially in direct sunlight.     That brings me to another point: the color looks a bit different in different lighting (even more with this Gelish color than others). Inside with indoor lighting, the color looks like regular, Crayola blue. If you look closely you see some shimmer, but for the most part, it&#x27;s just blue. It actually looks identical to Amazon&#x27;s swatch so it&#x27;s still pretty, just nothing spectacular. If you&#x27;re anywhere with natural sunlight (direct or not), the color looks more like its name, ocean blue. In direct sunlight however, the color looks very bright and very shimmery.     I have uploaded pictures taken in different lighting to describe the above description. It&#x27;s a bit hard to describe the \\&quot;accurate\\&quot; color of this polish, because it&#x27;s pretty multi-dimensional. That&#x27;s probably what makes it such a lovely color. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments while wearing this color, more than any other Gelish shade I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
    <li> Based on the picture of the item, I was expecting Ocean Wave to be a deep, sophisticated blue.  Instead it is a bright, almost neon blue.  It is also very transparent and almost requires 3 coats to appear opaque.</li>
    <li> Loved this!!! The pic does not do the blue justice!</li>
    <li> love the Gelish product.  Lasts for weeks if applied properly and if taken  care of can last 2 weeks or longer</li>
    <li> It was wan&#x27;t sure if I would like the color from the online pics.I used three coats to get the deep color. It is an eye catching color.</li>
    <li> I bought several bottle of Gelish nail polish for my daughters around Christmas time. Within six months several of the polishes were runny and did not cover/make designs well. I would not recommend buying this product without knowing if the product is &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;. I have friends who love Gelish polish, I unfortunately have not had the same experience.</li>
    <li> Appeared as see through.  Needed 3 coats color.</li>
    <li> this is a good summer color for a darker, but still bright hue.  with just two coats the color was vibrant!</li>
    <li> My daughter told me to purchase this color of polish.  Glad I did.  Loved it - got so many compliments!</li>
    <li> Nice polish. Beautiful color.Glides on nicely.Would purchase this brand again. Color is versitile for summer or fall.  Again love it.</li>
    <li> Still getting the hang of doing my own nails. Love the colour, but this one is a little thick. I think with more practice, I&#x27;ll be able to get a thin enough coat on that it won&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
    <li> Very very pretty color.  It really makes a statement.  I agree with others that it feels very nautical and beachy.  I wore it for 12 days (about how long I wear the other colors before getting bored).  I received lots of compliments and it looks adorable with Vegas Nights.  Great seller - fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I only buy and use Harmony Gelish products. This color blue is my favorite of all and my nail clients too!</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this color.  It&#x27;s a lighter blue, which I prefer (at least right now) to super dark blue.  It was quite thick, however, so it can mess up while trying to dry it with the LED light. I&#x27;m hoping it settles like some of my other Gelish colors have.  I will say that Gelish has been MUCH better than some other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This color is very sheer and requires 3 coats for full coverage.  It&#x27;s lighter than the picture appears and shimmers!  Looks great under mint icing and over or under Midnight Caller.  I am in my 40&#x27;s so I can&#x27;t pull off the blue color alone but I loved it so much that I put it over Plum &amp; Done and it was absolutely gorgeous!  I received several compliments and it looked like a 2 tone polish depending on the lighting - sometimes it looked blue and sometimes purple.  I&#x27;ve put Ocean Blue over many colors and it&#x27;s the one that always looks great!  Looks awesome over Starburst too!  I would recommend this if you like experiementing with mixing colors.  I put the base color on (usually 2 coats) cure each coat and then 1 coat of Ocean Blue, cure and top it off!  Looks great!!</li>
    <li> Yes, this one has to be my favorite. Two coats! Definitely stands out, I get lots of comments on my blue fingernails.</li>
    <li> thank you very much for the product, remains haunted, I loved it, thanks for the attention and the speed with which they work, 100% recommended, greetings and thanks</li>
    <li> I bought Ocean Wave to use for a color french tip. I found it to be way too sheer. The first coat of the color barely had a tint of blue in it. This color takes at least 3 coats if not 4. It might be okay to use on a full nail but it just didn&#x27;t work out great to use on the tips of the nails. If you are able to get enough layers of the color built up, it does turn out to be a good looking blue like pictured.</li>
    <li> Gelish is a great range of products, and this is a particularly nice colour if you can find the clothes and season to fit it.  Bought in a small beauty supply store as a gift for my wife, it&#x27;s been added to her regular collection.</li>
    <li> This is my favourite colour of all of the Gelish polishes.  It is a beautiful jewel tone.  I used to get this colour put on at the salon before going on vacations to sunny locations.  Now I do it myself at home.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bright blue color. Item was shipped fast and was as described. This is a fun color and goes on well.</li>
    <li> This color is lighter than the image on amazon. I&#x27;m not sure I would call it neon though. It&#x27;s more like a middle of the road blue. It is also still very pretty. The bottle I have is crazy thin, I ended up putting on 4 coats of color + the base and top coats curing between each. Some of my nails are still a little transparent in places, but that&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m neurotic and pick out the flaws. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very cute color! I&#x27;m glad to have it in my collection and I&#x27;m going to try layering it like others have said.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m at the ocean everytime stare at this polish on my nails.  Gelish polish lasts 10 days for me once I have painted my nails.  I have found that this color works best with a 4 minute UV cure time on the last coat.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s a pretty vibrant blue. The default picture on here does it no justice. I was holding off on purchasing it until I saw it in person at a beauty store. Now every time I use it I always get compliments. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  The color is exactly as shown in the picture.  It took maybe twice for me to get the hang of using the gel, but now everybody thinks that I&#x27;m getting manicures.  If you put a coat of regular clear on your nails after 5-7 days the gel will stay perfect for another week.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty color. This gelish polish works very nice with either my UV light or my LED light.</li>
    <li> This color is so pretty! Compliments all the time on this one.  Gelish products work well and last a long time if applied perfectly.  I always use 3 very thin and even coats paying careful attention to seal the raw edge on the ends of the nails.  I also cure the top coat twice and I hardly ever have problems with chipping or peeling.</li>
    <li> My wife never does her nails but bought this and now she does it herself everyother week and loves it, saves me a ton of cash and she likes it and looks good also...</li>
    <li> I was expecting a deep royal blue. This is a very sheer transparent blue. I used three coats and it still looks a little streaky. I&#x27;ll try it with four coats next time.</li>
    <li> I love Ocean Wave - it is my favorite shade of blue - does require up to three coats, but well worth it - i always get compliments on my blue nails - a real crowd pleaser!</li>
    <li> Very pretty but very clear. I use it for layering in gradient nails and its great. You could also get neat effects layering this over other colors to create depth. Very shimmery.</li>
