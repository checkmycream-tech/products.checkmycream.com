      <li>The Best thing for traveling, and so Easy to use</li>
      <li>Anyway, works good for cologne or perfume</li>
      <li>really loved it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>because there is a lot of plastic in this, it&#x27;s a good idea to use for 1 fragrance per atomizer.</li>
      <li>I dropped my favorite perfume bottle &amp; the nozzle broke off, so this was perfect for me to still be able to use the perfume, just keep filling this up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product itself.</li>
      <li>I saw reviews on Youtube about it many times and heard great things.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have tried it took 3 more....... very very very nice</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be happier with a more attractive design, but overall this has to be considered a superb product at a great price.</li>
      <li>amazing product.</li>
      <li>Reliable, durable, handy and compact.</li>
      <li>Kind of like refilling a lighter with butane.</li>
      <li>This atomizer is a handy thing to have for travel, but it does take some experience to figure out how to efficiently get your cologne to squirt up into the storage chamber.  </li>
      <li>And from that moment I didn&#x27;t take anywhere, and decided to not fill it with any kind of liquid at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>though I&#x27;m not giving a perfect score because I find the price too much for the purpose it&#x27;s serving.</li>
      <li>very easy to fill and takes up no space whatsoever.  </li>
      <li>Refills by the way are very easy.</li>
      <li>Love it, will buy more!</li>
      <li>So easy to fill!</li>
      <li>very handy and on the go useful</li>
      <li>By the way, right now, I smell quite interesting!!</li>
      <li>They fit in the tinniest location in your purse/backpack/jeans!</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this Travelo Travel Spray.</li>
      <li>Interesting that they say the price was reduced from $20.</li>
      <li>But for God&#x27;s sake, make sure you are not using Butane.</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love the gold color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  </li>
      <li>I bought the one from Fragrancenet.com and that one is much better quality.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I am quite satisfied with it</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>Im sure</li>
      <li>It is cute and elegant, and even has a window to see the level of liquid inside the atomizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad this product has worked well for others, but I won&#x27;t take the risk again.</li>
      <li>I love my travalo, i bring it in my purse and will put it in my clutch if i go out dancing.</li>
      <li>the perfume just bubbled over the top.</li>
      <li>then got two more.</li>
      <li>The folks I&#x27;ve shown it to have been impressed, and I keep it with me regularly for a quick freshen up.</li>
      <li>Unlike other atomizers I&#x27;ve tried, these hold up perfectly in the pressurized atmosphere of a plane, and the TSA has never looked twice at them.  </li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;d read the reviews I was still amazed at how easy it was to fill (took me 3 seconds!)and</li>
      <li>the fill instructions are easy to understand and well-written.</li>
      <li>It is also so so easy to use</li>
      <li>So easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to pump and no leaks.</li>
      <li>this tiny package is a beautiful gold pocket mode&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and</li>
      <li>/&gt;Everything is fine</li>
      <li>and it also leaked when I filled it with perfume.</li>
      <li>, just don&#x27;t try to light your cigarette with it.</li>
      <li>so it can fit into the smallest of clutches/wristlets for a night-out.</li>
      <li>it filled and worked like a charm.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>-18 came on the 13th great shipping and because i had a gift card i only paid 2.10 definately suggest buying its very nice and compact and mine works like a charm</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say but they are perfect, small, easy to fill and convenient during travelling.</li>
      <li>For a week long trip I was looking for a hardy and easy to use but attractive atomizer for my dress up Vintage Shalimar.</li>
      <li>My whole purse was ruined!!!</li>
      <li>For the first 2 weeks, it was ok</li>
      <li>ok in the first 2 - 3 weeks ,</li>
      <li>It was even easier to fill than I thought - just remove the head from your original perfume bottle, slip the bottom of the Travalo Atomizer onto the exposed stem, and pump like you were spraying yourself.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited to get this.</li>
      <li>so worth it and easy to use.</li>
      <li>okay, so i used the other two and loved them.</li>
      <li>I loved the idea of this product, especially the way it fills.  </li>
      <li>I loved how the Travalo fills by pumping it from a larger bottle.</li>
      <li>Small, light, and leak-proof, the Travalo perfume atomizers are a snap to fill, easy to carry, and provide a great way to refresh one&#x27;s chosen scent when on the go.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a quick spray of cologne or purfume on the go.</li>
      <li>It should be noted that the color of this particular product is much more gold than it appears on my monitor</li>
      <li>It really does work, and it&#x27;s so easy and simple to fill, plus nice and compact for packing.</li>
      <li>I plan to give these to friends this year along with their favorite perfume, for a wow Christmas gift.</li>
      <li>Available in several colors, they&#x27;re ideal for those of us who pair our perfumes with the environment and venue in which we will be, and thus require multiple atomizers, each one immediately identifiable without the necessity of labeling.  </li>
      <li>The gold sticks out so easy to keep track of, filling it could be done by a 2 year old, and the glass &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; helps you keep track for when it needs a refill.</li>
      <li>I read about this cute little bullet shaped travel atomizer and thought it would be great for an upcoming long cruise.</li>
      <li>easy to use and refill, looks nice, small to put in pocket to freshen up after being outdoors a while</li>
      <li>Otherwise your Angel will start smelling like Ck1 and who wants that!</li>
      <li>I would recommend buying different colors if you are going to keep these for yourself and want to be able to tell at a glance what fragrance you want to take...</li>
      <li>At last I can have my favorite colognes with me when I&#x27;m on the road.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have now made it my mission to stock up on these, I can&#x27;t get enough of them! They fit in the tinniest location in your purse/backpack/jeans! And if you travel alot via airplane they are perfect for security airports.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this. I saw reviews on Youtube about it many times and heard great things. Not one of them ever said that it has ever leaked for them. I have filled up this atomizer many times and maybe used it a few times, it would always end up empty and my purse would smell strongly of whatever I put in there. Im sure its a legit Travalo so I don&#x27;t think I got sent a knock-off, I am really disappointed. :( I wish mine wouldn&#x27;t leak because its a really great invention/idea otherwise.</li>
    <li> I love this Travelo Travel Spray. So easy to use. It is perfect for my purse.I bought it in two colors for two different scents I like to use.</li>
    <li> Small, light, and leak-proof, the Travalo perfume atomizers are a snap to fill, easy to carry, and provide a great way to refresh one&#x27;s chosen scent when on the go.  Available in several colors, they&#x27;re ideal for those of us who pair our perfumes with the environment and venue in which we will be, and thus require multiple atomizers, each one immediately identifiable without the necessity of labeling.  Unlike other atomizers I&#x27;ve tried, these hold up perfectly in the pressurized atmosphere of a plane, and the TSA has never looked twice at them.  I&#x27;ve purchased and use the black, silver, soft pink, and red versions of the Travalo, and keep the gold one for my signature scent, 24 Faubourg, by Hermes.  All have been refilled at least seven or eight times, and the mating between the atomizers and the parent bottles has never failed.  I&#x27;d be happier with a more attractive design, but overall this has to be considered a superb product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product even if you&#x27;re not travelling at all! I&#x27;ve noticed that even EDP fades away in the afternoon. And with this in my purse, I can take my favorite scent with me all day long.</li>
    <li> This travel perfume atomizer is awesome. Super-easy to refill from a spray bottle. It is cute and elegant, and even has a window to see the level of liquid inside the atomizer. I am ordering two more for my nieces because I just have to share this wonderful find!</li>
    <li> This leaked all over my bag. It couldn&#x27;t even contain my perfume longer than 24 hours. waste of my money</li>
    <li> I bought this I love this this tiny package is a beautiful gold pocket mode&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Everything is fine&lt;br /&gt;I really loved it.&lt;br /&gt;My friend also said good-looking you are unable to tell the difference. So far so good. I recommend buying this product</li>
    <li> I bought this because I travel frequently and didn&#x27;t want to have to deal with packing my regular sized perfume bottle.  This little thing is perfect for travel and is small enough to keep in my clutch wallet.  The filling mechanism is incredibly easy to use, and I&#x27;ve only had to refill it once (about 1 month of daily use).  The cap is tight enough that I&#x27;m not worried about it coming open in my bag, and the little window helps me see how much perfume is left.</li>
    <li> I love my travalo, i bring it in my purse and will put it in my clutch if i go out dancing. My perfume easily pumps into it, but does get a little perfume coming out if the nozzle is too big for the travalo pump. The only issue is, you have to spray out the entire thing if you want to put a different perfume in it or else they will mix.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these. Can&#x27;t say but they are perfect, small, easy to fill and convenient during travelling. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> At last I can have my favorite colognes with me when I&#x27;m on the road.  I was skeptical of the filling method, but it worked perfectly on my spray bottles of Eav Des Beaux and Wild Fern.  The splash bottles require the use of a hypodermic (w/o needle) to fill.  I put the needle on to reach into the splash bottle to fill the hypo, then remove it to fill the Travalo.  Total cost for hypo/needle combo: $.79 at the local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> The Best thing for traveling, and so Easy to use</li>
    <li> They sold me a fake Travalo product. It doesn&#x27;t even say &amp;#34;Travalo&amp;#34; on the side of the atomizer and it also leaked when I filled it with perfume.</li>
    <li> I received a black box with this product in it. The only thing that said Travalo on it was a sticker they placed on the back with a UPC code. The box is NOT Travalo. Will demand my money back.</li>
    <li> I loved how the Travalo fills by pumping it from a larger bottle. However, I brought it with me on a flight and it leaked in my liquids bag. I opened it on the plane and it reeked of perfume. Will not be repurchasing and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Small enough to satisfy the TSA - Thousand Standing Around, and large enough to hold a few days worth of spray. That&#x27;s a subjective statement, because if you spray constantly, like your trying to hide the fact you haven&#x27;t showered for a few days, this may not last for you. But for normal use, I can go a week between refills. Refills by the way are very easy. Just take the atomizer off you perfume or cologne bottle, insert it into the bottom of this Travalo, and pump a few times to fill up. Kind of like refilling a lighter with butane. But for God&#x27;s sake, make sure you are not using Butane. In fact, I&#x27;m surprised there is not a warning against using Butane. You know, there are lawyers out there just waiting to take on that case. I can see the late night ads now...&amp;#34;Have you been injured in a car wreck, slipped in a store aisle, pumped Butane in your Travalo?&amp;#34; Anyway, works good for cologne or perfume, just don&#x27;t try to light your cigarette with it.</li>
    <li> Awsome item! Reliable, durable, handy and compact. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a quick spray of cologne or purfume on the go.</li>
    <li> amazing product. very handy and on the go useful</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! No longer need to buy travel sized bottles of my perfume as I can fill this one with whatever perfume I want! So easy to fill!</li>
    <li> Do not leaking practical&lt;br /&gt;I loved it suitable price. I&#x27;ll have tried it took 3 more....... very very very nice</li>
    <li> I heard about the Travalo through a YouTube channel and came online to give it a shot. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product itself. It&#x27;s small, holds a few days worth of perfume or cologne, and easily passes through airport security without any alarms. It should be noted that the color of this particular product is much more gold than it appears on my monitor -- It&#x27;s almost the color of the Amazon logo. The folks I&#x27;ve shown it to have been impressed, and I keep it with me regularly for a quick freshen up. If you have more than one cologne or perfume, you can mix your scents, too!</li>
    <li> The plug broke and the atomizer is now useless.  I bought the one from Fragrancenet.com and that one is much better quality.</li>
    <li> The container leaked after just a few uses. Very poor quality.</li>
    <li> perfect for traveling, loved how easy it was to fill and use!</li>
    <li> Better than expected.</li>
    <li> The best travel atomizer! Read about it in Sky Mall and had to have one. It really does work, and it&#x27;s so easy and simple to fill, plus nice and compact for packing. It&#x27;s also clearly well made and very thick so won&#x27;t break. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it when traveling, but I also slip it in my bag when I want to freshen up my fragrance throughout the day. It&#x27;s the perfect size, so I can slip it into my everyday purse, my gym bag, and even my little evening bag. I plan to give these to friends this year along with their favorite perfume, for a wow Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> easy to use and refill, looks nice, small to put in pocket to freshen up after being outdoors a while</li>
    <li> so worth it and easy to use. no leakage , great product. enough said what more can i say &#x27; buy it&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> i had first heard about this product on youtube and went to the manufacturer&#x27;s website and it was almost twice as much as the price on amazon. this really is a great deal! the atomizer is really tiny so it can fit into the smallest of clutches/wristlets for a night-out. it has a decent amount of sprays. the fill instructions are easy to understand and well-written. i did have a bit of trouble filling the atomizer for a minute or two, then it worked like a dream. i would recommend getting a few in different colors if you have several favorite fragrances you like to switch between.</li>
    <li> This is the best travel item I&#x27;ve ever bought.  For ages, I never took cologne with me on trips because 1) airline carryon restrictions on liquids and 2) leaky bottles.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product.  It was even easier to fill than I thought - just remove the head from your original perfume bottle, slip the bottom of the Travalo Atomizer onto the exposed stem, and pump like you were spraying yourself.  The compact size fits easily in purse, takes up minimal space in the quart-sized baggie required by airlines for carryons, and has never leaked!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This worked well for a couple of months, and then it leaked everything -- which not only meant the loss of the perfume, but also destroyed a lot of things in my makeup bag.  Turns out perfume will melt stuff.  Who knew!  I&#x27;m glad this product has worked well for others, but I won&#x27;t take the risk again.</li>
    <li> Interesting that they say the price was reduced from $20. This is NOT true because this model retails for $16.from the company and also from a store close to where I live. The $20. model comes with a case. There should also be a 10 year warenty that comes with it. Just my opinion but this is a bit dishonest...wonder what the shipping is compared to getting it direct from travalo. the store down from me does free shipping....no big deal unless saving a few bucks is important to you, it is to me.</li>
    <li> very easy to fill and takes up no space whatsoever.  Makes the TSA very happy which is always a good thing</li>
    <li> It seemed really yellow more than gold in the image shown but when delivered it was such a flattering shade of gold. Easy to pump and no leaks. Quite small but holds a good amount of spray and it was delivered by the amazon expected delivery date! Might buy another one just for another color.</li>
    <li> Bought this atomizer to put some of my j&#x27;adore in because the pump on my big bottle of j&#x27;adore is broken. Well, it didn&#x27;t work. The atomizer is cute but smaller than I thought.</li>
    <li> I dropped my favorite perfume bottle &amp; the nozzle broke off, so this was perfect for me to still be able to use the perfume, just keep filling this up.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, three Atomizers.  I tried each on a different fragrance.  Each of my fragrances is released from the SIDE of the white protuberance of each bottle.  If possible I am going to return this product and just stick to roll-ons.  Did anyone else experience this problem.  By the way, right now, I smell quite interesting!!</li>
    <li> Great product that allowed me to use my spray perfume to make a purse atomizer. Small and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> This atomizer is a handy thing to have for travel, but it does take some experience to figure out how to efficiently get your cologne to squirt up into the storage chamber.  My suggestion is to follow the directions, and when re-loading, DO NOT PUMP it TOO VIGOROUSLY.  Over time, the soft plastic that seals the nipple (female part) will deteriorate and leak.  I think mine worked as advertised for about 10 refills, then began leaking for the next 10, and is now useless. YMMV.  I&#x27;m going to try the newer version, or a different brand.</li>
    <li> i love it it is just what i needed for a longggg time estimated delivery date was july 13-18 came on the 13th great shipping and because i had a gift card i only paid 2.10 definately suggest buying its very nice and compact and mine works like a charm</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of these. One I have not had to refill as of yet, but the other I have refilled  and it leaks badly. I own a few different brands so I am aware of how to carefully refill this type of bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for 3 months now and refilled it for around 5x and no leaks so far. I am quite satisfied with it though I&#x27;m not giving a perfect score because I find the price too much for the purpose it&#x27;s serving.</li>
    <li> My friend has a black one, she loves it! So i bought 2 - pink and gold. Gold looks the best, lighter than on the picture and looks very fancy! If you can&#x27;t decide what color to buy, pick this one!!!&lt;br /&gt;I put a little perfume in it and left it to see if it leaks. I will update in a couple of days to tell the result ))))</li>
    <li> Use it all time. Doesn&#x27;t leak and I have my favorite perfume with me in my purse everywhere !!! Recommend it</li>
    <li> This item performs exactly as advertised. It is very easy to refill and saves me money because I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive travel sizes of my favorite perfume. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works!  No leaks, no mess: just works.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of this product, especially the way it fills.  However, the atomizer end leaked immediately and was unusable.  It immediately went into the trash, along with a few ounces of my favorite (discontinued) perfume.</li>
    <li> It is so handy! It is also so so easy to use and I absolutely love the gold color. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This one didn&#x27;t hold the perfume, it leaked out.  Haven&#x27;t had the problem with other refillable perfume sprays.  Perhaps I received a faulty one.</li>
    <li> i first ordered one of this. it filled and worked like a charm. then got two more. one of them didn&#x27;t fill up. the perfume just bubbled over the top. i thought it was a freak defective piece. okay, so i used the other two and loved them. then they needed to be refilled and the same problem - they just wouldn&#x27;t fill up and bubbled all over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/3. something&#x27;s wrong with the way this thing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i finally got the one with the built-in funnel at one end.</li>
    <li> I read about this cute little bullet shaped travel atomizer and thought it would be great for an upcoming long cruise. Although I&#x27;d read the reviews I was still amazed at how easy it was to fill (took me 3 seconds!)and how compact (small) the bottle was but still able to hold a lot of my perfume. Because it is such a small size and easy to carry I will be using it in my purse &amp; evening bags when I go out. After showing this to a friend she wanted one for herself and is planning on giving some as gifts. I am going to order a few more as gifts and also a couple extra for myself so that I can have a couple of my favorite fragrances ready to go when I go out. I would recommend buying different colors if you are going to keep these for yourself and want to be able to tell at a glance what fragrance you want to take...(gold is for Angel and another color will be for Chanel #5). Love it!</li>
    <li> I choose this product after I wasted many perfumes by putting them in my car and letting sun changes them chemically, so I decided to have this thing so I wouldn&#x27;t bring my perfume where I go anytime.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok in the first 2 - 3 weeks , after that it kept leaking where you should fill it. Even it round some of my clothes. And from that moment I didn&#x27;t take anywhere, and decided to not fill it with any kind of liquid at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after all , i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> For a week long trip I was looking for a hardy and easy to use but attractive atomizer for my dress up Vintage Shalimar. Found it! The gold sticks out so easy to keep track of, filling it could be done by a 2 year old, and the glass &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; helps you keep track for when it needs a refill. The sprayer worked perfectly and the cap stayed put. There was no leakage at all and it seems to be resistant to dings/scratches. Love it, will buy more! Imp note: because there is a lot of plastic in this, it&#x27;s a good idea to use for 1 fragrance per atomizer. Otherwise your Angel will start smelling like Ck1 and who wants that!</li>
    <li> After using for a few times and i don&#x27;t even use it often, it starts to leak from the bottom pumping area. My whole purse was ruined!!! Bad quality. Do NOT recommand!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought Travalo Gold Unisex Atomizer for my cologne.  For the first 2 weeks, it was ok but afterwards, it started to leak in the area where you use to pump the cologne into.  Must be a flaw in the design because I notice other reviews say the same thing. What a waste of my $10.</li>
    <li> Does not work on my perfume bottle . I am bummed as I cannot use it.  Oh well, another one bites the dust.</li>
