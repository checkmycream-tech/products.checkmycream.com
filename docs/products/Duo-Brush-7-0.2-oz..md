      <li>but when I tried to use the Brush #7 it did not apply smoothly.</li>
      <li>but well worth the money!</li>
      <li>Works great as expected</li>

      <li>So much so, that I bought this 2nd brush to use in my travel stuff.  </li>
      <li>If the brush wobbles too much, you will have a mess on your hands.  </li>

    <li> I use this brush with Dipbrow and love the way it creates a precise, defined line.  It&#x27;s narrow and stiff and is the perfect brush for that purpose.  However, I find I wear out these brushes rather quickly.  The bristles begin to spread after a while and I have to buy a new one and they&#x27;re not exactly cheap.  When I&#x27;ve inspected cheaper brushes, they&#x27;ve not been as firm and stiff as the Anastasia brushes, which, to me at least, makes them less likely to be effective.  With Dipbrow, the stiffness of the brush is the key to applying it in a precise line.  If the brush wobbles too much, you will have a mess on your hands.  This brush is perfectly suited to brow powder as well.  I&#x27;m giving it five stars anyway because I haven&#x27;t found another brush that&#x27;s as good.  I just wish I wasn&#x27;t purchasing this expensive brush several times a year.</li>
    <li> Does what it should.  Works like a dream.  I use the brow powder that goes with this brush, and I think this brush is crucial.  So much so, that I bought this 2nd brush to use in my travel stuff.  Compact size, but well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love it!! I use it every time I do my eyebrows. Goes perfectly well with the ABH Dipbrow pomade!</li>
    <li> I also bought the Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade in Ebony and it works beautifully but when I tried to use the Brush #7 it did not apply smoothly. The brush also did not pick up the product as well either. Would not buy it.</li>
    <li> Got this with the Dipbrow pomade. Works perfectly with that item. Tad soft for bristles but that means no scratchy feeling when filling in brows. Good size for traveling.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed-2tools in one. Quality is better than anything you can find at any beauty store. Very precise brow liner.  Love it</li>
    <li> Purchased before until my daughter took it. :)</li>

    <li> Anastasia never disappoints!</li>
