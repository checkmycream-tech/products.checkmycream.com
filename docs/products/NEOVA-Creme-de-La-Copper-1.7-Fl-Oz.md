    <li> I have been using this creme for a few years now.  I have dry mature skin and this product adds moisture and luster to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Other products claim to do the same as this product but do not deliver.  You can apply A.M. - P.M. It mixes well with foundations or&lt;br /&gt;any other skin product.&lt;br /&gt;All of the Neova product are superior to other brands.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product!  Not greasy, not oily, no smell - it just works!  Buy it you will it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JanSimpson</li>
    <li> Love this product, face feels plumper and does not break me out. I use it mostly during the night.</li>
    <li> I have never seen better results for overall skin quality in such a short amount of time.  I&#x27;ve used it twice, I&#x27;m hooked.  It&#x27;s thick and goes on smoothly, no perfume smell.  Can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in a month.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time. I have allergies, and this product contains none of the items I can&#x27;t use.  It is easy to apply and dries right away.  Can apply make-up almost right away.  The only problem I have is that one cannot tell when it is empty until the  last time you pump it, and nothing comes out.  I&#x27;ve learned to always have another one in stock.</li>
    <li> I really to not see any difference in this product.  It is very expensive for the amount in the container.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and the price too. it leaves my face and neck feeling very good. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a year now and I love the texture and results it&#x27;s given me.</li>
    <li> I could only use this product for one week.  Everytime I put it on, the scent of this cream was very offensive to me.  I felt like I had to hold my nose for a few minutes after putting it on. My friend didn&#x27;t mind the scent so I gave the cream to her. During the one week I used the product, I saw no change in my skin texture. No biggie. I didn&#x27;t expect to after such a short time.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried it and I am hooked.  I have very dry skin and this product keeps my skin dewy fresh.</li>
    <li> I began using this product upon the recommendation of a professional &amp; I use it for years, day &amp; night &amp; I find it offers good result always &amp; keep my skin hydrated, smooth &amp; fresh. It&#x27;s my everyday &#x27;go to&#x27; facial cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and enjoy the moisturizers it contains.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great product and good quality!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with beauty creams.  I am 60ish ;) and always seeking the next best thing.  I read up on copper and started looking for a copper cream.  Ordered this, so wonderful, so soothing, smooth, non-greasy, really good.  I don&#x27;t know what the copper is doing but I have high hopes. Either way I love this cream.  I have the empty container here on my bedside table to remind me to order more.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. This was a reorder.</li>
    <li> already use product, but the price was right</li>
    <li> this product was recommended by my doctor some ten years ago and it has helped my skin so much that I have continued to use it since then.</li>
