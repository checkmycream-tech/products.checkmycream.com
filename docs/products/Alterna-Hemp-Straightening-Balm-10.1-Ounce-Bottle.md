      <li>This product is great for \\&quot;mixed-breed\\&quot; hair.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use too!</li>
      <li>Its a great product, and does exactly what it claims to do: straighten hair while drying it without frizz.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast, great result and easy to use!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years now.  </li>
      <li>and I just love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product, but it took almost three weeks before I received it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and really love it.</li>
      <li>Yes, love this product</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make your hair flat, it was just perfect.</li>
      <li>My hair gets tangled and breaks way more easily when I use this.</li>
      <li>Hair is easy to blow-dry and style.</li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny Serum is a much better way to go.  </li>
      <li>My hair is smooth...</li>
      <li>The pump was taped securely and the bottle placed in popcorn, to prevent leaks and damage.  </li>
      <li>but since, no longer available in my area?</li>
      <li>Alterna, please bring back the original formula!!!</li>
      <li>This is a good product overall, it does not leave my hair any straighter</li>
      <li>plus I received the item quickly.  </li>
      <li>Because I was no longer able to locate Alterna Products where I am in New Jersey, someone suggested trying the Internet.  </li>
      <li>it is amazingly straight and super shiny!</li>
      <li>Your hair is more manageable and soft.</li>
      <li>Hooray for finding a reliable, economical source for one of my must-have hair products.</li>
      <li>Looks natural but helps even the dryest hair look healthy.  </li>
      <li>It works great and leaves my hair shiny, tame, and STRAIGHT!!    </li>
      <li>I tried it right away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still searching for the right product.</li>
      <li>, you get the right amount of \\&quot;hold\\&quot; without stiffness.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised in a good way when I saw how big the product was!</li>
      <li>It is pretty over priced, but works well.</li>
      <li>I really feel like I threw 19 dollars in the garbage!     </li>
      <li>Even with shipping, the total was under $20, about the cost of the 5 oz size at most retailers (online and off).  </li>
      <li>I was able to purchase Alterna products local</li>
      <li>does* help straighten my long very fine and frizzy hair, but it leaves it sticky and tangly in the process.</li>
      <li>And using as directed this product leaves much to be desired.  </li>
      <li>Think I used too much.  </li>
      <li>Gave it to my sister who has very frizzy hair</li>
      <li>Having used dozens of brands, I have to say the Aterna product does more to straighten my waves than any other.</li>
      <li>Not only does it help to get my hair super straight it also holds it in to place.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the product and the company I purchased it from.</li>
      <li>This is the only straightening product that resists humidity on my biracial (varying from fine and straight, wavy and medium to coarse coils).      </li>
      <li>Smells great but not overwhelming, and it leaves my hair so much easier to style with a round brush and blow dryer.</li>
      <li>that summer is fast approaching.  </li>
      <li>I find it works wonders on my natural curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I like my hair to be soft without frizz.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this above anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I highly reccomend the product; the only issue is with the dispenser, which is not a tube as shown, but a bottle with a pump, which often sticks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this exact same product (same ounces and everything) from a local beauty supply store at $30.</li>
      <li>I usually mix it with another straightening serum to really help protect my hair from frizzies in high humidity.</li>

<li> I blew dry my hair and when it was dried, my hair looked amazingly straight!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s silky but flat.</li>
<li> it works wonders along with a flat iron.</li>
<li> It appears to be the same product, packaging is a little different and although the fragrance is slightly different, it works the same.  </li>
<li> and I am not a young chick.  </li>
<li> I have naturally curly (tight!)</li>
<li> It shipped earlier than expected!</li>
<li> A little goes a long way so this size bottle will last a while.  </li>

<li> That&#x27;s about the only positive thing I can say unfortunately.    </li>
<li> I used on towel dried hair and also kept reapplying as I straightened with my flat iron and comb.  </li>
<li> Not sure about this product - only used it once</li>
<li> It also gives a measure of protection of hair from the extreme heat.</li>
<li> All I had to do was wash my hair with my regular shampoo and conditioner, then dried my hair a little and applied the product.</li>
<li> I ran out after 2 years, so I was desperate to get it replaced quickly.  </li>
<li> I ordered this as I&#x27;ve purchased it from my salon previously and often have difficulty finding it.</li>
<li> My hair continued to curl and was a frizzy mess afterward.  </li>
<li> This product acts shine without making your hair stiff or sticky.  </li>
<li> Not sure why?</li>
<li> Been using this product for at least 7 years</li>
<li> Sucks not what I thought it was at all.</li>
<li> Maybe this product would work well on someone who&#x27;s hair is not as thick as mine but who knows.    </li>
<li> I have very thick wavy hair.</li>
<li> If you have very thick hair</li>
<li> no fly aways.  </li>

    <li> This product acts shine without making your hair stiff or sticky.  Looks natural but helps even the dryest hair look healthy.  Highly recommend this above anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Enoy!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Alterna Hemp Straightening Balm about two weeks ago and it arrived in a timely manner.  That&#x27;s about the only positive thing I can say unfortunately.    I have very thick wavy hair. And using as directed this product leaves much to be desired.  Did not help with straightening at all.  It also did not help with the frizziness or fly-away hairs either.  I used on towel dried hair and also kept reapplying as I straightened with my flat iron and comb.  My hair continued to curl and was a frizzy mess afterward.  I also tried using the product simply with a blow dryer and paddle brush and had the same results.    Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny Serum is a much better way to go.  It works great and leaves my hair shiny, tame, and STRAIGHT!!    I really feel like I threw 19 dollars in the garbage!     Maybe this product would work well on someone who&#x27;s hair is not as thick as mine but who knows.    If you have very thick hair that&#x27;s curly or wavy I would definitely go with a different product!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product on the market for curly or frizzy hair. Feels like you don&#x27;t have a product on, but works like you do. Your hair is more manageable and soft. Can&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> The product came within about a week.  The pump was taped securely and the bottle placed in popcorn, to prevent leaks and damage.  Even with shipping, the total was under $20, about the cost of the 5 oz size at most retailers (online and off).  This is the only straightening product that resists humidity on my biracial (varying from fine and straight, wavy and medium to coarse coils).      I ran out after 2 years, so I was desperate to get it replaced quickly.  Hooray for finding a reliable, economical source for one of my must-have hair products.</li>
    <li> This product is great for \\&quot;mixed-breed\\&quot; hair.  I used to get it cheaper on another site.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for my unruly curly hair and it is the best I have ever found and I am not a young chick.  The best part of this purchase is this price was one of the fairest I have found plus I received the item quickly.  I highly recommend the product and the company I purchased it from.</li>
    <li> Having used dozens of brands, I have to say the Aterna product does more to straighten my waves than any other. However, it only does half the battle -- basically making for easier ironing and drying.</li>
    <li> This is a good product overall, it does not leave my hair any straighter but at the same time it helps with my split ends and makes my hair look healthier when i use it. Plus it smells great. thx</li>
    <li> I ordered this as I&#x27;ve purchased it from my salon previously and often have difficulty finding it. Its a great product, and does exactly what it claims to do: straighten hair while drying it without frizz. I highly reccomend the product; the only issue is with the dispenser, which is not a tube as shown, but a bottle with a pump, which often sticks. Otherwise, a great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! It shipped earlier than expected! I tried it right away. It&#x27;s easy to use too! All I had to do was wash my hair with my regular shampoo and conditioner, then dried my hair a little and applied the product. I blew dry my hair and when it was dried, my hair looked amazingly straight! Just the way I like it! It didn&#x27;t make your hair flat, it was just perfect. I was surprised in a good way when I saw how big the product was! It smelt nice too! Overall rating, 5 stars! Shipped fast, great result and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Great product for humidity.  Lightweight but effective.  A little goes a long way so this size bottle will last a while.  This is my third bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years now.  Because I was no longer able to locate Alterna Products where I am in New Jersey, someone suggested trying the Internet.  It appears to be the same product, packaging is a little different and although the fragrance is slightly different, it works the same.  Yes, love this product, you get the right amount of \\&quot;hold\\&quot; without stiffness.  Hair is easy to blow-dry and style.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this product - only used it once but my hair was fly away after using it.  Think I used too much.  Hair felt silky after using it though.  Gave it to my sister who has very frizzy hair and she says she likes it.  I will have to buy another to try again now that summer is fast approaching.  Received as scheduled.</li>
    <li> Although this is product is a staightening Balm...I find it works wonders on my natural curly hair.  My hair is smooth...no frizz...no fly aways.  And when I do straighten my hair...it is amazingly straight and super shiny!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Not only does it help to get my hair super straight it also holds it in to place.</li>
    <li> Sucks not what I thought it was at all. I think I threw it away. It made my hair crispy. I like my hair to be soft without frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and really love it. I usually mix it with another straightening serum to really help protect my hair from frizzies in high humidity. Smells great but not overwhelming, and it leaves my hair so much easier to style with a round brush and blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this product but it dries my hair out like nobody&#x27;s business. My hair gets tangled and breaks way more easily when I use this. It *does* help straighten my long very fine and frizzy hair, but it leaves it sticky and tangly in the process.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it took almost three weeks before I received it.  It is pretty over priced, but works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this exact same product (same ounces and everything) from a local beauty supply store at $30. Didn&#x27;t even think to look here on Amazon (slaps forehead...). Been using this product for at least 7 years and I just love it. I have naturally curly (tight!) hair and it works wonders along with a flat iron. It also gives a measure of protection of hair from the extreme heat. So happy to find here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I really like this wonderful product but in my opinion, is a bit pricey. I was able to purchase Alterna products local but since, no longer available in my area? Not sure why? Thank you Alterna.</li>
    <li> I loved Alterna Hemp Straightening Balm! But they don&#x27;t make it anymore. Oh, they brought the product back in smaller tubes, but it&#x27;s not the same formula. Current offering leaves my hair with no body. It&#x27;s silky but flat. That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m still searching for the right product. Alterna, please bring back the original formula!!!</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for. this product has been discontinued</li>
</ol>
