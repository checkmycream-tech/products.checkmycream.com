    <li> First tried this body wash in a hotel, went to Bath &amp; Body Works only to find this product was discontinued. The scent is fresh and woodsy and I like the way it sticks with me well into the day.</li>
    <li> Great Clean and fresh scent that is not too strong.  This is one of my favorite bath products by far.</li>

    <li> Perfect! Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> We went on vacation &amp; the hotel had this product. I fell in love with it, and of course, it is discontinued! I have searched for it &amp; am sooooooo very glad to find it here! I can&#x27;t explain it---- It&#x27;s just a clean, fresh, soft scent, and it rinses very clean.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!! Was really bummed out at christmas that I couldnt find this in any of the Bath and body works stores...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the shower gel and lotion versions of this scent. I must say, the lotion smells a lot better (and actually smells like leaves!). This didn&#x27;t really smell like leaves; it had this weird citrus-y, musky smell.</li>
    <li> Love the clean fresh scent!  Not oliy and leave my skin smooth as silk!</li>
    <li> I like this shower gel because the scent is not fruity or floral. To me, it just smells clean and neutral. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it reminds me of other items that have &#x27;ocean&#x27; in their name or description, if you can relate. It&#x27;s disappointing that this has been discontinued at B&amp;BW, but I&#x27;m happy that it can be purchased here.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite shower gels.  It lathers very well, leaves my skin feeling clean and soft and smelling subtly as if I&#x27;ve been outside in the fresh air.  A great way to start the day.</li>
    <li> A nice scent, you want to feel fresh and new when you leave the shower. I don&#x27;t drive so anything I get through the mail is great.</li>
    <li> When you want to mingle with a  fresh, windy morning that makes the mind go to the heights of exuberance in order to start a rough day, this gel will give you the kiss of morning that must take you through that day.</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff for my wife when I&#x27;m looking to get some brownie points.  It smells mighty fine.  It smells pretty close to its name.  From what I&#x27;m told you can never go wrong with the Bath &amp; Body stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was timely &amp; the packaging was what you&#x27;d expect it to be.  Zero complaints from the seller.  Will buy from again most definitely!</li>
    <li> very nice and light  i would but a perfume like this if they had it</li>
    <li> This is one of the better shower gels I have tried!  The main feature I look for is a good lather.  This one lathers great.  It only takes a little on my scrubby for my whole body.  I&#x27;m not going to review the scent because that is such a matter of personal taste.  I like the quality of this shower gel and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is not available from the original company and it&#x27;s awesome!  The smell is as described.  It would be wise of Bath &amp; Body Works to reintroduce this scent so it can be easily purchased from their shops.</li>
    <li> This might be my all-time Bath &amp; Body Works favorite scent, so I can&#x27;t help but love it!  I actually got this to make foaming soap.  It works perfectly and I&#x27;m saving money since I don&#x27;t have to buy pre-made foaming soap anymore.</li>
