    <li> Have had lots of trouble finding a styptic pencil in drugstore or elsewhere, these are a good price, GREAT!</li>
    <li> I ordered the &#x27;Pinaud Clubman styptic pencil 2 pack&#x27; to try it for my children&#x27;s nosebleeds. They both get frequent nosebleeds during allergy season, and I wanted a remedy for the small ones, faster than the \\&quot;handfuls of tissue and ice pack to the head for five minutes\\&quot; routine. Wiping out the nose gently with one tissue, wetting the end of the styptic pencil and placing it carefully in the affected nostril for a few seconds ENDED THE NOSEBLEED IMMEDIATELY! My little boy didn&#x27;t say it stung or smelled bad and he could go right back to playing without a tissue plug in his nose. This product is an awesome win and I will keep these in my first aid kits forever more.</li>
    <li> I like a product that is so economical that is does not pay to calculate cost per use.  This is such a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the kind of product I would expect to buy much of, but this seller is so reliable that I&#x27;m willing to see what else I can buy from them, based on other possible needs.</li>
    <li> My beard grows quickly. I am also a klutz. Hence, I  get the occasional shaving nick or three. This stuff works quickly and prevents me from having to cover my face with small patches of toilet paper post-shave.</li>
    <li> I cut myself shaving with my safety razor frequently. After one rub, this styptic pen stops the bleeding. Get ready for it to sting briefly depending how big the cut is. The only thing I dislike is sometimes a little bit of dry blood can be left where the cut was, but I guess it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;These things last forever so the one I had and broke was old.  New ones from Pinaud are thin and work better than the old ones.  One for the bath and one for the dopp kit.</li>
    <li> This product has been around for years..and it never fails. it says for &amp;#34;nicks&amp;#34; now !</li>
    <li> The item works for its intended purposes. No argument there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the packaging is very awkward. It is hard to get the pencils out of the casing without tearing it to shreds and in the process dropping a pencil and breaking it. I did.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected.</li>
    <li> this works great for small shaving cuts, or small scrapes or scratches.  I keep one in both bathroom medicine kits.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000YM76VU Pinaud Clubman styptic pencil for nick relief - 0.33 oz, 2 pack]]I&#x27;ve recently returned to shaving with a doublr-edged \\&quot;safety\\&quot; razor. Along with closeness comes nicks. My new pencil sure beats trying to stop the bleeding with tissue Thanks so much. Best Regards-Bob R.</li>
    <li> I tried using this for the first time recently and I have to say this is great! It does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do and quickly stops bleeding. Can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to try the product. It does leave a white residue, but you can easily wipe it off with a damp cloth.</li>
    <li> Wow!  These things are so handy when I cut my self shaving--ordered 2--my wife was always getting mine for her legs--now she has her own.  They were  hard to find in the store--cheaper here too.</li>
    <li> Styptic pencils are underrated items to stop minor bleeding. I keep at least one by shaving equipment, my first aid kit,my backpacking first aid kit and my fishing tackle box. Simple to use and small and lightweight lasts ling time. Nice item to stop bleeding from shaving nicks,fishing lure cuts, and small nicks and cuts. Remember Not for deep gash cuts!&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah it does burn at first for a second or two.</li>
    <li> Hard to Find at the pharmacy any more, but works as it always has.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should! Stops the blood and doesn&#x27;t sting too much. They last quite a while, too.</li>
    <li> Keeps little nics and cuts from bleeding quickly. Wet it, apply it, fix it. A word of caution however. It&#x27;ll sting for about 4-5 seconds but gets the job done</li>
    <li> Stings a lil but its supposed to.</li>
    <li> excellent product and packaging&lt;br /&gt;really great quality...if you shave with a blade&lt;br /&gt;you got to have this product...stops nicks and cuts instantly!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to see the classic styptic pencils are still available, and for a great price.  You can spend $12, yes $12 for a single smaller version from TAOS, or get a 2 pack of the standard, old-school size here for under $5.  Even with regular use, 2 of these should last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like advertised. Great product !!!</li>
    <li> What to say, styptic pencil to take care of nicks.  Don&#x27;t use much, but when needed work great and cheap price.  If I shaved for next 40 years wouldn&#x27;t use 2 of these, so gave one to son</li>
    <li> stops the bleeding, and i carry one for when i cut my self while i am working.</li>
    <li> This thing actually works. If you cut yourself shaving, this thing will stop the bleeding. I have one at home and in each car, just in case.</li>
    <li> Great for those unexpected razor cuts.  Works well and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Product worked exactly as I remember, bought it because could no longer find it in my area.</li>
    <li> they are gonna last me a lifetime, but couldn&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Stops bleeding from razor cuts. Leaves a white residue on skin that looks better than a piece of tissue paper but still needs to be cleaned off before you get to work after shaving in the morning.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  Comes with its own tube for storage making it great for travel.  And best of all, it stops the bleeding caused by my less than perfect 5 blade razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these two styptic pencils for about a year, and have only used them on a few occasions, but this product works.  It stings like the devil for a couple seconds, but it works.</li>
    <li> It works but burns like hell that&#x27;s all I have to say</li>
    <li> Easer to use than the old paper wrapped but the new formula is ineffective when it comes to stopping the blood flow or sealing the wound. True there is no sting but there is also no cauterization.  Jim H.</li>
    <li> My nick was bleeding! Behold the magical white stick! My nick is no longer bleeding!</li>
    <li> Works like I remember from years past.  This item is hard to find here locally so I was pleased to be able to purchase them online at a decent price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those small cuts and/or nicks you get for various reasons, including shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this product over the years. But for some reason I no longer see it sold in Fla drugstores (?).&lt;br /&gt;I keep one at home &amp; one in my car.</li>
    <li> Works stops the blood, I wish it had a handle or something that is the only downside or a screw on holder or something like that.</li>
    <li> So cheap yet you get more then your money&#x27;s worth out of this. It does a great job stopping the bleeding and it&#x27;s great that it comes in a container and the blood washes off very well.</li>
    <li> Good product; timely shipping.</li>
    <li> Stings when you use it, but it does stop the bleeding from any smaller nick/cut</li>
    <li> Great product for shaving nicks! Priced very reasonably! Was very good for it was purchased to do! Would recommend it!</li>
    <li> My son is 16 and seems to find this very helpful on tough shaving days!  He finds this easy to use when he has a little nick and he stops bleeding quickly.</li>
    <li> Perfect for shaving cuts. Just what I was looking for. Just get it a little wet and put it on the knick. Will stop bleeding in a few seconds. Stings just a tiny bit, that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says and is a life saver! I wash it off with rubbing alcohol and let it dry before putting it away. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> It works!  What else do you need to know.</li>
    <li> Comes in a plastic container. The only problem is the red cap on the plastic container is extremely hard to get off. Very tight fit. I had to use my teeth.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders! Doesn&#x27;t hurt but reminds you you&#x27;re a man :) It comes in two and has a case with it so it&#x27;s easy to travel with!</li>
    <li> This does the job for any small shaving cuts. I only bought this so I can have one at home and one for travel.  You will likely never need to buy another one.  I still use the one I bought over 20 years ago. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> For the occasional accidental nick when shaving this does what it is supposed to do. Simply wet the stick and dab it on the cut. It stops the bleeding. Man up...the stinging is not bad at all.</li>
    <li> This perfect for those slip-ups when shaving. The price is right and i should last for years, unless you shave with a chainsaw.</li>
    <li> Styptic Pencil is great  it really works it stops the bleeding fast I love it because I have grandchildren all boy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> With the outrageous costs of multi-blade shaving cartridges, many guys are beginning to make the switch back to the old-school way of shaving. A good double-edge (DE) razor, brush, shaving soap and a little practice is all that&#x27;s needed to experience the exceptional closeness that just can&#x27;t be had with those battery operated, 5-blade monstrosities. With this resurgence in wet-shaving comes the increase in those little nicks and cuts that will inevitably happen and that&#x27;s why this little Pinaud Styptic Pencil is great to have on hand when it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially it looks and feels like a piece of chalk but it&#x27;s made of alum. For a cut or nick, lightly wet the end and apply. You don&#x27;t have to keep it pressed there. Just dab it and you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s that fast. It works by constricting the blood vessels to stop bleeding and then it leaves a little white residue over the cut to seal further. Wash off the pencil and then dry it off and it&#x27;s ready for the next time. I keep mine within easy reach while shaving. After a few minutes I&#x27;ll wipe off the white residue and I&#x27;m good as new. If you&#x27;ve ever seen anyone tear off those little pieces of toilet paper and stick to their face, please get them this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine locally at Wal-Mart and the cost was only around 1 dollar. Check out the top shelf on the shaving aisle and if they don&#x27;t have it you might want to request it. I think soon we&#x27;re going to start seeing more and more of these old products become popular again. My Pinaud Styptic Pencil did not come in a tube but there is nothing to spill, it&#x27;s very small and very convenient. I will have to slightly disagree with the product description in that there is a VERY SLIGHT sting. It&#x27;s not much but it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever method you prefer to whack the little hairs off your face and neck, no shaving kit should be without this...ask your grandfather.</li>
    <li> I have used Pinaud Clubman styptic pencils in the past, but not for several years.  I found the quality of their product to be as good as I remembered.  Their quality has not fallen off the way so many others have over the years.  I would recommend them to anyone who shaves.</li>

    <li> this is like putting salt on a cut.  it does stop the bleeding.  it leaves white mark on your face.  i usually take the excess off with a qtip once it&#x27;s dry.  and i&#x27;ll repeat, IT BURNS!  just for a few seconds, but IT BURNS!</li>
    <li> Product as described. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
