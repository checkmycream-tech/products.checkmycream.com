      <li>Looks good.</li>
      <li>Very cute, and functional.  </li>
      <li>Colour matches her hair nicely.</li>
      <li>but it matched my hair perfectly and was really shiny.</li>
      <li>it nice</li>
      <li>This was a very light brown color-it looks darker in the picture</li>
      <li>so it looks more like my hair.</li>
      <li>Will purchase again. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>Not my favorite.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how the color would go</li>
      <li>Good quality braid, but color is much lighter than on the picture.</li>
      <li>Did not look real and did not feel good on head.</li>
      <li>It was nothing like the picture said and the living a light brown</li>
      <li>this isnt even light brown.</li>
      <li>Quality is okay, doesn&#x27;t look anything like real hair.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; in the band is so super duper shiny it</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t require a certain number of words!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s overall very comfortable and fashionable.</li>
      <li>Really disapointed I dont recommend anyone to buy this!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>It almost looks real.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>....how much can be said about this.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s really not much more to be said about a hair accessory, but to fill word count – it&#x27;s so stylish!</li>
      <li>Headband is pretty large and more thick than it looks in the image.</li>
      <li>This is rather dark blond than light brown.</li>
      <li>The seem to fit ok with &amp;#34;big normal heads&amp;#34; as Chinese made headbands are usually too tiny for normal American heads.</li>
      <li>I like so much, but to my daughter is a little big, and for me is fine but need to put something to not move.</li>
      <li>Obviously, it is plastic, and for the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much from it...</li>
      <li>A little big but worth its price.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately I changed my hair color and it doesn&#x27;t match, but my daughter&#x27;s French Bull Dog loves it and so far he hasn&#x27;t been able to chew it apart, so</li>

<li> dont waste your money.</li>
<li> Recieved the complete wrong color.</li>
<li> its closer to blonde and the hir is fake plastic.</li>
<li> This was just a waste of money!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pretty bad, hair does match, it looks fake because it&#x27;s too shiny</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s actually a weird color and doesn&#x27;t match any of my friends either.</li>

    <li> A little big but worth its price. Will purchase again. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> it nice but it hurts my head after a while of using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Very cute, and functional.  There&#x27;s really not much more to be said about a hair accessory, but to fill word count – it&#x27;s so stylish!</li>
    <li> This was just a waste of money! They sent a headband thats hideous and not the one on the picture! Really disapointed I dont recommend anyone to buy this!</li>
    <li> I like so much, but to my daughter is a little big, and for me is fine but need to put something to not move.</li>
    <li> this is crap. dont waste your money. im so mad. this isnt even light brown. its closer to blonde and the hir is fake plastic. JUST CRAP!</li>
    <li> I like how it looks in my hair. It almost looks real. Good quality and price! I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like these: brown and black bought. The seem to fit ok with &amp;#34;big normal heads&amp;#34; as Chinese made headbands are usually too tiny for normal American heads. Discreet and not too ornate. Perfect</li>
    <li> does not even come close to matching the color of my daughters hair so she can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
    <li> Shipping took a long time. Quality is okay, doesn&#x27;t look anything like real hair.</li>
    <li> Did not look real and did not feel good on head.</li>
    <li> This is what you would think it is. It&#x27;s a hairband that looks like braided hair. Unfortunately I changed my hair color and it doesn&#x27;t match, but my daughter&#x27;s French Bull Dog loves it and so far he hasn&#x27;t been able to chew it apart, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> This was a very light brown color-it looks darker in the picture so I couldn&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s actually a weird color and doesn&#x27;t match any of my friends either.</li>
    <li> My daughter put it on as soon as package was opened. She loves it. Colour matches her hair nicely. Looks good.</li>
    <li> Remember this is just a hairband....how much can be said about this.  Yada Yada....blah blah blah....Please don&#x27;t require a certain number of words!</li>
    <li> I like this product and I wear it a lot. However I like to wear it with ponytails and I do wish the bottom part of it was also a braid rather than a black band so it looks more like my hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure how the color would go but it matched my hair perfectly and was really shiny. I do have to adjust it throughout the day because the hair is slippery and it slides back on my head but it&#x27;s overall very comfortable and fashionable.</li>
    <li> Dumbs down. It didn&#x27;t come in the color as shown in picture.</li>
    <li> Headband is pretty large and more thick than it looks in the image. Not my favorite. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; in the band is so super duper shiny it *looks* synthetic... like plastic.  Obviously, it is plastic, and for the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much from it... but my girls like wearing it.</li>
    <li> Recieved the complete wrong color. Nothing like the picture of what I chose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty bad, hair does match, it looks fake because it&#x27;s too shiny and it&#x27;s lighter then brown. And it slips off my head</li>
    <li> his. It was nothing like the picture said and the living a light brown it was actually a brass yellow pee color. threw it in the garbage as soon as I got it</li>
    <li> Good quality braid, but color is much lighter than on the picture. This is rather dark blond than light brown. I&#x27;ll have to figure out how to modify it to wear.</li>
