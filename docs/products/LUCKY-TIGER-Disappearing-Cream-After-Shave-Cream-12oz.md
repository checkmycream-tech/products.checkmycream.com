      <li>Was impressed with it there and had to find it.</li>
      <li>Very good</li>
      <li>Great product extremely happy</li>
      <li>Great shaving experience</li>
      <li>Also great on elbows and knees.</li>
      <li>The texture is not as creamy and the smell is not as pleasant, but it gets the job done and for the price, you can give it a try.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend loved this product...</li>
      <li>It does my face good.</li>
      <li>Outstanding product, smells good, and makes my face feel great after a shave.</li>
      <li>My favorite aftershave, great menthol to cool as well as give you a pick me up.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a no-nonsense aftershave / face moisturizer that goes on easy and has a nice menthol hit to it, try this.</li>
      <li>My face looks excellent and feels ultra-smooth after using this, it&#x27;s a big step up from alcohol-based aftershave for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>okay not as silky as I want.</li>
      <li>Really makes face feel great, and reduces razor bumps and stuff like that.</li>
      <li>I love the name</li>
      <li>I am thoroughly enjoying this product .</li>
      <li>I decided I might do better to invest in something better, so I gave this a try because I love the refreshing kick of menthol after a shave.</li>
      <li>It used to be full to top.</li>
      <li>It will last forever, and feels great. .</li>
      <li>Its best use is for a second pass using a straight / safety razor.</li>
      <li>Much more cost effective, a better shave, and less irritation too.</li>
      <li>This product is similar to Proraso Pre-shave Cream (refresh) in texture and smell, except for me, the proraso product is superior in comparison.  </li>
      <li>Makes face feel clean and fresh after a shave.</li>
      <li>I asked her what she was applying to my face after she removed my beard, she told me Lucky Tiger Disappearing Cream.</li>
      <li>Anyway I will keep buying this Lucky Tiger Cream.  </li>
      <li>I have questions bout lucky tiger cream</li>
      <li>After my Barber recommended this Lucky Tiger</li>
      <li>Its got a heavy menthol smell thats soothing and is a great moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Not crazy about smell.</li>
      <li>Received item quickly and as described, thanks!</li>
      <li>Lucky Tiger is pretty much that.</li>
      <li>I can only describe this as “interesting”…unlike any aftershave product I have used before.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several shave balms or moisturizers and this product is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Great Product and one can last a very long time.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff - Trick is to work the cream between your palms to break it down prior to putting it on your face.  </li>
      <li>The menthol kick is present, but somewhat subdued, which is fine.</li>
      <li>What can you really say about aftershave?</li>
      <li>Very concentrated.</li>
      <li>Very cooling on the skin</li>
      <li>Just apply to face before shave apply hot face towel for about 30secs and this product really allows pours to open up and the razor takes the hairs off like a hot knife through butter.</li>
      <li>This cream is very useful when you don&#x27;t stand those strong fragrances that usually comes with regular shaving creams.    </li>
      <li>It leaves your face very smooth and you can feel some medical effect due to its menthol feeling.    </li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This stuff is old school.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used alcohol-based aftershaves like Old Spice, and I still like them, but they tend to leave my face with a reddish look and occasionally itchy and irritated.</li>
      <li>Not old school, new school.</li>
      <li>I recently switched to a double edge blade and chucked the old Mach 3.</li>
      <li>Only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t full disappearing.  </li>

    <li> I was disappointed in much the amount of cream in the jar has been reduced. It used to be full to top. Much less now.</li>
    <li> This cream is very useful when you don&#x27;t stand those strong fragrances that usually comes with regular shaving creams.    It leaves your face very smooth and you can feel some medical effect due to its menthol feeling.    Only complaint is that it isn&#x27;t full disappearing.  You have to be very careful whipping off any excess of cream.  If not, your face will show a lot of white spots and lines.    Anyway I will keep buying this Lucky Tiger Cream.  It does my face good.</li>
    <li> Very cooling on the skin</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin on my neck and used to get horrible razor bumps. This stuff has worked the best. It soothes the skin on my neck and I don&#x27;t get razor bumps anymore.</li>
    <li> I never really used After Shave too often because I didn&#x27;t like the Alcohol in them.  After my Barber recommended this Lucky Tiger After Shave, I use it daily!  Great Product and one can last a very long time.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is old school.  Learned of it by having a shave at a barber shop.  Its got a heavy menthol smell thats soothing and is a great moisturizer.  Its best use is for a second pass using a straight / safety razor. I don&#x27;t shave without it!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved this product... Very good when u jus had a hair cut, no razor bumps, would recommend anyone to buy this cream</li>
    <li> What can you really say about aftershave? This is different. I recently switched to a double edge blade and chucked the old Mach 3. Much more cost effective, a better shave, and less irritation too. Can&#x27;t lose with that. I&#x27;ve always used alcohol-based aftershaves like Old Spice, and I still like them, but they tend to leave my face with a reddish look and occasionally itchy and irritated. I decided I might do better to invest in something better, so I gave this a try because I love the refreshing kick of menthol after a shave. Lucky Tiger is pretty much that. It&#x27;s thick and a little crumbly -- you dig out a big gunk of it on the edge of your fingers, rub it flat, and rub it in. The menthol kick is present, but somewhat subdued, which is fine. There&#x27;s not much of a lingering smell like a traditional aftershave, but like I said, this is different. Not old school, new school.

I do believe I am sold on this stuff, so as long as they keep making it, I&#x27;ll buy it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My barber used it when giving me a shave. I asked her what she was applying to my face after she removed my beard, she told me Lucky Tiger Disappearing Cream. I immediately bought a tub of it and use it after every shave. Outstanding product, smells good, and makes my face feel great after a shave.</li>
    <li> This is the best AfterShave I have ever used. It will last forever, and feels great. . blah blah blah,</li>
    <li> okay not as silky as I want. Not crazy about smell. Very concentrated.</li>
    <li> Great stuff - Trick is to work the cream between your palms to break it down prior to putting it on your face.  Also great on elbows and knees.</li>
    <li> I can only describe this as “interesting”…unlike any aftershave product I have used before.  There is a lot in the container.</li>
    <li> My favorite aftershave, great menthol to cool as well as give you a pick me up.</li>
    <li> Really makes face feel great, and reduces razor bumps and stuff like that. Makes face feel clean and fresh after a shave.</li>

    <li> I am thoroughly enjoying this product . After a shave  it refreshes my face and aid in healing my skin , especially after a close shave . Wiil purchase again .</li>
    <li> I have tried several shave balms or moisturizers and this product is my favorite. Would recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>

    <li> Found this product through barber shop while at college. Was impressed with it there and had to find it. Just apply to face before shave apply hot face towel for about 30secs and this product really allows pours to open up and the razor takes the hairs off like a hot knife through butter. After wipe off access and use cold water to close pours. Great product extremely happy</li>
