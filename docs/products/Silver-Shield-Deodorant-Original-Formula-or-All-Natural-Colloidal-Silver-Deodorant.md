      <li>It&#x27;s the best!</li>
      <li>best non toxic deodorant out there.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for over a year with great results for an aluminum alternative, and plan to continue using it!</li>
      <li>and I am happy with the refill option.</li>
      <li>If I work up a sweat from exercising, I do need to reapply it, but otherwise I think it is a great product.</li>
      <li>The product works great, just the applicator doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
      <li>These are great refills for the applicator.  </li>
      <li>Animal Cruelty Free (!!!)</li>
      <li>It is good for the body by not using ingredients that will harm the body.</li>
      <li>Very pleased...</li>
      <li>The smell is very light and pleasant.</li>
      <li>So glad it&#x27;s on AMAZON!</li>

      <li>Safe &amp; Effective</li>
      <li>This is the best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both love this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally glad I did.</li>
      <li>While I understand, they need to design something better while keeping the re-fill concept.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s better than my favorite deodorant?</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I could be sure that it had no animal products in it.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m not quite sure how I got the top off of the deodorant bottle.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I intend to continue using it.</li>
      <li>This is really an outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m ok if everyone moves away from me by 5pm.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I grit my teeth and say inspirational things to myself while I wait for the sting to pass.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so good that some mornings you might wake up with your pits still smelling fresh.</li>
      <li>Saving money with a more environmentally friendly refill!</li>
      <li>But it came off; and refilling was easy and replacing the cap was easy.</li>
      <li>Petrochemical Free</li>
      <li>Silver Shield does reduce odor for me, and it has greatly reduced staining on my white t-shirts.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Aluminum Free</li>
      <li>It works all day and I enjoy the cedar smell.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this deodorant and it works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>but it is pleasant and actually becomes fairly neutral shortly after application.</li>
      <li>I liked the idea of reusing my old bottle.</li>
      <li>Not bad for a non-Aluminum deodorant.</li>
      <li>It sure doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;classic&#x27; deodorant scent</li>
      <li>, we go through it fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Here are the features listed on the original roller bottle (which you should get first or along with the 2X Refill)...</li>
      <li>Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;+ Lasts a long time considering the size of the bottle (perfect for traveling)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the natural Deo...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried more than 10 natural deodorants.</li>
      <li>Refillable and Economical</li>
      <li>This stuff is just plain great.  </li>
      <li>It has good anti bacterial properties amongst other benefits.</li>
      <li>She says that she very much enjoys using Silver Shield, and that it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I ordered the refill.</li>
      <li>I also had a concern with one of my shipments to which their costumer service was very responsive!  </li>
      <li>It does burn when I apply after I&#x27;ve shaved my arm pits but am aware as others have pointed out the sensitivity of the area.  </li>
      <li>I tried the salt/rock type, but after about 6 hours in a hot or stressful environment, the salt deodorant gives out and then i have to re-apply it (if i have it with me).  </li>
      <li>This is the only kind of natural deodorant that keeps me from smelling like a cilantro farmer.  </li>
      <li>Everything I bought at Whole Paycheck failed to keep me smelly, so after reading excellent reviews about Silver Shield, I can now say my armpits no longer smell like cilantro.  </li>
      <li>First off, I certainly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
      <li>I only apply the deodorant fresh out of the shower on clean skin, but it seems like bacteria somehow managed to get inside the applicator container and start growing.  </li>
      <li>This Silver Shield easily lasts an entire day AND night, regardless of the temperature or stress level.  </li>
      <li>Really, I stink on ice, and this stuff works.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like people that much</li>
      <li>You have to use it at least twice a day, but good product.  </li>
      <li>, I get a rash( I do have pretty sensitive skin though).</li>
      <li>This stuff seems to do a good enough job killing bacteria that the day of, and the next day(I shower every morning), and sometimes the third, I will not have one whiff of underarm odor.  </li>
      <li>But, if you are looking for something new to try to reduce odor, give it a shot!</li>
      <li>That I can live w/by altering immediate usage after shower shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t exactly work as well as traditional deodorants, because it is liquid.</li>
      <li>I am odor free all day long, no white paste under my arms or stained clothes (like with my old stick deodorant).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;• 100% Natural &amp; Non GMO&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by so-called &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; who denigrate natural health products.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it was long lasting - I&#x27;ve used many other deodorants that do not last the whole day.</li>
      <li>Usually, with standard deodorants (and more with Toms of Maine), by early afternoon, my armpits still begin to smell.  </li>
      <li>It takes forever to dry, but when it does, it really works.  </li>
      <li>I trust Natural News dot com above and beyond the BS that is published elsewhere.</li>
      <li>None of the other products I ever used seemed to do much.</li>
      <li>Stains do not seem to really last but are apparent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the smell of this deodorant and it works pretty well.  If I work up a sweat from exercising, I do need to reapply it, but otherwise I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I buy this b/c I do not want to use deodorant with aluminum in it.  You have to use it at least twice a day, but good product.  DO NOT use after you have shaved your arm pits, hurts like hell.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this deodorant.  It takes forever to dry, but when it does, it really works.  Usually, with standard deodorants (and more with Toms of Maine), by early afternoon, my armpits still begin to smell.  This stuff seems to do a good enough job killing bacteria that the day of, and the next day(I shower every morning), and sometimes the third, I will not have one whiff of underarm odor.  I took one star away because if I do try to wear every day, I get a rash( I do have pretty sensitive skin though). Only applying every 2-3 days does the trick though, and no rash.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I was using the roll-on applicator but I kept having problems with \\&quot;contamination\\&quot;.  I only apply the deodorant fresh out of the shower on clean skin, but it seems like bacteria somehow managed to get inside the applicator container and start growing.  The product works great, just the applicator doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I must be doing something wrong.  So I decided to purchase the refill bottle and throw away the applicator.  I drop a few drops in my hand and smear it on my armpits.  I am odor free all day long, no white paste under my arms or stained clothes (like with my old stick deodorant).  I am super impressed with the healthy ingredients and effectiveness in fighting odor.  I love this product and I intend to continue using it.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s better than my favorite deodorant? Saving money with a more environmentally friendly refill! My only possible complaint is that I wish they made a bigger refill size as with 2 of us using this, we go through it fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have found. I love it. It works all day and I enjoy the cedar smell. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I ordered the refill. I liked the idea of reusing my old bottle. However, I&#x27;m not quite sure how I got the top off of the deodorant bottle. But it came off; and refilling was easy and replacing the cap was easy. I like the product and I am happy with the refill option.</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of natural deodorant that keeps me from smelling like a cilantro farmer.  Everything I bought at Whole Paycheck failed to keep me smelly, so after reading excellent reviews about Silver Shield, I can now say my armpits no longer smell like cilantro.  And that&#x27;s a win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, if you shave your pits prior to applying this, it does sting some.  I grit my teeth and say inspirational things to myself while I wait for the sting to pass.  Also, I do have to be a bit heavy handed in order to keep all the cilantro away, but these might just be me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried more than 10 natural deodorants. This has been the only one that works for me. I don&#x27;t smell!!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 years now!!!!!! It&#x27;s the best! So glad it&#x27;s on AMAZON! Thx!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the natural Deo...no more yellow stained T-shirt underarms!! It does burn when I apply after I&#x27;ve shaved my arm pits but am aware as others have pointed out the sensitivity of the area.  That I can live w/by altering immediate usage after shower shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the applicator. I&#x27;ve cleaned as suggested but it still occasionally drips a drop or two from the roller as you&#x27;re applying it.  While I understand, they need to design something better while keeping the re-fill concept.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to deodorant ever since getting off of aluminum based deodorants.  I tried the salt/rock type, but after about 6 hours in a hot or stressful environment, the salt deodorant gives out and then i have to re-apply it (if i have it with me).  This Silver Shield easily lasts an entire day AND night, regardless of the temperature or stress level.  It&#x27;s so good that some mornings you might wake up with your pits still smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I apply it once a day, in the morning, and odor problems disappear for the rest of the day! None of the other products I ever used seemed to do much. I hope they never stop making this deodorant. Very pleased...</li>
    <li> + Stops bad odor&lt;br /&gt;+ Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;+ Lasts a long time considering the size of the bottle (perfect for traveling)&lt;br /&gt;+ Refilling is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wish it came in a slender body that would use a long roller and not a ball.</li>
    <li> These are great refills for the applicator.  I also had a concern with one of my shipments to which their costumer service was very responsive!  I have used this product for over a year with great results for an aluminum alternative, and plan to continue using it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I could be sure that it had no animal products in it. I was pleasantly surprised that it was long lasting - I&#x27;ve used many other deodorants that do not last the whole day. It sure doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;classic&#x27; deodorant scent but it is pleasant and actually becomes fairly neutral shortly after application.</li>
    <li> My armpits were so gunked up with deodorant products that I decided to end the insanity. After some research, I found Silver Shield Deodorant and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m totally glad I did. This is my second 2X Refill. The smell is very light and pleasant. It keeps the pits dry and there is no residue that won&#x27;t come out in the shower. Here are the features listed on the original roller bottle (which you should get first or along with the 2X Refill)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Colloidal Silver Powered&lt;br /&gt;• 100% Natural &amp; Non GMO&lt;br /&gt;• Aluminum Free&lt;br /&gt;• Petrochemical Free&lt;br /&gt;• Safe &amp; Effective&lt;br /&gt;• Animal Cruelty Free (!!!)&lt;br /&gt;• Refillable and Economical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colloidal silver is silver particles suspended in distilled water. It has good anti bacterial properties amongst other benefits. Don&#x27;t be fooled by so-called &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; who denigrate natural health products. They have a secret agenda because they are paid by the big pharmaceutical corporations to turn people away from things that are actually beneficial rather than harmful. I trust Natural News dot com above and beyond the BS that is published elsewhere. Check it out there.</li>
    <li> This is really an outstanding product.  It is good for the body by not using ingredients that will harm the body.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t exactly work as well as traditional deodorants, because it is liquid. It does work though, I use it in combination to traditional deodorant. Because I sweat quite profusely! Not bad for a non-Aluminum deodorant. A Warning does have tendency to stain. Use with caution. Stains do not seem to really last but are apparent.</li>
    <li> No body odor or residue.  Love it!</li>
    <li> best non toxic deodorant out there. Really, I stink on ice, and this stuff works. I mean here in FL it wears off by end of day but I don&#x27;t like people that much so I&#x27;m ok if everyone moves away from me by 5pm.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, who has used this product for several years. She says that she very much enjoys using Silver Shield, and that it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> First off, I certainly recommend giving this product a try. I&#x27;m not sure if it will work for everyone, but it does work for me. I understand the concept of silver working to reduce bacterial growth thus cutting down on armpit odor. Silver Shield does reduce odor for me, and it has greatly reduced staining on my white t-shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have run the gamut of products from Gillette to Jason and none have kept the odor down as well as Silver Shield. Mind you, this is not an antiperspirant, so if that is what you are after I would not buy this. But, if you are looking for something new to try to reduce odor, give it a shot!</li>
    <li> This stuff is just plain great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and it has never let me down!</li>
