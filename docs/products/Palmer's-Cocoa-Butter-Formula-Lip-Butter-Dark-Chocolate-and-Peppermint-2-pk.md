      <li>so I was thrilled I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Vitamin E is the third ingredient meaning there is a good amount and will provide wonderful conditioning for the lips.</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands of lip balm and none of them compare to Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Lip Butter Formula.  </li>
      <li>There can be more flavors too, idk...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most all of them and am not a fan.  </li>
      <li>I love the taste and smell of this lip balm.</li>
      <li>My favorite lip balm.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>
      <li>I love this stuff![[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Nothing overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I Should have been able to tell by the tube that this is a liquid type chapstick, but I was basing the brand and scent</li>
      <li>I have also tried the Dark Chocolate Cordial Cherry flavor lip butter that is very delicious to the taste.  </li>
      <li>Smooth and creamy, and smells/</li>
      <li>(so it&#x27;s true to its name).The formula is smooth</li>
      <li>/taste off of a large one I bought someplace else that I LOVE.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also not a fan of lip balms from The Body Shop or Bath + Body Works because of their very unnatural and sometimes overwhelming scents which are quite offensive to me.  </li>
      <li>Smells good enough to eat though, for real!!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong taste, but really conditions your lips.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this lip butter for a long time and it rates the top on my list of favorite lip balms.  </li>
      <li>Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Lip Butter Formula really keeps your lips moist and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Arrived SUPER fast too!</li>
      <li>Though the young gals love them, I much prefer a product with a very mild natural scent or flavor that does not overwhelm.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product works far better than the ever-popular ChapStick, Blistex or most other lip balms.  </li>
      <li>will say that the chocolate + peppermint description sounded like something a 13-year-old would covet, though after reading positive reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try</li>
      <li>I would certainly recommend.</li>
      <li>so it was very easy to just squeeze a bit, glide it over my lips and enjoy the moisture and subtle gloss.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It works really well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It gives a gentle shine to your lips and if you order the dark chocolate mint it gives off a lovely peppermint fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Rather, it produces a smooth pleasant sensation on your lips with nothing artificial.  </li>
      <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s products and this dark chocolate &amp; peppermint lip butter....</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Lip Butter (Dark Chocolate &amp; Peppermint)</li>
      <li>I simply love this lip butter dark chocolate formula, and I know you will too once you try it.</li>
      <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it&#x27;s a problem with the manufacturing, but the side of the container splits and the product oozes out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this happen to 3 of the containers in the 12 pack.</li>
      <li>rendition of what I know and love about the natural combination of dark chocolate + peppermint.  </li>
      <li>The scent is delectable; mostly chocolate with a small but noticeable hint of peppermint</li>
      <li>It very moisture at the beginning, but not last long</li>

    <li> I used to be a Carmex-girl, but using this has changed my mind.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong taste, but really conditions your lips.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm. Smooth and creamy, and smells/tastes wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is probably the only lip cream/gloss/balm in the world that works for me.  It provides great moisturizing effect and gives a nice glossy look on my lips.  Please DO NOT discontinue the product.</li>
    <li> Palmers is the best lip gloss/lip conditioner ever!  It is not greasy, thick or goey!!  It gives a gentle shine to your lips and if you order the dark chocolate mint it gives off a lovely peppermint fragrance.  I love this stuff![[ASIN:B003I26FYC Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Lip Butter-Dark Chocolate &amp; Peppermint, 2 pack]]</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Lip Butter Formula really keeps your lips moist and smooth.  I have been using this lip butter for a long time and it rates the top on my list of favorite lip balms.  I have tried many brands of lip balm and none of them compare to Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Lip Butter Formula.  The flavor is delicious if you happen to run your tongue over your lip.  It never leaves a bitter taste in your mouth.  I have also tried the Dark Chocolate Cordial Cherry flavor lip butter that is very delicious to the taste.  I hope Palmer&#x27;s continues to manufacture this dark chocolate flavored lip butter formula.  I have a hard time finding it in stores, so I order it on-line.  I simply love this lip butter dark chocolate formula, and I know you will too once you try it.</li>
    <li> This lip butter was/is a  delight to use.The scent is delectable; mostly chocolate with a small but noticeable hint of peppermint (so it&#x27;s true to its name).The formula is smooth so it was very easy to just squeeze a bit, glide it over my lips and enjoy the moisture and subtle gloss.Vitamin E is the third ingredient meaning there is a good amount and will provide wonderful conditioning for the lips.The only con is that it does not contain SPF nor is there a separate version that has SPF;otherwise I would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!! The lip butter feels good on ur lips!!! There can be more flavors too, idk...but this one is really really good!</li>

Rather, it produces a smooth pleasant sensation on your lips with nothing artificial.  Nothing overwhelming.  A sheer pleasure to apply just before I close my eyes at night to keep my mouth moist, since we sleep under a ceiling fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it...you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> LOVED the lip butter! Arrived SUPER fast too!</li>

    <li> I absolutely love the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Lip Butter (Dark Chocolate &amp; Peppermint) I purchased through amazon.com.  I can use it alone or with lipstick.  My lips feel moist, smooth and are ready for cold weather and kissing! Can&#x27;t get much better than that!!!</li>
    <li> It very moisture at the beginning, but not last long</li>
    <li> I Should have been able to tell by the tube that this is a liquid type chapstick, but I was basing the brand and scent/taste off of a large one I bought someplace else that I LOVE.  This is not the same consistency.  :(  Smells good enough to eat though, for real!!  LOL</li>
