      <li>Was very excited to try this product</li>
      <li>My hair is beautiful and has NEVER felt so soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair is beautiful, soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>It will help you grow strong healthy hair.</li>
      <li>i can say is that the shipping was quick and the packaging was nice.</li>
      <li>So quick and easy!  </li>
      <li>I find that I use A LOT of the products and the re-moist finished very quickly for me (well before 90 days).</li>
      <li>I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it.</li>
      <li>it is Fabulous</li>
      <li>in all, this is a fantastic product, but don&#x27;t EVER order from the official Wen page.</li>
      <li>My curls are FREE, shiny and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ok, so now that I&#x27;ve opened the bottle and have some on my hands.....why not try it out, right?  </li>
      <li>Really?!?!?!</li>
      <li>This is pretty much a good kit and probably would make a nice gift since the holidays are approaching</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this after seeing the infomercials etc.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>My hair never felt clean after using</li>
      <li>I needed a hair product that would moisturize and dry out my hair and this works great for moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I had nice, soft, shiny, defined, moisturized curls.</li>
      <li>Check out my full review on missjimmelk@blogspot.com</li>
      <li>, I decided to order the Wen Sweet Almond Mint hair care kit.</li>
      <li>These two products (I think), are where the magic really happens.</li>
      <li>wife loves the product uses it regular was used by a friend she loved it</li>
      <li>Love the product, I am still on first bottle and see the results right away.  </li>
      <li>Quick transaction&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
      <li>At least they were honest, there is NO SOLUTION to getting good results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will be sure to share and spread the word for this particular Seller.</li>
      <li>i had used this a few years ago and wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>Since using WEN I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my hair; it&#x27;s softer, no frizz and much easier to manage.</li>
      <li>Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and shiny now, and I have more &amp;#34;good-hair&amp;#34; days than &amp;#34;bad-hair&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>After trying many expensive salon products that just did not satisfy my lust for beautiful hair, I have finally become satisfied.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the product once so far so good</li>
      <li>Thank You Very Much.</li>
      <li>My hair is also very shiny than any other shampoos that I&#x27;ve ever used and it smells good to.</li>
      <li>after 2 weeks of use exactly as instructions state</li>
      <li>No words to describe the consistent quality and end result.</li>
      <li>The first time I used the cleansing cream</li>
      <li>The texture of my hair changed from soft and smooth to a wooly, brittle, frizzy, and wiry texture.  </li>
      <li>First of all, it&#x27;s not some runny obnoxious smelling goo.  </li>
      <li>Most of us guys secretly open, smell, and test you women&#x27;s arsenal of beauty products in the shower.  </li>
      <li>When I first met my girlfriend, she had this stuff called WEN in her shower.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product does make your hair soft, but it really looks oily.</li>
    <li> This product I can&#x27;t live without. I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about 3 years and it delivers what it says it does. I have curly hair and it really softens my hair to give it manageability. My hair is also very shiny than any other shampoos that I&#x27;ve ever used and it smells good to.</li>
    <li> This is for thick or curly hair</li>
    <li> I love this product.  You can tell after only a few times of using it that it just seems more natural then regular nutrient stripping shampoo. After trying many expensive salon products that just did not satisfy my lust for beautiful hair, I have finally become satisfied.   I cannot wait to try the other varieties that WEN has to offer.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work that well. but tip, if you use make sure you use cold water</li>
    <li> All of these products are amazing! my hair is very important to me and I spend alot of money on salon products to keep my hair healthy and this product tops them all! I have also used silk therapy on my hair every morning for the past 12 years to smooth all knots and tangles; now that I use this I have to say no more silk therapy!!!! AMAZING I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Wen girl and do not use anything else. I prefer the gluten-free Pomegranate &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s great for hair color, helps reduce fading and keeps conditioned.</li>
    <li> Hair is falling out and is causing acne</li>
    <li> I just want to compliment the seller on my particular order. I am \\&quot;EXTREMELY\\&quot; pleased with service provided by this seller. I was not expecting the extra&#x27;s but what a way to go. Thank you so much and I will look for you when purchasing in the future! I will be sure to share and spread the word for this particular Seller. Thank you again!!&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wen is a great product! I have been using it for 5 months and am very pleased with it! My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this great since I was a child. I get a lot of compliments on the transformation Wen has made.</li>
    <li> My hair is soft but the ends of my hair seems to dry</li>
    <li> I bought this and other products because of the ads on TV.  I should have read the reviews about all of the women who&#x27;s hair has dried out and has FALLEN out!  I only used it twice and I had nothing but ruined hair.  My hair got so dry and damaged from it, it even turned white and straw like.  I had to get over 4 inches cut off to remove the damage, my beautiful hair is ruined.  People do your research and do not buy because of TV ads like I did, read the reviews from others online.  Shocking!</li>
    <li> No words to describe the consistent quality and end result. Time after time same end result could not be happier with ALL WEN PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> I love the way the product makes my hair feel. I will purchase again and share the results with friends</li>
    <li> My hair fell out! It was also very dry. I followed the directions and was very disappointed. My healthy hair was unhealthy because of Wen!</li>
    <li> I got this product as gift for someone, and she loved it! I would be happy to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am mixed with black/white. My hair is on the kinky side, get curly. I started using Wen and I thought I was seeing a difference but my hair got severely dry. So I will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> Wen product is great for any women of color who tired of process chemicals in her hair. It will help you grow strong healthy hair. It does what the infomercials says it will do. Your hair will become rejuvenated and you will see less shedding and breakage too. Try it, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I received this kit as a gift, after wanting to try it for a very long time. The package arrived promptly and I was anxious to try it!&lt;br /&gt;First let me give you some background on my hair.  I have very long, coarse, thick, naturally curly (which is now naturally frizzy after having been color treated for over 30  years) hair.  I have always used a moderately priced shampoo and conditioner, B&amp;B Straight (now called Blow Dry) and Silk Therapy to get the desired result of basically straight, soft, shiny hair.  I use a blow dryer, flat iron and a curling iron on the ends.  I have always received many compliments on my hair and consider it one of my best features.&lt;br /&gt;Now about this product:  Once it arrived and I began reading the instructions, I was a bit dismayed to read that they suggest that you use a bit of the Cleansing Conditioner as a leave in conditioner, as this has never worked well for me.  Every leave-in conditioner that I have ever used has left my hair heavy and flat and unmanageable.  When I read that the Styling Crème was also a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot;, I opted not to use additional Cleansing Conditioner as a leave-in conditioner.  I used the Cleansing Conditioner and Re-Moist Intensive Hair Treatment as directed.  Left the treatment in for 45 minutes, rinsed with cool water, then applied the Styling Crème to wet hair. After blow drying, I could tell an immediate difference.  My hair was already softer and shinier than with my regular products.  I then used the flat iron and then curled the ends of my hair with the curling iron.  My hair is beautiful and has NEVER felt so soft.  It was much easier to curl and has held the curl for a longer period of time.  I am anxious to see what results the following uses will bring.  I am hoping they stay the same.  I don&#x27;t know how it could get any better.  Finally, a product that does what it says it will do!!  I am not saying that this product will give everyone the same results, regardless of the advertisements.  I can tell you that it worked wonders on my hair and I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> At first I did not think I would like this, but after using it for a few months my hair has improved a lot. You need to use the correct amount though depending on the length of your hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this after seeing the infomercials etc. Used it for two weeks hoping that it would grow on me, but it didn&#x27;t. My hair felt heavy and greasy all the time. I used less product and rinsed for longer but it just always felt heavy and dirty. Personally, not a fan.</li>
    <li> This is by far the greatest product I have ever used. I have long, curly red hair and I had always had difficulty finding a product that would keep my hair from frizzing and being altogether unmanageable. My hair is so soft and shiny now, and I have more &amp;#34;good-hair&amp;#34; days than &amp;#34;bad-hair&amp;#34; days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would recommend purchasing this product from any site other than the official Wen site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became a member, and when my old Debit card expired I of course went on to enter my new card information. For some friggin&#x27; reason, the site took this as permission to take out $90 from my account, which not only overdrew my account, but took the money I had set aside for other bills. I had to call the company, where I was put on hold for over an hour, and was then told that I could return the product to get my money back. Well, it&#x27;s been over 5 WEEKS since I returned it, and I still haven&#x27;t gotten my money back. I called them last week to see where my money was, and I was told that it can take 4-6 weeks for the company to process the return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a fantastic product, but don&#x27;t EVER order from the official Wen page.</li>
    <li> after 2 weeks of use exactly as instructions state my scalp was flaking off in chunks and bleeding made split ends worse and hair was breaking off. Not falling out literally breaking off! I have naturally curly hair not color treated dry hair. I do have a friend with naturally oily hair and she did not have the same experience. Product does not seem to work on all hair types the same. READ all the reviews you can find! it took over a week to recover my hair and scalp to a normal state and months for my scalp to heal completely</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give it a 1 star, that&#x27;s how bad this product &amp; customer service is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like so many others I fell for that late night infomercial bologna! I have tried everything with this product, following directions exactly, using more, using less, using it every other day, leaving it in, rinsing it out, combing it through, using hot water, using cold water . . . I can&#x27;t think of anything else to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product takes weeks to arrive, like other folks have reported, it is priority shipped to some post office where I believe it is left in the corner until they absolutely have to deal with it. I&#x27;d say it took a good 4-5 weeks to arrive. The instructions say to use like 20 pumps. Really?!?!?! So just how long is THAT bottle going to last . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after I received the product, I started getting emails stating if I was not getting the results I wanted to call Wen by Chaz. I called today, told them the issues I was having. Their solution to me getting the results I was expecting . . . send the product back for a full refund since I was still within my 60 days! At least they were honest, there is NO SOLUTION to getting good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I signed into my account to write a review and guess what? When I go to &#x27;write a review&#x27; it says &#x27;Submission Currently Unavailable.&#x27; Wow! It is going to take 4-6 weeks for a refund, minus shipping (which I&#x27;m sure they will charge me at least half of what I paid), but they sure quick on the draw to keep me from posting a bad review on their site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo glad I&#x27;m getting out of this mess!</li>
    <li> Always works miracles on my hair!</li>
    <li> I ordered this system and I wanted to try Wen but didn&#x27;t want to get caught in some auto-mailing system from the Wen website so I ordered it from Amazon. A little about myself, I am an African American female with natural curly hair (3c/4a range for all those that hair type). The first time I used the cleansing cream I followed the instructions on the bottle almost to a T, I just didn&#x27;t use as many pumps as recommended on the bottle. I left it in for the entire duration of my shower, detangled my hair, and then rinsed out the cream. My hair was very soft, smelled amazing, and there was a slight tingle on my scalp- from the mint. I also used a few pumps for my leave-in conditioner, applied some gel to my  hair, and then let my hair air dry. The results were great! I had nice, soft, shiny, defined, moisturized curls. The only con for this product is the price. I used my first bottle in about 6 weeks time so to pay $30 every month and a half can get pretty pricey. Onto the intensive treatment. I used this after shampooing my hair with some heat applied and was very pleased with the results. The consistency of the product is very thick and moisturizing and does wonders for the hair. Also, a little goes a long way. But like the cleansing cream, it is very expensive and I think there are other store products that work just as well as this treatment. The styling creme was a NEGATIVE for me because it felt very waxy and sticky. I never even applied it to my hair once I rubbed some in between my hands. Another product that comes with the kit that isn&#x27;t shown is the texturizing balm. I&#x27;ve used this a few times just to catch flyaways and to help control my edges and have really liked the results. This is pretty much a good kit and probably would make a nice gift since the holidays are approaching but Wen is just to expensive for me to buy on a consistent basis.</li>
    <li> My hair never felt clean after using</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It softened my coarse (Extremely Coarse) hair and made it extremely manageable. The Hair mask or Re-Moist Intensive Hair Treatment gave it a well conditioned shine and left little breakage when combing throught with the magic WEN comb (That doesn&#x27;t Break) lol.

    <li> Motivation for Ordering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After viewing the infomercial for some years, I decided to order the Wen Sweet Almond Mint hair care kit. I wanted a product that was gentle on my multi-racial fine and soft hair (African American/European American).  My down my back medium length hair is so soft that it will not hold a curl, and nor will it hold an up do without tons of hair spray and lots of hair pins--see photo.  The kit contained all the products pictured here: Sweet Almond Mint Conditioner (12 oz.), Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment (2 oz.), Sweet Almond Mint Styling Cream (2 oz.), Sweet Mint Texture Balm (.35 oz.), and a black wide-tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product for two months and my hair color changed from a soft dark brown to a brassy auburn, so I thought.  The texture of my hair changed from soft and smooth to a wooly, brittle, frizzy, and wiry texture.  I went to my stylist to see what we could do to change my hair texture and color back to its original glamorous condition.  She stated, &amp;#34;Your hair is fried, we will have to cut it all off, what have you been using!&amp;#34; I told her that I had ordered Wen because I watched the TV commercials, and it implied that Wen was much more gentle than regular shampoo.  The lovely head of gorgeous hair in the photo is all gone.  My stylist had to cut my hair to within an inch of my scalp.  It is gradually growing back with the aid of vitamins and my regular hair care products. Friends, family members, and persons at my house of faith were astonished at the transformation.  I told them of my experience with Wen.  The proof is in the post pictures, that I am not bold enough to share online, and the astonished looks on their faces. I&#x27;ve heard whispers, &amp;#34;What happened to her hair!&amp;#34;  No, I&#x27;m not taking chemo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Mailings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you order Wen, there are two boxes you can check to opt out of receiving additional mailings of the product, and the other allows them to release your info to third parties.  I selected no for both boxes.  Wen put me on the list anyway even though I had opted out of receiving additional products.  When I called, I spoke to someone in Asia (India) they said that they didn&#x27;t want me to run out. &amp;#34;I told them I checked the no box.  They then proceeded to ask why I wanted to cancel, and I told them that the color and texture of my hair changed and my stylist had to cut away the damaged hair.  They said, &amp;#34;We have a product especially for ethnic hair.&amp;#34;  I declined.  However, I had to pay the $10.40/per box shipping charges and waste my gas to travel to and from the post office to return the mailings I didn&#x27;t order.  The post office does not accept &#x27;return to sender&#x27; for the Wen products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t do enough research before ordering this product.  I should have read all the reviews prior to ordering this product.  My hair was my thing and now it&#x27;s all gone.  Who knows how long it will take to recover.</li>
    <li> wife loves the product uses it regular was used by a friend she loved it so wife wanted it and</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick and curly hair that&#x27;s not exactly easy to take care of. Because of that, I have to be discerning about what hair care products I use otherwise my hair would either become too dry,frizzy and poofy or slick and greasy. My fiance&#x27;s mother got me to try this and since then I&#x27;ve been hooked! It&#x27;s worked wonders on my hair! Since using WEN I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my hair; it&#x27;s softer, no frizz and much easier to manage. It&#x27;s a bit expensive to buy but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it. My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair. About a 3-4 weeks into using the product, I noticed clumps and clumps of hair clogging the drain. The same thing happened to my mother, who started using it a few days after me (I used the almond one and used the cucumber one). We&#x27;re both white, she&#x27;s a brunette and I&#x27;m a redhead.  She and I have very different hair types as well.  We don&#x27;t live together, have different diets. etc. Wen is what we had in common.  I lost about 1/3 the thickness of my hair; I was devastated. I was left with this halo-like effect around my head from the short strands of hair left behind from the rest of my hair breaking off. I quit using it and though my hair stopped falling out, my hair is not the same. Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be.  After using hair vitamins and some oil treatments, I&#x27;ve got my shine back, but my hair is still not as strong as it used to be.  When I part my hair, I still have the halo affect of short strands of hair sticking up and they&#x27;re not new hair, it&#x27;s hair that&#x27;s still breaking off.  I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke! Now, it snaps at the lightest pull. Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. I don&#x27;t know how the effects could last so long, but they have. I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy, not pregnant, etc. It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence and I have seen from other customer reviews on the web that this same thing has happened to other people.</li>
    <li> i had used this a few years ago and wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.  i tried it again after watching the infomercial a thousand times and loved it.  For whatever reason it works great!  My hair is beautiful, soft and manageable.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product  I will never ever put chemicals in my hair again and neither will you if you try this just once  it is Fabulous</li>
    <li> My hair has never been healthier! My color doesn&#x27;t wash out, My thin hair is fuller, thicker, and doesn&#x27;t crump in humidity.</li>
    <li> Love the product, I am still on first bottle and see the results right away.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the effects after a fee months.</li>
    <li> My curls are FREE, shiny and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, has volume, shines and looks very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy results.</li>
    <li> never use another shampoo again</li>
    <li> hey, i can&#x27;t be objective on this one cause it wasn&#x27;t for me, it was for some one else, and they&#x27;re totally stoked by chaz dean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all i can say is that the shipping was quick and the packaging was nice.</li>
    <li> You will never use anything else once you try it.</li>
    <li> I hated it wish I never ordered it. This product really sucks i used it one time a instantly I could tell it had thinned out my hair made it break off really bad now I&#x27;m trying to repair my hair for real</li>
    <li> It really works!!!!!! can&#x27;t say that about lots of stuff, but this stuff really, really,works.  My hair is colored, and very dry.  The Wen conditioner treatment restored my hair and it feels and looks great!  Everybody noticed it even with the first treatment!!!!!</li>
    <li> I choose this item because I was not having good results with the product I was using. I love how this products treats my hair. It is soft and manageable all the time now. Yes I tell people what I am using when they comment on my hair. Which happens all the time now. I really love these products for my hair. Thank You Very Much.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen shampoo for just over a year and I still love it. It is a little expensive but it truly does make a difference in your hair and my color does stay in longer so it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that the end result is very nice. The getting there, however, leaves much to be desired.  I am black with long, thick, healthy relaxed and color treated hair. The comb provided does not work on detangling my hair wet or dry which is a shame because it seems like it is truly \\&quot;unbreakable\\&quot;. In fact, the biggest issue I have with this product is level at which my hair tangles while using it. I can neither detangle my hair as instructed while the cleansing conditioner is on it or when working through the \\&quot;Re-Moist\\&quot; treatment. I have actually resolved not to attempt to put a comb through it while I have the products in it. Instead, I towel blot it, apply the spray and leave-in gel and style my hair.  While wet, the hair feels as if it will dry sticky or flaky but it doesn&#x27;t.  These two products (I think), are where the magic really happens. Because of the above double processing, my hair has a tendency to look and feel dry in some parts but since using Wen, it both looks and feels as healthy as it is. I roller set my hair and I find that it retains the curl as well. When I tried to detangle my hair in the shower, I did experience a lot of breakage, but after detangling towel blotted hair with leave-in applied, I had far less breakage. Please note: I also make a conscious effort to detangle the piece I&#x27;m rolling only. I think there is something in the products that create a drying effect on the hair which make it feel like straw when you&#x27;re handling it wet (I have to re-wet my hair more than when using conventional conditioners). So, imagine my surprise my hair dries, smooth and shiny! So, the verdict is &#x27;Yes&#x27;,it delivers on its promise to cleanse without detergents and leave the hair shiny and soft but if you aren&#x27;t careful while detangling you will lose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- I find that I use A LOT of the products and the re-moist finished very quickly for me (well before 90 days). I understand that that may be affected by my hair texture, the amount of hair I have and its length but I wanted to share that that was my experience since some reviewers explained that they did not need as much as the bottles recommended.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan.  Only used it for about a month and notice no change</li>
    <li> Not for me. I have naturally curly, red hair, I have never colored it, nor do I blow dry it. This product really weighs my hair down and pulls all the curl out. I have friends who use it and love it, but it&#x27;s not for me. I haven&#x27;t noticed any fall out like some others have mentioned, but I&#x27;m not going to use it anymore, since it does not seem to agree with my hair type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product once so far so good</li>
    <li> I love everything about it. This is my second time purchasing it &amp; I have decided I won&#x27;t use anything else to cleanse my hair.</li>
    <li> Was very excited to try this product bc I saw the tv commercials.  It def didn&#x27;t deliver what it promises. My hair was left to feel greasy, weighed down and not shiny.  My hair is very healthy and it didn&#x27;t feel that way after 1 1/2 weeks using Wen.  Returning this expensive shampoo and very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Makes my hair feel and look amazing!</li>
    <li> Quick transaction&lt;br /&gt;Item just as promised.</li>
    <li> My hair is past my waist. I needed a hair product that would moisturize and dry out my hair and this works great for moisturizing. A little goes a long way. I use much less pumps than recommended. I find I do need to use a  clarifying shampoo once a month otherwise it will build up on the scalp and cause itching. It also helps to hold my color. I color my hair auburn which is hard to keep but with this product I color my hair less.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully! My hair looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> Cleansing conditioner is great but other items in kit not good for my hair. My hair is fine &amp; not dry so other products are too much for my hair,it does not need the extra softening.</li>
    <li> I was cynical after reading mixed reviews...with normal shampoo my hair ended up frizzy and dull after I washed. I tried lots of different products, oils, conditioners, leave ins, cremes..etc.  I have cut down considerably on my hair budget since switching to Wen. My hair looks and feels so much better!!</li>
    <li> Okay I watched the infomercial over and over but didn&#x27;t want to be committed to a monthly bill.  I buy mostly everything from amazon. It can quick and I tried it for the first time the next day. I&#x27;ve read a few reviews that say it broke their hair off. I did not experience this. I like the way it feels when I wash my hair, the smell is nice almost invigorating. I rinsed at the end of the shower and was hesitant to use the same product to leave in my hair-well it&#x27;s pretty awesome and worth the money. I&#x27;ve used the moisturizer, the balm and its all nice. My husband commented a week or so after I started using it that my hair looked shiny and soft to touch. I would give it a try if your on the fence, how else will you know if you like it.</li>
    <li> This is a great Deal!</li>
    <li> We Love our WEN products, they&#x27;re great!  So quick and easy!  We love the results...too!&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
    <li> Did not noticed a difference as advertised. Was not satisfied.</li>
    <li> So, taking showers in a woman&#x27;s shower is always an interesting experience.  When I first met my girlfriend, she had this stuff called WEN in her shower.  Most of us guys secretly open, smell, and test you women&#x27;s arsenal of beauty products in the shower.  This stuff was different!  First of all, it&#x27;s not some runny obnoxious smelling goo.  In fact, it&#x27;s quite the opposite.  It&#x27;s very gooey and smells quite enticing.  Ok, so now that I&#x27;ve opened the bottle and have some on my hands.....why not try it out, right?  I have mid-length curly hair, and this stuff did wonders to it.  I went from bed head to Fabio just by taking a shower and using this stuff in my hair.  Back on track......my girlfriend swears by this stuff so I bought her some for Christmas and............we BOTH love it!</li>
