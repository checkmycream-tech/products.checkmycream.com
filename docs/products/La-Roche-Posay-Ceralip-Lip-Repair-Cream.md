    <li> it really has not gotten rid of all the dryness around my lips as I had expected...it has only been a week or so</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. Sits on top of lips.</li>
    <li> Great item.  I use it every night and have not had any dry lips problems.</li>
    <li> Have not found anything comparable to moisten my lips, which are dry and wrinkly due to &amp;#34;dry mouth syndrome.&amp;#34;  I put a healthy dab on before bed, and then a little before using lipstick.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd tube, and I really like it.  I mostly use it at bedtime in the summer months as my lip usually get chapped  from the air-conditioning.  the feel is like having vaseline ...I use this procuct as it is  small tube and I keep iat next to my bed.</li>
    <li> Though a little too expensive, it is a superb product and I strongly recommend it. Good quality and works as one would expect of a lip saver and more...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended CERALIP from La Roche Posay, Lip Repair Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am vitamin B-12 deficient, and one symptom of this is small painful cuts on the sides of your lips.  Nothing heals this unless I use Ceralip from La Roche Posay.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun, from antiobiotic creams, to prescription creams, and many more.  Once my doctor recommended Ceralip for this problem, I was so grateful to finally not have the painful cuts on my lips.  The repair cream feels so soothing, and it repairs the damage quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regular pharmacy store stopped carrying CERALIP (although they had other La Roche Posay products), and I couldn&#x27;t find Ceralip anywhere. I was in a panic. Thank God that I found it available on AMAZON, and I faithfully purchase about 4 at a time, sometimes more.  I am worried that someday they would stop making this cream or Amazon would stop selling it.  I would be devastated.  I hope that La Roche Posay continues to produce Ceralip Lip Repair Cream permanently, because you are helping so many people who suffer from medical side effects on their lips.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you La Roche Posay and Amazon.</li>

    <li> I purchased this on the advice of the facialist who I see sometimes.  It did help with my dry, chapped lips.  I did find it to be more on the greasy side and didn&#x27;t stay on well.  On the other hand it did help the healing.....</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Does what it says it&#x27;ll do. Non-sticky but very moisturizing and lasts better than most lip treatments. I&#x27;d buy it again and again.</li>
