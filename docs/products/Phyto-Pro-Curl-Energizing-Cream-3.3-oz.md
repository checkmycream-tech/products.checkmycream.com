    <li> I saw good results with using it on my hair. I have AA hair-4A-very thick which has been damaged by heat. I have one side that needs some TLC with curling. Once I cut out the heat damage, I will see great results with this product. My other side of my hair curls up nicely with the product. I recognize that it not the product but more my hair challenges at this point.I also use the phyto 7 with it for moisture or the relaxing balm for frizz.</li>

    <li> This is a very good product. I have used it several times now and it does help with the body and curls.</li>
    <li> It seems like this product has been sitting around for a while.  When I pump it, it has a strong odor and the cream is yellow, not the usual white.  I had to buy another one locally because it just smelled so bad.</li>
    <li> Not so &amp;#34;Curl Energizing&amp;#34; for me. No problem at all wth the speed of delivery, which was great. Only issue is with the product itself. It didn&#x27;t perform as advertised, but that could be due to my particular hair type, which is naturally curly, but somewhat fine. It was very difficult to comb through/detangle my wet hair after application, and  I had that halo of frizzies the next day after using this.

    <li> Bought it originally at the salon on the stylist&#x27;s recommendation- always on the lookout for my curly/ sometimes frizzy hair.  Need to use 2-3 \\&quot;quarter-size-\\&quot; squirts AND comb it through before finger scrunching it . Sometimes air dry, sometimes a 3 min blow dry with a diffuser.Have used it for a year now and it&#x27;s the only product I use- love it!</li>
    <li> Love this styling cream.  I have thin, wavy hair and this gives my hair volume without being sticky.  I no longer need hairspray!</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and definitely need a stying product.  Anything I have ever used has always turned my hair sticky and/or stiff.  Phyto Pro Curl Energizing Cream is perfect for my hair.

    <li> This product leaves a residue on my hair every time I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;ve tried it three times, on wet hair, dry hair that was a few days old and dry hair that was freshly shampooed...it left residue that looked like little white beads in my hair each time.  What a waste! It went in the trash!</li>

    <li> Great product!! I truly recommend it to anyone that has curly hair. It gives you good definition. It does not make your hair stiff, but rather managable curls.  Try it. Its a white cream, with no scent. Also it does not have harsh chemicals that can damage or dry out your hair.</li>
