      <li>so it was kind of a nice feature to it that made it look even more like a portfolio or tablet instead of a pill box.&lt;br</li>
      <li>also received an XL FOLIO which is nice for storing more than 6-8 pills.</li>
      <li>But over all this is an amazingly designed product and quite stylish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this cute pill box has held its own.</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this!</li>
      <li>The case is very stylish and most important</li>
      <li>This a great product to have for vacations and road trips, with this large case to put your pills in you wont need to carry all the pill bottles with you.</li>

      <li>Love the design</li>
      <li>Sabi made the compartments of their pill case more rounded so it is easier and faster for you to get your pills out without spilling them all</li>
      <li>However, now I am barely able to jump out of bed and use the restroom let alone remember to take my medication before having to grab Xavier.</li>
      <li>I was able to store two weeks of medications,</li>
      <li>i love the look of this pill case.</li>
      <li>I use this on out road trips and love it.</li>
      <li>But with the Folio, they all fit quite nicely inside .  </li>
      <li>Most pill holder are square.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the Sabi FOLIO.</li>
      <li>I love this organizer.  </li>
      <li>but I found that, depending on the size of your pills, it may be able to hold up to eight (8).</li>
      <li>However, when using more than one (I took three with me to Russia and England)</li>
      <li>Most pill reminders look a bit...</li>
      <li>I really love this travel pill box.</li>
      <li>and I really love it/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one looks elegant by comparison to everything else on the market.  </li>
      <li>There is one side-lift top that covers them all.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s sleek and stylish.</li>
      <li>I did like the band that goes around the container for safe keeping</li>
      <li>So glad I found this,</li>
      <li>This pill box is awesome to carry daily medications.  </li>
      <li>I keep using it because its designed so much better than I can even imagine.  </li>
      <li>I just received my pill organizer, and I love the way it looks.  </li>
      <li>In fact we both love the case.</li>
      <li>and I was in need of a palette for my paint that was portable, stylish, waterproof and had a sufficient number of compartments.</li>
      <li>and I never forget to take my pills because I always can see the box which looks more like a purse or mini-portfolio.</li>
      <li>Contrary to what some reviewers are saying, I think this pill organizer is the perfect size for people who travel or are on the go and don&#x27;t want to schlepp a giant pill organizer contraption with them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked well. I was able to store two weeks of medications, am and pm. Used separate container for larger supliments/vitamins.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking pills regularly for years and always hated the geriatric looking pill boxes. Finally I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to take out my pill case  in front of people. The case is very stylish and most important is that it&#x27;s functional. I love the Sabi line and would highly recommend to anyone who takes pills/vitamins regularly.</li>
    <li> Great purchase for anyone with multiple pills/vitamins to take each day. Not only nice for travel, but just keeping track of intake on a daily basis. Has held up well over the past few trips we&#x27;ve taken.</li>
    <li> niches are too small for my daily pill load.  I take 9 in the am and 6 in the pm.  The larger capsules make this unworkable for my current med load.  It stays in the drawer until my med load decreases.</li>
    <li> I love the look of the the Sabi Folio however the compartments are too small.  2 fish oil capsules fill it with almost no room for other pills. It also doesn&#x27;t seal tight enough to  keep pills from absorbing moisture. In my opinion you can do a lot better at your drugstore for a lot less money!</li>
    <li> I got this for an older relative for a short trip, but she uses it all the time!  It&#x27;s compact size and convenient compartments make this great for any time you&#x27;re leaving the house.</li>
    <li> I love this organizer.  Sleek and discrete.  Thank you Sabi!</li>
    <li> However, when using more than one (I took three with me to Russia and England) they are rather heavy.  I did like the band that goes around the container for safe keeping and the pills did not move out of the individual cubicles.</li>
    <li> I just received my pill organizer, and I love the way it looks.  It&#x27;s nothing like my grandma&#x27;s huge plastic pill case.  BUT the individual pill sections are way too small.  I can&#x27;t even fit my 2 supplement softgels in the section.  It would definitely work for 2-3 small pills or 1 larger capsule, but nothing more.</li>
    <li> Very sleek case...great compartments easy to get pills out of.&lt;br /&gt;Classic cover that will look good when you&#x27;re on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally</li>
    <li> I like this FOLIO Travel Pill Box. It is going to be great when I go away for a day or two. It is nice looking and doesn&#x27;t even look like a pill box. I like the rounded corners so the pills are easily removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Everyone on here is pretty much talking about using this as a pill holder, which is totally fine! The quality of the leather and the plastic is completely fabulous, and it could definitely be a great pill holder. The strap is strong and it seems very clean and sterile, which would be great for people who do want a clever solution for holding their pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw potential in it to be much better than just a pill holder. I&#x27;m an artist and I was in need of a palette for my paint that was portable, stylish, waterproof and had a sufficient number of compartments. This makes the PERFECT watercolor palette for the artist on the go. It&#x27;s got a side for the wells, and a flat side for color mixing. The colors stay in their compartments when you snap it shut, which is actually a lot more than most artist palettes can say. It also looks like a little moleskine in my bag, so it blends in with the other 8 watercolor journals I haul around. I have tried many different kinds of palette for my watercolors, and they all end up extremley gross and messy in a short period of time. This one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> A Wallet for your meds! Great idea and well made follow through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Like the Tripod, this is another pill box that I use solely for my husband. He takes a few prescriptions in the morning, and a few others in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This box is perfect for that. The wells are deep and hold even large pills well. But the wells are easy to get the pills back out of, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used other pill boxes that made it so difficult to get the medications back out that it wasn’t worth the time to fill it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another feature of this box that I really like is that the elastic band is really secure. It’s also easy for me to open at 6 am with blurry vision. There’s been more than a few times that I’ve accidentally dropped this case, and none of the medications fell out or got into other wells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I doubt I would be so lucky if the case were *open* when I dropped it, but it’s great that I don’t have to worry when it’s sealed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that I can take a few minutes on Saturday to fill up this case and it’s ready to go every day. It’s saved me a ton of time opening bottles and sorting medications every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> i love the look of this pill case. It&#x27;s what i use everything . it doesnt look like a case.</li>
    <li> I love all of these products and they have helped my daily tasks so easy. I especially needed the containers and pill cutters because these were definitely my problem areas. I use these for cutting my multivitamins, storing my daily pills and crushing up medicine for my daughter.  I would definitely recommend these products because they are so easy to use, and surprisingly enough, they all work! The products are also ridiculously affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I got this case to review and I really loved the way that it looks. I take a lot of pills so this isn&#x27;t for someone who has a lot. What caught my eye the most was that it didn&#x27;t look like a traditional pill case from the drug store. And fit well into my small purse</li>
    <li> Bigger than I expected and not as portable as I wanted. Back to the dorky (but smaller) drugstore pillboxes I go!</li>
    <li> Love this case from Sabi this is great for traveling and keeping your pills organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Perfect for a vacation supply of meds and vitamins. Elegant and very solid. I recommend this pill box very highly</li>
    <li> Place all my weekly vitamins and pills without anyone knowing that its a pill case. Would but again. Love it!</li>
    <li> I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a lot of vitamins and supplements and it can be very difficult keeping track of them all. That’s why I was so excited to have the opportunity to try out several types of pill boxes by Sabi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sabi FOLIO pill box has 14 compartments making it easy for those needing to take vitamins, supplements, or pills twice daily. The universal lid is very easy to open and the rounded compartments make retrieving pills equally as easy. I especially love the sleek, stylish presentation. The case fits easily in my day bag and the design makes for a very discreet product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s intended to hold up to six (6) pills per day but I found that, depending on the size of your pills, it may be able to hold up to eight (8). Once upon a time I only took 3 or 4 pills a day and it occurred to me that one could load this with two weeks of pills instead of one if that were the case for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also received an XL FOLIO which is nice for storing more than 6-8 pills.</li>
    <li> Of all the pill box and medication storage containers that I have used over the years, this one is by far my favorite.  With 14 individual pockets for daily or twice daily medicines it is great for use at home and while traveling. I really like how sleek, and stylish the case is and that it is easy to open and close with the blue elastic strap.  It does not look like a traditional pill box! The only negative to this Folio style pill box is that it does not fit a large vitamins along with multiple other pills very well.  It is best for only a small amount of pills, as long as there is not more than 1 larger pill.  Since I only take a few daily meds, it works great for my needs.  But I would not recommend it for those who take medication more than 1 time a day, or take multiple larger pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This pill box is awesome to carry daily medications.  I have to eat before I take some of my supplements, and I don&#x27;t always get the chance to eat before I leave my house.  This fits into my purse easily and no one knows what it is.  It is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I&lt;br /&gt;have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this! First of all, the look of it is fantastic so you can leave it sitting out and no one will know what it is. My spouse kept thinking it was a book when I first got it. The two compartments for each day are super handy as well. The only negative that I have found is, if you aren&#x27;t careful and you bump this while it is open, your pills will go flying everywhere. I was rushing one day, being clumsy, and knocked the side of this while I had it open and my pills did fly all over the place. Otherwise though, if you aren&#x27;t being clumsy, everything stays put and this does a great job of organizing your medications. I absolutely recommend this to everyone with no qualms. It is easy to open, so great for someone with arthritis or hand problems, which is also a big plus. It is of high quality materials too, so I really think this is going to last. I probably open it 4+ times a day, and the blue strap has not broken or even stretched out. Sabi took their time in making this a great product.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and easily washable.&lt;br /&gt;Each of the 14 partitions can hold 3 - 4 standard capsule-sized pills.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> It fits in anywhere, you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s a bunch of medication. The band is tight and with all the stuff in my bag it has never opened, which I was worried about when I first purchased it. Good product</li>
    <li> Contrary to what some reviewers are saying, I think this pill organizer is the perfect size for people who travel or are on the go and don&#x27;t want to schlepp a giant pill organizer contraption with them. It&#x27;s compact and just right for travelling light!</li>
    <li> Mainly got this because it doesn&#x27;t look like a pill box so people don&#x27;t ask about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only holds a small amount of average sized pills per day so if you take lots of medicine or vitamins (or large ones) it will not work for you.</li>
    <li> Like that this doesn&#x27;t scream pill box!</li>
    <li> This a great product to have for vacations and road trips, with this large case to put your pills in you wont need to carry all the pill bottles with you. I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I love the Folio because it looks cool.  I keep using it because its designed so much better than I can even imagine.  The curved corners of each pill section make it easier to get your pills out without having to dump the entire thing out.  I loved taking it with me travelling and not having to lug around my entire full bottles of all my vitamins and such.  So glad I found this,</li>
    <li> For me, I normally cannot stand pill containers, and when I go on vacation or overnight, I hate packing pills!  I put them in a container, and they fall out.  I can&#x27;t fit my pills in the container.  I can&#x27;t get my pills out!  But with this pill container, none of that is true.  I plan to put it to good use this summer when I got away for a week.  It should be the only pill container I have to take with me!  I also love the strap that securely keeps the pills inside the pill-box.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This is very slick, easy to use, clean, and classic.  One thing that bothers me about the design, however, is that it cannot stay open while laying flat.  This is only a problem if you want it to lie flat and open while you&#x27;re loading it with pills every week.  With the top wanting to fall shut constantly, you have to hold it open with one hand and manage the bottles with the other hand.  Not a big deal, but definitely annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rounded crevices ARE easier to scoop with one finger than a typical clear pill box.  The reason that there are two crevices for every day is so that you can divide your a.m. and p.m. pills.  Instead of using the a.m./p.m. idea, I&#x27;ve filled it with the same things so that this has become a 2-week container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I haven&#x27;t gone back to the clear, plastic box, so you know this must be better than what I was using.  This is great for traveling, but it is just a little bulky.  It takes up more space than my previous clear box, but it looks a lot nicer on my counter.

    <li> was excited to receive this new cute on the go chic travel pill box to accompany me on my world travels. As many of you already know I am a mother of three, an entrepreneur, bakery owner, world traveler, blogger, journalist, social media and brand manager and the list goes on and on. I am constantly on the road so when the opportunity came up for me to try this new Sabi Strap &amp; Go Weekly Travel Pill Box I was all in because I have purchased countless pill boxes over the years to hold both my migraine medicine and vitamins and none of them seem to last very long. I decided to put the Sabi to the test. I have had my pill box for a month and trust me with traveling to ten different places in the last few months, the kids sports, mommy duties and my social event this cute pill box has held its own. I love the outside look and the great support it provides for all of my pills. Hands down I have found another winner.&lt;br /&gt;*I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I thought the FOLIO Strap + Go Weekly Travel Pill Box was very handy. It is definitely easy to use, and the design is much nicer then the typical hard plastic box you find at some chain stores and pharmacy. I would definitely recommend the FOLIO Strap + Go Weekly Travel Pill Box to anyone who is looking for a travel pill carrier or on a twice a day regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Folio Easy Pill Traveler is a portable weekly pill organizer with two compartments for each day of the week which is also BPA free. Dropped your pill traveler? No worries! With the wrap-around-strap that is attached to the traveler, it helps the scatter proof lid stay put which means your pills stay in place, not on the ground. Each compartment has a capacity for 6 pills. It’s very cute and looks a bit like a writing pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product although might not fit someone that shakes a lot as there are no individual lids on each of the compartments, otherwise, it’s  a GREAT pill holder. The round shaped compartment makes it super easy to slide out the pills and not have to dig for them when they get stuck in the corners.</li>
    <li> I used to have to lay my vitamins out on the table in the mornings so I would remember to take them.  But with the Folio, they all fit quite nicely inside .  This would also work well if one had several pills they had to take twice a day.  The moleskin does show fingerprints, but does wipe off clean easily.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.

    <li> I am always looking for a convenient way to store my medications whether it be for at home or on the road. I want something that can hold my medications and also not be a hassle to carry around. This extra large Folio with strap has proven to be perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this travel box hold my medications with the days clearly marked, but it is also the perfect size and fit for my purse. The outside material is smooth as it is covered with a velvety feel material and the strap holds it closed so that my pills do not fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pill box is made for those of us on a heavier twice daily am/pm regimen of vitamins, supplements or pills. Or for those who take large-sized vitamins or supplements.&lt;br /&gt; It is a cut above the standard 14-door pill box and is much easier to load, with one universal lid. It&#x27;s also much easier to extract pills from the FOLIO grande pill box.&lt;br /&gt; With other pill organizers, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get your fingers into the pill box compartments and it&#x27;s necessary to turn the entire pill box upside-down to shake out its contents.&lt;br /&gt; The FOLIO grande pill box features rounded compartments that make extraction of pills quick and easy and fits elegantly and stylishly into a purse, briefcase or backpack and can be taken out anywhere. And the snug strap keeps it secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have carried one of those cheap plastic organizers around before (The ones that have pop open lids on them) but after a while they do not stay shut and lose their strength. Not to mention the medications end up melting or sticking to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this weekly travel box is perfect for carrying all of your medications with you no matter where you go. Each little opening is nice and deep which makes it perfect for storing numerous pills .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I received this for review.  I really loved the way that it looks. I like that it is a different look then all of the other Pill cases that are out there.  It will work if you have a couple of pills that you have to take every day it will work nicely.  Great for your vitiams also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been looking for a neat jewellery box that would store multiple small earrings and thin chains so they don&#x27;t get tangled. This does the trick very nicely, while looking smart. Everything stays secure in transit, and it&#x27;s actually quite nice to be able to see everything you&#x27;ve packed at a glance. Small/thin rings fit too, but big earrings/pendants/brooches obviously won&#x27;t. Feels sturdy and looks handsome - not too obviously medicinal. Rattles a little, of course, but I think I can live with that. I reckon Sabi could market a jewellery specific version with a softer finish on the inside and no week-day markers pretty successfully...</li>
    <li> I was getting lazy about vitamins so I got this as a little motivator and reminder.  Love the design - it looks like a moleskin notebook instead of an ugly pill cartridge.</li>
    <li> Of late I have been traveling once a week to visit friends a few miles away from my home, I usually spend 2 days there and need to take with me all the supplements that I take morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the Sabi Folio because it keeps my supplements secure and it does not take up a lot of room in my over night bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Folio is sturdy and holds pills in compartments nicely. I use it for the 2 days but you can use it for up to 2 weeks because it has compartments for each day. I do take a whole lot of supplements and I cant be without them so this Folio makes it really easy to travel with all my supplements with out carrying a bunch of large supplement bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I got to try one of these free in order to do the review and I really love it/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> The FOLIO comes with 14 spots for pills, intended to be for two dosages per day. I find it no problem at all to store four pills in each compartment and use it for four of my six dosages per day. At night, I still use my pill bottles, but that isn&#x27;t a bother at all. I&#x27;m fairly sure I could fit the additional four pills per day since my medication is small in size, but it&#x27;s just not so necessary as long as I&#x27;m home at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This case is slick, refined, and modern. It looks like a small notebook, so you could discretely open it up and grab a pill at a restaurant. Your tablemates will notice, but other customers won&#x27;t think anything of it. The elastic that holds the case shut is strong enough to keep the pills secure - I keep mine tossed in a big purse - but easy enough to slip off when you need your pills. I also find it quieter to grab my morning dosage from the FOLIO compared to opening a big pill bottle. It also feels more durable than the cheap ones from the drugstore, which never seem to last more than a couple months before they randomly pop open and spill pills in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers mention that the small size of each compartment isn&#x27;t enough for their pills, which I could see happening. However, for my needs, I have plenty of room. All my prescription meds are very small, so while I take a lot of pills per day, I can easily store them with room to spare. It&#x27;s all in how large your pills are. If you take giant supplements, there may be another option that would work better, but for smaller pills, this one is just fine. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> As a blogger I am able to work for myself. That can be a good and bad thing. If I am lazy you get boring posts if I am in a good mood you are bombarded with posts. However, we are getting back into a normal schedule now but sometimes when your home with your toddler (or kids or even a husband) you tend to not always function at your best. You are forgetful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Once I became a parent I lost sleep and I became forgetful. I thought I would get it back after pregnancy but I have not and I do not expect it anytime soon. I just have so much on my mind it is sometimes hard to remember little tasks. However, little tasks can be important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I wanted to do this review because it speaks to me on two levels, as a mom and as a person with epilepsy. I never had a problem remembering to take medication of any kind before being a mom. However, now I am barely able to jump out of bed and use the restroom let alone remember to take my medication before having to grab Xavier. As a person with epilepsy that is not a good thing. We have to take our medicine(s) at the same time every day. Our levels must stay normal and by keeping a routine they stay normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So since Xavier has been born I carry around a pill case. Nothing too big, but enough for medication and a prenatal vitamin that I still take. Usually the cases I get are very ugly, plastic, giant things. I know it&#x27;s a lot to ask for in a pill case to have some style, but I already have to look at it twice a day everyday and it usually starts and ends my day so I would like it to be at least a pleasant experience. That&#x27;s when I saw the Sabi Folio, I thought it was a wonderful idea. Finally, a pill case that I did not have to hide from and that looked nice sitting on my counter, or going in my purse or overnight bag. It is a sleek 14-door pill box with one universal lid which is so very easy to open but not so easy that all your pills spill out. The compartments are labeled the days of the week in the middle and have one compartment on each side. Sabi made the compartments of their pill case more rounded so it is easier and faster for you to get your pills out without spilling them all and you do not ever even have to turn it over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sabi Folio small and Sabi Folio Large next to each other. I used my contact case as a measuring point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was able to test the Sabi Folio in the small and large size. My husband used one and I used one as he takes a lot of herbal supplements so he liked the large size. It holds a lot of large size pills which you find in your herbal supplements. It also is a little bit darker than the small box so it was kind of a nice feature to it that made it look even more like a portfolio or tablet instead of a pill box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference in depth between the Sabi Folio small and Sabi Folio large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have been using the small Sabi Folio and I think it is the perfect size for me. It even fits a couple prenatal vitamins in each hole which is nice. It is small and fits really nice on my bathroom counter or drawer or purse. I can easier grab my pills without spilling them or losing them, something I often do when I am tired. In fact we both love the case. It has made me remember my medications much easier by just using a case instead of out of the bottle and I do not mind using it in the morning or night because it is at least a pleasant experience and it is quick and fast so you can get on with the rest of your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabi Folio small compartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabi Folio large compartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you are in the market for a new pill case or if you have problems remembering to take medicine a pill case might be a great idea for you! I highly recommend the Sabi Folio&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sabi Folio Small is $24.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it measures 6.7 inches high by 3.8 inches wide by .9 inches deep&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sabi Folio Large is $29.99&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it measures 6.7 inches long by 3.8 inches wide by 1.5 inches high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- All Sabi Folio&#x27;s are BPA free and hand wipe clean with a clothy 1.5 inches high&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- All Sabi Folio&#x27;s are BPA free and hand wipe clean with a cloth</li>
    <li> The Folio strap is a nice tight elastic. As you saw in the video, it keeps the lid on nice and tight. You don&#x27;t want your pills falling out all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; lid is very easy to wipe down. Just grab a damp cloth and wipe. The compartments were pill accessible.  Most pill holder are square. Doesn&#x27;t make much sense since pills are round and oval. Now this smaller Folio doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of pills. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a business trip.  Maybe a small weekend getaway. You can pretty much throw in it your brief case or your bag, and go.</li>
    <li> Each compartment in this case is nice and large, it can fit anything from fish oil to vitamins. Most traditional (cheap) pill boxes don&#x27;t fit fish oil or larger pills, so that is important. I really like the design and look of this pill container - it&#x27;s sleek and stylish. It has been working very well for me and makes it easy to keep my daily pills organized. Plus I can fill it up with 2 weeks worth of pills since the compartments are large enough that I only need to use one a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> this is a great if you take a few different pills and don&#x27;t take them all on the same day. it takes all the guess work out. I sit down 1 day a week and plan my pill &amp;#34;menu&amp;#34; for the week. It also helps me know whether or not I take my daily meds. easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.*</li>
    <li> Finally something that I could leave on my desk and doesn&#x27;t look like a pill holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something for a ton of large supplements,  this prob won&#x27;t hold them, but great for everyday rx.</li>
    <li> This is small enough to fit in my purse but not big enough for all of my vitamins. If you are just taking a few vitamins or have AM/PM vitamins to take, you can certainly store them in the top or bottom rows. I like the band, it keeps the case secure and the BPA free plastic ensures that my vitamins are not contaminated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really cool new concept in the world of pill boxes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Perfect size and great look.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the clean design of this organizer.  I bought it for my husband, to help him adjust to a new daily medicine regime without feeling like an old man.  The compartments are relatively small, but plenty big for his 3 daily pills, so it really depends on the size of pills you use.  Big vitamins and other supplements likely won&#x27;t fit well, but I use the end of his 2nd week to hold a cache of 4 - 6 acid reflux, pain, and allergy pills, so if they are aspirin size you&#x27;ll have no problem.  A year later, the elastic is starting to wear, but it still holds closed of his monthly trips abroad.  Considering this thing has traveled the same 140,000 miles my husband did this year and still looks good I give it extra points for durability.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no problem with moisture; it seals shut but is not water or air tight.  I am going to buy another one in a few months, so we have a back up in case this one breaks.</li>
    <li> The Folio pill box organizes your daily pill regime in easy to use a.m./p.m. compartments with a single universal lid. Not sure if you took  your pills this morning? Just slid down the strap, flip open the lid, and see it all at a glance. The pill compartments are extra large with rounded bottoms that allow your fingers to slide in easily for pill removal. No more frustrating flipping and shaking just to take your meds. The lid is contoured to fit and stay in place even if the elastic band slips or pulls and the sleek design slips neatly into purses or briefcases with style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I recently received a free FOLIO pill box by Sabi to review.  Since I take a minimum of eight pills a day, this is perfect.  I can sort my pills out once a week and not have to fight with bottles every morning and night.  My last pill container used to get knocked off the counter and pills would going flying everywhere!  The sturdy strap on this container keeps it closed no matter what happens.  I can throw it across the room if I wanted to and they wouldn&#x27;t fall out.  I really like how easily I can get my finger in each compartment without having to dump the container all over as well.  Even a large finger could fit in there!  There is plenty of room for more pills if need be which is good because my prescriptions chance often.  I would definitely recommend the FOLIO pill box or the FOLIO Grande to anyone who wants a nice, large sized pill box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I chose to review the FOLIO strap + go weekly travel pill box because I take several medications on a daily basis and have some needed in the morning and some at night. This organizer made it easier to separate out my dosages. I like that the pill compartments are curved to ensure it was easy to remove the pills. I also like the discreet slim design which makes it easier to take to work in my purse. I did however have issue with the open compartments. Often my pills would spill into another day as I took them out. I also worried about all of them falling out every time I opened it for use since all 14 compartments were exposed even when I was only using one. Overall, it is a good idea that with a few tweeks could be exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I like this case and probably would have given it 5 stars, however I would have preferred a smaller case that was less expensive. This case has two slots for each day of the week, and I only need one. Other than that I like the case which I purchased because I have difficulty opening other types of cases, and this one just has a band that is sooooooooo easy. If you are older and need something that is simple to get into, this is for you. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to receive the FOLIO strap + go weekly travel pill box and found it was well designed. The blue secures the box closed and the pill sections are evenly separated giving you an optional spot for morning pills and evening pills.  It is also labeled by day as well; a little reminder for those who need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I came up with is the sections for the pills are not as big as I originally thought they were going to be.  These days pills are HUGE and after placing two big pills in the sectionals I found sometimes the other pills would not fit. But over all this is an amazingly designed product and quite stylish as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> Most pill reminders look a bit... well... tacky. This one looks elegant by comparison to everything else on the market.  It&#x27;s well designed, and well built.</li>
    <li> The product looks nice, but it simply doesn&#x27;t hold that much.  I bought this to replace the traditional daily pill organizer that my girlfriend uses for her vitamins.  Unfortunately, the wells were too small to hold a day&#x27;s pills for her (5 pills).  After a few mishaps with pills falling out, we had to trash the organizer.  The product looks great and if you have a small number of pills to take daily, then I highly recommend it.  However, if you&#x27;re taking more than 3 pills daily, then I&#x27;d look for something higher capacity.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if my medicines would fit in this travel pill box, until it arrived.  I take 6 medicines a day and when I travel or go anywhere, I take an extra day&#x27;s does just in case.  I don&#x27;t like the big pill boxes because they take up so much room in my small handbags but the Sabi  FOLIO travel pill box fits really well.  I can&#x27;t carry a large handbag due to back injuries (the weight of a large one is too much on my back) so my pill box needs to be small enough to fit but large enough to carry my medicines.  My pills are small except for one type and I can easily fit what I need in my new pill box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> This is so much more attractive than the traditional pill holders!  The notebook design also eliminates the problem of doors breaking off.  The pill compartments are shaped with curved edges so pills can slide out without having to tip the case over.  I am impressed with this product for both its design and function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review.

    <li> I like the look and style of this pill box. There are two oval compartments for each day of the week. That comes in handy if you need a morning and evening dose, or just extra space for those bulky supplements. One compartment holds up to three capsules of my preferred multivitamins.  In a single compartment, I can also fit a dose of my B-Complex supplement which consists of two large capsules, and another pill. It looks much nicer than the basic plastic pill boxes I&#x27;ve seen around. As far as function, it does the exact same job as the promotional pill box I got for free last week from the drugstore. The Sabi box adds a touch of elegance to the mundane job of popping a daily supplement, and I can appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product for free for the purpose of this review.

    <li> First of all, this little 6.7&amp;#34; x 3.8&amp;#34; pill container is downright classy. The fingertip touch is soft (not cushy, just fabric soft) and makes me feel as though I have a classy, non-plastic product in my hands. It looks classy, too. Through the years, I personally have carried my mid-day pills in a small single compartment holder tucked away in my purse. And when I&#x27;ve traveled, I&#x27;ve tossed the week&#x27;s supply of an assortment of prescriptions into a single prescription bottle. Now you know as well as I know, that is simply NOT a good solution. But I simply couldn&#x27;t envision those weekly pill holders with all the little compartments tucked in my luggage or my purse and gallivanting cross country. (Can&#x27;t you just see those little lids getting flipped open and pills going everywhere?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That problem is now solved. This &amp;#34;Go Weekly Travel Pill Box&amp;#34; is ideal. The individual compartments (2 per day) don&#x27;t have individual lids on them. There is one side-lift top that covers them all. The little compartments are rounded which helps to get those very small pills out. The whole pill box is held closed with a colorful elastic strap. Just simple and classic. And all the while it is made of BPA-free materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product by Sabi and encourage you to see for yourself just how nice and workable it is for you or someone you love.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I use this on out road trips and love it. Fits in my purse or bag nicely.  easy to get to and fits quite a few at a time.

    <li> The Folio is a great idea.  You can place two weeks of pills in it at a time, and secure them in the case with its snug fitting lid, and the addition of the elastic strap that wraps around the case.  The departments for the pills are \\&quot;bathtub\\&quot; shaped to allow your fingers to easily grasp the pills that are placed inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it is hard to get just one compartment of pills at a time.  The others sometimes want to come out too.  If you use your fingers to sort of scoop out the pills, it works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see my full review, go here. [...]</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Sabi FOLIO. I prefer to take a large assortment of vitamins every day, and refilling my old container every week was getting to be a bit of a pain. Plus, it obviously looked like a pill container, and people would see it and instantly assume I was taking a ton of pills (instead of vitamins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how the Sabi FOLIO looks very unassuming. It&#x27;s modern-looking, and it doesn&#x27;t instantly scream \\&quot;pills/vitamins\\&quot;! The elastic strap on the FOLIO holds the pill container together easily, and despite throwing it in bags or purses, I&#x27;ve never had it come open on me. When it&#x27;s shut, I&#x27;ve never had any of the pills \\&quot;switch\\&quot; compartments either, so everything stays where it should. It&#x27;s worth noting that it IS possible to open it upside down, so if you&#x27;re planning on using this with someone who may not remember to open it right-side up, you should consider that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the compartments are \\&quot;open\\&quot;. This means once the lid is open, the compartments aren&#x27;t sealed off from one another. So again, if whomever is using this won&#x27;t notice if they move pills between spots, you might want to consider that. For me, though, I have absolutely no issue with the design. I&#x27;ll notice if I accidentally move vitamins around, and the curved compartments make it so much easier to actually get my vitamins out. It&#x27;s much easier to refill because I don&#x27;t have to pop open all of the containers to refill; I just have to refill them all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how much it holds, it was designed to do your \\&quot;AM pills\\&quot; and your \\&quot;PM pills\\&quot; for 7 days. This means there are 14 total slots. I don&#x27;t really have any AM/PM, so I chose to put 14 days worth of daily vitamins in it. It&#x27;s a tight fit, but it DID fit five separate pills in each container. I think the Large version would have made it easier, but it DID fit into the small. If you plan on putting more than just one or two pills per slot, get the Large one for easier use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much, I love it. I wish I had the Large one, and then it&#x27;d be perfect for my needs, but as-is, it makes it so much easier to take my vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

    <li> I bought this to organize my pills for the week -- I was counting them all into little zip lock bags and that was very time-consuming.  The folio is far more convenient -- I count right into the container and I&#x27;m done.  Unfortunately, the size of the pill compartments are much too small for the variety of supplements I take.  I&#x27;ve ended up using two compartments for each morning&#x27;s dose and two compartments for each night&#x27;s dose...and therefore, have to refill the folio twice a week.  I&#x27;m still saving time by doing this, and I am still very pleased with the overall design of the product.  I dearly wish it were twice the size though!  I would have rated it a \\&quot;5\\&quot; if the advertisement that led me to buy it had been clear about the size of the pill compartments.  It made it seem like it would be large enough for someone who takes a range of supplements each day.</li>
    <li> This a great idea for someone needs daily pills and has to travel. My con is the wells are only deep for a few pills, so if your someone has to take lots of pills this would not be for you.</li>
    <li> When I travel for around the week, I always take FOLIO easy pill container with me. I can put this carrier on a table and I never forget to take my pills because I always can see the box which looks more like a purse or mini-portfolio. Even when I am eating out or visiting attractions, I do not feel any shame to pull out my travel pill box and take necessary supplements. FOLIO strap + go weekly travel pill box is not only a fashionable accessory, it also helps to organize your pills taking routine. This weekly pill container has 14 compartments, two for each day with flip-open lid for easy use. The round shape of the compartments is convenient to extract the pills out without any efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days of the week are printed between two compartments to ensure you follow the schedule. Elastic band of blue color makes sure that the box always securely closed. As for cover, it looks very nice and stylish. Overall, FOLIO strap + go weekly travel pill box as most of Sabi products is a fabulous combination of elegant design and practical use, bringing little moments of luxury to our everyday life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review. However, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
    <li> I really love this travel pill box. After carrying around a couple bottles, I knew it was time for something different, and this was exactly what I was looking for! It holds all my pills, and fits nicely in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free for the purpose of this review.

    <li> This has made organizing my daily medication very easy. It also secures very well, and not looking like a pill box I do not worry about someone snagging it for the medication, when I carry it in my backpack, or leave it out on my desk at work.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a non pill looking pill carrier, something less obtrusive to keep bedside and also take on the go. I also needed something that had clear color separation for day/night pills. I had one that was purple for day and blue at night. Without my glasses on I often confused the two. The sleek design of this product is what sold me. I had to compromise though b/c there is not a color separation of the compartments (is it really that difficult to make a piece of plastic that is white plastic for the day pills and a dark color for the night pills?) This is also only good if you take pills 2x per day as there are only day/night compartments and they are small compartments too. I fit my 4 pills in the morning slot and 4 in the evening easily but no more. Also, personally I love the easy flap open but be mindful that when you open this to get your pills all of your weeks supply is exposed so if you have shaky hands you can easily spill the tray. Overall I love this as it fits my needs.</li>
    <li> As pictured and described.</li>
    <li> Nice for organizing pills, but its way bigger than expected and kind of heavy. Way better looping than any other pill organizer.</li>
    <li> Thicker/larger than expected with a lot of wasted bulk IMO. and the strap system allows chambers to mix inside if shaken up enough like in a bike trunk bag over rough roads. I no longer use this item but if I carried a large purse or Man Bag I would consider it.</li>
