      <li>Best oil for thin fine hair</li>

      <li>After using two bottles of the product in numerous ways and quantities, I can say that it smells great and leaves my hair soft.</li>

      <li>I have rather curly, color treated hair and this product makes my hair soft and silky without making it greasy.</li>
      <li>and you actually get more oil for less money by buying the smaller ones.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always careful not to get too much to avoid the look of my hair being oily.</li>
      <li>However, I was mainly looking for a product to help with my (not very) frizzy hair and it was ineffective at that, even with blow drying and flat ironing.</li>

    <li> Great product with a wonderful scent and it arrived so quickly!</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine, straight, chin-length layered hair.  The ends tend to bend up in different directions after shampooing and drying.  So before I blow dry with a round brush to &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; my hair in the preferred direction, I apply a few drops of the oil with my hands (3-4 drops spread on my palms and then worked onto the ends of my hair).  Then I blow dry as usual.  It has really helped make my hair look smoother and shinier.  Have gotten plenty of compliments!  The only complaint is that there seems to be a very fine line between &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;too much.&amp;#34;  If I apply too much it will make my hair look greasy and stringy.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff. Even though these were sample sizes this was a bargain! Def buying more when I run out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have oily hair. If your hair is damaged and dry this stuffs great. A tiny but goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Awesome. Made my hair so silky and smooth after the first use.</li>

    <li> Wife is loving it, great price and speedy shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I like the shine and body it gives my hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I gave one to my daughter to try. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good hair oil, not too greasy but still makes hair soft.</li>
    <li> Best oil for thin fine hair it makes my hair silky soft not greasy! Would reccomend to buy these three small bottles so you have one in each bathroom and your gym bag!</li>
    <li> This great stuff holds your color and makes your hair feel so soft</li>
    <li> This is the best product.  You only need a drop.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily and has a nice fragrace.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It makes my hair shiny and healthy looking.  I&#x27;m always careful not to get too much to avoid the look of my hair being oily. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am a big biolage fan. I love their products because they work so great with my hair. I like the small bottles and you actually get more oil for less money by buying the smaller ones. The oil has the wonderful biolage smell and its not too heavy. I put a small amount in after I towel dry my hair and then again when it dries and I style it. Just a small amount goes along way and makes my hair smell wonderful, feel so soft and look so shiny. I love, love, love, biolage!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I use it in shower with my regular conditioner than just rinse out. It leaves my hair so soft when I straighten it</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff!  It does a good job on my coarse, frizzy hair and I use it after washing and leave it in for blow drying.  Just don&#x27;t use too much or it leaves you hair feeling ickily greasy.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot and reordered it when I ran out.  It does not weigh my hair down, and improves its manageability.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has a great smell to it. I will definitely be buying it in a larger quantity next time.  This time i just bought the sample size to try it out.  Love the shampoo and conditioner also.</li>
    <li> help keep my hair healthy and shiny.  Super price. Gave a bottle to my friend then she had me order a set for her</li>
    <li> I have been using BIoSilk therapy oil for 10 years. The price has always been ridiculous. At my salon appointment last week, my stylist didn&#x27;t have the Biosilk, so, she put this on my hair....I LOVE it. She gave me her bottle to take home, and I ordered this the next day from Amazon. About 1/20th of the price.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!  This is NOT an authentic Biolage product.  I have used this product since 2010, and when I received the shipment from amazon, it is a thinner consistency, it has a different smell, and it specifically says on the product label &amp;#34;not for retail sale&amp;#34;.  I returned it immediately.  Very disappointed.</li>
