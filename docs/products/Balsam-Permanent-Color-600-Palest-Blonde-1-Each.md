      <li>I really love this brand.</li>
      <li>but I would spare to buy a much better hair color</li>
      <li>I received this item for an honest review: This product I thought would be a  tad light for me however once I used it</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply and i love it.</li>
      <li>I normally always use Preference by Loreal but found this works just as great as Preference.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mix and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It actually left my hair smelling good after I rinsed it out!</li>
      <li>It was easy to mix and use</li>
      <li>Easy to apply by myself with no helpers.</li>
      <li>The dye did have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>And it made my hair FABULOUS.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect for my pale skin tone and bright blue eyes.</li>
      <li>The color was off a little, but still a good product!</li>
      <li>I think the most important thing is that my hair looks natural, and it does.</li>
      <li>Works great, like any other hair dye!</li>
      <li>It also does not feel dry or damaged, which is amazing.</li>
      <li>So my hair is pretty damaged.</li>
      <li>The color is exactly as described and you could not beat the price for a 3 pack of Clairol hair dye.  </li>
      <li>ok Hair color to be different for the week</li>
      <li>Used other bleach salon colors made it a nice pumpkin orange ;)</li>
      <li>I used regular conditioner after rising it out though and my hair came out soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s easy to use and lasts a long while I suggest trying Clairol Balsam Hair Color bought on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Bought this since it was very cheap; less than $0.40/box.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really change the color of my hair much and it didn&#x27;t cover up the grey.</li>
      <li>It arrived within a few days, everything is intact and was securely packaged.</li>
      <li>I like this deal because it comes with THREE kits and I will most likely need each one because my hair is super long and thick.</li>
      <li>I have dark blonde or light brown hair.</li>
      <li>Usually, my hair gets naturally light in the summer from being out in the sun, but for some reason, this year, my hair hasn&#x27;t been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Barely brown!</li>
      <li>hair did not get as light as it advertises on the box, but then again, I was only dying small strands of my hair to get the highlights.</li>
      <li>Barely *</li>
      <li>but I should have read that when you have really dark hair, you won&#x27;t see as much difference.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft and color last a long time.</li>

<li> Leaves hair soft and color last a long time.</li>
<li> Also, when I mixed the dye, it started off yellow and become a strange blue color, so I was a little worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> my hair was wet, it didn&#x27;t look like the dye had done anything at all.</li>
<li> Everything came as expected ...</li>
<li> In the past, when I dyed my hair blonde, you could see my hair getting lighter even when it was wet.</li>
<li> it didn&#x27;t give me the brassy orange-yellow that blonde box dyes have given me in the past.</li>
<li> However, once my hair was fully dry, I saw that it turned out to be this really subtle highlights that actually looked natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> No skin irritation; scalp was just a little tingling</li>
<li> The boxes were a little squashed, but it did not effect the product.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell like all other hair dyes I have used, and I have dyed my hair a lot!!</li>
<li> My hair is dirty blonde and I dye it lighter blonde.</li>
<li> I will get this again in a few months when may hair needs it.</li>
<li> (However, that resulted in an ugly yellow-orange blonde, which is something I obviously do NOT want)</li>
<li> this color is hard to find</li>
<li> then expect to use at least two if not all three boxes of dye.</li>
<li> to re-dye!&amp;Total waste of time!!!</li>
<li> I know that hair dye always smells bad, but this is a new level of bad.</li>
<li> Very disappointed this did not have conditioner treatment with it.  </li>
<li> /&gt;First of all, the reason why this is 4 stars and not 5 is because smell of this dye is HORRIBLE.</li>
<li> The product was awful for my hair type would not recommend</li>

    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but is a good price</li>

    <li> Love the color came out great</li>
    <li> This is a great color</li>
    <li> Got this through the subscribe and save And it made my hair FABULOUS. I will get this again in a few months when may hair needs it. It came as described and i didn&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to this. It was easy to apply and i love it.</li>
    <li> Color was spectacular.  Hair texture improved even after only one use.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Very disappointed this did not have conditioner treatment with it.  Product is great, but I do look forward to the conditioning treatments with my at home color.</li>
    <li> I received this item for an honest review: This product I thought would be a  tad light for me however once I used it I love the color. It was easy to mix and use and I love the brand. Thank you</li>
    <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I have always used Clairol hair dye and I absolutely love it.  The color is perfect for my pale skin tone and bright blue eyes. It covers well but if you are dyeing hair that&#x27;s darker in color then expect to use at least two if not all three boxes of dye.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really change the color of my hair much and it didn&#x27;t cover up the grey.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in order to attempt to do my own &amp;#34;honey dipped&amp;#34; / balayage hombre highlights. I have dark blonde or light brown hair. Usually, my hair gets naturally light in the summer from being out in the sun, but for some reason, this year, my hair hasn&#x27;t been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the reason why this is 4 stars and not 5 is because smell of this dye is HORRIBLE. I know that hair dye always smells bad, but this is a new level of bad. The window was open, but I could feel myself choking and coughing a lot. Also, when I mixed the dye, it started off yellow and become a strange blue color, so I was a little worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair was wet, it didn&#x27;t look like the dye had done anything at all. In the past, when I dyed my hair blonde, you could see my hair getting lighter even when it was wet. (However, that resulted in an ugly yellow-orange blonde, which is something I obviously do NOT want) I was getting nervous, thinking that it just didn&#x27;t work. However, once my hair was fully dry, I saw that it turned out to be this really subtle highlights that actually looked natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did not get as light as it advertises on the box, but then again, I was only dying small strands of my hair to get the highlights. I like that it didn&#x27;t give me the brassy orange-yellow that blonde box dyes have given me in the past. I think the most important thing is that my hair looks natural, and it does. It also does not feel dry or damaged, which is amazing.</li>
    <li> Bought this since it was very cheap; less than $0.40/box. Delivery was good; no damaged product.  The product itself, only my roots changed color from the dye. No conditioner in the boxes for when you wash your hair out. So my hair is pretty damaged. The dye did have a strong smell. No skin irritation; scalp was just a little tingling but that&#x27;s it. Used another box to dye my hair, excluding the roots, and it changed just a bit, but not enough to blend in with my roots. Will have to use the 3rd box another day and exclude the roots again. Hopefully this will help make the rest of my hair match my roots.</li>
    <li> Love my Clairol Hair Color buy! I normally always use Preference by Loreal but found this works just as great as Preference.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to mix and easy to apply. Color is still lasting at about a month since using it. If wanting a great haircolor that&#x27;s easy to use and lasts a long while I suggest trying Clairol Balsam Hair Color bought on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I got this at a discount for my honest opinion about the product. The color is great, my hair turned out looking more beautiful than it looked before.</li>
    <li> I love this hair color! It doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell like all other hair dyes I have used, and I have dyed my hair a lot!! It actually left my hair smelling good after I rinsed it out! My hair is dirty blonde and I dye it lighter blonde. This blonde color turned out great! I really love it! The only downside to me about this product it it doesn&#x27;t come with a deep conditioner. I used regular conditioner after rising it out though and my hair came out soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> ok Hair color to be different for the week</li>
    <li> Nice product. Great price!</li>
    <li> Works great, like any other hair dye!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother in law, great price and easy ordering. She loves this brand and color.</li>
    <li> The color was off a little, but still a good product!</li>
    <li> I tried using this but I should have read that when you have really dark hair, you won&#x27;t see as much difference. I am fan of clairol but I would spare to buy a much better hair color</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected ...this color is hard to find so glad you carry this product. My customer is very happy that I can order it for her. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have raven hair! Used other bleach salon colors made it a nice pumpkin orange ;) lolol yet this product just turned my roots ..chocolate brown... Barely ***. Might as well dyed my hair with vinegar! No results at all! Barely brown! Have to wait to re-dye!&amp;Total waste of time!!!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really good for the best deal ever.</li>
    <li> It arrived within a few days, everything is intact and was securely packaged. Can&#x27;t wait to see what my hair looks like after.I like this deal because it comes with THREE kits and I will most likely need each one because my hair is super long and thick.</li>
    <li> perfect color for me!</li>
    <li> Love this brand. Leaves hair soft and color last a long time.</li>
    <li> I really love this brand. The color is even throughout my hair. Easy to apply by myself with no helpers. Like I could convince my husband to help me anyway! Even not this color this is a great product at a great price. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
    <li> The product was awful for my hair type would not recommend</li>
