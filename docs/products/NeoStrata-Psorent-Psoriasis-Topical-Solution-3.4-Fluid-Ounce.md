      <li>This stuff helps my Psoriasis more</li>
      <li>We have told any one that we know about this item and have already reordered 2 more bottles.</li>
      <li>On my third bottle now ,and the results are incredible!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used so many of these psoriasis products that I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
      <li>I make sure he never runs out.</li>
      <li>Mostly for treatment of symptoms of itching and flaking.</li>
      <li>I have been prescribed so many medications to treat my scalp psoriasis &amp;</li>
      <li>the Psoriasin, but it lacked in results and was much more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Psorent for well over a year now and could not be more pleased.  </li>
      <li>but works pretty good.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!  </li>
      <li>This is merely an easy way of reducing the itch.  </li>
      <li>I use twice a day because the applicator makes it so easy to do.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>It had a strong odor, but it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Since it is no longer produced</li>
      <li>This smells a bit strong but it is working.</li>
      <li>The best part is I noticed no sent and ver little staining.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hopefully it will continue working because it&#x27;s the most effective OTC treatment I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>I have light Psoriasis on my elbows and ankles.</li>
      <li>With that in mind, I recommend checking NeoStrata&#x27;s website to see if they&#x27;re still providing free Psorent samples so you can try before you buy.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see much results from this product except it kind of got rid of the itch temporarily.</li>
      <li>great topical tar-based product for psoriasis.</li>
      <li>Works like magic to calm itch and pain, and remove plaques.</li>
      <li>Going to try spacingout applications more to see if it will stay clear on its own now.</li>
      <li>This very effective for Psoriasis with immediate relief of symptoms and ultimate cure.</li>
      <li>so I was excited to find it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
      <li>In only 2 weeks I have been having great success.  </li>
      <li>The good results only seem to continue.</li>
      <li>MG217, which costs a fraction as much, is also a far more effective treatment.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used lots of coal tar shampoos and other products over the years, and Psorent smells the best by far.</li>
      <li>The only side effect that I&#x27;ve experienced is that it does make your skin more responsive to the sun, and basically by Summer&#x27;s end areas treated with Psorent will be considerably more heavily tanned.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>I did and found it effective enough to buy a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have finally found this miracle cure.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not messy like so many topicals, you don&#x27;t have to leave the shampoo in your hair for, what seems like, ever, don&#x27;t have to wear a shower cap to bed for some meds, etc.</li>
      <li>NO other medicine/drug is needed which is great after almost 10 years of this condition.and various creams/pills/injections.  </li>
      <li>One, very smart, doctor said, \\&quot;Let&#x27;s try this anyways because tests can be</li>
      <li>Previously I used Psoriasin Scalp Liquid, which I loved.  </li>
      <li>It was the second order and was very smooth.</li>
      <li>When it first came out it was something like $45 per bottle.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to the product 6 years ago</li>
      <li>If I could rate higher than five stars I would.  </li>
      <li>Be patient and consistent just as if the doctor had prescribed this to you.</li>
      <li>Twice per day without fail Best of luck to you all!&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11-1-2015&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give another update</li>
      <li>This is the second time I started using this treatment and for whatever reason it is working better this time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for 25 years, and this works better than topical steroids from your MD!  </li>
      <li>areas\\&quot; and it eliminates the scaly skin and itch very well!  </li>
      <li>Have been diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis - doctors prescribed steroid solution which worked good but just not comfortable using steroids</li>
      <li>but it is the easiest and most fast drying topical treatment out there.</li>
      <li>It does seem to take off the thickness when used consistently but it hurts too much for him to do that.  </li>
      <li>(I let it dry before I get into bed) and when I wake up my skin is so much better.</li>
      <li>The applicator works well and you can accurately apply to only the problem.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this on the advice of my dermatologist for eczema but have real concerns about using it.</li>
      <li>really helps from psoriasis</li>
      <li>Helps the psoriasis and the dab-applicator is very convenient.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care how much it costs.</li>
      <li>you have light to moderate psoriasis, this might be a solution.  </li>
      <li>and it really cuts the itching and burning...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend combining the use of the two!</li>
      <li>for 20.00 bucks a bottle,worth a try,and it turns white flaky skin to a more natural color while its working.</li>
      <li>I have tried other products but none worked as good as Neostrata Psorent topical solution.</li>
      <li>The applicator really makes the use of this product 10 times better than other products on the market.</li>
      <li>I had given it a higher rating because it did clear up the patches a bit, but since it hurts too much he doesn&#x27;t use it</li>
      <li>applicator is pretty good for areas with limited hair, such as the back of the neck.</li>
      <li>Still applying daily for the most part (sometimes he forgets) but only 1x per day now.</li>
      <li>3 months later, all spots are about 50% smaller or more, cracking</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>All large places are completely gone.</li>
      <li>A little more healing</li>
      <li>long term - tried Psorent - fantastic - controls better than the steroid - stayed clear of build-up for long periods of time between regular use - would recommend this highly to anyone</li>
      <li>This product is an economical alternative to current options on the market.</li>
      <li>this one is the clear winner &amp; is non-prescription to boot!  </li>
      <li>It is more liquid and it runs into small cuts and scratches in his plaque.  </li>
      <li>Since using it I can go out in public without being self aware about my psoriasis.  </li>
      <li>It still has a slight tar smell but not to nearly the same extent as most products</li>
      <li>Sometimes will clear plaques.</li>
      <li>There is 1 place on his back that is reluctant to clear up.</li>
      <li>His skin looks clear even with an 18x7 inch spot on the upper leg.</li>
      <li>It was not a good fit for me.</li>
      <li>There is no excuse for this product.  </li>
      <li>It has really toned down my symptoms.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was given a trial size from a doctor and I really liked it. It was way more expensive through the doctor&#x27;s office so I was excited to find it cheaper on Amazon. I am covered about 90% of my body and I use it all over and it makes a difference and helps stop the itch and burning. The scales even go away. I use it at night (I let it dry before I get into bed) and when I wake up my skin is so much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for over 3 weeks now and the Psoriasis scales are just about gone. The creams and ointments I got from my doctor didn&#x27;t work as good as Psorent does. I would recommend this to everyone that has Psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much results from this product except it kind of got rid of the itch temporarily. I would keep looking for something else.</li>
    <li> There is no excuse for this product.  Its price is outrageous, and it is ineffective.  MG217, which costs a fraction as much, is also a far more effective treatment.  I have no idea why--they are both tar in roughly the same strength--but that&#x27;s how it is.  No need to waste your money</li>
    <li> Anyone with plaque psoriasis should get this.  Within two weeks the difference was incredible!!  They were thinned out and not scaly and it took the redness and itching away!  It goes on great and doesn&#x27;t stink like coal tar.  Awesome alternative to steroid treatments.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have had plaque Psoriasis on my knees for 20+ years... thankfully never spreading further than the front of the knee.  This stuff completely eliminated all of the Psoriasis on one of my knees, and other spots that were cropping up!  My other knee has reduced plaques and usually looks quite normal.  I use it in other \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot; and it eliminates the scaly skin and itch very well!  The amount of applications are - a few times during the week!  Try this out!  And if you want to have the FSA authorization of reimbursement you will have to have your Dermatologist either write the prescription for this, or a letter indicating it is \\&quot;medicinally necessary\\&quot;... it is!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it really cuts the itching and burning...pleasant smell and does not stain clothing! Wish it came in LARGER size.</li>
    <li> I have suffered a little over a year. I have seen countless dermatologists and had countless tests run. I was on every steroid cream and ointment up until there was nothing left to try. I have been on the strongest out there. The test for psoriasis came up negative. I have this on my palms so I was set on medical leave from work and school. This has greatly impacted my life. One, very smart, doctor said, \\&quot;Let&#x27;s try this anyways because tests can be wrong.\\&quot; Psorent works! In only 2 weeks I have been having great success.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference after I have suffered for so long. I don&#x27;t care how much it costs. Bring it on and I will pay it. I am going back to school this fall. A little more healing and I will be back to work. I am so happy with this. I am going to get the coal tar soap and lotion next.</li>
    <li> March, 2015:&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty skeptical when purchasing this item for a family member. The applicator really makes the use of this product 10 times better than other products on the market. With Humira no longer being a treatment option for health reasons and the doctors having little else to offer other than steroid creams, I went on the hunt for other psoriasis treatment options. This product has cleared all of the severe redness and irritation within a few weeks. Be patient, apply twice a day, and it should work for you too. This product is an economical alternative to current options on the market. It should be a mainstay of treatment for those who choose to not do the newer biologic medications. We alternated treatment with this product and the CeraVe cream (not lotion). The CeraVe cream will help to resolve dryness, soothe itching, and ease the irritation. This product actually clears up the psoriasis itself. ***I highly recommend combining the use of the two!*** 3 months later, all spots are about 50% smaller or more, cracking/dryness is gone, redness is gone.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;as of 5-11-2015 I can confirm that all of the red, open plaques are gone. Itching is greatly reduced too. My family member is now only using the product a few times per week to maintain the results. We have told any one that we know about this item and have already reordered 2 more bottles. The good results only seem to continue. Be patient and consistent just as if the doctor had prescribed this to you. Twice per day without fail Best of luck to you all!&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11-1-2015&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give another update so people would know what to expect long term. All large places are completely gone. There is 1 place on his back that is reluctant to clear up. All of the digging and scratching has stopped months ago. His skin looks clear even with an 18x7 inch spot on the upper leg. Still applying daily for the most part (sometimes he forgets) but only 1x per day now. Going to try spacingout applications more to see if it will stay clear on its own now. NO other medicine/drug is needed which is great after almost 10 years of this condition.and various creams/pills/injections.  I make sure he never runs out. I do wish there was a larger size and plenty of brochures about this at the doctor&#x27;s office!! It should be covered under health insurance!</li>
    <li> This may work for some, but it made my problem much, much worse. It was not a good fit for me.</li>
    <li> Best product that I have found for psoriasis. I would highly recommend this product. I have tried other products but none worked as good as Neostrata Psorent topical solution. You will notice improvement after 3 or 4 treatments.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until I read the instructions that came with it that it stains fabric and hair.  I have white hair.  Ugh!</li>
    <li> Works like magic to calm itch and pain, and remove plaques. I use twice a day because the applicator makes it so easy to do.</li>
    <li> Great product. I suffer from guttate psoriasis. The product doesn&#x27;t stop the spreading when I have an outbreak but it is the easiest and most fast drying topical treatment out there. I was first introduced to the product 6 years ago and I always make sure I have it on hand! It still has a slight tar smell but not to nearly the same extent as most products and I&#x27;m the only one who notices it.</li>
    <li> I know there is no cure for psoriasis.  This is merely an easy way of reducing the itch.  I recommend it in addition to the steroid ointments usually prescribed.</li>
    <li> Psoriasis is a disorder where a treatment that works for one person won&#x27;t work for another, and where a treatment that works for you today might not work tomorrow. With that in mind, I recommend checking NeoStrata&#x27;s website to see if they&#x27;re still providing free Psorent samples so you can try before you buy. I did and found it effective enough to buy a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will continue working because it&#x27;s the most effective OTC treatment I&#x27;ve found so far. It eliminates itching. The redness is still there, but that might diminish over a few weeks, as some other users have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used lots of coal tar shampoos and other products over the years, and Psorent smells the best by far. You won&#x27;t mistake it for Burberry, but you also won&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply sparingly, especially if the affected area is cracked. This stuff burns for about 15 seconds, so the less you put on in one shot, the less cringing you&#x27;ll do. After the initial burn, the bliss sets in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is pretty good for areas with limited hair, such as the back of the neck. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to use it on your scalp unless you&#x27;ve got a crewcut or are bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to reading about other people&#x27;s experiences with Psorent. It&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for 25 years, and this works better than topical steroids from your MD!  Cheaper too, but it does have a weird smell</li>
    <li> This stuff is working for small patches of psoriasis on my scalp.  The applicator works well and you can accurately apply to only the problem.  The liquid formula gets through the hair effectively.  It does not smell of pine.  It has really toned down my symptoms.</li>
    <li> This smells a bit strong but it is working. Psoriasis is tricky for my BF so it may not work forever.</li>
    <li> This stuff helps my Psoriasis more that any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I have light Psoriasis on my elbows and ankles. The best part is I noticed no sent and ver little staining.</li>
    <li> I have not yet used this product since  I read the warning label that it contains ingredients known to cause cancer in the State of California.  Thank goodness I&#x27;m in NJ, I guess it can&#x27;t cause cancer there!  Just kidding-I ordered this on the advice of my dermatologist for eczema but have real concerns about using it.</li>
    <li> It was the second order and was very smooth. I will order again.  Also, I will recommend this product to all of people who are looking for a helpful lotion.Its work.</li>
    <li> better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
    <li> This stuff burns my husband when he uses it.  It is more liquid and it runs into small cuts and scratches in his plaque.  It does seem to take off the thickness when used consistently but it hurts too much for him to do that.  I had given it a higher rating because it did clear up the patches a bit, but since it hurts too much he doesn&#x27;t use it so I guess that doesn&#x27;t count.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting. It just makes my flaking skin turn yellow and foul smelling; It doesn&#x27;t cut down on the frequency or thickness of my scales, nor the redness/bleeding when they come off.  Stings like crazy if any open skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many of these psoriasis products that I&#x27;ve lost count. I have severe itchy scales on my scalp. After only two treatments, my discomfort is GONE!! I&#x27;m thrilled to have finally found this miracle cure.</li>
    <li> Excellent with fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have been prescribed so many medications to treat my scalp psoriasis &amp; this one is the clear winner &amp; is non-prescription to boot!  It&#x27;s not messy like so many topicals, you don&#x27;t have to leave the shampoo in your hair for, what seems like, ever, don&#x27;t have to wear a shower cap to bed for some meds, etc. --- &amp; it does the job....relieves the itching &amp; scaling &amp; flakes!  Since my involved area is on the back of my head, I do need my hubby to apply it...can&#x27;t hold a mirror, part my hair &amp; apply it....that&#x27;s it&#x27;s only drawback.&lt;br /&gt;Glad my Family Practice MD recommended it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Psorent for well over a year now and could not be more pleased.  I&#x27;ve used all kinds of over the counter and some prescription drugs that would help to some degree but never fully got rid of the my plaque psoriasis.  This stuff has been the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually totally rids my body of the unsightly itchy scaley patches.  I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!  Since using it I can go out in public without being self aware about my psoriasis.  $20 my seem expensive but believe me I would gladly fork over hundreds for this stuff.  If you have plaque psoriasis you need to try this product.  If I could rate higher than five stars I would.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy it!!</li>
    <li> Works, but only if applied 3 times a day!!&lt;br /&gt;No the smell is not as bad as normal tar based creams but it&#x27;s still an unpleasant smell especially after applying through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;I still have a bottle as a back up treatment.. but I stopped using it for now</li>
    <li> Have been diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis - doctors prescribed steroid solution which worked good but just not comfortable using steroids long term - tried Psorent - fantastic - controls better than the steroid - stayed clear of build-up for long periods of time between regular use - would recommend this highly to anyone</li>
    <li> Have used numerous medications for Psoriasis over the last 35 years (OTC, prescription, home brew, etc...) , and have been using Psorent for the last 8 years.  When it first came out it was something like $45 per bottle.  In my experience it&#x27;s managed my psoriasis faster than anything else, with the fewest side effects.  The only side effect that I&#x27;ve experienced is that it does make your skin more responsive to the sun, and basically by Summer&#x27;s end areas treated with Psorent will be considerably more heavily tanned.</li>
    <li> Best solution for my plaque psoriasis. Keeps the itching down. Sometimes will clear plaques. Mostly for treatment of symptoms of itching and flaking.</li>
    <li> This very effective for Psoriasis with immediate relief of symptoms and ultimate cure.</li>
    <li> If you have Psoriasis, you have got to try this! Have used halobetasol for years with little results. On my third bottle now ,and the results are incredible! for 20.00 bucks a bottle,worth a try,and it turns white flaky skin to a more natural color while its working. kinda tan here. Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I started using this treatment and for whatever reason it is working better this time.  Drying up the psoriasis.</li>
    <li> This product has an odor...of course...but works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Helps the psoriasis and the dab-applicator is very convenient.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product for anyone with psoriasis, has a very low tar smell and works wonders, and at 20.00 and no prescription its great for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have insurance and for people who have insurance</li>
    <li> really helps from psoriasis</li>
    <li> Previously I used Psoriasin Scalp Liquid, which I loved.  It had a strong odor, but it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Since it is no longer produced, I had to look for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I gave Psorent a try.  It did help, but was not very effective.  The smell was much less offensive&lt;br /&gt;than the Psoriasin, but it lacked in results and was much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;If you have light to moderate psoriasis, this might be a solution.  However, I&#x27;m going to&lt;br /&gt;try other products.</li>
    <li> great topical tar-based product for psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm when everything else under the sun failed. Also using Gold Bond Ultra Eczema for face and it works great too.</li>
