    <li> this is a great mirror! you can see everything.....good bad and the ugly. the natural lighting helps you&lt;br /&gt;keep makeup looking even.</li>
    <li> I was worried after reading the reviews that the light wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough.  But it is great.  And the price was really good compared to others I looked at.  I love the 8x magnification...especially for these not so young eyes</li>
    <li> I really loved this mirror so much I bought 3. Two for me and one as a gift.  Both I bought from Costco and a little after a year of light usage the bulbs blew out and now I am having one heck of a time trying to find replacements for.  Frustrated, but thankfully I didn&#x27;t pay that much for them.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror, good height, good light, great magnification. The light gets brighter the longer it is on so turn it on a few minutes before you need it. The bad side, you will see things on your face your never saw before!</li>
    <li> this works well the light is a little bit duller then the last one I had that&#x27;s why I only rated it 4 stars does the job</li>
    <li> Received the totally wrong mirror. Definitely not impressed. All you have to do is match the mirror to the pictures. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> my 2nd one!  I have one that my daughter keeps hogging so bought her one :)</li>
    <li> You can get this cheaper at Costco - this mirror is 19.99 at costco - i was pretty disappointed when i saw that yesterday exact same mirror.</li>
    <li> Very good price for this good quality product.  Use it everyday for make-up and cleaning teeth,&lt;br /&gt;Function well with no complaint.</li>
    <li> This natural light magnifying mirror is great. Bought it for my daughter who wears glasses. Now she can put in her makeup and see what she is doing. She loves it! Great quality.</li>
    <li> Not bright enough. The magnification is not strong enough either. It shipped in the time allotted but I am not happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It is a little difficult to switch mirror sides, but overall it is excellent. This is definitely worth the money. It is sturdy and heavy and I believe it will last a long time. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very good.  My daughter loves it.  When she first opened it after Xmas the bulb was burned out but Amazon made it right.</li>
    <li> The lighting is great, and the mirror is built well.  I am happy I bought this product, exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> light bulb was broken when it arrived but it uses 13W bulbs from any store you buy bulbs and it was easy to replace. I use it every day</li>
    <li> The bulb inside was broken right out of the box. My husband couldn&#x27;t get it open because the screws were also a problem. it was bent so the screwdriver could not fit in and turn. It had to be returned. I was then told that did not have anymore. They credited the money back. What a pain in the A#$. I found the same one cheaper @ Costco.</li>
    <li> This helps bring the mirror closer to the user.  Magnification is so good, it&#x27;s almost too good.  My husband uses it daily.  The natural light bulb included really makes a difference in being able to groom thoroughly.  Was worth the price!</li>
    <li> Great mirror, stylish and bright enough to see everything you need to see with it.  Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t take much space.</li>

    <li> I was looking to update my old lighted vanity mirror and after reading great reviews about this product, I ordered it. Shipping was fast and the packaging kept the mirror safe. Alas, it did not live up to my expectation. It should not be advertised or called \\&quot;Natural Daylight...\\&quot;, it is far from being natural daylight! My old lighted vanity mirror is brighter than this product. In addition, I now realized that an 8x magnification is not enough for my eye make up application or for grooming my eye brows. I wish they have one that has a higher magnification. I should have given it 2 stars, but I gave it another star for being heavy weight, sturdy and has the right height for me. I will keep it until I find a better one.</li>
    <li> Love the mirror it is very stable the light is not to bright and it works great. This is a good value.</li>
