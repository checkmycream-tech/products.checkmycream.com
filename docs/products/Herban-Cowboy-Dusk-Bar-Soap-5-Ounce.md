<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> vegan, alcohol free, smells manly, good quality soap</li>
    <li> Best soap at a good price. Under $3 this is the best man soap for me. Above, I would go with Dr Brooner or others, but this is grest and I use daily.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this soap and he smells good all day.  Our son started using it as well and now we have to buy twice as much!  Also, the soap itself lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t melt away fast.  I have recommended this soap to many people!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like awesome. Some people suggest the smell fills up a room it is in. Good. Then I don&#x27;t have to smell all the crappy soaps my roommates have that try to compete with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One concern with this soap is that you run the risk of become a werecowboy. Sometimes after using this in the shower I lose hours of my life. I wake up by a campfire, the embers burning low, bottles of empty whiskey strewn about my feet, with a loyal horse waiting nearby. I find myself asking why I came out West, why I thought I would find my fortune here. I have vague memories of my wife and children dying of cholera, of that gunshot wound I suffered at the hands of Little Boy Slim, the infamous bank robber. I wait until the memories fade, hop on the saddle, and ride into the dawn.</li>
    <li> This product has no endocryne disruptors. But it also has a great smell and it is an effective soap. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just got the soap and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied. The scent is a little odd while washing and the entire bathroom got rather filled with it but it smells much better on your body after the shower! Much more subtle. Didn&#x27;t dry my skin out which is a plus. I&#x27;d recommend it if you are in search of a vegan soap.</li>
    <li> My husband has very sensitive skin, and this is the first soap he tried in ten years that didn&#x27;t make him itch.  It smells wonderful, very green and...well...dusky!  Also, I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents, get terrible headaches from even walking past a Bath and Body Works, but this scent doesn&#x27;t cause me any problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works great! We get this delivered monthly.</li>
    <li> I used this soap all through the winter and for the first time in years, my back was not crazy dry and itchy. The fragrance is nice and manly without being all AXE-y and juvenile smelling. It is costly and seems to dissolve faster than most bar soaps I&#x27;ve used in the past (one bar, for me, lasts 3 weeks or so). I try to stock up when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> Amazing vegan soap that smells perfect for a man.  In fact, the smell is intoxicating!  Some vegan companies don&#x27;t get it quite right but this company gets every product perfect.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my brother as a Christmas gift. He was so excited and we all thought it smells amazing!!! Natural ingredients, too.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic.. I bought it for my husband but I like the smell myself (female).</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap.  He said he likes the aroma as well as the nice lather it makes.  This choice was a guess on my part, so I&#x27;m  glad he likes it.   Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Obviously you are paying a lot for what is just a bar of soap, but if you want an environmentally friendly, body healthy product, this is perfect.  The smell is great.  I do consider this to be a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent, although I wouldn&#x27;t scoff if I noticed a girl smelled this way.  The soap makes your skin literally squeaky clean.  Some might describe this as drying, but I feel like the soap does a good job taking away to excess oil and grime.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Feels a lot like Dove soap which is a good thing. Thumbs up</li>
    <li> Smells like a cross between Irish spring and vetiver Mistral soaps. Nice scent. Decent soap</li>
    <li> I was super exited to get this soap, especially after all the great reviews and it being advertised as organic.  When I got the soap I read through the ingredients and was disappointed to see Parfum listed as one of the ingredients.  Now I wish I&#x27;d been more thorough in researching the product before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Great smelling! My favorite soap!!</li>
    <li> When you reach a certain age, you&#x27;ve developed loyalty to products in most categories. For instance, I know the size and manufacturer of the undershirt, sock, trouser, jean, polo shirt, toothbrush, and so on; it&#x27;s like having a favorite author for everything in your life! Herban Copwboy Dusk is my favorite scent and I buy it in every permutation: soap, shaving cream, aftershave balm, and deodorant. I wish they made a shampoo and conditioner (it&#x27;s Enjoy for me until they do, though).</li>
    <li> Its the only soap i&#x27;ve used that lathers and stays lathered (thats a word, right?!). Smells like if Axe (pick one) and Acqua di Parma Colonia had a child... But the Colonia had the dominant gene.</li>
    <li> It was just okay. Did not find the scent to last all day, nor did the bar last as long as it should have for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, but runs out fast! I&#x27;d guess about a bar a week.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this soap because of the positive reviews on the web. However, there are a few things about this soap which could be improved. First of all, the soap is extremely drying. If you have dry skin, stay away from this product. Second, although this soap has natural ingredients, as others have noted, \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; can mean anything, including synthetics. Third, this soap disappears QUICKLY. I have used many different bar soaps (including many all-natural, vegetable oil bar soaps), and none of them have disappeared as quickly as Herban Cowboy&#x27;s milled soap. I would say that even with conservative use, this bar of soap won&#x27;t last more than 2 or 3 weeks. On the upside, the soap smells great and natural, organic ingredients is a plus. Overall, if you don&#x27;t mind buying two bars of soap a month, that&#x27;s fine, but for me, that adds up fast and it becomes too expensive. If you want a nice, \\&quot;manly\\&quot; soap, I recommend River Soap Company&#x27;s Woodland soap. It costs the same, smells great, doesn&#x27;t dry your skin, and lasts much longer.</li>
    <li> Very nice, doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry/itchy skin.  Good aroma.</li>
    <li> This soap is a spicy work of art.  Very masculine, but not offensive. It&#x27;s a very nice soap for the man in your life.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES how this smells.  He says the smell also lasts a very long time after used.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my honey.  It smells great and it trully is made with natural ingredients!  I am so happy to have found this soap.  If you care about what touches your skin but don&#x27;t care to smell like patchouli, this is the product for you (if you are a guy or looking for a gift for your honey)</li>
    <li> This is a quality product that is reasonably priced. I like this company&#x27;s products and have this soap as part of a regular delivery. I like to use different soaps and this is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s really a bargain price-wise, rinses nice and clean and the scent is perfect. I&#x27;m a guy and not really into the strong scent of after shave or cologne, so I prefer soaps that leave you smelling great without the &#x27;in your face&#x27; smell you get from cologne. As a bonus, after showering with this soap, the bathroom also smells great all day long! Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> the smell is wayyyyyyy too strong</li>
    <li> Ditch the old spice and men&#x27;s dove and all that other crap - and get yourself some of this if you wanna smell like a real man!</li>
    <li> Been trying some new soaps, and this is by far my favorite. The fragrance is great!!</li>
    <li> I use this as a bathroom hand washing bar for my sink and its been 2 months now and its halfway gone I expect another 2 months to go. Smells great and really washes your hands.</li>
    <li> great smelling soap for men. i use this instead of wearing cologne. yes, it is strong for a bar soap but it smells great to me and does a good job of getting me very clean after a long day. your lady will luv the smell when its time 4 bed. wink wink</li>
    <li> Pretty musky and good smelling. I loved it. Does the job.</li>
    <li> This soap smells a lot like their cologne which is amazing and &amp;#34;manly, yet refreshingly subtle&amp;#34; as I described it previously. It moisturizes well and leaves you smelling great. I will certainly be ordering more dusk soap &amp; Herban Cowboy products in the future. Their products really hold up and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this soap. :)</li>
    <li> Awesome scent and great product!!!</li>
    <li> Herban Cowboy&#x27;s Milled Soap hits pretty much every nail on the head. The scent is incredible and unlike anything else I&#x27;ve ever smelled (certainly not like any other bar soap) and it lingers on the skin for a good few hours after showering. It is an organic vegan soap so it is vegetable-based, specifically coconut and palm oils. Very fine pumice helps clean skin, black walnut deodorizes, and sea kelp + glycerin moisturize making your skin feel smooth for the rest of the day. The soap produces a nice lather that rinses clean and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have been looking for the ideal bar soap to use and it looks as though I&#x27;ve finally found it. This soap does not irritate my skin; it is actually incredibly soothing for how simple the ingredients are to the point that I can even wash my face with it. The rosemary leaf extract has been known to calm skin irritations and has anti-aging properties to boot. I love soaps that have a nice, strong smell and the Dusk scent is masculine, musky and great in and after the shower. If you are sensitive to stronger scents this bar may not be the best pick for you. The soap itself is gray-colored, very smooth and pleasant to the touch and it appears as though it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap and Herban Cowboy&#x27;s other products. They do not conduct animal testing and their products are all-natural and top notch. I also use the [[ASIN:B000OP79FK Herban Cowboy Dusk Soothing After Shave Balm Moisturizer, 3.5 Fluid Ounce]], which is the most soothing after shave balm I&#x27;ve come across and, of course, smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5</li>
    <li> I work at Amazon and packed this soap for a customer.  The scent smells wonderful!!  I will be buying this if just for the scent to use as an air freshener!!</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my 14-year-old son. He loves it and even his friends are fascinated by the scent. When was the last time 14-year-old boy cared about the scent of soap? It is unlike anything else! It smells fabulous and is not overbearing. The suds factor is perfect. We&#x27;re hooked. I&#x27;ve never written a review before but I had to share this. We also bought the deodorant. I rub it on my clothes just to get the scent. Next stop - I gotta check out if they have cologne.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this soap for over a year. It lasts a long time, smells great, cleans well and will continue to be my daily soap for many years.</li>
    <li> Be a man. Clean yourself and smell awesome. You&#x27;ll make more friends and the neighborhood cats will meow as you walk down the street.</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like perfumes or heavy scents. This soap is awesome. The light musky smell is awesome and I can&#x27;t stop myself from sniffing him after the shower. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in the market for Vegan stuff.  I just like trying different things.  This turned out to be a great find.  It&#x27;s bang for buck.  I will eventually try their other stuff, hope it doesn&#x27;t dissapoint. This has potential to being the brand I stick with.</li>
    <li> It smells pretty darn good and makes me feel nice and clean. Keeps ya fresh and won&#x27;t let ya get stinky.</li>
    <li> One of the VERY BEST bars of soap that you&#x27;ll ever buy! The scent of this soap is great, it makes a good lather and makes you really fresh after a long hot shower. Made from natural ingredients and never artificial stuff, i switched using these + Mistral French milled soaps for that extra long great smeeling scent long after the shower is over. I bought a whole stck of these and i will never go back using a Dial or safeguard GENERIC Crap ever again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the scent is \\&quot;manly\\&quot; as much as it isn&#x27;t \\&quot;fruity\\&quot;. Yes, my husband really likes using it, but so do I. It&#x27;s just very pleasant all around, even on sensitive skin...even on kids. And great ingredients too!</li>
    <li> This soap smells sooooo good. I am a vegan who only uses vegan / cruelty free beauty products. It was not easy to find something for the man in my life that fits the bill but doesn&#x27;t smell like patchouli. Enter &#x27;Herban Cowboy&#x27;  (angels singing) . This stuff is sooo yummy smelling. And the scent lingers long after he is out of the shower. I highly recommend this, vegan beauty lover or not.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is WAY too strong. Couldn&#x27;t use the product at all.</li>
    <li> Nice and lingers for a few hours. Soap does not last long enough though. But this is the only soap I will be using.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. The soap has a great lather and leaves me feeling clean. Not a fan that a product that advertises as vegan and natural utilizes dye, whether natural or not, to give the soap an odd grey color. I&#x27;d prefer a clear&#x27;ish, almost glycerin-like, more transparent bar of soap.</li>
    <li> Amazing, strong smell. Great lather and spreads easily. The bar is lasting a while and I&#x27;ll be buying it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I recommend it smells great in it last long</li>
    <li> Love this soap and scent. Using it for as long as it stays this good</li>
    <li> Just an unpleasant soap. Drys skin and smells bad.</li>
    <li> Smells great goes fast.</li>
    <li> Scent is nice, but WAY too strong.  Bar and soap are good quality.  Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Smells great and does it&#x27;s job as a bar of soap.</li>
    <li> Great smell that lasts!</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the matching deodorant and now I&#x27;m simply irresistible...at least to myself. Seriously, this stuff smells great, isn&#x27;t over-powering (I have a sensitive nose), and lathers just right. I mean, what more can I ask for (or say) about soap? Get it and then creepily start sniffing your arm while you&#x27;re sitting in a meeting. You&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
    <li> Relatively inexpensive and has a good aroma. Seems to last a reasonably long time. Would buy again. As with other Herban Cowboy products, the aroma does not last long. I assume that means they are not heavily perfumed, so I am not sure if that is a plus or a minus, you be the judge.</li>
    <li> This is nice soap and it smells good too!</li>
    <li> Nice quality soap however the fragrance reminded me of Calamine Lotion which I&#x27;m not a fan of. If they made soap with other fragrances I&#x27;d consider trying them.</li>
    <li> Husband did not like this, but then, he hates anything I wear that is scented. I am trying to find a scent that makes me smell like I just popped out of the shower, used baby powder, and the smell is perhaps Lavendar. Any ideas?</li>
    <li> I love this scent and the fact that the deodorant is all natural.  It is the only all natural deodorant that I have been able to find that will last all day.</li>
    <li> Good manly smell and the bar lasts well.  Not overpowering and keeps me from stinking.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, husband says it&#x27;s a bit slimy.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this soap. It smells great, has a nice lather, and lasts a decent amount of time. I will definitely be making future purchases.</li>
    <li> Good fragrance soap. Lathers up nicely. Seems to last  long time. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. Very masculine sent.</li>
    <li> Smells great even after using.</li>
    <li> II just started to use it...It soaps up OK and the suds hold up while taking a shower.</li>
    <li> With way better ingredients! I love this soap. Didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and the smell of Irish spring brings a nostalgic touch. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Smells so good!  You have to buy this for your man!</li>
    <li> My son loves this soap,Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers up nicely, washes away cleanly, doesn&#x27;t leave a over perfumed or pungent smell, and does what soap&#x27;s supposed to do! Good product, will purchase again</li>
    <li> This smells great!  I&#x27;m glad to have my man smelling like this soap.  And there is a deoderant with the same scent.</li>
    <li> 4 of Herban Cowboy Dusk Bar Soap, 5 Ounce. What a Great, GREAT!!! Men&#x27;s soap, lots of suds, great for your skin, cleansing and wonderfully fragranced. The price is even refreshing! What a great deal. Thank You so much for a wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE WAY THE SCENT STAYS FOR HOURS. VERY MASCULINE SCENT OR SIMPLY IF YOU LIKE THAT OUTDOORS SCENT!</li>
    <li> The soap quality is really nice, it lathers just fine, and it seems to last longer than Dr. Bronners soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of the bar is not so great.  I think I may be biased, but I am reminded of my 75 year-old Great Uncle who wore old-fashioned , musky aftershave that had this exact same smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not modern. It&#x27;s old-fashioned and traditional musk (I&#x27;m aware the soap is called &amp;#34;dusk&amp;#34;, but the smell is &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34;).  My wife doesn&#x27;t like the smell all that much either, but it&#x27;s better than the Bronner products I was using, so we&#x27;ll try this out for a while.</li>
    <li> great soap smells like a dude soap should. My wife is very sensitive to smells and she loves it. Great price and it lasts very long.</li>
    <li> My husband was looking for bar of soap that is natural and free of harsh chemicals that most known soap brands contain. He was tired of using the body wash I would buy that smelled fruity or flowery. He wanted to smell like a man. So he scoped the hygiene isle in our local Whole Foods Grocery Store and found this product. Ofcourse we found it cheaper on Amazon and I believe we found it even cheaper at iHerb.com ( it is 3.79 for a bar of soap on their website compared to the 7.20 on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves this soap and it smells so GOOD!!! He uses the aftershave, deodorant, and cologne by Herban Cowboy. I also tried the deodorant they make for women. I really like it a lot it&#x27;s called Herban Cowboy Natural for Her and the scent is Blossom. So all you guys who buy this product should tell the lovely ladies in your lives to give this a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a couple years now with no complaints.. I&#x27;ll be sticking with it for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used!  The fragrance is strong and powerful and last all day.  The soap bar is soft and lathers well.  Great use with the Urban Cowboy cologne! Best of all, the soap is cruelty-free.  It is manufactured without testing it on animals!</li>
    <li> Bought for teeneager. Then came back and bought again for my dad. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Geat smell.  I bought it for my husband as I&#x27;m trying to get him away from those toxic body washes.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it and so do I. It leaves the bathroom smelling lovely:-)</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this soap to be so perfumey. It&#x27;s quite strong smelling, and as my girlfriend pointed out, it &amp;#34;smells like a teen magazine&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great smelling soap at a great value. The Sandelwood and other fragrances make this soap extremely pleasant, and manly. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This soap is great! Great smell, cleans well, &amp; doesn&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals in it. Goes good with their dusk deodorant.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever! Great smell, and natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> This soap smells nice. It is masculine without smelling like a junior high dance. My daughter and I didn&#x27;t mind using it at all. It lathered nicely and lasted about 30 washes. It does have a fine grit to it, which was not unpleasant. I liked this soap very much. I did not like washing my face with it, though. The smell was just too much and left me feeling hay feverish when I used it on my face. (I am, admittedly, sensitive to such things.) But my husband and children with sensitive skin had no issues with this soap.</li>
    <li> Very manly smelling soap. My girl likes it, that makes it good</li>
    <li> Reordered many times. 2x price in store. Good value and smells great.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and a great product.</li>
    <li> Package (original box) was smashed and the scent was very strong.  I still gifted it -- could be used as a sachet in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I love the simplicity of this soap, not overpowering with smells, works well with other products, Plus the Organic factor!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Lasts thru playing and sweating with pede patients. Musky with patchouli and spicy. Very nice. Great for sensitive skin too.</li>
    <li> I like the soap,  all natural,  come on</li>
    <li> I thought the product would be like any other soap but smell better. Sadly I was mistaken. The bar lasted me 3 weeks. what a waste of money</li>
    <li> I wonder who all the people are who were writing reviews about lightly scented. There were so many. I usually believe you get what you pay for, but SO MANY people wrote that they had sensitive skin and it was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I really dislike floral scents and no one in my house does well with strongly scented products. Well we all agreed we would have been better with old fashioned Irish Spring. We needed rubbing alcohol to get the smell off!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN OR ANY WELL DEVELOPED OLFACTORY SENSES.&lt;br /&gt;I would not have been so upset if I hadn&#x27;t broken out in hives and smelled like it for a whole day. Something is very strange about all those reviews about it being lightly scented and great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Stays fragrent after for a long time after first use</li>
    <li> My girlfriend likes the way it smells, and it makes my whole bathroom smell good. Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to decay as quickly as cheap soap. I will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Herban Cowboy&#x27;s dusk scent in their deodorant, so when I saw they had it in soap from, I wanted to give it a try.  The bar itself is nicely made and also has that pleasing dusk scent to it.  I found that the bar works nicely and lasted a decent amount of time, so nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> Smells great and all natural!</li>
    <li> This soap has a nice clean aroma and is a step up from ordinary soap, it has a manly scent which i like.</li>
