      <li>Have used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>There was no way to \\&quot;seal\\&quot; the product so that I won&#x27;t accidentally push on top of the bottle and the moisturizer comes out.</li>

      <li>This is light enough to use day and night and the odor smells great!     </li>
      <li>I love this product, as it allows my liquid foundation to smooth on and does not make my face shiny (oily t zone).  </li>
      <li>Super satisfied :)</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product got so many great reviews when it has done such harm to my skin.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and absorbs very quickly.</li>
      <li>The smell is not too strong.</li>
      <li>This is probably the best local drugstore, inexpensive moisturizer out there on the market right now.</li>
      <li>I honestly see no reason to ever purchase another day lotion, no matter how much room you have in your beauty</li>
      <li>Overall this moisturizer is great</li>
      <li>I was blessed with good genetics and clear, even skin.</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin, and this is the only thing I use on my face during the hot summers.</li>
      <li>They were very nice, offered a full refund, and the entire matter was resolved within a day.  </li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, but still lightweight and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out like most moisturizers do.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about a full year now.</li>
      <li>This is a great moisturizer and sunscreen (rubs in easily, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, etc)</li>
      <li>The light just catches your face in all the right places.</li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly and packaged well.    </li>
      <li>This is my ultimate favorite moisturizer!</li>
      <li>but i figured it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I am way behind in my work because all I do is pose, smile and stare at my flawless skin.</li>
      <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin that flakes and burns with most products.</li>
      <li>Based on the success of using that</li>
      <li>I needed a higher SPF, not be too greasy, and be mild on my skin.  </li>
      <li>; very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>My dermotologist recommended that I use SPF-30 moisturizer because of my fair skin and our dry hot summers in New Mexico.  </li>
      <li>smell I don&#x27;t like with sunscreen, and has a higher SPF than most daily moisturizing lotions.</li>
      <li>but I would of dealt with it for the higher SPF.</li>
      <li>it smells nicer and is only 10 bucks with more ranges of spf choices.</li>
      <li>Well, when I got outside it seemed to have made my eyes more sensitive to the light..</li>
      <li>I am a freckle skinned, light blue eyed person if that rings  true for you, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen is nice, but for the amount I need the cost is just not worth it.</li>
      <li>I am blessed (ha ha) with dry skin that is prone to break outs, and most of the moisturizers I have tried caused my face to break out.</li>
      <li>I contacted the vendor and heard back from them very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I would certainly purchase again from them.  </li>
      <li>I agree that the fragrance is pretty strong, more so than what I&#x27;m used to in other facial products.</li>
      <li>Also very affordable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve become very vain.</li>
      <li>I have really sensetive skin, so I always look out for hypo-allegenic products.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this product</li>
      <li>Too much fragrance</li>
      <li>I live in hot, humid Florida.  </li>
      <li>The product caused my skin to burn a little, and the fragance smell was very strong for me.</li>
      <li>this product felt ok when I first applied it, still a little too greasy than I cared for</li>
      <li>After I saw it rated highly on Allure.com, Beauty.com, and many other sites, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
      <li>So far, this works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>In more than a month and a half of use, there has been no</li>
      <li>Love this product, gives great sun protection but leaves none of the annoying sunscreen smell or residue.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>After about a few months of use, I found out that the top of the dispenser twists.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re shopping for a new facial moisturizer with SPF.</li>
      <li>In the winter when my skin is more dry, I do have to apply several times a day, though.</li>
      <li>this was definitly not for me, I&#x27;m sending it right BACK!!!</li>
      <li>I just turn it over and dump it into the new bottle.</li>
      <li>Blends really well into skin and requires no other moisturizer.</li>
      <li>First time I used it, it all came back to me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband uses this every day!! It&#x27;s the only way I can get him to use a daily sunblock</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now. My skin is flawless. I never thought skin could glow the way it is. I look at myself in the mirror and I see an angel face. Having said that: I never stop looking in the mirror. I&#x27;ve become very vain. Lost several friends. I am way behind in my work because all I do is pose, smile and stare at my flawless skin. Yes! This product works. But there is a price. Buyers beware. Only purchase if you have friends to spare and you are not the sole income in your household.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s with sensitive skin that tends to break out, and I&#x27;ve never had a single problem with this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, and I can apply makeup just a few seconds later. I&#x27;ve had bad luck with other SPF lotions, because they tend to feel heavy or make me break out. This one is just perfect. I never even notice that I have lotion on, but it keeps my skin soft and well protected from the sun. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of day lotions, from Oil of Olay to La Mer, and I have to say that this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried. I honestly see no reason to ever purchase another day lotion, no matter how much room you have in your beauty budget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, August 2012: It&#x27;s been three years since I wrote this review, and I still use this moisturizer every morning and am just as happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  April 2014. Still in love! If this product is ever discontinued, I&#x27;ll probably cry. It&#x27;s just perfect. No break outs, no excess oiliness, no stinging or redness. Do yourself a favor and try this lotion!</li>
    <li> Love this product, gives great sun protection but leaves none of the annoying sunscreen smell or residue. Blends really well into skin and requires no other moisturizer. Have used this product for many years.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because I like Aveeno products. I was using Olay Defense Moisterizer Spf 30 when I decided to try this product. My skin is oily and seemed to be much worse after application. The product caused my skin to burn a little, and the fragance smell was very strong for me. I use a product with glycolic acid under my moisterizer so that may have caused to product to sting. I had none of these problems with what I was using before so I will go back, but I would recommend this product to someone to try.</li>
    <li> I used to use Clinique 25spf at about $40. When I was getting a facial at a spa the technicion suggested that I try Aveeno. I did and was very happy with the results and the price. The only negative is that a lot of the product gets left at the bottom of the bottle. I just turn it over and dump it into the new bottle.</li>
    <li> I have really sensetive skin, so I always look out for hypo-allegenic products. A co-worker recommended Aveeno to me. I ought it yesterday, I loved it until I realized i had these stinging eyes...this was definitly not for me, I&#x27;m sending it right BACK!!!</li>
    <li> I am blessed (ha ha) with dry skin that is prone to break outs, and most of the moisturizers I have tried caused my face to break out. This one is a perfect exception. It also has a light catching element that makes your face appear to glow. Love it! In the winter when my skin is more dry, I do have to apply several times a day, though.</li>
    <li> This is my ultimate favorite moisturizer! SPF 30 and love how this makes me glow. To add, it has a nice smell.    This pack of two is a steal! At target, you&#x27;ll be paying $15 for one bottle!     The product arrived quickly and packaged well.    Super satisfied :)</li>
    <li> I had read great reviews in InStyle Magazine and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  My face burned and stung so bad after using it, I could not put anything but cold compresses on my face for relief.  I had a similar reaction to an Aveeno product several years ago, but thought their products had improved, given such a high rating.  Aveeno is not for everyone, especially me.</li>
    <li> Expensive but it works great.  I cannot get a tan when I use it :0  Not greasy, a little bit goes a long way.  It was recommended by my dermotologist two Summers ago.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a face moisturizer, i had been using neutrogena in the past and run out so wanted to try something new.  I saw this had an spf 30 so loved it watched youtube videos and reviews but i guess i should have checked out reviews here as well.  I was trying to decide btn this and ambi and pple said ambi burned their faces so i decided this was it. was pricey but i figured it was worth it. I used it once and it stung my eyes n i thought was something else but i guess i went too close to my eyes. Then when i would put on ma face it would tingle real bad. i didnt want to pay attention then once i saw this big puffy mark on ma cheek bone but thought it was smething else. i still wanted to keep it but alas today i put it on and was tingling so bad i rubbed my face a little and my whole face had puffs in all these spots. so its going back. i cant believe it cos i am one of those people who is not allergic to anything, well i guess i was wrong cos there is something in this that just doesnt work for me. i am surprised cos i thought aveeno was all about sensitive skin. someone mentioned it has soy protein so maybe thats what i am allergic to. so i have to give this a bad rating. back to neutrogena or something else</li>
    <li> This moisturizing sunscreen is way too shiny and oily. I&#x27;m 33 and I think it would be better for older women who have problems with dry, dull skin. By 10 in the morning I need to use an oil-absorbing sheet on my skin, and it makes my concealer slide off as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and sunscreen (rubs in easily, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, etc) but on my oily skin, by the end of a summer day, it forms a grime-attracting layer. I definitely had an increase in clogged pores after about two weeks of use, despite washing my face as soon as I got home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands and feet instead, where it seems to be great. I like it enough to try the 15-spf version, but will otherwise go back to Ambi and Cotz for summer skin protection.</li>
    <li> I had used this in the past, but couldn&#x27;t remember why I stopped using it, so gave it another try due to the good price for 2.  First time I used it, it all came back to me. Too much fragrance and it makes me tear up like crazy.  By the time I got to me car I had tears streaming down my face, which is not a great look for the rest of your makeup.  Today is the second day and tried again to see if it was something else and I am already tearing up and can smell the fragrance. I am not one of those too sensitive about smells either. I like to wear perfume!  What ever they use, is not good for me.  I am a freckle skinned, light blue eyed person if that rings  true for you, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> like others, I think it&#x27;s a good moisturizer and even for my oily skin, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  However, when I use it my eyes feel like they&#x27;re burning up!  I read that a few others had this problem.  Too bad, I can&#x27;t use it, the eye irritation is so strong.</li>
    <li> Despite being a moisturizer I didn&#x27;t find this thing so moisturizing at all. I would put one my dry patches but it doesn&#x27;t help at all. I&#x27;m guessing the target customer for this product is for oily skin people, not try skin. Also this was my first spf lotion, initially I found it a little stinging on my face. It did not even out my skin tone despite what it claims. One bottle can last a month or two. I didn&#x27;t really like this product and it was kinda expensive for 15 bucks. For spf I like neutrogena it smells nicer and is only 10 bucks with more ranges of spf choices.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Aveeno Moisturizer from this vendor for a Christmas gift.  There was a problem with the product.  I contacted the vendor and heard back from them very quickly.  They were very nice, offered a full refund, and the entire matter was resolved within a day.  I would certainly purchase again from them.  For the way they handled my return, they get a Five Star rating from me.</li>
    <li> I live in hot, humid Florida.  I had bought the Aveeno tinted moisturizer and use that if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.  Based on the success of using that, I bought this yesterday at Publix (local grocery store).  I love this product, as it allows my liquid foundation to smooth on and does not make my face shiny (oily t zone).  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was given this from my dermatologist.  Since I have Rosecea I needed a higher SPF, not be too greasy, and be mild on my skin.  So far, this works pretty well.  Also, the Soy compounds that are in the lotion are supposed to work to even out skin tone as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best face moisturizer I have ever used! I have incredibly sensitive skin that flakes and burns with most products. I can&#x27;t even use mineral powder on my face without consequences. About a year ago, I decided to try this product. IT IS AMAZING! It is very moisturizing, but still lightweight and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out like most moisturizers do. I have very fair skin, and this is the only thing I use on my face during the hot summers. I have yet to be sunburned. Believe me, I have tried everything from Clinique to Clearasil, Olay to Neutrogena, and nothing has even felt as good on my face or made my skin as happy as this product.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from eczema over 5 years and this moisturizer perfectly suits for my skin. It is not greasy and absorbs very quickly.</li>
    <li> I may have only giving this product 4 but that only because I sweat a lot and after awhile it makes my face looks greasy...but aveeno is good for u</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight, non-greasy moisturizer that also gives sun protection. My sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t broken out or reacted to it at all, and I find it also helps keep my oily skin in check - I&#x27;m not shiny all day when I use this. So far, the best affordable moisturizer I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I use a benzoyl peroxide cleanser &amp; toner before applying this and it does sting a little upon application (for me it&#x27;s near my nose). I agree that the fragrance is pretty strong, more so than what I&#x27;m used to in other facial products. But luckily for me I like the smell, and it does seem to leave my skin looking glowy compared to my usual Vanicream. There&#x27;s no greasy feel afterwards...another plus! I&#x27;ve used this 3 times on three different weekends, and so far no major breakouts from using it. I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re shopping for a new facial moisturizer with SPF.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this product. I have been using it for about a full year now. I went on this lotion while I was on Accutane and it has made my skin feel so wonderful; very soft and smooth. I also love the fact that it has some SPF in it because I am in the sun quite often. My face has never gotten burnt after staying out for hours outside. Maybe just a little rosy if anything. The lotion is light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or like it is clogging your pores. I will be on this for years to come I&#x27;m sure!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best local drugstore, inexpensive moisturizer out there on the market right now. The moisturizer leaves the skin feeling smoother than ever. When the moisturizer is first applied to the skin, it may feel heavy and a bit shiny, and greasy-looking but after the skin absorbs the product its less shiny and greasy-looking. This is light enough to use day and night and the odor smells great!     When I first bought this product, I was unhappy about the design of the bottle. There was no way to \\&quot;seal\\&quot; the product so that I won&#x27;t accidentally push on top of the bottle and the moisturizer comes out. After about a few months of use, I found out that the top of the dispenser twists. So in order to \\&quot;seal\\&quot; the product you need to turn the dispenser to the left.    Overall this moisturizer is great but there&#x27;s only one downside to it... it&#x27;s a bit glittery. I hope the glitter wont clog the pores.</li>
    <li> I need a lot of sunscreen for my job and this little bottle is just not going to work. The sunscreen is nice, but for the amount I need the cost is just not worth it. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I always use this cream.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to know that I can now get it on line at&lt;br /&gt;a much better price.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It does what it says, for once. It gives my skin a subtle, pretty glow and I have noticed a small reduction in redness. The light just catches your face in all the right places. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would do a good job, based on the reviews Id read. I have sensitive dry skin &amp; was really thinking this would work well. My face turned red, skin burned, and literally looked like I slathered acid on it. :( No good for me</li>
    <li> My curiosity got the best of me while I was reading reviews about this product so I gave it a shot. I have some melasma type discoloration on my face that I had hoped this was going to help with. In more than a month and a half of use, there has been no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to be a decent moisturizer, (although it does leave my skin, which is normal to slightly dry, looking a bit greasy), and using this product did get me in the habit of using SPF on my face daily, but I don&#x27;t think Aveeno ought to be pushing this as some sort of dark spot diminisher, because in my experience, it just doesn&#x27;t have any effect on discoloration.</li>
    <li> Use it every night after washing my face - great stuff and a nice scent as well.</li>
    <li> Be forewarned it can cause a massive acne outbreak.  I washed my face and put it on in the morning.  By night fall I had pimples on my forehead, in the morning my face was covered in pimples.  I would recommend only trying it in one part of your face and watch for reactions.  I will NOT be using this again.</li>
    <li> this product felt ok when I first applied it, still a little too greasy than I cared for but I would of dealt with it for the higher SPF. Well, when I got outside it seemed to have made my eyes more sensitive to the light.. because my eyes BURNED and started to water so much it looked like I was crying. I wasn&#x27;t sweating yet, so it wasn&#x27;t because it was sweating into my eyes either. Good thing I didn&#x27;t have my contacts in. I had to wash the product off my face in a store&#x27;s bathroom. I think it&#x27;s the heavy perfume scent they put in the product that caused the problem.</li>
    <li> I use it daily. I don&#x27;t leave home without it. The smell is not too strong. Pretty good product for over the counter. Also very affordable.</li>
    <li> My dermotologist recommended that I use SPF-30 moisturizer because of my fair skin and our dry hot summers in New Mexico.  This one is priced great and it is a great product.  I have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and was as expected.</li>
    <li> I use this as a daily moisturizer for my face.  Just a little does the job and lasts the whole day.</li>
    <li> this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;sunscreen-y&amp;#34; smell I don&#x27;t like with sunscreen, and has a higher SPF than most daily moisturizing lotions.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever bought. It does indeed make my skin look more radiant and it makes my makeup go on more smoothly.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist as I have fair skin.  I use it daily, and this has helped prevent me from getting burns and hopefully long term skin damage from unexpected bouts in the sun without the ability to use regular sunblock.</li>
    <li> I, like many on here, did research about this product before buying it. After I saw it rated highly on Allure.com, Beauty.com, and many other sites, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER had problem skin. I was blessed with good genetics and clear, even skin. But being in my 30&#x27;s I bought into the hype of needing a \\&quot;daily moisturizer.\\&quot; This product not only made my skin dry and cracked, but it left big, red, burning blotches all over my face. One of the worst spots is right next to my eye and burns constantly, and as everyone knows, your eye region is already sensitive to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I am finding that cold compresses and returning to Suave Advanced Therapy lotion are really helping. I can&#x27;t believe this product got so many great reviews when it has done such harm to my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for this product.  With a need to stay out of the sun, this is ideal.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and am very happy that I did.  It softens my skin and gives me sun protection all at the same time.</li>
