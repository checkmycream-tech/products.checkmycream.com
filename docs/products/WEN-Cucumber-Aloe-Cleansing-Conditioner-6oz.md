      <li>so i decided to give wen one more try since at this point i had given up on good shampoo.  </li>

      <li>Number one, the smell is great, and my hair felt really clean, but the frizziness was still there.  </li>
      <li>make sure you rinse A LOT b/c unlike your normal shampoo, this stuff is wonderful but must realllllyyy be rinsed out, otherwise your roots will be greasy/limp within a day.</li>
      <li>have medium length, very fine hair</li>
      <li>The Customer Service Rep (Who had the best French accent!) talked me into trying this Cucumber Aloe, which I fell in love with!</li>
      <li>My hair is clean and it smells good and shines.</li>
      <li>I love Wen.</li>
      <li>The better version just says &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; on the label and the label is just a rectangle stuck on the front of the bottle.</li>
      <li>It seems like it should be more conditioning...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>, it really does make a great conditioner.</li>
      <li>I started out washing every day and now I wash my hair 3 times a week at the most.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I like the minty refreshing</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>As a conditioner/strengthener, it did okay.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>At the price it is, the result should be outstanding.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel so healthy, like it was just cut.</li>
      <li>so I  started using the better salon stuff since I have access to the Beauty Supply store discount.  </li>
      <li>Using Wen, my hair is much more manageable.  </li>
      <li>You cant just pile all the product on the top of your head and rub it in.</li>
      <li>i say spurge on you and give it a try :)</li>
      <li>but I used to be able to go 2 days between shampoos and now within 12 hours the top of my head looks greasy.  </li>
      <li>Tge product arrived very quickly to me by an outside source, so that was the BEST part of the experience.</li>
      <li>i thought that this formula may be better</li>
      <li>but I couldn&#x27;t stand not washing it any more.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Thank you and Enjoy!</li>
      <li>and it was ok for a day or two</li>
      <li>I think the claims they make are mostly hype.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>I read this on another womans review and it worked better this way.</li>
      <li>I LOVE &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be using  this product any more.</li>
      <li>I ordered the one they said was better for fine hair.</li>
      <li>Truth be told, I sometimes use it to clean my FACE in the shower!  </li>
      <li>The version I bought from this seller had the original better ingredients.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been completely satisfied with the way my hair looks in a very long time so watching the beautiful hair on the infomercials</li>
      <li>I ended up just using it as conditioner after I washed my hair and it worked fine.</li>
      <li>and I get away with 5 pumps just fine</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it didn&#x27;t do anything for it.</li>
      <li>I tried this one since it is supposed to be for fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine blond hair</li>
      <li>To me it smells as strong as cheap purfume.  </li>
      <li>Works great on my fine blonde hair.</li>
      <li>I had very damaged hair because I have colored, bleached, permed etc, but now my hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
      <li>The QVC girls all look so beautiful with their long, shinny and smooth hair - maybe because someone else is spending 20 minutes rinsing their hair for them.  </li>
      <li>this is one of the best products out there i honestly cannot say enough good about it, , and i mean i keep ordering</li>
      <li>Be sure to get the right formulation.  </li>
      <li>A commercial for wen like that would be much more accurate - it feels amazing when you are putting it in your hair.</li>
      <li>I will say, if you follow the directions exactly (use AS MANY PUMPS</li>
      <li>I was really excited about the product.</li>
      <li>This has a fresh smell, kinda tingles too!</li>
      <li>After watching the infomercials and reading all the reviews I was so excited to try this product that the moment I got it</li>
      <li>my scalp didnt feel that clean.</li>
      <li>I just never felt like my hair got clean and all that time rinsing,</li>
      <li>but my hair still didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
      <li>Then you pump the Wen (I use 12-15 pumps, and have medium length, right below my shoulders, fine hair)</li>
      <li>Great conditioner but not much of a cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I tried &#x27;Wen&#x27; by purchasing the online package-where you get the Sweet Almond Mint kit.</li>
      <li>I am in my late 60s and now have the best hair ever.  </li>
      <li>the beginning helps remove much of the products we layer on our hair, allowing the Wen product to do it&#x27;s magic.</li>
      <li>I want to start by saying I  have also used the Wen tea tree cleansing formula and the sweet almond one before this</li>
      <li>My sister gave me the real deal and love it.</li>
      <li>I am grateful for the same good results.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love how Wen products treat my hair!!</li>
    <li> I have used this before and am using it again. I liked it so much that I gave it to several people as gifts.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I am African-American with relaxed hair and this works very well to treat the dandruff I sometimes struggle with. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is long and thin, but only because it has a fine texture. I only had to use this about every 2-3 days. And the quantity of how much styling cream made a difference on how clean or \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; my hair felt. I would use more if I wanted to wear it wavy to help maintain frizz control, or very little to none at all if I was wearing it straight. When I used a curling iron on my hair I wouldn&#x27;t put it on while it was wet. I waited until after it was dry and styled and rubbed a small amount on my fingers and ran it through to texturize the curl. This truly is a really great product line!</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying I  have also used the Wen tea tree cleansing formula and the sweet almond one before this i wasnt 100% impressed.  My hair is long, wavy, is fine but i have a lot of it, gets greasy at the scalp and dry and kinky looking at the ends.  I have tried every drugstore shampoo  which sucked ( obviously) so I  started using the better salon stuff since I have access to the Beauty Supply store discount.  Nothing worked!!! My hair was always FLAT, and got greasy by the end of the day. It was wierd i would buy the \\&quot;volumizing shampoo\\&quot;  of different lines, Bumble and Bumble, Loreal, redken, frederick fekkiai etc which tend to strip off any build up weighing your hair down, but it had the opposite effect and my hair was even more flat! UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WTF???????  plus I  always want extra  volume and i was told that using products like living proof volume cream would help, I worked good the first two times i used it, then the same thing would happen build up and  a greasy weighed down look. I decided that nothing was working so i decided to give wen one more try since at this point i had given up on good shampoo.  The Cucmber Aloe Cleansing conditioner is friggin amazing, after one wash, my hair was clean, shiny and no static or frizz. It was full of volume and bounce, I have to say this one is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than the tea tree one or the almond one, ESPECIALLY if you have oily hair. I did feel like the tea tree one left a flim on my hair and my scalp didnt feel that clean. This one is a noticable difference, i was really surprised how clean my hair felt. AND it did sort of \\&quot;lather\\&quot; in the shower more so than the other ones.  It is expensive, but i dont care, i was so sick of having bad hair days. It blows any high end salon shampoo i have tried away.  Its worth it becuase when my hair looks good i feel better about my day especially since your hair is a big part of your apperance.  my advice would be to order the small sample bottles of3 different kinds and see which one works the best on your hair. Since there really is a difference in each one. Then buy the gallon size in bulk. Also it does take a longer time to wash your hair when using this product. its not a 2 min process. You cant just pile all the product on the top of your head and rub it in. You really need to distribute the pumps of product evenly to different parts of your hair, the top, sides, back and underneath by the nape of the neck, then massage the hell out of your head. comb it through. massage again then let it sit for 5 mins, massage again then rinse thoroughly.  I read this on another womans review and it worked better this way.</li>
    <li> This product did clean my hair, and leave it soft on the first day, but with continued use my hair started to feel greasy and heavy.  I can&#x27;t say that this is a great product for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and WEN left a residue and weighed my hair down.  I tried massaging it in for longer and using more product and less product and I just couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  It left my hair heavy and weighed down.  I use it only occasionally now and I still find that is leaves my hair feeling like it has a residue on it even though I&#x27;m not using it often.</li>
    <li> I tried Wen about a year ago. At first I didn&#x27;t like it as a cleanser. It left my hair greasy on top and moisturized on the ends. Then, I realized I was using the product all wrong. You need to let your hair soak first when you shower, at least 2-3 minutes of good water saturation. Then you pump the Wen (I use 12-15 pumps, and have medium length, right below my shoulders, fine hair) You work the wen through your hair in sections, rub some in the top, on the sides, in the middle, and the ends. Then you need to really work it in. Massage for at least 3 minutes. Then you use a very little amount of water and work it in with the Wen (massage for another 1-3 minutes). You will see slight suds (very little). Then you leave it in your hair for the rest of your shower. Wash, shave, etc, and last rinse your hair very thoroughly. It is a long process and involves more work than normal shampoo and conditioner, but if you don&#x27;t mind taking the time, I promise it is worth it. I have been using it for a year now, and refuse to use anything else! I had very damaged hair because I have colored, bleached, permed etc, but now my hair looks and feels amazing. It also has helped with the greasiness of my hair over time. I started out washing every day and now I wash my hair 3 times a week at the most. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought the Cucumber Aloe would have less of a smell.  I was wrong.  To me it smells as strong as cheap purfume.  I could not use it due to allergies.</li>
    <li> its such a great product im never going back to normal shampoo and conditioner. i work out a lot so  need to use regular shampoo about one a week use to get all the salt and sweat out of my hair but unless your working out 20+ hours a week this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I will say the first day was ok, but after that, it just doesn&#x27;t rinse out and my hair was too flat to do anything with.  I already have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need any help in the flat department.  I wish it would have worked.</li>
    <li> Getting used to the smell of the Cucumber as opposed to the Sweet Almond Mint is not possible.  I am grateful for the same good results.  I will only use the Sweet Almond Mint and the Gardenia Tea Tree from now on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. My hair has never felt so soft, and it is so shiny. I have healthy hair to begin with, so I can only imagine what a great job it would do if your hair is dry or damaged. It is on the expensive side, but it takes the place of your shampoo AND conditioner. I love the fact that I could try a smaller size, given the cost, to see if I&#x27;d even like it by buying it through Amazon. I&#x27;ve also tried their lavendar variety and can&#x27;t decide which one I like best. You&#x27;ll think that it can&#x27;t possibly work because it doesn&#x27;t suds up like regular shampoos but that is because it doesn&#x27;t have all those sulphates and detergents in it. You just put several pumps on your hair at the beginning of your shower, work it in really well, and then let it sit while you finish your shower. Then just rinse it out.</li>
    <li> I have color treated, dry, frizzy hair.  I have tried everything for the frizz, and every serum I could find, and every known conditioner known to man.  When I saw the Wen infomercial, I jumped at the chance to try something different.  Number one, the smell is great, and my hair felt really clean, but the frizziness was still there.  It did nothing to combat the frizzies and did not make my hair shiny at all.  I am really disappointed in Wen, so I am glad I just bought the 6 oz size, which was pretty expensive to begin with.  Live and learn!</li>
    <li> the Wen is actually no special product to me.I&#x27;m only using it because I bought it.My hair is no different than before(3 weeks ago).I dont reccommend it for fine thin hair,at all.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been completely satisfied with the way my hair looks in a very long time so watching the beautiful hair on the infomercials I thought &amp;#34;what do I have to lose&amp;#34;.  I ordered a small bottle of Wen and I have followed the instructions on the bottle.  Since I started using this product my hair has gone from being shiny with fly away ends to being dull and lifeless - well lifeless is probably the wrong word here because it does have life...it flies away all over the place.  Not only that, but I used to be able to go 2 days between shampoos and now within 12 hours the top of my head looks greasy.  So yes, I did have something to lose, ok looking hair went to horrible.  And $18 lost from my bank account.  This product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I got these for my husband, but I tried one as I heard it was great &amp; the best for hair. Yicks -- when I put it on, it felt like it was making my hair dirty.  It was the worst thing I&#x27;d ever felt on my hair in my life.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how small the bottle was and had to reread the instructions because I thought they were wrong, when it stated 20-30 pumps to wash my hair. So needless to say, that small bottle lasted less than a week. I have very curly hair, and was looking for something to \\&quot;tame\\&quot; it down, and the heavy thickness of the Wen product just weighted down my hair, it felt greasy, not light, and it was just as crazy wild as usual. Tge product arrived very quickly to me by an outside source, so that was the BEST part of the experience.</li>
    <li> This one felt so good on your scalp and hair. It actually have off a smell that helped you breath better too. Just loved this product</li>
    <li> Great conditioner but not much of a cleanser.  I just never felt like my hair got clean and all that time rinsing, ridiculous!  I suppose if it had made my hair look fabulous, it might have been worth the price and time spent in the shower but my hair really didn&#x27;t look much different and it just felt grimy.  The QVC girls all look so beautiful with their long, shinny and smooth hair - maybe because someone else is spending 20 minutes rinsing their hair for them.  Not a total waste though, it really does make a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> Works great on my fine blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I tried based on the all the reviews, but it does not work for me, the first day the hair is clean and silky but next day my hair is greasy and I must wash it again. I am sorry, I really wanted to like this product, but it just does not work for my straight hair.</li>
    <li> I tried WEN cucumber aloe on the urging of a friend.  I cringed as I hit the &#x27;add to cart&#x27; however I am now addicted.  I have been using WEN for about 6 months now and constantly have people ask what I use on my hair.  My hair was so fine and oily that within hours my hair was completely flat and NEVER could I go a 2nd day.  Since using WEN my hair stays soft and full all day and can even go a second day without washing if needed.  I have worn my hair short for years just to make it appear fuller, since using WEN I have been growing it out since it looks so nice.  For the ladies complaining about the WEN weighing their hair down I am wondering if they are not rinsing all of the product out.</li>
    <li> I bought the 6oz WEN Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner to try.  The first time I used it my normally frizzy hair had soft curls and felt fuller.  I received a compliment on my hair that same day.  When I applied WEN to my hair in the shower I gently combed it through as instructed. but this caused a little more hair than usual to come out on the comb.  A day or two after using this product my hair began looking frizzy again, although it still felt softer.</li>
    <li> i wasnt impressed.  Rip Off as far as I am concerned.  My daughter and I both have fine thin hair and this did nothing for us.  Glad I got a trial size to start with!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I DEFINITELY notice a difference in the softness &amp; (seeming) health of my hair since I began use. However, unlike some of the reviewers, I have not noticed a drastic change in the length of time needed between washes. In fact, because I work long hours and don&#x27;t always have the ten minutes to spend on my hair in the shower, I like to alternate b/t Wen and my Serge Normant. I will say, if you follow the directions exactly (use AS MANY PUMPS AS IT SAYS - yeah, I know that seems like a lot - and then LEAVE IT ON FOR AT LEAST 5 MINUTES) make sure you rinse A LOT b/c unlike your normal shampoo, this stuff is wonderful but must realllllyyy be rinsed out, otherwise your roots will be greasy/limp within a day. I bought this for Christmas presents for all my girlfriends because I think (if you have the shower time) this is a wonder-shampoo. Excuse me - conditioning cleanser :)Would totally recommend, and don&#x27;t waste your time, buy the big bottle. It will last you forever, and the small 6oz will only last you a couple weeks (if that).</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really wow me compared to regular shampoo. IT wasn&#x27;t good or bad. Maybe if I had thicker or curlier hair it would&#x27;ve been amazing.</li>
    <li> ...so I suppose it works otherwise why would she want it so much. I guess she got what she wanted so there you are&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> This product is nothing like it described. I am trying to return product cause I am very disappointing and this product does nothing it says. Your hair feels no different and all the product is a fraud. I figured since it was so expensive it really worked. Doesn&#x27;t work and can contact the owner.</li>
    <li> WEN Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner is perfect for my hair type.  I have fine, slight frizzy/curly, shoulder length hair.  Using Wen, my hair is much more manageable.  Because my hair is so fine and also short, I don&#x27;t use as much as the product description recommends.  I will say that my hair stays cleaner longer so I don&#x27;t have to wash it as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased the Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Condition from Paul&#x27;s and both time; and was very happy with the quick shipping.  I would definitely purchase more products from them in the future</li>
    <li> I got this because it&#x27;s touted as being awesome. It was a great moisturizer but left my hair really greasy. I didn&#x27;t even use it as a leave in conditioner either. I used about 7 pumps (much less than what it says on the label). Left it in for the allotted time, rinsed it and my roots are super greasy now. Luckily I used it for a night time shower because there&#x27;s no way I could go out with this. I really wanted to like the Wen line. I think I&#x27;m going to get another one from the line just to try it. I am pretty bitter that I can&#x27;t return this and get my money back. I guess I&#x27;ll just use it as a leave in treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have psoriasis on my scalp, considering how \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; this stuff is supposed to be, I figured it would help. Not only is my flare up worse than normal, but my entire scalp (not just the part with psoriasis), is itchy like crazy. I had actually gotten it under control and after using this product my scalp is in horrible shape. I must withdraw my earlier statement about trying another Wen product- THAT&#x27;S not happening.</li>
    <li> I tried this one since it is supposed to be for fine hair.  It might work for some but not mine.  It was too heavy!  I will say it is lighter than the regular Wen conditioning cleanser, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> Terrible! It made my hair feel very oily and heavy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but too expensive for me. I&#x27;ve found another one (at less than half the cost of Wen) through Amazon and love it. No sulfates either. Do a search and find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It seems like it should be more conditioning... but I like it.</li>
    <li> i have long fine hair and i have to wash it everyday because it gets oily. i tried hair one knock off and it was ok for a day or two but then my hair got used to it and was super oily. i thought that this formula may be better but i was wrong. i wish i hadnt spent 20 bucks on 3 uses!</li>
    <li> The ounce size of the Wen cleansing conditioner was a bit smaller than I expected, but otherwise I was satisfied overall.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel so healthy, like it was just cut. And you know those old herbal essences commercials where the woman in the shower is like having an orgasm from the shampoo? A commercial for wen like that would be much more accurate - it feels amazing when you are putting it in your hair. Make sure your hair is soaked, I have to constantly remember that it is very different from regular shampoo. Also, I should say I was skeptical because of my hair type and because of the price plus how much it said you have to use. I cheat every other day and use a tiny (like dime size) amount of a regular clarifying shampoo on my roots only, they just produce too much oil. And I have very fine hair down to my belly button and I get away with 5 pumps just fine, I cannot even imagine using the 20-30 pumps it says on the bottle. Then I put one pump on just my ends as a leave in conditioner. The cucumber aloe smells great and works well for my oily scalp/dry ends fine hair type. The 6 oz was perfect to try it for a week or two to see if it works for you!</li>
    <li> Repairs my hair after coloring. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> I tried &#x27;Wen&#x27; by purchasing the online package-where you get the Sweet Almond Mint kit. I was not impressed @ all! The Customer Service Rep (Who had the best French accent!) talked me into trying this Cucumber Aloe, which I fell in love with! I stopped buying it due to the cost, and Wen charging me card early/without contacting me, etc… Now that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon.com I am so happy! (You can find anything &amp; everything here on Amazon! I just love this place! LOL!)&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length, very fine hair that&#x27;s thick, and has become just tad wavy in places as I&#x27;ve gotten older. I dye my hair, but do not use heat on it if I can avoid it. (Sometimes when the wind chill is below -15 I&#x27;ll break out the blow dryer!) My hair is dry though, due to the color I use, so this &#x27;Cleansing Conditioner&#x27; is prefect! You do need to follow the directions completely-especially if you use many products on your hair! The wetting down of your hair for several minutes @ the beginning helps remove much of the products we layer on our hair, allowing the Wen product to do it&#x27;s magic. (I&#x27;ve found that wetting down of my hair also helps when I&#x27;m using other shampoo products!) Follow the directs to a &#x27;T&#x27; and you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase! I promise!</li>
    <li> Wen products are gentle on my hair but I find I cannot use them all the time. My hair starts to get flat and greasy looking fast. Wen is also very expensive. If I pay a lot, I expect a lot. It&#x27;s a good product but not for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve had some hair loss issues but since I&#x27;ve been using the WEN Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner it seems to have stopped falling out and is growing back. It&#x27;s been great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. My hair is clean and it smells good and shines.But, it seems to get dirty, again, faster.  I&#x27;m just not impressed. I&#x27;ll stick to my Loreal.</li>
    <li> This has a fresh smell, kinda tingles too!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to someone with thin, frizzy, color treated hair.  She had no idea of the cost of this stuff.  I warned her to follow directions since it is not like using shampoo. Also to use it exclusively for a few hair washings to give it a chance.  She was careful and used the whole bottle.  She was underwhelmed.  She said there was no difference in her hair.  Whew....I won&#x27;t have to buy it again.  At the price it is, the result should be outstanding.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price. I use this product often. It really does work well and helps to revitalize and replenish your hair. I would highly recommend this product. It is expensive, so I often shop Amazon and Ebay for deals. I have only tried 3 of the scents and the scents are mild, so it is not strong at all.  Which is very good for me.  I like it quite well.  Thank you and Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I tried Wen hair care before and my roots got really greasy! I decided to try it again with the cucumber formula for greasy roots and dry ends but this was no different. I followed the instructions and still ended up with extremely oily hair at the roots and slightly better ends. Had to use a dry shampoo in my hair everyday to look half way decent. Maybe only recommend using this as a conditioner for ends.</li>
    <li> The product is too expensive for the average person to afford to use and I felt it was wasteful due to the amount that the directions said to use. Twenty (20) pumps for hair only down to my ear lobes! My scalp began itching and it was inconvenient to have to spend so much time working in the product and giving it time to work. I did get more shine, but no more volume or body. I think the claims they make are mostly hype. I am tired of products that don&#x27;t work like they say they will. I need to see real results. I won&#x27;t be using  this product any more.</li>
    <li> I have used WEN for the past 4 years on my color treated, fine hair. My hair stylist always raves about how my color stays and hold up in between salon visits. It always gives me the right amount of cleaning and conditioning. Highest recommendations!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I am in my late 60s and now have the best hair ever.  There is significantly less breakage than before.  Be sure to get the right formulation.  My hair is still oily and the cucumber aloe is the most clarifying of the various formulations.  Don&#x27;t expect this to lather as it does not.  It also takes much wetter hair than with lathering shampoo.  I apply and massage with it while sticking my head under the shower briefly.  Finally, I rinse and rinse with the last one cool.  If you don&#x27;t rinse properly the product does not work as it should.</li>
    <li> I hated it what else can I say the product wasn&#x27;t anything like the almond mint I&#x27;n exchanging it for the one I know I LOVE &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I had seen this product advertised on Yahoo and I thought I would try it. I have fine blond hair and I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before. I used it for a couple days in a row and my hair felt really dirty. I followed the directions and rinsed thoroughly but my hair still didn&#x27;t feel clean. I ended up just using it as conditioner after I washed my hair and it worked fine. Maybe I just  didn&#x27;t give my hair enough time to adjust but I couldn&#x27;t stand not washing it any more. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended, however, I was not impressed on how it worked for me.  I have thin, fine hair and it seemed to do nothing special for my hair like it claims.  I might as well have saved my money and bought Suave shampoo.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best products out there i honestly cannot say enough good about it, , and i mean i keep ordering so i would say you give it a try i did and i love it if i were to have to say one negative it would be price but yet then again you get what you pay for so if ya have the extra $  i say spurge on you and give it a try :)</li>
    <li> Love this on my hair!</li>
    <li> I have real fine and limp hair and this product promised to add volume and shine. After I used this product my hair seemed drier.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a little expensive, but it makes your hair soft, and fuller than regular shampoo does.  and when you are done using it, you take a little bit of it, and put it straight on your hair like you are using a mousse.  It is fabulous, and keeps your hair looking tryly great!!!  All WEN CLEANSING CONDITIONER PRODUCTS are the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> Wen is excellent, jut make sure you get the version that does not list water, glycerin, Cetyl alcohol and cetearyl alcohol as the first four ingredients. The version I bought from this seller had the original better ingredients. My fine frizzy hair became thicker, non frizzy and extremely manageable. All I needed was a little beach spray. I then got the bad version, and it made my hair frizzy, but a little less so, and it felt brittle and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell by the label. The better version just says &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; on the label and the label is just a rectangle stuck on the front of the bottle. The bad version says &amp;#34;Wen by Chaz Dean&amp;#34; and the label sticker goes all the way around the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love Wen. This is the only product for me. I recommend this product to everyone I know. Natural or permed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just awful. After watching the infomercials and reading all the reviews I was so excited to try this product that the moment I got it I came home and took a shower. First, it made my hair smell like medicine, second, it made my fine but thick and very curly hair frizzy and unmanageable and third it completely dried out my scalp. I used the whole bottle (in about 2 weeks) to give it a chance but the frizz and dry scalp just got worse. I&#x27;ll never use this product again. I&#x27;m still trying to undo the damage this stuff did to my hair.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with any wen products. There is no other product out there like wen, the cost is worth every penny because its really 5 products in one.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, naturally curly hair and it&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to find products that work. I think I&#x27;ve found the miracle! I don&#x27;t really follow the directions though. I was with shampoo and then condition like regular, then I use the Wen as a leave in conditioner and add a curl activator. This combination works AMAZINGLY well for me....long, define ringlets and no frizz. If I use it as a shampoo, too much poof. It smells great too!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my very oily hair. In fact, it made it worse. Not worth my money. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> After using this particular product, I reread the reviews and believe this to actually be  wen knockoff. My sister gave me the real deal and love it. But, not so much this product. Instructions read differently and my hair did not feel like it does with the real deal. Sorry this one is a thumbs down for me.</li>
    <li> About once a week I &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my hair with this conditioner/shampoo combo to give it a break.  Truth be told, I sometimes use it to clean my FACE in the shower!  I like the minty refreshing feel it leaves on my face even after drying off.</li>
    <li> About my hair:  I have long (to my waist), straight, very fine hair that tends to get oily at the scalp and dry and frizzy at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product:  I used the product pretty much as directed on the website (there weren&#x27;t any directions with the bottle I got, just so you know).  Based on the comments left here, I definitely didn&#x27;t use anywhere near the recommended number of pumps for my hair length.  I got my hair really wet, I scrubbed the product into my scalp and all the way down to the very tips, I combed it through, waited 3-5 minutes, and rinsed it with cool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results:  As a cleanser, this product fails.  My oily scalp looked just as oily as before I washed it.  As a conditioner/strengthener, it did okay.  The dry, ratty ends of my hair didn&#x27;t change much, but I did notice that my very fine hair felt thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product was \\&quot;okay,\\&quot; but I would not purchase it again.  It certainly didn&#x27;t live up to its hype, and the overall results weren&#x27;t much better than any other type of shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I get product-created eczema on my hands, due to some chemicals that are used in beauty products like soap, shampoo, and conditioner (I haven&#x27;t found out which one specifically yet).  I will say that this product has not caused the eczema to resurface while I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> This product did wonders for my hair.  In addition to it really bringing life back to my hair which had been damaged from coloring and heat,  I actually burned a front section of my hair when I failed to check the temperature of my curling iron.  My hair felt like straw where I had burned it.  I placed the WEN on that section of hair and did not wash it out.  I left it in all night and washed it the next morning.  I could not believe how quickly it restored the burned hair.  I could not tell my hair had be scorched.  I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> I bought the small size to give it a try, and followed the directions. I have oily hair to start with, but this made my hair even oilier. Maybe it&#x27;s part of the process, or you have to get used to it. I don&#x27;t want to walk around with hair that looks like it hasn&#x27;t been shampooed for a week! Boo...I was really excited about the product. AND my pump didn&#x27;t work, so I had to squeeze it into my hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this Wen Cucumber Aloe conditioner for my husband who has very fine hair, a tad thin on top.  He washes it every day after tennis, yet it is still oily from ballcaps, perspiration etc.  He&#x27;s used it 2 weeks now and already his hair is looking thicker and&lt;br /&gt;really shiny . . And he just asked me to get him some more!</li>
    <li> Read the description because I ordered the wrong size by mistake. I love the product but for this price you can buy a bigger size.</li>
    <li> Everyone kept talking about WEN products but didn&#x27;t want to order via informercial. Tried this small version and I&#x27;m HOOKED!! It&#x27;s definitely pricey but your hair will thank you.</li>
    <li> Not a very distinct scent, but maybe that the point. Works as well as the other WEN products, but glad to have bought this &#x27;trial&#x27; size first</li>
    <li> This stuff is worthless. It made my hair worse. I have fine hair and it didn&#x27;t do anything for it. My son has very thick hair and he tried it as well and had the same results. I would never purchase any WEN hair care product again.</li>
    <li> I ordered the one they said was better for fine hair. It just flattened mine out and gave no body or volume. Really expensive on top of that. Maybe could use if you have to wash your hair too much and you need a break from shampoo.</li>
</ol>
