      <li>This mirror is perfect for looking at the back of my head when I do my hair and then flipping it over and using the magnified side for applying my makeup.  </li>
      <li>However, we have found that for our use it is best to use 5X or occasionally 7X power.</li>
      <li>I need to buy more just to make sure I always have one.</li>
      <li>The 7X magnification is great, you can see anything very close up, like looking into a microscope.</li>
      <li>The stand that comes with it is okay, but I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>The 7X magnification is perfect for seeing facial details.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with this mirror.</li>
      <li>The 7x magnification is just right for seeing some detail that a 5X mirror isn&#x27;t good enough.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very good but smaller</li>

      <li>Super mirror!  </li>

      <li>This is a handy item to see what you really look like in the course of a day.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable to hold and the stand is usable.  </li>
      <li>I received this mirror in a few days, in perfect condition.  </li>
      <li>This LED light does need batteries, but I can use [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The handle is comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I believe it is also available in 5X and 10X power.</li>
      <li>so far so good.</li>
      <li>This is heavier than I would prefer but the fact that it lies flat is a great selling point.</li>
      <li>stand is okay, and it works better when I put it on a high counter.</li>
      <li>Received it very fast, my grand daughters use it every day</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For being an inexpenisve hand mirror I absolutely love it. I need to buy more just to make sure I always have one.</li>
    <li> Solid, nicely made, clear plastic mirror.  The stand works well... you can adjust the tilt of the mirror by moving the stand up the mirror handle.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Purchased the mirror for both travel and home make-up, really nice with the ability to have both a hand and table top functionality. so far so good. Handle to table stand adapter allows angle change and works fairly well while traveling. You do have to look at a downward angle but then it is dual purpose and some compromise is acceptable.  Overall the quality is excellent, and the 7X is perfect. For me 5X was not enough and 10X too much magnification.  The only Negative is I was expecting actual 7 inch mirrors. The product info states it has \\&quot; Two (2), 7\\&quot; Precision Quality Optical Glass Mirrors\\&quot;.....wrong they are about 5 1/4 inch mirrors mounted in a clear acrylic/plastic surround for a total of 7 inches. Still it is large enough and the optical quality is first rate! 4 Stars because of poor product info. The product is definitely 5 stars!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror, it reflects</li>
    <li> Great mirror.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like the mirror although it is award to hold.</li>
    <li> Very good but smaller than I thought.</li>
    <li> Great hand held and the foot accessory works well when we need it. The mirror/glass is really nice quality. We&#x27;ll be buying another for our 2nd bathroom.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror just the right size for me. The 7X side comes in handy &amp; am glad i got it.</li>
    <li> These mirors are hard to find in the stores, I&#x27;ve looked and looked. If there is one out there, it&#x27;s not glass. So, this is a great deal!</li>
    <li> This is a handy item to see what you really look like in the course of a day. Scary hu!</li>
    <li> Mirror can be handheld or put on a stand. The 7X magnification is perfect for meticulous make-up application and tweezing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and it is perfect.  Some mirrors are too strong - some mirrors are too weak, but this one is just right.  She has been wanting a new mirror she can use anywhere and she&#x27;s going to be thrilled with this find!  The size as well as the strength of this is great!</li>
    <li> This mirror looks great and is made of good quality. The 7X magnification is great, you can see anything very close up, like looking into a microscope. The stand is very helpful in keeping the mirror up and in place.</li>
    <li> Zadro mirrors offer great quality.  This 7X mirror is essential for applying my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> If you need a hand mirror, this is as good as any.  It&#x27;s exactly as advertised, no more, no less, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do - it fits comfortably in your hand and you can see yourself just fine.  I was happy to see the angle can be adjusted by sliding the handle up or down - that was not apparent from the description.  Of course with something this low tech there&#x27;s not much to go wrong.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain about this, because I knew what I was buying.  I have had it for two months and I use it whenever I do tweezing/makeup.  I like the level of magnification.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I expected.  You do have to be careful when you put it in the stand.  You can&#x27;t hurry because it&#x27;ll go off balance and fall over, but as long as you&#x27;re careful, it holds itself up beautifully.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife to take on a trip.  She loves it.  I works just fine and the quality is good.  The magnifying function is great and will be indispensable if you live alone and ever sit on a cactus.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror because it was priced right compared to other similar products. Clarity is great and no complaints thus far so it&#x27;s recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect amount of magnification for putting on eye makeup without glasses and without distortion.  The mirror is of good quality and looks very attractive on the counter. It is comfortable to hold and the stand is usable.  Just ordered another as my husband saw it and wanted one to assist in shaving and beard trimming.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirrors and stylish acrylic mount. As one reviewer noted, however, there is no hole set into the handle to facilitate hanging. Not an issue with me, but may be with anyone with limited real estate on the dressing table.</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite mirror.  I have broken two of these by dropping them on the bathroom tile.  I never hesitate to purchase another one.  I do wish it came in a 10X, but until it does, this is the one for me.</li>
    <li> The 7x mirror is for close up use only if you want to clearly view your face. The normal non magnified side works as expected. The stand is a nice touch. This makes shaving my neckline easy but I&#x27;m not able to use it with the 7X side. I would recommend the mirror just be aware of its limitations.</li>
    <li> you can remove it from the stand if you prefer&lt;br /&gt;perfect mirror&lt;br /&gt;I use it to put on makeup and fix my hair&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the 7X magnification, but it is nice to have&lt;br /&gt;clear frame, very attractive&lt;br /&gt;good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this mirror. I thought the 7x magnification would be to much ... But it&#x27;s not. Maybe a little frightening! Lol, but it&#x27;s great for detail work such as eyebrow shaping etcetera. At about 50 plus years of age, my eyes just began to strain a bit in seeing up close details and this mirror has been very helpful to me. It&#x27;s well crafted and attractive enough. The handle is comfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the stand to store the mirror upright to avoid  getting any scratches on it from laying on a flat surface. I think I would have difficulty using the mirror in the stand without a great amount of effort. So ... The stand is worth having however I really only use the mirror as a hand mirror.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel, lightweight.</li>
    <li> The magnification is a nice thing to have, and the plastic stand is also convenient.</li>
    <li> The best hand-held mirror.  Just perfect for travel and for home.</li>
    <li> I really love this hand mirror, it looks good on my bathroom counter.  However, the stand is terrible; it is shaky and easily tips over.  They need to rework the stand.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I don&#x27;t know why anyone NEEDS 7x magnification of their face, as no one else will ever see them that extremely, but if you do, this works well &amp; is priced well. I use the regular side to shave with, &amp; I am glad to have it.</li>
    <li> Super mirror!  It has a sturdy feel to it and is easy to hold.  It&#x27;s made very well and the magnification is very good.  I&#x27;m pleased to have found a good quality mirror, and I like the clear colored finish on the frame.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror, good optics.  Handle should have a hole or loop for hanging it up.</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror after another \\&quot;Goody\\&quot; mirror broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the clarity of the glass and the quality of the acrylic body.  It&#x27;s very solid.  The 7x magnification is just right for seeing some detail that a 5X mirror isn&#x27;t good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that I spent just a little bit more and got several times the quality.</li>
    <li> Just what I had been looking for.  Very good quality</li>
    <li> really nice mirror, nice value, dear Wife uses and enjoys it. Quality!</li>
    <li> Originally I was about to give this a 3-star review. Because my mirror kept falling over, seemed that the stand was built incorrectly. Then I saw the picture and realized how the stand was meant to work. Everything works beautifully now, 7x is more than enough magnification. I remember seeing some 10x mirrors for sale on here, but I don&#x27;t think I really want to view myself anymore than 7x magnification. It&#x27;s of adequate size and overall I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just what I was looking for.  It is plenty big enough and has ample magnification for these old eyes to see well.  I would have given it 5 stars but the little stand is pretty cheap.  I don&#x27;t use it anyway so it doesn&#x27;t matter.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror. I had been looking for a two sided hand mirror with 7X on one side. You&#x27;d think they would be easy to find, but not so. The only thing I wish this mirror had is a hole in the handle to allow hanging. The stand works just fine, but it takes up counter space. Still, it&#x27;s a very good mirror.</li>
    <li> Image is incredibly good for acrylic. Good as most glass mirrors, but durable. I would buy again if I needed another.</li>
    <li> Cheaply mads hand mirror with very flimsy stand yet the quality of the mirrors are good.  Just be careful about drooping it  and it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a mirror that was too bulky too stuff in a suitcase.  This is heavier than I would prefer but the fact that it lies flat is a great selling point.</li>
    <li> Chose this mirror because a friend has it.  Great for travel because sturdy and not too heavy, just the right size and magnification.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> We looked everywhere for a hand mirror that my mother-in-law would like.  None of them had a handle like she wanted.  After two trips searching the stores, I decided to look online.  There it was and there were even some choices.  I ordered it and she had it in a few days.....delivered right to her door.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Received it very fast, my grand daughters use it every day</li>
    <li> I had a mirror exactly like this for about 20 years before I dropped and broke it.  This is exactly like it and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight combination handheld mirror with a stand.  One side is 1 to 1, and the opposite side is 7X.  The 7X magnification is perfect for seeing facial details.  It is light enough fir viewing the back of my head and neck.  Good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> Very much like the previous one I had, which my granddaughter broke.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great. not too heavy and the 7X magnificaton is just right. No distortion with good visibility. I recommend this purchase</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for looking at the back of my head when I do my hair and then flipping it over and using the magnified side for applying my makeup.  It is pretty sturdy (I am forever dropping it on the counter or knocking it on the floor)  so I am not so much interested in a decorative item as a sturdy one!</li>
    <li> As so many other reviews observed, 10x magnification was too strong. The reflection is excellent, no distortions. I like the fact that the the self supporting stand is removable.</li>
    <li> This mirror does the job nicely. I gave this to my dad and he uses it every day and likes it.</li>
    <li> This mirror has a great level of magnification, 7x, and it has a removable stand so it can function for hands-free use. It would be better if it was lighted, but every lighted makeup mirror I have found, either locally or online, has the same problem. The bulb inevitably burns out, and it is expensive, time-consuming, or utterly impossible to replace it. If the bulb cannot be replaced, a lighted makeup mirror becomes garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have jury-rigged my own solution with this mirror to make up for the fact that it is not lighted. When doing one-handed work, I just hold it up without its stand, and the lights above the bathroom mirror are quite sufficient for lighting it. When doing two-handed work, I use a small LED light such as the [[ASIN:B0038M95DU Maxcraft]] and place it beneath the mirror which is held in its stand. LED is long-lasting, compared to the bulbs in lighted makeup mirrors. This LED light does need batteries, but I can use [[ASIN:B00007ISWA rechargeable ones]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the look and feel of this mirror aesthetically. It is very light, comfortable to hold in my hand, and the acrylic plastic is smooth and high-quality. It is clear and colorless, so it will match any bathroom decor.</li>
    <li> perfect for what I wanted it for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror.  It magnifies and stands on its own.  Just what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> perfect for my eyebrows and extracting blackheads- not really good for whiteheads. stand is good- i&#x27;ve dropped it twice already without the mirror cracking</li>
    <li> Spouse is very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a very sturdy hefty mirror. I had it fall off a high counter onto some thin carpet and thought that it was busted for sure, but it was completely fine. The 7X magnification was a bit of a surprise. You have to put your face very close to the mirror, but then you can see every single eyelash when putting on make up (you can also see every single pore, but oh well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is okay, and it works better when I put it on a high counter. The stand slides off the handle, and you flip it around. It doesn&#x27;t collapse though, so you have to take it apart to store it more easily.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it had a hole on the end to hang it through. I might have to try adding one on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a good sturdy, high magnification mirror, but I wish the stand was more flexible and convenient.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Pretty and inexpensive.  Might get another one for the other bathroom.  I could not find this item in local stores.</li>
    <li> Zadro Acrylic Hand Mirror  I received this mirror in a few days, in perfect condition.  I really like the 7X magnification for doing eyebrows and liner and also use the other side to use in conjunction with my bathroom wall mirror to see the sides and back of my hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear lucite is very sleek and nice looking.  The stand that comes with it is okay, but I don&#x27;t use it.  I did discover if you do use it, to set the stand on a wash cloth, paper towel, etc.---it will be a bit more stable and not slip on the hard surface of something.</li>
    <li> Good size and like the two different magnification sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses it to trim his mustache and I use it when putting on tooth whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also has many other uses and comes in super handy to have.</li>
    <li> Does just what it should. Great price and seems quite durable. Comes with a nice stand for hands free styling! Recommend this one.</li>
    <li> When looking to replace a broken basic hand-held magnifying mirror at many of our local drug stores, beauty supply centers, and department stores, I was surprised to not be able to find anything suitable in design or quality available anywhere. I was delighted to have located this mirror on Amazon. I believe it is also available in 5X and 10X power. However, we have found that for our use it is best to use 5X or occasionally 7X power. The optical quality and frame/handle are very good and probably as good as you might find (if you&#x27;re lucky) anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror and the acrylic is really pretty. The magnification is great without any distortion but it was a bit big for what I wanted. However, great quality and would not hesitate to buy if you are looking for this type of mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is of good quality and is as it was described.  The image is solid and clear on both sides and is very handy.</li>
    <li> The best mirror I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good....stand is a bit flimsy, but doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  Wish it came with a cover for traveling.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful mirror.  Very sharp image.  So happy with it.</li>
