### Positive Reviews

      <li>These bottles and filling system are the best ever.</li>

      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely impressed.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad that this holds everything I need!</li>
      <li>Great assortment of tubes</li>
      <li>This kit is one of the best of its kind for carrying liquids and gels</li>
      <li>Great help with moving cosmetics to travel compliant bottles.  </li>
      <li>For the things this worked well for, it was great, for others, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to report there were no spills or leaks.      </li>
      <li>They come with a syringe and some sort of covers that help you in filling the tubes, which is great.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
      <li>The good thing about that, though, is that I can now bring plenty of shampoo, conditioner, lotion and sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;(I do like the superior &amp;#34;toothpaste control&amp;#34; these containers provide...</li>
      <li>This is good for any type of travel.</li>
      <li>The tubes are food safe, so any food items you wanted you could put in here!</li>
      <li>Still love them!</li>
      <li>to get all the air out of the syringe, you could be wearing the  moisturizer on more than your face!  </li>
      <li>Easy to refill and great sizes for traveling.</li>
      <li>For example, someone mentioned GoToob, which does look nice, but they seem way overpriced to me.</li>
      <li>Oh and one nice touch -</li>
      <li>The bottles were very easy to fill with detailed instructions and a great assortment of attachments that came with the kit.</li>
      <li>I rarely write product reviews, but I had to for this because it is a great idea that just doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>The bottles and adapters make it easy to create your own travel size portions for whatever trip</li>
      <li>nice selection of bottles and labels and for the most part the bottles are easy to fill.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the travel containers you can buy at Target are much better and are also TSA compliant.</li>
      <li>but most of the lids are flip tops</li>
      <li>I love the size of the tubes and how flexible they are.  </li>
      <li>We only took carry-on so this was the perfect product for us.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if hotels would stock shampoo and lotion like they do in the US.</li>
      <li>I know I elaborated a lot more on the Cons than the Pros, but I still rated the product 4 stars b/c</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s all you buy, though, you will need to make sure to get the fill kit as well.</li>
      <li>I like the way these hold more product than the .8 ounce travel toothpaste you buy at the store.</li>
      <li>And you can pay more too.</li>
      <li>If you like only one shampoo or have a favorite hair gel, this will be perfect.</li>
      <li>So much more practical for travel.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this would be an issue for most people however.  </li>
      <li>I was able to take everything I needed with me in \\&quot;legal\\&quot; sizes for a 3 week stint.  </li>
      <li>This combo of travel containers worked wonderfully for my European travel.  </li>
      <li>With this kit I was able to use my home products and build a travel kit with everything I needed in about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t leak at all, and I was able to travel well with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sure.   </li>
      <li>The best part about these bottles is you know they&#x27;re not going to leak -- you can squeeze these bottles with the cap fastened and there is no way they&#x27;re going to shoot open.   </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, most of the bottles that I use do not have a screw top, so I had to use the accompanying syringe.  </li>
      <li>Even if you might get better with practice doing something like this, there are just much better things you can do with your time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so we were glad to have those also.  </li>
      <li>The one quart bags that are included are more sturdy that the ones from my kitchen</li>
      <li>Great if you&#x27;ve been storing an odorless, non-oily, liquid; not so great for any other types of liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would be nice if they gave you instructions to how to clean them...</li>
      <li>Thicker, creamier, more viscous liquids aren&#x27;t nearly as easy to transfer as watery liquids.</li>
      <li>Not messy at all, and the labels are also great to keep track of the contents.    </li>
      <li>However, since airlines have started charging for check-in bags, I thought I should make more of an effort to fit everything into a carry-on, and this looked like it would expedite that process.  </li>
      <li>we were able to make it all fit into one bag, so I still had a bag for my makeup.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s to be expected I guess, and I still think it&#x27;s the best product on the market.  </li>
      <li>Unscrew the Receiver Cap, replace it with the regular cap, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>Nifty package of containers allowing you to use all the stuff you already have at home and easily put it into travel bottles.  </li>
      <li>Were easy to fill and worked like a charm.  </li>
      <li>It was fairly easy depending on the type of liquid you were working with.  </li>
      <li>Bottle not as easy to fill as I thought they would be.</li>
      <li>I contacted Easy Traveler through their site, and within 30 minutes had a phone call from the owner</li>
      <li>since i am pretty handy with my hands and never had any problem assembling furniture all my life</li>
      <li>The products are useful, very reasonably priced, and good quality.</li>
      <li>with that said the bottles themselves are fine.</li>
      <li>I really like the top reviewer&#x27;s idea of rotating identical kits!</li>
      <li>If you use mostly light lotions that are a bit runny this product may be fine</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge deal b/c</li>
      <li>but I have filled some bottles.  </li>
      <li>the plus side, you can fit a bunch of these into the included zip lock bag.</li>
      <li>You get a good bundle of bottles, all the necessary adapters (to fit your existing bottles or tubes), and a syringe if you need to pull contents out of a bottle that doesn&#x27;t have a threaded cap top.  </li>
      <li>simpler, easy to clean design.</li>
      <li>but I managed to get the bottle filled.  </li>
      <li>The bottles are convenient sizes, and the shape makes it easier to fit a lot into a quart bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I filled the ziploc bag and kept it in my purse</li>
      <li>(i&#x27;m 60 yrs old), i also had great success assembling a eliptical exercising machine, i thought i can over come this task...</li>
      <li>the mouthwash and coconut oil (when in liquid form) I can fill them from a dish without any of the special caps...fairly easy to do mid-travel</li>
      <li>Easy and quick to dispense liquids once in the travel containers</li>
      <li>I originally ordered this in an effort to reduce the clutter in my travel toiletry bag.  </li>
      <li>Screw the appropriately sized dispensing spout onto product you wish to transfer (you will have to cut the end off of the dispensing spout - but do not cut so much off that it doesn&#x27;t fit into the receiver cap).  </li>
      <li>(I think you have to have 3 hands!), and once I got product into a tube I couldn&#x27;t get it out, and there&#x27;s no way to clean them....</li>
      <li>My husband and I used them for a week trip, and we had more than enough stuff, (we each could bring our own shower gel etc)</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s no way to really clean it.</li>
      <li>That way all containers are filled with fresh cream or gel and there is never a need to prepare a kit for travel.</li>
      <li>I really, really wanted to love this kit.</li>
      <li>the only good thing I got out of it was use for the 1qt bag that came with it.</li>
      <li>Although I have yet to use the product (it is for a trip later this month), I am very impressed with the quality of the different pieces.</li>
      <li>I love this kit and highly recommend it to anyone who travels.</li>
      <li>I received my 3-1-1 Totally Compliant Carry-on Kit today and I am so pleased!  </li>
      <li>I filled most all of these for a 10 day trip to Japan and was able to bring all the products that I normally use (my daughter carried several of mine in her 1 quart bag).  </li>
      <li>seals are not all that great as I&#x27;ve had leaks from a few of them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I rarely do reviews, but this company and their products deserve a 5-star rating.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re also a nice compact size for the amount they hold, an important trait when I&#x27;m trying to cram as many different tubes as possible into one quart-sized bag.</li>
      <li>of.&lt;br /&gt;(I tried a thicker hand/body-cream and it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort</li>
      <li>First, there are nozzle adaptors that go on your full size product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These bottles and filling system are the best ever. The bottles are lightweight and collapse as you use them so they take up less space as you go along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the directions, they are simple to fill. From looking over the negative reviews (which I couldn&#x27;t believe there were any at first), it looks like the negative reviewers didn&#x27;t understand how to fill the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These travel bottles have very tiny openings. This is a plus because it makes them very leak resistant and easily controls the amount of product that you use, essential when traveling. Because of this, you have to use the kit to fill them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who want to know, their are two types of adaptors in the kit. First, there are nozzle adaptors that go on your full size product. They have a small nozzle tip to make transfers easy. Second, there are coupling adaptors that go on the travel bottles. These couplers have an opening just the size to match the nozzles without leaking. Insert nozzle (on full size product) into connector (on travel tube) and gently squeeze to fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have something in a jar or odd container, there is a syringe you can fill and then use the connector coupler on the travel tube to fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can&#x27;t really empty and clean these out very well, but how often do you need to totally change out product type in a travel kit? Even if you change brands, a little blend of old product and new isn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, you can fit a bunch of these into the included zip lock bag. This makes air travel simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip for those really looking to minimize space and weight: if you have no objection to using your fingers to apply deodorant, take the top off a new &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; type of deodorant (creamy liquid texture). Take the back out of the syringe, scoop the deodorant into the syringe, replace back and squirt into one of the travel tubes. Shake gently before each use as the deodorant may separate a little. Apply a pea sized amount to finger and rub in. Compare this little container with the full size deodorant! So much more practical for travel. This is slightly more messy than filling the tubes with other products, however, doing it once lasted me for a year of travel (one weekend/month average).  It&#x27;s easily 4-6 weeks of deodorant in one little bottle.</li>
    <li> They come with a syringe and some sort of covers that help you in filling the tubes, which is great. The only downside is that cleaning is a bit hard? I can understand this because well, they&#x27;re tubes! Would be nice if they gave you instructions to how to clean them...</li>
    <li> 1) Do not overfill.  Leave enough room at the top for pressure changes.  I have made the mistake of over filling a bottle, and it broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The plastic bags could be made tougher, but there are other options on Amazon for that.  You will end up replacing it before the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recommend getting the FlyBag to hold these items[[ASIN:B001LLFBVU Flybags - TSA Compliant Toiletry Bag with Gray Dagger Insert and Leather Trim]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The bottles and adapters make it easy to create your own travel size portions for whatever trip you are taking.  The lids stay on tight, and don&#x27;t leak (just be sure to leave 1/5 of the area of each bottle open for air and expansion during flight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE July 2013&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these for a few years now, and some have become brittle and failed.  It&#x27;s to be expected I guess, and I still think it&#x27;s the best product on the market.  GoToob just has too many issues with liquidy materials and reactions with very common ingredients in products.</li>
    <li> The bottles/containers are varied in size, plentiful and very sturdy as are the ziploc bags.  I filled the ziploc bag and kept it in my purse and I&#x27;m happy to report there were no spills or leaks.      The only minor con is in transferring thicker liquids like moisturizers from their original bottle to the traveler size  with the syringe.  If you&#x27;re not careful (as I wasn&#x27;t!) to get all the air out of the syringe, you could be wearing the  moisturizer on more than your face!  (But that&#x27;s clearly a user flaw rather than a product flaw!)    I love this kit and highly recommend it to anyone who travels.</li>
    <li> I travel often but purchased this specifically for a long trip abroad. I wasn&#x27;t sure if hotels would stock shampoo and lotion like they do in the US. Getting the products into the tubes wasn&#x27;t easy but also not as difficult as some reviewers suggested. A brief read of the instructions and a little time to get things together was all it took. I have twice as many containers as I need for lotion, shampoo, conditioner, and various hair products.     I am not sure I would recommend it for travel where you know what&#x27;s offered. If you like only one shampoo or have a favorite hair gel, this will be perfect. If your like me and have learned to live with what is provided, this is an extravagence. For camping, travel abroad, hostel stays etc. this is well worth the small investment in time and money.     By the way, I really like the durability of the plastic bags included in the kit. I use them instead of the regular ziploc and haven&#x27;t replaced one after more than ten trips.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set after reading about it on [...] (in efforts to become a lighter/carry-on traveler).  The kit arrived last night and I decided to fill it up with my products and get it \\&quot;ready to go\\&quot; for future trips. The bottles were very easy to fill with detailed instructions and a great assortment of attachments that came with the kit. Not messy at all, and the labels are also great to keep track of the contents.    The ziploc bags that come with the kit are very sturdy and for some reason they seem bigger, like they hold more stuff than the quart-sized ones I&#x27;ve previously purchased at the grocery store (maybe it is the shape?).  The bag holds my shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion, face wash, exfoliant, moisturizer, toothpaste, leave-in conditioner (used the spray bottle), and a little eye cream I have that came in it&#x27;s own travel sized jar. I am very picky about my products so I don&#x27;t typically use anything provided in hotels. I&#x27;m very glad that this holds everything I need! There are also a few bottles left over (and you can purchase extra bottles on the Easy Traveler website).  So with the attachments and extra bags that came with the original kit, I&#x27;ll be able to make a 2nd kit for my fiance as well.    I will be trying this out for the first time later this month, on a week-long trip to visit my family on the east coast. I am also looking forward to having this on our 2-1/2 week honeymoon to Europe this summer as we aspire to take carry-on luggage only!  Oh and one nice touch - the owner of the company includes a hand-signed letter in the shipment thanking you for the purchase and advising to contact them if we have any questions or concerns.  You don&#x27;t see that too often - I can tell they are all about customer service!</li>
    <li> The thick (expensive!)  hair styling creams are what I needed this for, since shampoos and conditioners and other products have many travel sizes and containers that work fine.  I wasted a large amount! Never got much in the tube. I read the reviews after my first attempt and thought I was doing something wrong, so I actually tried again and wasted that much more of the product!  Made a big mess and could not get the tube clean or the container. Probably a great product for thinner liquids, but a waste of money for me! I agree it is unnecessarily complicated!!</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to love this kit. I really did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the tubes usually do not leak, but this depends on what type of liquid I have inside - so contrary to the manufacturer&#x27;s claim, they&#x27;re not leakproof. Most liquids do well, but thin, watery liquids always leak, no matter how carefully I tighten the caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also a nice compact size for the amount they hold, an important trait when I&#x27;m trying to cram as many different tubes as possible into one quart-sized bag. The system is cleverly designed, with delivery spouts that fit different bottle sizes and a syringe for extracting liquids from a container that can&#x27;t be squeezed, like glass or metal. The quart-sized bags provided in the kit are good quality - thick and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, because the openings on the tubes are so small, it&#x27;s easier to transfer some liquids than others. Thin, watery liquids went down easily, quickly, and cleanly. Thicker, creamier liquids were another matter. My conditioner and moisturizer each took half an hour and plenty of overflowed gobs to fill into a three-ounce tube. The sunscreen I completely gave up on. In hindsight, spending an hour filling six ounces worth of toiletries was sheer lunacy on my part. Even if you might get better with practice doing something like this, there are just much better things you can do with your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another drawback is that the tubes are hard to clean and, depending on what you put in them, not always reusable. Nothing even as big as a Q-tip can fit into the holes so the only way to really clean the tubes is to pour some water and detergent in there and slosh it around. Great if you&#x27;ve been storing an odorless, non-oily, liquid; not so great for any other types of liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tubes are translucent, which is helpful for easily identifying the contents inside, but not good for storing liquids that shouldn&#x27;t be exposed to light, such as just about any good lotion or cream. The sharp edges of the tubes also tend to stretch out and leave marks on the plastic quart bags; rounded edges might&#x27;ve been a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the instructions that come with the kit are not user-friendly. I got a one page sheet with lots of tightly cramped text. Aside from looking unprofessional, all this writing crammed onto a single page just helps to reinforce the initial impression that this is a complicated and unintuitive system. The instructions for a kit like this should be heavy on diagrams and light on text - designed to be as easy to follow as possible.</li>
    <li> I rarely write product reviews, but I had to for this because it is a great idea that just doesn&#x27;t work.  The bottles are convenient sizes, and the shape makes it easier to fit a lot into a quart bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the refilling process is nightmare.  The tips provided are too big - they don&#x27;t fit in the holes and make a seal.  This pretty much means  you can&#x27;t use the tubes, because the holes are too small for anything else to fit.  It&#x27;s very frustrating, since it seems like such a simple fix.  There&#x27;s also a syringe to use in connection with the tips, but that means you have to wash it out in between each fill, which can get time-consuming and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a lot of pre-printed labels and instructoins that look they came from someone&#x27;s home computer.  I appreciate the attempt at a value add but it was a little amateurish.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this in an effort to reduce the clutter in my travel toiletry bag.  I was so disappointed when I realized how LARGE all the tubes were - not meant for air travel!  The tubes aren&#x27;t designed to meet the carry-on travel restrictions (you can take only fit a couple tubes into the carry-on size ziploc)- and since they&#x27;re so hard to fill, it just isn&#x27;t realistic to transfer contents for every day use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I wish they came with a variety of dispense tops (like the ones where the connected lid flips open).  I guess I was hoping more like the GoToobs which have a wide mouth to fill but a small hole for dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again?  Nope.  I just wish there was a cheaper alternative to the GoToob.</li>
    <li> really... dont waste your time with this product it&#x27;s cheaply made, the plastic caps that are supposed to help funnel your products into the little squeeze bottles are FUSED shut so u have to cut them... BUT when u cut them the tip is too big to fit in the opening. It was very frustrating. the only good thing I got out of it was use for the 1qt bag that came with it.</li>
    <li> Normally I just buy whatever miscellaneous liquids I need at my destination city rather than messing with airport security, but a recent trip that involves 4 cities in 5 days forced me to find an alternative.   I purchased the Flybags kit from Amazon and while the bag itself was of reasonable quality, the bottles were absolutely worthless so I sought out this as an alternative.    This kit is very well apportioned.   You get a good bundle of bottles, all the necessary adapters (to fit your existing bottles or tubes), and a syringe if you need to pull contents out of a bottle that doesn&#x27;t have a threaded cap top.  The best part about these bottles is you know they&#x27;re not going to leak -- you can squeeze these bottles with the cap fastened and there is no way they&#x27;re going to shoot open.   There is also an included instruction sheet, an envelope containing labels so you can put size and contents labels on all the bottles, and a handful of 1qt zip lock bags if you want to go that route.    Would it be easier just buying travel size bottles of product at the store?  Sure.   Unfortunately the product selection is dismal at local stores in the travel size container, so unless you like candy apple hair gel (I really don&#x27;t, being an adult male) you&#x27;re going to be stuck looking for other options.  With this kit I was able to use my home products and build a travel kit with everything I needed in about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I travel frequently, and in the past, I almost always took a check-in bag, so I didn&#x27;t worry too much about the new rules for liquids and gels.  However, since airlines have started charging for check-in bags, I thought I should make more of an effort to fit everything into a carry-on, and this looked like it would expedite that process.  In fact, attempting to transfer shampoo, conditioner, face wash, and hand lotion into the squeeze tubes is a sisyphean, kafkaesque task, thanks to the tiny holes through you are expected miraculously to fill up the tubes.  Half my shampoo and conditioner ended up going down the drain of my sink, and my hands ended up completely covered in various lotions.  Previous reviewers have mentioned that the instructions for filling the tubes are confusing; I received no instructions whatsoever, just a link to a product website which has a video on it that I am unable to view on a Mac.  The idea that I should need a syringe to get shampoo into my carry-on bag is laughable, though.  I want a refund.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Has a ton of pieces, with terrific instructions to go along with them.  The bottles take a little practice to fill, but well worth the effort.  Unlike small bottles the tubes are easy to use, since you can squeeze every last drop out of them.  Plus they save a ton of space in your travel bag.     My travel kit arrived in just a matter of days, and was well packed.</li>
    <li> Lots of tubes.  They are decent quality and relatively large.  The aspect about this set I don&#x27;t like is the openings in the tubes are too small to fill without using the accompanying syringe that comes with the set.</li>
    <li> nice selection of bottles and labels and for the most part the bottles are easy to fill.  If however you have products in non-standard bottles (i.e. I had some Obagi face care products) then the included connectors may not fit and it is hard to get the product into the containers. I don&#x27;t think this would be an issue for most people however.  Overall a very useful kit.  I like the fact that they included one spray bottle.</li>
    <li> The large tubes have worked well. But on three separate occasions, the small tubes have leaked (at the crimped end of the tube). Twice was while stowed in hand luggage on a flight, the other time during a car trip. They were not overfilled. I received replacement bottles when I complained, but I cannot trust the replacements after my experience. I still use the large tubes. I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere for small tubes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping to streamline packing toiletries for a 2 wk international trip.  There&#x27;s nothing I can recommend about it....the directions are confusing, packaging and quality is cheap, no matter how small I made the cut on the plastic tips they were too big to transfer product into a tube (I think you have to have 3 hands!), and once I got product into a tube I couldn&#x27;t get it out, and there&#x27;s no way to clean them....so it&#x27;s now all in the trash.  I would highly recommend goob tubes...simpler, easy to clean design.</li>
    <li> I rarely do reviews, but this company and their products deserve a 5-star rating. As others have noted, customer service is excellent. This travel kit is exactly what I was looking for. The products are useful, very reasonably priced, and good quality. Learning to fill them does take a little practice/care, but once you&#x27;ve got it, there&#x27;s nothing to it.    You can pay less for travel kits, but you won&#x27;t get the quality. And you can pay more too. For example, someone mentioned GoToob, which does look nice, but they seem way overpriced to me. A single 2 oz. GoToob runs something like $7. You can get FOUR 2.5 oz tubes from EasyTraveler for $5. If that&#x27;s all you buy, though, you will need to make sure to get the fill kit as well. But the 3-1-1 kit comes with all you need for filling the tubes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 3 months ago b/c I was tired of my shampoo, conditioner, and face wash bottles leaking in my gym bag. Here are the pros and cons in my opinion (in order of importance):     PROS:   1) Absolutely, 100% leak proof.   2) Ample sizes and number of containers.  3) Easy and quick to dispense liquids once in the travel containers b/c they are all squeezable (as opposed to rigid plastic).   4) Durable - since there are no plastic hinges on the bottles tops (everything screws on), they seem more durable than other squeeze bottles I&#x27;ve had where the plastic hinges break (and thus the top is loose and so they leak)    CONS:   1) Messy refills. The video (referenced below in CON #2) makes it look effortless and completely mess-free. However.... there are 2 main reasons why my experience differed from this example:                    a) My Loreal bottles of shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t lend themselves to having a transfer cap screwed on to them. I fully admit, this is probably something I should have realized/investigated before I bought the product. So I squeeze my product into another travel bottle (the infamous leaky ones that I used previously) and then put a transfer cap on those. So, more effort and more mess.                    b) Thicker, creamier, more viscous liquids aren&#x27;t nearly as easy to transfer as watery liquids. My extra conditing products don&#x27;t instantly transfer like the ketchup does in the instructional video. Not a huge deal, but just be aware.   2) Instructions are severly lacking. I am a financial analyst and had serious problems understanding what pieces were what (note: pieces are not labeled, but referred to by name in the instructions) and the logistical details of the process in general. Go to the link in the instructions to watch the video. If you can&#x27;t view the video, try a different internet browser (Mozilla didn&#x27;t work for me, Google Chrome did). The video clears everything up, so I can&#x27;t be too disappointed with the written instructions.   3) Hard to clean out the bottles. Because of the very small hole which makes dispensing the liquid easy (see PRO #3), it&#x27;s almost impossible to fully clean out these bottles if you want to put something else in them. This isn&#x27;t a huge deal b/c you have a lot of bottles in this set and you will always need bottles for certain products like shampoo &amp; conditioner, face wash, lotion, etc. This is something to keep in mind if you are switching brands of your products, though.     I know I elaborated a lot more on the Cons than the Pros, but I still rated the product 4 stars b/c it served the main purpose for which I purchased it -- no leaky bottles in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> I received my 3-1-1 Totally Compliant Carry-on Kit today and I am so pleased!  This set includes high quality tubes and lids that close tightly so that products don&#x27;t leak.  The instructions that come with the kit are very clear and easy to follow.  I will never go back to drug store quality travel bottles and containers.  Highly recommend this kit to anyone that travels.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these to anyone, in fact, I even gave them as a gift at Christmas.  In the age of the insanely expensive checked baggage, these are a must.  My husband and I used them for a week trip, and we had more than enough stuff, (we each could bring our own shower gel etc) we were able to make it all fit into one bag, so I still had a bag for my makeup.  Fantastic!  Were easy to fill and worked like a charm.  No leaks, and no problems!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on May 4 and received it on May 6. Although the seller (Jim) is located in my home state, I am still impressed with the turnaround time. I believe he shipped it out the day after he received my order (late at night)--a nice change from other sellers who seem to wait a week \\&quot;just because\\&quot;!    I had a question about transferring items from tubs (like lotions, for instance) and emailed Jim on his website (easytravelerinc--has a video, too). The form also asked for a phone number, and about 30 minutes later, Jim called me back and answered my questions.(The kit comes with a large, 60 cc/2 oz, although if you can use the other method, it is easier.) This was on a Sunday, too! I get the impression that, if any problems or questions arise, emailing or calling Jim will go far towards resolving them.     Although I have yet to use the product (it is for a trip later this month), I am very impressed with the quality of the different pieces. They are plastic, but they do not seem \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;. (An unconventional, but possible use for this kit is for icing! The tubes are food safe, so any food items you wanted you could put in here! Maybe some jam for your scones on the airplane?) You also get 4 quart sized bags (sturdy), a storage bag (zip around), instructions, converters/receivers and labels with the kit.    I highly recommend this product. (I&#x27;m not being paid or a representative of the company--I&#x27;m just impressed, as usual, with the customer service in the small business sector. Support small businesses!)</li>
    <li> This travel kit was bigger in many ways than I expected.  My last kit, which I was looking to repurchase, had lots of little bottles and jars and had 11 compact pieces that fit easily into a ziploc.  This kit had quite a few pieces, but all of the tubes were large (either 3 oz or 1.5 oz - approx).  The good thing about that, though, is that I can now bring plenty of shampoo, conditioner, lotion and sunscreen.  The drawback is that I don&#x27;t have little compact jars for things like eye cream, night cream, etc.  I ended up using the small tubes for most things, but for females who use lots of products that are sold in small 1-2oz quantities, it takes a whole jar/tube/etc. to fill the tubes.      The \\&quot;equipment\\&quot; that comes with the kit, though, is very impressive.  It has anything and everything you could ever need/want to transfer product from one container to another.  I can even put Vaseline in a tube and take it with me conveniently in dry climates now.      Overall, this met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I carried these around in my purse with sunscreen and bug spray during a year in Africa and never had them leak. Easy to refill and great sizes for traveling. I&#x27;ve gone up to 2 months without needing to refill these and using them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the bottles because you can alternate them (one up, one down) in the carry-on required quart size bag to be make them fit snugly so you can cram more stuff in that tiny bag. The spray bottle personally I feel is way too big and bulky. The lid takes up so much space but I wouldn&#x27;t pack it without the lead for fear of leaking. I ended up just using a travel-size hairspray bottle that I refill with whatever I need - it&#x27;s smaller and more compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year later and I still use these for frequent travel. Still love them!</li>
    <li> This combo of travel containers worked wonderfully for my European travel.  I was able to take everything I needed with me in \\&quot;legal\\&quot; sizes for a 3 week stint.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product! This kit is one of the best of its kind for carrying liquids and gels I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried several. You can fit a lot in a small space because the tubes can be staggered (one pointed up and another pointed down) when packing them in a toiletry bag. Although lightweight and easy to handle and use, the tubes and sprayer are all tough, leakproof, and can take a lot of punishment protecting both their contents and the inside of your travel bag.    Personally, I haven&#x27;t found filling the tubes at all difficult. The included &#x60;Receiver Caps&#x27; (for the empty tube you are filling) and the variety of sizes of &#x60;Dispensing Nozzles&#x27; (to screw onto full bottles you are filling from) make it a snap to transfer contents from one container to another. Just expel the air and hold the tube folded in half and release it as it fills with the cream or gel. Unscrew the Receiver Cap, replace it with the regular cap, and you&#x27;re good to go! I only had to use the included syringe for a couple of products: one that came in a very large bottle, and another that came with an oddly shaped closure that I had to cut off to keep open. With a little practice, it is easy to get the hang of it.    I keep two identical sets of containers: one set in quart bags ready for travel, and the others in bathroom cabinets for regular home use. When I empty a container, I refill it with fresh product and swap it with a full container in the travel kit. That way all containers are filled with fresh cream or gel and there is never a need to prepare a kit for travel. It is always ready!</li>
    <li> This product saved us a lot of space on a recent trip to Africa with 2 children.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy this product!!!!!!!!  i should have listened to other reviewers!  since i am pretty handy with my hands and never had any problem assembling furniture all my life (i&#x27;m 60 yrs old), i also had great success assembling a eliptical exercising machine, i thought i can over come this task... wrong, wrong, wrong!  i&#x27;m a pretty persistent person, i tried and tried and can not get my lotion into the tubes; made a mess and wasted a lot of quality lotion!  we were packing for a 18-day trip to alaska and did not have time to bother to return the item.  a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love the size of the tubes and how flexible they are.  However, I did not realize that I have so many stock bottle containers are have caps that you don&#x27;t screw on, but only snaps in.  Therefore, these nifty screw transfer/dispensing nozzles do not fit onto my stock bottles and creates a messy transfer.  Finally, trying to clean these nozzles afterwards, especially items that are thick consistency is definitely a big struggle.  I wish they had some tiny clean brushes to clean the nozzles.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use my product yet but I have filled some bottles.  It was fairly easy depending on the type of liquid you were working with.  If the liquid was on the thick side, it was a bit more difficult but I managed to get the bottle filled.  I can&#x27;t wait to use them as I&#x27;m tired of buying all the small travel size of things I use.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the kit and had a small problem when it arrived. I contacted Easy Traveler through their site, and within 30 minutes had a phone call from the owner (I recognized his voice from the video on his site!) who said that he&#x27;d send out a whole new kit today. The problem I had wasn&#x27;t with the whole kit, just 2 of the caps, and he&#x27;s still sending an entire replacement! I&#x27;m extremely impressed.</li>
    <li> I really like the top reviewer&#x27;s idea of rotating identical kits! I keep several pre-filled bottles to swap into my travel rotation as necessary but their plan is much more organized ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my bigger tubes for shampoo and conditioner -- this took some getting the hang of.&lt;br /&gt;(I tried a thicker hand/body-cream and it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort and I&#x27;ve been moving on to coconut oil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the smaller tubes for toothpaste, mouthwash, and, more recently, coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;(I do like the superior &amp;#34;toothpaste control&amp;#34; these containers provide...sorta rations it better)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the mouthwash and coconut oil (when in liquid form) I can fill them from a dish without any of the special caps...fairly easy to do mid-travel ;) If the coconut oil hardens, I&#x27;m thinking I can just hold the tube until it softens or bring it in the shower with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the other reviewers appear to cover everything, including the tricks for how to fill these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great idea for me; I was especially getting tired of buying and disposing of mini toothpastes and their boxes.</li>
    <li> It was kind of  messy to fill the tubes, and there was so much clean up. also one of the squeeze tubes leaked out of the box. There was a poor seal along the lower ridge, making it useless to use.</li>
    <li> I travel weekly for business and this is the only product I use.  The folks who say the bottles are difficult to fill just haven&#x27;t figured out how to do it properly.  Only on very rare occasions have I had to use the syringe to fill a bottle, and that was only if the product was in a tub (deep conditioner) vs a bottle onto which a &amp;#34;spout&amp;#34; could be screwed.  Occasionally I come across a shampoo with a lid that is not threaded and yes, that can be a bit messy, but it is not the fault of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Screw the receiver cap onto the desired tube (there is one for each sized bottle - they have wider &amp;#34;mouths&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;2. Screw the appropriately sized dispensing spout onto product you wish to transfer (you will have to cut the end off of the dispensing spout - but do not cut so much off that it doesn&#x27;t fit into the receiver cap).  Shake the bottle upside down so that the product is at the mouth of the bottle - ready to be transferred.&lt;br /&gt;3. Squeeze the air out of the receiving bottle (otherwise the product would have to displace the air and there is no way for it to get out of the same hole).&lt;br /&gt;4. Insert the dispensing spout into the mouth of the receiver cap and begin to transfer the product.&lt;br /&gt;5. Tap the (receiver) bottle to get the product to the bottom and repeat steps 3 and 4 until the bottle is full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last batch of 3 oz bottles was bad and split at the seem, but this is the only issue I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to wash the bottles out:&lt;br /&gt;1. Fill a sink with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;2. Squeeze the bottle to remove the air.&lt;br /&gt;3. While still squeezing the bottle, submerge it in the water and let go to fill with water.&lt;br /&gt;4. Shake and squeeze out water.&lt;br /&gt;5. Repeat until desired cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> No leaks or any issues whatsoever.  Make sure to follow the directions on filling and go slow filling the containers.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Bottle not as easy to fill as I thought they would be. Holes was too small for the filling needle it is for this reason I rated it a 4  and not a 5.</li>
    <li> Great help with moving cosmetics to travel compliant bottles.  Only challenge is the nozzles and consistency of cosmetics and toothpaste can be frustrating...but doable.</li>
    <li> Even with the various screw top adapter sizes, I had several products that did not have an adapter that would work. Without the adapter, you simply cannot get some products into the squeeze bottles. For the things this worked well for, it was great, for others, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> holes to small to put anything in the containers, I am wondering if they sent me the wrong type of containers.  I threw everything away.</li>
    <li> I like the way these hold more product than the .8 ounce travel toothpaste you buy at the store. I filled most all of these for a 10 day trip to Japan and was able to bring all the products that I normally use (my daughter carried several of mine in her 1 quart bag).  We only took carry-on so this was the perfect product for us.  I prefer the flip tops over the screw tops because they&#x27;re easier to use one handed but most of the lids are flip tops so that&#x27;s good.  There is a little learning curve on filling but we didn&#x27;t have any problems with shampoo, moisturizer, all my face product, body wash, toothpaste, and hairgel.  There&#x27;s even one spray bottle that we used for a hair smoothing product.  I used the provided lables and when I needed something more specific I used my label maker.  The one quart bags that are included are more sturdy that the ones from my kitchen so we were glad to have those also.  I recommended this to my sister who travels a lot overseas.</li>
    <li> Nifty package of containers allowing you to use all the stuff you already have at home and easily put it into travel bottles.  It does take a little extra work up front before your trip but it&#x27;s still cheaper then buying a whole bunch of travel sized stuff of brands you don&#x27;t usually use.  Now you can bring everything you are used to with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear plastic bag it comes with is a little on the flimsy side so I will be using another container to put these into but with that said the bottles themselves are fine.</li>
    <li> Needed a small container to hold toothpaste for business trip. Follow their directions to transfer toothpaste into container. Unfortunately, it did not work. Toothpaste material was too dense and sticky to transfer. This kit just did not work for my purpose.</li>
    <li> Have never had a leak using these. It&#x27;s been great!!</li>
    <li> This 3-1-1 Travel Kit worked. Thats about all I can say. It was difficult to get the product into the containers, its definitely a 2 person job. They didn&#x27;t leak at all, and I was able to travel well with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say go with a cheaper kit, its not worth the money or hassle to get the product into the containers for the same thing in a $12 kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, but not worth the ~$30 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> This got the job done for me.  Depending on what you put it, the bottles are either easy or difficult to fill.  They&#x27;re REALLY hard to clean.  For the most past they&#x27;re dependable in preventing leakage, but I did have a little leak from some liquid laundry detergent I had in one of the bottles.  Even still, I&#x27;ve heard nightmare stories about most of the other travel bottles leaking.  These bottles were dependable enough, the leakage only happend once.</li>
    <li> If you use mostly light lotions that are a bit runny this product may be fine but if you use things like moisturizers that have a thicker consistency these are messy and difficult to fill.  Also unlike other travel tubes you can&#x27;t fill it with one liquid, then clean it out and refill with a different liquid --because the tube is one piece with only a small hole at the top there&#x27;s no way to really clean it.</li>
    <li> So not worth it. Not easy to fill. The seams broke &amp; leaked after a week or 2 of use.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of tubes BUT YOU CAN&#x27;T FILL THEM! There is no way you can transfer gels or creams into these tubes with the adaptors provided. Absolutely a waste of money.</li>
    <li> There is every size you could possibly want.  There are also things to help you fill the containers.  This is good for any type of travel.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill these plastic bottles and so much less bulk in my suitcase!  I highly recommend this carry-on kit!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit several years ago, and I have used these bottles for multiple trips.  I have recommended it to family and friends and those to whom I have given it as a gift have been very happy with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;I did not find the instructions difficult to follow, but filling up these bottles can be time consuming.  I have used the bottles for shampoo, conditioner, soap, contact solution, and moisturizer.  Unfortunately, most of the bottles that I use do not have a screw top, so I had to use the accompanying syringe.  I had no problem using that or getting the product into the squeeze bottle, but, as I said, it was time consuming.  Since I don&#x27;t tend to switch products, I just had a designated a bottle for shampoo, conditioner, etc. and rinse them out in between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accompanying plastic bag is durable and also holds up for multiple uses.  I&#x27;ve been able to jam the majority of the bottles in there along with some other travel-sized ones.  Because the bag is made of a durable material I don&#x27;t have to worry about it tearing or bursting.  I&#x27;ve never had anything leak on me (not even the bottle containing the contact solution).  I&#x27;ve even had airport security officers compliment me on this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with other reviewers, however, who said that products like moisturizer are difficult to get into the bottles and almost impossible to clean. For things like facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve bought small round containers and that has worked out fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a perfect product, but I have been very happy with it and I will continue using it and recommending it to others.  I should also point out that I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller on Amazon and from the official website, and the items always ship very fast.</li>
    <li> The accompanying product information shows going from all your home bottles to the carry-on kit \\&quot;in seconds\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I expect hyperbole, but in fact the transfer of liquids is rather time consuming and awkward at best.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem is the size of the nozzles (too big) on the caps that fit your home products in comparison to the size of the holes (too small) on the travel containers.&lt;br /&gt;In all cases I had to use a drill bit to make the holes bigger on the travel containers.&lt;br /&gt;Even so, filling them was tricky. I was hesitant to make the holes bigger for fear of compromising the water tightness of the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The containers themselves are high quality and seem to be indestructable.  Likewise the zip lock quart bag for carrying them on to the plane.&lt;br /&gt;I have traveled with them several times and never lost a drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has taken me this long to write a review because I&#x27;m setting out on a trip and in getting my bottles ready I came across the letter from the seller asking for feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the product has been improved since I bought it in 2009,in which case it would get a definite recommendation from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, buy it if you travel a lot: just be prepared to do some work when you use them!</li>
    <li> The filling process for these is weird, messy, and annoying. You have to fill an injector tube then squeeze it into the tube. It is like these because they WILL NOT leak. It is a conundrum. I do not like the messy process for filling them, but it is that way because they are very reliable.</li>
    <li> I would give this zero stars if I could - ridiculous and impossible to use.  I threw it out b/c my 30 day return window had passed by the time I tried to fill the stupid little things.  The only useful thing were the preprinted labels, which I used on the bottles I bought to replace these useless pieces of crap.</li>
    <li> It can be very difficult to fill these containers depending on the type of product you are trying to fill it with.&lt;br /&gt;The seals are not all that great as I&#x27;ve had leaks from a few of them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the travel containers you can buy at Target are much better and are also TSA compliant.</li>
