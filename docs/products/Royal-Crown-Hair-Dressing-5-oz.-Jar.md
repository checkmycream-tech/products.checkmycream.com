### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>think I will continue my search for a product that works best for me after this runs out.</li>
      <li>Before buying this product, I read all the reviews and everyone was saying &amp;#34;this product is great!</li>
      <li>Best hair product for men even Johnny Cash used Crown Royal.</li>
      <li>Perfect for that 50&#x27;s look!</li>
      <li>The Royal Crown and the Dixie Peach were excellent.  </li>
      <li>and he seems happy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s for a great price</li>
      <li>and it does a great job keeping hair in place and gives a bit of a satin shine, not too glossy.</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Great shine and great hold&amp;#34</li>
      <li>GREAT FOR HAIR.</li>
      <li>This hair dressing is amazing stuff!</li>
      <li>Works great and smells good, for that I give 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Provides good shine for hair.</li>
      <li>Smells good, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it smells good, works as advertised</li>
      <li>product arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>Goes in VERY smooth!</li>
      <li>Product smells good and has a nice even consistency.  </li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t many ingredients, the packaging isn&#x27;t trying to be fancy with dazzling plastics and rounded edges on their container.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>But another great thing about it is if you are worried about it being too strong, don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It is kind of oily</li>
      <li>it was nice to know that I could to amazon.com and find the product.  </li>
      <li>its absolutely the best.  </li>
      <li>It just isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold very good, it leaves your hair looking very oily and greasy and the smell is off putting.</li>
      <li>Smells good and is cheap.</li>
      <li>Fragrance- make this a suitable substitute for vaseline (it&#x27;s thinner than vaseline, by the way) in just about any household application..</li>
      <li>Looks better on the shelf than in my hair.</li>
      <li>This hairdressing is mostly petrolatum and olive oil.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have use this for many days</li>
      <li>On top of that, I think it makes my hair and scalp healthier.  </li>
      <li>There are others that have a slightly better sheen, stay in longer and offer a bit more hold (though I&#x27;m talking strictly about oil-based hair dressings here - not heavier pomades)..</li>
      <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t my favorite hair dressing..</li>
      <li>but the smell could be better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more goopy than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>it comes in :-)</li>
      <li>All righty, I&#x27;m more then pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Ehhh...it was okay.</li>
      <li>My wife has forbidden its use and it may end up being gifted to friends.</li>
      <li>I love the hold</li>
      <li>But for the most part I like the product.</li>
      <li>If you want that authentic greasy feeling, this is the stuff.  </li>
      <li>More on the light side, but it is labeled a hair dressing and not a pomade, so there you go.</li>
      <li>doesnt smell good and is very greasy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold as well as Murray&#x27;s superior pomade, but it goes in and styles much easier.</li>
      <li>It goes in easily, cleans up easily, and keeps my hair neat.</li>
      <li>Its super cheap, but it gets the job done better than most hair products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>all this is is strongly scented petroleum jelly.</li>
      <li>I have to admit that when it first arrived, I was put off by the texture - kind of like thinned petroleum jelly.</li>
      <li>The product works pretty nice.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>And it is cheap</li>
      <li>If you want to control your hair with a light grease then this is for you.  </li>
      <li>Royal Crown is light weight</li>
      <li>I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I DIDN&#x27;T NEED ANY TISSUE GRAFTING.</li>
      <li>Really there are so many better hair products out there.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s super easy to restyle if your pompadour starts to fall.</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>
      <li>Light, holds great, doesn&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;the stuff smells great, lasts long and gives my hair</li>
      <li>I use this to get a wet shine top coat over my Murray&#x27;s Superior pomade.</li>
      <li>To get it out of my hair, I use Groom and Clean (which is a space age hair product from the 60s) by putting a dab into my hair and mixing it in before I shower.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not that strong or over powering, it smells fresh.</li>
      <li>BUT IT IS TRUE.</li>
      <li>If it was good enough for him, then it&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is adequate.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good for everyday use, sometimes I&#x27;ll add Murray&#x27;s when I need more hold</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll most likely get more when Im out.</li>
      <li>The seller was really quick</li>
      <li>No hold.. nothing like that, just pure shine and it washes out easily, sometimes just in the heat of the day.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully just got an old jar,not that that is particularly okay, for my first order because this new jar is very fragrant as well as having good hold and shine.</li>
      <li>The only con I could see anyone having is it lacks any scent, while Krew Komb smells amazing.</li>
      <li>It is great stuff, not too heavy</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t useful for a pompadour.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>It washes right out.  </li>
      <li>It gives just the right amount of hold too.</li>
      <li>I find it mild, but then again I don&#x27;t really glom this stuff on my head either, when i use it.  </li>
      <li>This is just a great buy overall, and it&#x27;ll last you for a while.</li>
      <li>While it does exactly what it promises to do (hold you hair in the position you&#x27;ve styled it), it does so with an scent that attracts GILFS very much like a geriatric Axe.  </li>
      <li>AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I SPEAK OF IT,</li>
      <li>You first have to know what type of hair you have.  </li>
      <li>I just picked up my third can, it lasts, is inexpensive and the smell is fine and wears off quick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even had more luck with ax&#x27;s hair pomade, although I&#x27;m not necessarily recommending it.</li>
      <li>It holds pretty well too, I have been using Murray&#x27;s for awhile now</li>
      <li>, lightweight, dirt cheap, wet look (if that is what you like), cool tin, all around old school vibes, easy to find.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re reading this review, I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re at least somewhat familiar with this product, since it is kind of obscure.</li>
      <li>It pretty much just has to sit on your sink or medicine cabinet shelf.</li>
      <li>Getting down to business, the pomade has a nice weight and consistency.</li>
      <li>Overall it controls any loose hairs you may have gives a greasy look, also gives a sleek look good for comb overs.</li>
      <li>But even when it does get windy outside or where ever you might be, this stuff looks great messy too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like modern hair products from companies like Axe, Layrite, Sally Beauty Supply, etc...  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product my whole life, and that&#x27;s not an exaggeration.  </li>
      <li>I really like the feel after applied.</li>
      <li>Thanks again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It smells, it is vasoline in the thinnest cardboard conatiner. I can&#x27;t fathom anyone ever putting that on their hair or on their person. Do yourself a favor and avoid this product.</li>
    <li> From what I&#x27;ve heard, Elvis used to use this.  If it was good enough for him, then it&#x27;s good enough for me.  It is great stuff, not too heavy and it does a great job keeping hair in place and gives a bit of a satin shine, not too glossy.</li>
    <li> Not really a fan. It doesn&#x27;t hold very good, it leaves your hair looking very oily and greasy and the smell is off putting. It reminds me of my grandpa...nobody should want to smell like gramps. Really there are so many better hair products out there. I&#x27;ve even had more luck with ax&#x27;s hair pomade, although I&#x27;m not necessarily recommending it. I have a comb-over, but this stuff is just too heavy to style it properly. If it&#x27;s a last resort I&#x27;ll use it, but I&#x27;m not going to go out looking for it by any means.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like gel and I don&#x27;t want bushy hair, this pomade takes care of that.  Royal Crown is light weight so it&#x27;s good for everyday use, sometimes I&#x27;ll add Murray&#x27;s when I need more hold and/or mousse if I&#x27;m feeling dangerous.  I just picked up my third can, it lasts, is inexpensive and the smell is fine and wears off quick.</li>
    <li> A lot goes a long way.  This stuff is legit.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of the product. It isn&#x27;t waxy like Murrays, which is too thick for me. It&#x27;s pretty much exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to create that \\&quot;wet look\\&quot;. The only slightly negative thing I&#x27;d have to say about it is it smells a little perfumey almost like lavender. But for the most part I like the product. I&#x27;ll most likely get more when Im out.</li>
    <li> Before buying this product, I read all the reviews and everyone was saying &amp;#34;this product is great! Great shine and great hold&amp;#34; but when I received it, I noticed that the container was damaged and The label was already coming off, so that was a minus right off the bat, second, this product did not hold my hair or give her any type of shine. I have thick and wavy hair so when I heard this was a &amp;#34;hairdressing&amp;#34; pomade I was expecting a terrific old and a minor shine, I got neither of that</li>
    <li> I really like the retro old school look of this can. The product works pretty nice. Gives your hair a really shiney look. Perfect for that 50&#x27;s look!</li>
    <li> Have been using this since 2001. Stopped being sold at CVS so I had to buy it from Amazon. Provides good shine for hair. Looks like you have product in hair but hair is soft to touch. It is kind of oily so you don&#x27;t want to use a lot.</li>
    <li> Came in a cardboard tin with a metal lid and base, hoping for all metal .</li>
    <li> i was a lonely,single guy before i discovered royal crown. now i can&#x27;t keep the ladies off of me. i literally have to beat them off with a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the stuff smells great, lasts long and gives my hair the wet look i searched for my whole life. one could also use it as a lubricant for your automotive , motorcycle and personal needs .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product my whole life, and that&#x27;s not an exaggeration.  My mother used to hot-comb my hair with RC when I was a little girl, and it&#x27;s been a stable of mine ever since.  My hair is now relaxed, but I still use RC every week, and it makes my hair soft and keeps it moisturized.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Product smells good and has a nice even consistency.  In the mid-30&#x27;s to mid-40&#x27;s or so, men were using hair product to hold down and organize their hair, not puff it up like hair gel or some pomades from the 1950&#x27;s.  This is a great product if you want to slick back your hair and keep it down.  It isn&#x27;t useful for a pompadour.  I have thick unruly hair and it organizes it well, especially if you are slicking it back. On top of that, I think it makes my hair and scalp healthier.  And it is cheap, a tin lasts me months...</li>
    <li> very weak, the product is too hard and not pliable enough.</li>
    <li> But then again I dont know anything about hair or hair products. I now use Royal Crown pomade and add a little bit of this for extra shine i guess?</li>
    <li> Too greasy for my tastes- I&#x27;m sticking with brylcream. Cool container graphics, but it is made out of cardboard and really thin metal. Looks better on the shelf than in my hair.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this hair dressing!  its absolutely the best.  An oldie but a goodie.  Amazon is the only place we can always find it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is beyond disgusting... I used it once and the next day spent 15 minutes trying to wash it out of my hair... it was like I had gummy oil in there.  When you open the can it looks like Vaseline and smells like Vaseline with some old lady rose water mixed in.  Nasty.  You put it in your hair and immediately your hair is flat and starting to collect any dust that sails by since this stuff is so nasty and sticky.  Did I mention it was nasty?  Forget anyone running their hands through your hair.  And your pillow is going to be nasty in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;d recommend instead is a little EO Nourishing Hair Cream [[ASIN:B005P0VMRK Style-Hair Cream Lavender &amp; Coconut EO 6 oz Cream]] and if you need a little oil to keep it moist / hold it down, just get some coconut oil either via Amazon or at your local Whole Foods / Trader Joes / Publix whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and threw it away.  Had I read a review like this I would have saved $6.... hope this helps.  I don&#x27;t write many reviews that are this negative as usually I do believe that different products are good for different people but in this case I can&#x27;t imagine anyone that would want to turn their hair into a gummy smelly mess.</li>
    <li> The cardboard container was smashed and the hairdressing was coming out of it. Also the container had glue around it .</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR HAIR. MY FAMILY USED WHEN I WAS A CHILD. WILL CONT. TO USE WHEN AVAILABLE.PLACE IT IN STORES IN QUAKERTOWN, PA AND KINSTON NC THANKS</li>
    <li> Let me be clear.  This stuff isn&#x27;t my favorite hair dressing.. There are others that have a slightly better sheen, stay in longer and offer a bit more hold (though I&#x27;m talking strictly about oil-based hair dressings here - not heavier pomades).. BUT.  As a grocery item, this stuff is terrific.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without a tub in the house.  It&#x27;s got simplicity on its side.  Only 3 or so ingredients -I think it&#x27;s Petrolatum, Olive Oil, Fragrance- make this a suitable substitute for vaseline (it&#x27;s thinner than vaseline, by the way) in just about any household application.. I&#x27;ve used it as a salve to soothe skin, as a lubricant on squeaky hinges, even as a makeshift sealant for my boots when it was rainy (boy they shined that day).  I&#x27;ve done just about everything with this stuff but put it on my cereal.  And it doubles as a decent hair dressing.  No hold.. nothing like that, just pure shine and it washes out easily, sometimes just in the heat of the day.  I&#x27;ve always thought it left my hair feeling light and soft.  Other people respond negatively to the smell, which is floral (I&#x27;ve heard lavender used to describe it).  I find it mild, but then again I don&#x27;t really glom this stuff on my head either, when i use it.  It reminds me of my grandpa or possibly grandpas in general (?).  Either way, I like it.  It comes in a cardboard tube and yet it&#x27;s got class.  And utility.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re reading this review, I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re at least somewhat familiar with this product, since it is kind of obscure. It totally has the texture of thin car grease and it doesn&#x27;t dry out throughout the day, so your hair will be greasy for at least two washings. It doesn&#x27;t hold as well as Murray&#x27;s superior pomade, but it goes in and styles much easier. Plus, it&#x27;s super easy to restyle if your pompadour starts to fall. It also works just as well if you put it in wet hair, something that the new synthetic wax pomades can&#x27;t do. Nobody will want to run their hands through your hair while this is in it, but if you are using this you probably don&#x27;t want anyone messing up your hair anyways.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;5-STAR</li>
    <li> Ehhh...it was okay.Hate the carton tin though...</li>
    <li> I like this but the smell could be better.  I love the hold but it&#x27;s scent is reminiscent of a citronella candle in my opinion.  It&#x27;s for a great price so I wouldn&#x27;t totally steer you away just yet, for that much it&#x27;s worth a try I think.  The seller was really quick so A+ for them!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my 15 year old grandson with oddly eclectric retro taste.  He loves it and uses it whenever he shaves and cleans up, I can&#x27;t swear how regular that is but it smells good, works as advertised and he seems happy.  That&#x27;s all I need from a Christmas present.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s old school.  There aren&#x27;t many ingredients, the packaging isn&#x27;t trying to be fancy with dazzling plastics and rounded edges on their container.  Royal Crown simply gets the job done!  It can be tough to wash out depending how much you use but it keeps your hair shiny, slick, and styled.</li>
    <li> This stuff is adequate. It smells a little odd, and has a strange texture, but it will keep hair looking wet all day. You can also touch up your style throughout the day without reapplying. It is a little difficult to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the container that it ships in does not really seal. It just has a lid that sits over the container. So, traveling with this product is out of the question. It pretty much just has to sit on your sink or medicine cabinet shelf. Otherwise, you will have a greasy mess in your travel kit if you take it with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will continue my search for a product that works best for me after this runs out.</li>
    <li> Some people in other reviews might be bothered by the scent of lavender but I don&#x27;t mind it at all, it&#x27;s not that strong or over powering, it smells fresh. It holds pretty well too, I have been using Murray&#x27;s for awhile now but I&#x27;ve been looking for a less greasy and hard pomade that I can apply with ease every morning and Royal Crow does the job pretty well, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hopefully just got an old jar,not that that is particularly okay, for my first order because this new jar is very fragrant as well as having good hold and shine.</li>
    <li> I found this on sale at Walgreens for $2.00! Can&#x27;t beat that price. Anyway,my first impression is the old school style of this product. The tin, the graphics, right down to the smell. And quite the smell it is. I can palette lavender, liquorice, ginger bread cookies, and a hint of diesel fuel! The scent is rather assertive, I&#x27;m neutral on whether or not I like it. I think it smells old manish.   Getting down to business, the pomade has a nice weight and consistency. More on the light side, but it is labeled a hair dressing and not a pomade, so there you go. It&#x27;s a tad too oily, must say. Goes in VERY smooth! Combs through well too. Look is on the wet side of town. Holds pretty well but not amazingly. I really like the feel after applied. It&#x27;s as if there is no product in my hair whatsoever.    Overall I say this is a cool,interesting, high quality product. All you pomade fanatics out there must check it out.    Pros:    Holds well, lightweight, dirt cheap, wet look (if that is what you like), cool tin, all around old school vibes, easy to find.  Cons:    Smell is an acquired taste, a tad oily for my purposes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have thick wiry hair that makes Don King look like Vin Diesel. It has the consistency of petroleum jelly but smells like lavender. To quote Aerosmith, I was a high school loser...until I used this product. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> product does what it promotes.  recommend product to anyone.  product arrived on time and in good condition.  product made with quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> You first have to know what type of hair you have.  Myself i have a full head yet thin.  This is basically like Vaseline with a smell of roses.  Its not designed for a firm hold or to style anything.... well at least for my hair it  will not.  If you want to control your hair with a light grease then this is for you.  If you want a updoo that is wind resistant then this is not for you.  Overall it controls any loose hairs you may have gives a greasy look, also gives a sleek look good for comb overs.</li>
    <li> Feels and looks like petroleum jelly, not the biggest fan. Back to Brylcreem for me,</li>
    <li> Best hair product for men even Johnny Cash used Crown Royal.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just dandy if you can handle petroleum in your hair.  It&#x27;s basically vasoline mixed with olive oil.  Honestly, it holds my hair down and you can comb it all day long.  To get it out of my hair, I use Groom and Clean (which is a space age hair product from the 60s) by putting a dab into my hair and mixing it in before I shower.  It washes right out.  The stuff is from the days of yore.  I don&#x27;t really like modern hair products from companies like Axe, Layrite, Sally Beauty Supply, etc...  There&#x27;s no reason to put chemicals you can&#x27;t even pronounce into your hair as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  The only thing you need to be aware of is that this stuff is going to turn your pillow dark and grease up your motorcycle helmet.  But at least it&#x27;ll smell like lilac flowers.  A very similar product that works exactly the same for me is Tres Flores Brillantine.  I use them interchangeably depending on what smell I&#x27;m in the mood for that day.  If you want that authentic greasy feeling, this is the stuff.  Don&#x27;t screw around with poly-vinyl modern day stuff.  To keep the mess to a minimum I mix American Crew Grooming Cream about 50/50 with this stuff.  It gives me hair that lays flat and looks shiny but without so many wet marks left on stranger&#x27;s furniture.</li>
    <li> This hair dressing is amazing stuff! It is petroleum based, so yes, its greasy. But I mean, that&#x27;s why I love it! Grease doesn&#x27;t dry out like water-based pomades do. That was a big problem for me, i wanted something i could fix and run a comb through if my hair got messed up (my friend thinks its funny to mess up my hair sometimes) This stuff is the same from the second you put it in your hair to the second you wash it out. It gives just the right amount of hold too. Your hair wont move throughout your daily routine as long as you aren&#x27;t exposed to high winds lol. But even when it does get windy outside or where ever you might be, this stuff looks great messy too. Its super cheap, but it gets the job done better than most hair products I&#x27;ve ever tried. It has a manly smell, and I don&#x27;t mind the smell. But another great thing about it is if you are worried about it being too strong, don&#x27;t. My cologne overpowers it with no problem. This is just a great buy overall, and it&#x27;ll last you for a while.</li>
    <li> All righty, I&#x27;m more then pleased with this product. Works great and smells good, for that I give 5 stars. The reason for only two stars is because when the packaged arrived I was less than amused to find nearly half of the DRESSING spilled into the box! So instead of 5oz of RC hair dressing I have 3oz to work with...oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If your going to package something that has no secure lid... perhaps you should find an efficient alternative way to pack it rather than some pathetic half-a** bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Seller.... package your product CORRECTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Royal Crown Company... rethink your container methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CS</li>
    <li> Either I&#x27;m not old enough or I&#x27;m not English enough to appreciate this item.  While it does exactly what it promises to do (hold you hair in the position you&#x27;ve styled it), it does so with an scent that attracts GILFS very much like a geriatric Axe.  My wife has forbidden its use and it may end up being gifted to friends.</li>
    <li> hard to wash our of hair.</li>
    <li> Found this stuff at Family Dollar while in an &amp;#34;urban&amp;#34; area, priced cheaper than the Amazon price. I figured I would give it a shot for the two dollar price tag. I&#x27;ve been a Krew Komb user for the last few years, but at 8.99 a jar, I find Royal Crown to perform better. The only con I could see anyone having is it lacks any scent, while Krew Komb smells amazing. I just add a drop of my aftershave in my palm before putting this stuff in my hair. I will be using this stuff until I find something that beats it. Light, holds great, doesn&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the nancy-boy salon cut dudes, rub a little dish soap mixed with olive oil in your hair to remove this, and most pomades. Maybe your vagisil will also do the trick...</li>
    <li> Gives the slick look I like. I usually mix with Murrays to give more hold or just the royal crown when there already is pomade build up. Old school classic. Olive oil in RC gives the shine and this washes out a lot easier than other hard pomades. My new favorite!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S NOT JUST FOR NATURAL HEAVY CURL HAIR, IT IS USED FOR MANY OTHER THINGS THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU. IN 1970 I WAS IN A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT WHICH CAUSED ME FIRST AND SECOND DEGREE BURNS ON MY ARMS, CHEST FACE HAIR AND SCALP. I WAS IN THE BURN UNIT FOR 2 WEEKS AND THWMN MOC&#x3D;VED TO A PRIVATE ROOM FOR ANOTHER 3 WEEKS.  AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL, ONCE AT HOME, MY SKIN WAS STILL HEALING AND IT WAS VERY DRY. I BEGAN GENTLY RUBBING THIS PRODUCT ON MY ARMS CHEST FACE HAIR AND SCALP.  I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I DIDN&#x27;T NEED ANY TISSUE GRAFTING. BUT I WAS SCARED OF ALL THE SCARS I WOULD HAVE. I USED THIS PRODUCT DAILY AFTER BATHING AND CLEANING MY SKIN. AFTER ABOUT A MONTH OR SO, MY DOCTORS WERE AMAZED TO SEE THAT MY SKIN WAS MOIST, SOFT AND THEIR COMMENTS WERE OF SURPRISE AND THANKFUL I WOULD NOT HAVE ANY VISUAL SCARRING. I KNOW THIS SOUNDS FAR-FETCHED AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I SPEAK OF IT, BUT IT IS TRUE. THE MOISTURE WAS KEPT IN MY TISSUE AND SKIN, MY SCALP HEALED IT TOOK MY HAIR SUCH AS EYELASHES AND EYEBROWS LONGER TO HEAL AND GROW, BUT ONCE THEY DID, ALL WAS BACK TO NORMAL. I CUT THE BURNED HAIR OFF AND ALLOWED IT TO GROW. STILL USING THIS PRODUCT.  THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PRODUCT AND I STILL USE IT. GREAT PRODUCT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> This hairdressing is mostly petrolatum and olive oil. What does that mean? It means that it is shiny, VERY shiny. I&#x27;m talking sheen like you&#x27;ve never seen. It also means that unlike normal petrolatum pomades (e.g. Murray&#x27;s) this will wash out in only one shower. You will still need a strong detergent shampoo like Dax Removing or just some plain dishsoap, but it will come out. The downside, of course, is the hold. It just isn&#x27;t very strong. I have seen some water-based pomades with hold like this, although they don&#x27;t have the same texture and they certainly don&#x27;t have the same shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you have long hair and want to sport a big pompadour or something of that ilk then this is not for you, stick with Murray&#x27;s. However, if you have shorter hair and want something that has the look and feel of a petrolatum pomade, but something you can still wear everyday and wash out at night, then Royal Crown might just be for you.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that when it first arrived, I was put off by the texture - kind of like thinned petroleum jelly. No surprise actually, since that&#x27;s pretty close to what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a try, though, and I really like it. It goes in easily, cleans up easily, and keeps my hair neat. Smells good, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
    <li> all this is is strongly scented petroleum jelly.</li>
    <li> The Royal Crown and the Dixie Peach were excellent.  I have use this for many days it was nice to know that I could to amazon.com and find the product.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I found the hair dressing to be what it is supposed to be but the can it comes in is made of soft cardboard and moves when you try to put the lid on - the side of the tin lid is thin so I bent the tin several times and smooshed the movable cardboard many times trying to get the lid back on - almost dropped the whole thing once since the dressing gets on the outside while you&#x27;re fighting the can - giving it four stars for the dressing but taking one off for the can it comes in :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot more goopy than I thought it would be. I was expecting hairdressing to be the same as pomade, but pomade is much thicker. I&#x27;d go for the pomade next time just because I have really thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to train.</li>
    <li> I use this to get a wet shine top coat over my Murray&#x27;s Superior pomade. Smells good and is cheap. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Not worth it at all. doesnt smell good and is very greasy. not the type of product for modern hairstyles at all. I dont recommend it</li>
