### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is great!</li>
      <li>but at 15 she probably knows wjats best!!</li>
      <li>She can however use her hairdryer so this attachment is perfect for curls without making a being production.</li>
      <li>However, I had beautiful curls/waves.</li>
      <li>I thought that this would be a great item.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold onto my blowdryer, and it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of spinning the hair into curls.</li>
      <li>When I bought it there was one review, and it was a good one.  </li>
      <li>This diffuser is very good, and it is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>, i was very excited!</li>
      <li>Very easy.</li>
      <li>At that point, I&#x27;ll be able to use it.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>but it sure looks cheap.hope</li>
      <li>I had bought this for myself because i love my hair curled.</li>
      <li>and it didnt fit!</li>
      <li>I love it, love it.</li>
      <li>it works and stands up  because it sure look cheaply made</li>
      <li>Even though it fit, I guess after</li>
      <li>It is cute and light, Deliver on time, and it is useful.</li>
      <li>But when it got here i was so excited, until i opened.</li>
      <li>Very easy, fun and fast to do!</li>
      <li>I think with damp hair, some mousse or other product, and hair spray, it will give some nice \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; waves that might be nice to do.  </li>
      <li>Easy for my 11 year old daughter to use too. :)</li>
      <li>so maybe it was worth a try.  </li>
      <li>As soon as we got it I ran to the bathroom to try it on my hair, right off the bat</li>
      <li>to keep it simple and easy this product is a piece of junk!</li>
      <li>and it was to  hot to hold onto the blow dryer</li>
      <li>I opened it and first it wasnt the air curler</li>
      <li>I wish I couldv&#x27;e just changed the channel, but I thought if it works, it would be safer than hot rollers or curling irons</li>
      <li>but I decided to check out the reviews first.</li>
      <li>It gets too hot to the touch and then falls off.</li>
      <li>Really curls your hair.</li>
      <li>Once I did figure it out it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my mom for mothers day and we were all excited to open.</li>
      <li>This was a gift for a 6 year old little girl who can not curl her hair with an electric curling iron on her own.  </li>
      <li>There is another brand I think I will try, because I still like the idea, but I&#x27;m going to do a little more research before handing over my $.</li>
      <li>I bought for my six year old daughter who has stick straight hair.  </li>
      <li>and I have just a normal hair dryer from Target.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I use this right out of the shower, and it manipulates my hair so well that I can sleep on it and it looks the same in the morning.</li>
      <li>But, no big pretty curls like advertised.</li>
      <li>A complete rip off!</li>
      <li>I do not usually write reviews.</li>
      <li>it came at least a week after the estimated delivery date maybe more.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I find it very interesting that there are polar opposite reviews with the negative outweighing the positive.</li>
      <li>highly recommend for daily hair curling design.</li>
      <li>sent this back due to the fact that the kid said it did not do what it was meant for, now whether she was doing it right</li>
      <li>wish i never spent the money.</li>
      <li>OK item but not great.</li>
      <li>It would cost me return shipping, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it to return.  </li>

<li> OK item but not great.</li>
<li> It would cost me return shipping, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it to return.  </li>
<li> It must have worked for her because it did nothing to my daughter&#x27;s hair, even if I could get it to stay on the dryer long enough to try it out.</li>
<li> my granddaughter says this is a useless cheap piece of junk and does not work properly.  </li>
<li> so long it detaches.</li>
<li> and I have really long hair.</li>
<li> (Wet, damp, dry hair even with hairspray and mousse)</li>
<li> Purchased after a gift request from granddaughter for her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in an empty box.  </li>
<li> The curl doesn&#x27;t last past 2 seconds after the removal of the hair even with product to enhance its stay power.</li>
<li> Would NOT recommend this to other buyers!</li>
<li> and it seriously looks like tiny bunched up strands of hair!</li>
<li> it is not worth the trouble to return it</li>
<li> It just made her hair messy.</li>
<li> buy unless, you want to waste your money.</li>
<li> Wasted money.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I had trouble keeping the attachment on my hair dryer.</li>
<li> , I thought maybe I can hold it on the hairdryer - bad idea b/c the plastic gets so scalding hot</li>
<li> I was not pleased with how late it came</li>
<li> I have really thick hair</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t work for thick hair!</li>
<li> Does NOT fit hair dryers!!!</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it falls off of the dryer and doesn&#x27;t work unless you somehow duct tape it.  </li>
<li> Useless.</li>
<li> No instructions included, just came in a very bootleg brown box and that was it.  </li>
<li> Knotted my hair badly</li>
<li> We became frustrated when the stupid thing wouldn&#x27;t come off our hair dryer.</li>
<li> : I hate to say it, but I may keep it.  </li>
<li> Product did not work We hated it.</li>
<li> I bought it for my daughter and she was very disappointed.</li>
<li> Terrible design.  </li>
<li> Terrible.</li>
<li> The worst ever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This does NOT do as it says it will do at all! We have tried it numerous times and ways and NO PART OF IT WORKS!</li>
    <li> I does not curl the hair falls off of the hair dryer. It gets too hot to the touch and then falls off.</li>
    <li> Product did not work We hated it. Wasted money. Comes with no instruction. I would recommend not purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it sure looks cheap.hope it works and stands up  because it sure look cheaply made</li>
    <li> sent this back due to the fact that the kid said it did not do what it was meant for, now whether she was doing it right maybe a question but at 15 she probably knows wjats best!!</li>
    <li> Purchased after a gift request from granddaughter for her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in an empty box.  This grandma had no idea how to use this,&lt;br /&gt;granddaughter has figured it out.  OK item but not great.</li>
    <li> I do not usually write reviews. However, I felt compelled to say that this product does not work! I bought it for my daughter and she was very disappointed. It does not curl.</li>
    <li> Terrible design.  Useless. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This diffuser is very good, and it is easy to use. I love it. highly recommend for daily hair curling design.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product as seen in tv commercials.  It doesn&#x27;t hold onto my blowdryer, and it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of spinning the hair into curls.</li>
    <li> This item has no instructions.  I tried to use it and it keeps falling off my hair dryer. The curls did not stay.</li>
    <li> I was going to purchase this, it said &amp;#34;one left&amp;#34; when I clicked on it but I decided to check out the reviews first. I find it very interesting that there are polar opposite reviews with the negative outweighing the positive. It makes me wonder about the legitimacy of the rave reviews. I think I will pass and save my money. Thank you for all of your reviews....very helpful</li>
    <li> Would not stay on my blow dryer I even tried to tape it but the heat melted the tape and it was to  hot to hold onto the blow dryer</li>
    <li> I love it, love it. It is cute and light, Deliver on time, and it is useful. I bought one  to my sister and girlfriend.</li>
    <li> I had trouble keeping the attachment on my hair dryer. Even though it fit, I guess after so long it detaches. However, I had beautiful curls/waves. I just had to keep putting the attachment back on to the dryer which took a lot of time.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter says this is a useless cheap piece of junk and does not work properly.  it is not worth the trouble to return it</li>
    <li> The attachment keeps falling off the hair dryer while trying to dry/curl hair.  There were NO instructions or directions on how to use it.  The box it came in did not even have a picture on it!!!  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Like the devious reviews, no instructions what so ever &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work when I did figure it out. It took 2 weeks to arrive.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a hair dryer that it actually fits on and I have just a normal hair dryer from Target.&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought maybe I can hold it on the hairdryer - bad idea b/c the plastic gets so scalding hot that I almost burned my fingers after about 45 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my curling iron.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a 6 year old little girl who can not curl her hair with an electric curling iron on her own.  She can however use her hairdryer so this attachment is perfect for curls without making a being production.</li>
    <li> The curl doesn&#x27;t last past 2 seconds after the removal of the hair even with product to enhance its stay power. Sending it back!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! As soon as we got it I ran to the bathroom to try it on my hair, right off the bat it doesn&#x27;t even stay on my blow dryer! So you would literally have to hold it while you are curling you hair with two hands. My mom and I both tried with two different hair types and neither of our hair works! We did it and our hair and it seriously looks like tiny bunched up strands of hair! My mom and I both tried for about an hour but all it did would tangle up our hair.....Would NOT recommend this to other buyers!</li>
    <li> Really curls your hair. Very easy. Curls last and I have really long hair. Easy for my 11 year old daughter to use too. :)</li>
    <li> Arrived with no instructions. What am I supposed to do with it? A complete rip off! I would say to anyone considering buying this - Save your money!</li>
    <li> This did not work...AT ALL!  This is nothing like the product in the commercial.  Save yourself the money and do not buy!</li>
    <li> The worst ever. Knotted my hair badly</li>
    <li> Does not work. You can twirl your hair with your finger for what this does. Does nothing but knot your hair up.</li>
    <li> I had bought this for myself because i love my hair curled. I was thinking i was getting the Air Curler from the TV commercial, i was very excited! I was not pleased with how late it came it came at least a week after the estimated delivery date maybe more. But when it got here i was so excited, until i opened. I opened it and first it wasnt the air curler i thought it was, and second i tried it on my hair dryer and it didnt fit! Eventually i just held the thing on and it didnt even work! I put my hair in the thing like it said and it didnt work! Horriable, just horriable!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for thick hair! it also falls off the hair dryer when using it. i tried it several times and did not work</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Very easy, fun and fast to do! Pays for itself. I like that I&#x27;m not burning my hair with a curling iron. This product is great! I have really thick hair and I use this right out of the shower, and it manipulates my hair so well that I can sleep on it and it looks the same in the morning. No need for instructions because it tells you how to use this product in the details before you buy it. I use this every day!</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work at all. Do not waste your money. I threw mine away after trying it 3x and 3 different ways. (Wet, damp, dry hair even with hairspray and mousse)</li>
    <li> Does NOT fit hair dryers!!!</li>
    <li> This came in a brown box, with no instructions. It took me a while to figure out how to even get it on the dryer, let alone figure out how to use it. Once I did figure it out it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> I thought that this would be a great item.  Unfortunately, it falls off of the dryer and doesn&#x27;t work unless you somehow duct tape it.  No instructions included, just came in a very bootleg brown box and that was it.  Definitely contacting to see if I can return.  If you attempt to hold it onto the dryer with your hands, you burn them...and I&#x27;m not using oven mitts for this.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> It fits my dryer, but doesn&#x27;t stay on at all. I bought for my six year old daughter who has stick straight hair.  She saw this on tv and started saying she wanted curly hair.  I wish I couldv&#x27;e just changed the channel, but I thought if it works, it would be safer than hot rollers or curling irons so maybe it was worth a try.  When I bought it there was one review, and it was a good one.  It must have worked for her because it did nothing to my daughter&#x27;s hair, even if I could get it to stay on the dryer long enough to try it out. It just made her hair messy. There is another brand I think I will try, because I still like the idea, but I&#x27;m going to do a little more research before handing over my $. Hopefully this return will be easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I hate to say it, but I may keep it.  It would cost me return shipping, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it to return.  I will be finding a dedicated blow dryer to duct tape this thing to.  At that point, I&#x27;ll be able to use it.  I think with damp hair, some mousse or other product, and hair spray, it will give some nice \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; waves that might be nice to do.  But, no big pretty curls like advertised.</li>
    <li> Works like it should. Except you have to turn it backwards to get the same curl all around.</li>
    <li> to keep it simple and easy this product is a piece of junk! did not curl 1 strand. wish i never spent the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom for mothers day and we were all excited to open. We stuck  it on our hair dryer and began to curl it. It didn&#x27;t work. We became frustrated when the stupid thing wouldn&#x27;t come off our hair dryer. I literally had to get a butter knife to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy unless, you want to waste your money. If you know how to use it please tell me because I do not.</li>
