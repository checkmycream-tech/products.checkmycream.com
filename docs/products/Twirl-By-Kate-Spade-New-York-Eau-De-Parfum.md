      <li>I bought this for my mom for Christmas and price shopped all around and Amazon had by far the best price.</li>
      <li>This is a soft floral scent that is perfect for the spring!</li>
      <li>, it has a very pleasant fresh fragrance, and as it fades its sweet and floral.</li>
      <li>The first time I ever experienced this fragrance was a tester from Sephora, and I was so hooked on it</li>
      <li>Interesting.  </li>
      <li>I would buy this again :)</li>
      <li>Personally, it is my favorite.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful fresh scent - not heavy at all.  </li>
      <li>Overall a nice pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Easy transaction and</li>
      <li>The bottle was full and appeared to not have been used, but it did not include a top.</li>
      <li>The bottle is huge and gives you plenty of perfume.</li>
      <li>Great price for larger size.</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying that this would be a great gift giver not only the perfume but the box itself.</li>
      <li>Like I said the perfume itself is unique</li>
      <li>I love it so much!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m told all day long how great my perfume is.  </li>
      <li>&quot; When you lift up another piece you will then be amazed by the true size of the bottle.</li>
      <li>exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>If you are purchasing this as a gift, please be aware that this is a tester, and not what you would buy in the store!</li>
      <li>I am usually really sensitive to strong smells, but I think the fruity scent makes me okay with it; however, it can be strong to those who do not like perfumes (in general), so my advice is to use it sparsely because it is quite concentrated.</li>
      <li>I Received Fast and accurate service.</li>
      <li>When I initially smelled this, thought it smelled really nice.  </li>
      <li>Sampled &#x27;Twirl&#x27; few more times on separate occasions - just to be sure...</li>
      <li>my daughter (22) used up half my bottle before I realized it and then confessed she loved it also.  </li>
      <li>and I saw people say it smelled generic and too strong and too sweet.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>it has a soft clean scent to it.</li>
      <li>Love it for everyday and special occasions.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly, but in a brown box marked \\&quot;Tester - not for re-sale\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The box is huge and cute, when you open the top there is a quote in tiny pink letters that says,\\&quot;she had a cocktail in hand and confetti in her hair.\\</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wanna smell like pure watermelon.</li>
      <li>FAST SHIPPER QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
      <li>This is the best perfume… I&#x27;m so sad that Kate Spade discontinued it!</li>
      <li>Someone left a small sample of \\&quot;Twirl\\&quot; on my office desk, so I tested it and fell in love with it immediately!!  </li>
      <li>It is not sweet at all and not strong, and for being a huge perfumeholic I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of perfume before and this particular perfume is unique.</li>
      <li>I will say that this doesn&#x27;t last that long it lasts on me for around 3-4 hours which is pretty fast because it is an EDP.</li>
      <li>Not a great perfume, but not horrible either.  </li>

    <li> I expected to be wowed by this fragrance since it has Kate Spade&#x27;s name attached to it, but instead I was very disappointed. There is nothing at all special about this fragrance, which is just your average cheap-smelling, flowery fragrance that completely loses its scent less than an hour after application. Skip this one, ladies.</li>
    <li> The first time I ever experienced this fragrance was a tester from Sephora, and I was so hooked on it, I NEEDED it, finally I bought the 3.4 oz bottle, and i&#x27;ve had it since 2013, it has a very pleasant fresh fragrance, and as it fades its sweet and floral. Not too over powering. Love this perfume, don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use another! It would probably take the tears of angels to get me to stop using it!</li>
    <li> I gave this perfume to my best friend for Christmas and she loved it! The bottle is huge and gives you plenty of perfume. It also is gorgeous, along with the rest of the packaging! I would buy this again :)</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift! The receipient loved it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite go to scent!  Love it for everyday and special occasions.</li>
    <li> Easy transaction and exactly what I was looking for! This is a soft floral scent that is perfect for the spring!</li>
    <li> OMG SMELLS SO FLIPPEN GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!! I love it so much! Fits the warm weather too! YAY PERFUME! :D I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how good twirl smells! :P</li>
    <li> Personally, it is my favorite. I am usually really sensitive to strong smells, but I think the fruity scent makes me okay with it; however, it can be strong to those who do not like perfumes (in general), so my advice is to use it sparsely because it is quite concentrated.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume… I&#x27;m so sad that Kate Spade discontinued it!</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful. it has a soft clean scent to it. the only down side is it doesnt last long enough. would have given it 5 stars if it did.</li>
    <li> awesome product and service</li>
    <li> Great price for larger size.</li>
    <li> Someone left a small sample of \\&quot;Twirl\\&quot; on my office desk, so I tested it and fell in love with it immediately!!  I&#x27;m told all day long how great my perfume is.  There is no generation gap here either... my daughter (22) used up half my bottle before I realized it and then confessed she loved it also.  This is a wonderful fresh scent - not heavy at all.  My &#x27;go to&#x27; favorite!</li>
    <li> After using the product a few times the pump itself broke. Now it leaks if tipped and can not figure out how to fix it.</li>
    <li> I Received Fast and accurate service. Great job!!!! Keep providing awesome customer service which is rare these days. Happy Holidays!</li>
    <li> Great price for the size. Overall a nice pleasant smell. This is my second bottle, and I will purchase another in the future. I get lots of complements every time I wear Twirl.</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPER QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
    <li> When I initially smelled this, thought it smelled really nice.  Sampled &#x27;Twirl&#x27; few more times on separate occasions - just to be sure...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the fragrance wore on, &#x27;Twirl&#x27; began to smell like...pizza? on me.  Interesting.  Not a great perfume, but not horrible either.  Just ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chloe</li>
    <li> Great perfume at a great price. I bought this for my mom for Christmas and price shopped all around and Amazon had by far the best price. My mom loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and so do I! I got it for her for Christmas and she loves it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am a happy customer.    Best scent ever.  Think Clinique \\&quot;HAPPY\\&quot; but with glamour and class.    Each time I wear this scent, people tell me I smell \\&quot;SO GOOD\\&quot;    Perf shipping and delivery.  SO happy with seller!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3.4 ounce size and received a tester. It arrived quickly, but in a brown box marked \\&quot;Tester - not for re-sale\\&quot;. The bottle was full and appeared to not have been used, but it did not include a top. If you are purchasing this as a gift, please be aware that this is a tester, and not what you would buy in the store! No where in the description does it say you are purchasing a tester. I love this fragrance, so I will keeping, since I purchased it for myself, but I am disappointed that the description did not indicate exactly what I would be receiving.</li>
    <li> Like everything that has Kate Spade&#x27;s name you will never be let down with craftsmanship and quality. Anyone wondering the size I purchased I purchased the 3.4 OZ bottle. Let me start off by saying that this would be a great gift giver not only the perfume but the box itself. The box is huge and cute, when you open the top there is a quote in tiny pink letters that says,\\&quot;she had a cocktail in hand and confetti in her hair.\\&quot; When you lift up another piece you will then be amazed by the true size of the bottle. The top of the bottle is in a gold ball shape with a particular shape along with a red stripe on the base of it. No worries about losing the tops it is pretty heavy! As for the perfume itself it is not strong at all, I did research for months on this and I saw people say it smelled generic and too strong and too sweet. It is not sweet at all and not strong, and for being a huge perfumeholic I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of perfume before and this particular perfume is unique. I will say that this doesn&#x27;t last that long it lasts on me for around 3-4 hours which is pretty fast because it is an EDP. Like I said the perfume itself is unique and I can&#x27;t for once specifically state what I smell as for the notes. Which is actually good to me because if there&#x27;s notes of watermelon I don&#x27;t wanna smell like pure watermelon. I saw that the finishing touch of this was some type of cookie? I can say I smell some slight type of sugary cookie after an hour or so of applying it.</li>
