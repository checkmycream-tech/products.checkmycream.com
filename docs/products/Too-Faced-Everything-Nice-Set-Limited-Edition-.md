      <li>You get a good number of semi mattes and shimmery nudes, and a couple of colorful eyeshadows for a pop of color.</li>
      <li>I bought this holiday palette because I fell in love with the colors.</li>
      <li>The face powders are also lovely.</li>
      <li>Love this palette.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>

      <li>They&#x27;re so lovely &amp; the brushes are smooth too.</li>
      <li>The eyeshadows are a little chalky, but the face products are great and smells good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it.</li>
      <li>The item came on time, however the box the palette came in was damaged, as this is a new product I expected it to be in perfect condition.</li>

      <li>over priced but worth it</li>
      <li>The little mascara included is good for traveling, and does a satisfactory job for lengthening the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was able to get the last stock online for $84.98.</li>
      <li>spraying a little bit of hair lacquer on the pouch will do the job).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a nice addition for anyone who likes too-faced products, and wants a bit of everything.</li>
      <li>and I hope like it because its very pricey.</li>
      <li>They are definitely more than average quality.</li>
      <li>The only problem I noticed using this palette is that the eyeshadows arent as pigmented as other too faced eyeshadows I own.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll play with it a little more</li>
      <li>love the little brushes they included.</li>
      <li>However, I think it won&#x27;t be too bad if you use a good eye primer and do eyes first.</li>
      <li>doesnt fit item and zipper is small.</li>
      <li>great palette but bad packaging for shipping</li>
      <li>After exhausting every online avenue and local Sephora I bit the bullet and purchased it online for nearly 30 dollars more than Sephora.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad that nothing inside the box broken thank God.</li>

<li> In addition, if you pay attention to the scent, they have a little bit of a chemical smell.</li>

<li> Love everything except I was disappointed the mascara was a little dried out :(  </li>
<li> Hard to carry...like the makeup</li>
<li> and I was so disappointed when it came half opened.</li>
<li> Crazy about the mascara</li>

    <li> Great little kit for travel as well as every day use.  Great assortment of colors, very rich and plenty to go around.  Seller was quick and delivery excellent.</li>
    <li> This product is a gift for my cousin and I was so disappointed when it came half opened. The manila bubble-wrapped envelope was ripped and so was the box the set came in. I&#x27;m glad that nothing inside the box broken thank God. I can&#x27;t wait to give it to my cousin, the colors are really pigmented and the blushes are perfect.</li>
    <li> over priced but worth it</li>
    <li> In love with new pallet</li>
    <li> great palette but bad packaging for shipping</li>
    <li> Like the name says, everything is nice in this palette :)</li>
    <li> I love it, we couldn&#x27;t find in stores!</li>

    <li> The item came on time, however the box the palette came in was damaged, as this is a new product I expected it to be in perfect condition. The only problem I noticed using this palette is that the eyeshadows arent as pigmented as other too faced eyeshadows I own. I havent given up on this product yet. I&#x27;ll play with it a little more and I hope like it because its very pricey.</li>
    <li> The glittery bag.... doesnt fit item and zipper is small. Hard to carry...like the makeup</li>
    <li> great Pallet, great color collection</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, highly recommended +++++A</li>
    <li> Love this palette. Only downside is that the colors aren&#x27;t very wearable outside dramatic makeup.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I&#x27;m totally hooked it looks amazing and the colors are amazing .... Crazy about the mascara though</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my wife as a gift. After exhausting every online avenue and local Sephora I bit the bullet and purchased it online for nearly 30 dollars more than Sephora. The case was well wrapped and it was AUTHENTIC! That was my only concern, I didn&#x27;t care about the price. My wife is happy and my life is happy.</li>
    <li> This never arrived to me! However, I bought it from sephora for cheaper. The eyeshadows are a little chalky, but the face products are great and smells good</li>
    <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT! Way over priced on MECCA is $74</li>
    <li> I bought this holiday palette because I fell in love with the colors. You get a good number of semi mattes and shimmery nudes, and a couple of colorful eyeshadows for a pop of color. I haven&#x27;t tried the palette properly yet, but I can tell that some of the glittery eyeshadows fall out. However, I think it won&#x27;t be too bad if you use a good eye primer and do eyes first. The eyeshadows in this palette are not comparable to the ones in the chocolate bar; they&#x27;re not as pigmented, blendable and silky. In addition, if you pay attention to the scent, they have a little bit of a chemical smell. Nonetheless, they are nice colors to have and a good deal for someone who wants a bit of everything.&lt;br /&gt;I love the little brushes they included. They are definitely more than average quality. The face powders are also lovely. In fact, I think I will be using them a lot. The chocolate bronzer smells amazing (like the chocolate bar). The little mascara included is good for traveling, and does a satisfactory job for lengthening the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I am not fond of the pink pouch; the palettes does not fit in it, and the pink glitter just falls everywhere (spraying a little bit of hair lacquer on the pouch will do the job).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a nice addition for anyone who likes too-faced products, and wants a bit of everything. I do not regret buying it!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT!  Way over priced. Buy it at Sephora for $52.00.</li>
    <li> I just got them today. I&#x27;m excited to use it. This is my 1st ever palette. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but good thing I was able to get the last stock online for $84.98. I wish I heard/knew about it earlier.  They&#x27;re so lovely &amp; the brushes are smooth too.</li>
