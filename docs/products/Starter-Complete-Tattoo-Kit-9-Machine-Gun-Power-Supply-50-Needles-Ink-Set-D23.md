    <li> Package came with no problems till I opened it up and one of the tattoo guns was broken into</li>
    <li> Very nice set with a bunch of really cool guns. However the power supply doesn&#x27;t work properly and the case was dented, or else I would give it a five stars. Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy...way more items than seller could ever fit into any pic...everything is awesome and works great!</li>

    <li> The disc to learn how to do tattoos does not work. I don&#x27;t know why???</li>
    <li> this was a gift for a family member and they love it!</li>
    <li> Well packaged, very nice set!  Quite pleased!</li>
    <li> The DVD isn&#x27;t a video. It&#x27;s just a slideshow of pictures, not very &amp;#34;instructional&amp;#34;. But overall great product/quality.</li>
