### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The pumice stone stone worked great on my feet, and after it fell off, about 6 months after I bought it</li>
      <li>The bristles are great for exfoliating my face.</li>
      <li>The brush and loofa part is great.  </li>
      <li>Aside from those two faults, the brush is functional, but I would not purchase this item as a replacement for the one I currently own.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for better quality - but you get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find a similar product of better quality, but since it&#x27;s bamboo and biodegradable, I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>It is way too smooth.</li>
      <li>I would expect better product quality from Amazon, particularly given the price of the item.</li>
      <li>All the pieces of this tool work great except the black part.</li>
      <li>It is handy to have all four features in one item, but I will be looking for a foot brush that will last.</li>
      <li>Breaking apart very fast and got moldy.</li>
      <li>Fell apart with its first water exposure</li>
      <li>It came off the first time I used if.</li>
      <li>But the file part is just a sticker and fell off after the first time I used the brush.</li>
      <li>It may last for a year tops, then I will be looking for a better quality product.  </li>
      <li>bought as a christmas gift and hope i can return it if my grandaughter doesn&#x27;t want the item hard to find a good</li>
      <li>The metal piece I used on my hands, but didn&#x27;t do much on my feet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nicely made brush with attractive bamboo handle, unfortunately the black Emry board fell off immediately and it doesn&#x27;t seem like glue would hold it back in place since I primarily use this in the shower</li>
      <li>The wooden handle itself also cracked after the first couple uses!</li>
      <li>Just an ok product, seems a little overpriced.</li>
      <li>would advise the makers of this product to cut holes in the stone and black file and secure them on with screws or something stronger than glue to make this a high quality item.</li>
      <li>The black file pad is cheap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would last longer if it didn&#x27;t constant get wet</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s Bamboo tools, and only the black part easy drop off.</li>
      <li>Great foot care product, sturdy, lasting and yet small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in an already tight shower!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> All the pieces of this tool work great except the black part. It came off the first time I used if. I could probably glue it back on, but it got soaked it my shower and now it&#x27;s all folded up.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find a similar product of better quality, but since it&#x27;s bamboo and biodegradable, I am happy with it. Mine kicked the bucket after 10 months of regular use. The black nail and dead-skin file finally fell off, so I&#x27;m buying a new one. The pumice stone stone worked great on my feet, and after it fell off, about 6 months after I bought it I kept it nearby and continued to use it. Pumice stones eventually get worn out and need to be replaced anyway. The bristles are great for exfoliating my face. The metal piece I used on my hands, but didn&#x27;t do much on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise the makers of this product to cut holes in the stone and black file and secure them on with screws or something stronger than glue to make this a high quality item.</li>
    <li> The Swissco Bamboo 4 In 1 Foot File does have four different surfaces on the brush. However, only two of them are sturdy enough for daily use--the bristles and the pumice stone. The emory surface is a sticker, and when I received my product the sticker was beginning to lift off the bamboo surface. The metal file portion appears to be low grade aluminum and does not seem sturdy enough to fulfill its purpose. Aside from those two faults, the brush is functional, but I would not purchase this item as a replacement for the one I currently own.</li>
    <li> The loofah fell off after two uses.  Boo.</li>
    <li> The black part fell off in a couple of weeks and the metal is rusting already, Not a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Bamboo tools, and only the black part easy drop off. I use it for a few weeks, it&#x27;s still working, So I give 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for better quality - but you get what you pay for.  The bristles in the nail brush are very wimpy and after a few uses are flattened and falling out.  The foot file came off and I had to reglue it.  It may last for a year tops, then I will be looking for a better quality product.  It is handy to have all four features in one item, but I will be looking for a foot brush that will last.</li>
    <li> Breaking apart very fast and got moldy. I&#x27;m sure it would last longer if it didn&#x27;t constant get wet I&#x27;m the shower even when not in use. Next time I will get a plastic one. All 4 sides worked well tho</li>
    <li> Nicely made brush with attractive bamboo handle, unfortunately the black Emry board fell off immediately and it doesn&#x27;t seem like glue would hold it back in place since I primarily use this in the shower</li>
    <li> has everything on it.</li>
    <li> Emory board section misaligned.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this item because the black file section of the brush peeled off of the wooden handle after the very first use in the shower! After that, there was no way of sticking it back on. The wooden handle itself also cracked after the first couple uses! Poorly made and a total bummer.</li>
    <li> Great foot care product, sturdy, lasting and yet small enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in an already tight shower!</li>
    <li> Was looking for some type of all-in-one product to use in the shower.  Unfortunately, after only the first time of using this foot file, the black file part has come off!  I am now concerned as to which piece is next.</li>
    <li> The black file pad is cheap. It fell off after one use -- it didn&#x27;t work anyway. It is way too smooth.</li>
    <li> The buff pad on the foot file has no adhesion and came off in transit and the metallic section has a nail sticking out of it. I would expect better product quality from Amazon, particularly given the price of the item.</li>
    <li> It is poorly made, the black part fell off as I was taking the product out of the box.  The Pummice stone part seems to fall apart a little too when its dry.  Other than that, it does the job.  Just an ok product, seems a little overpriced.</li>
    <li> Fell apart with its first water exposure</li>
    <li> The brush and loofa part is great.  But the file part is just a sticker and fell off after the first time I used the brush.</li>
    <li> bought as a christmas gift and hope i can return it if my grandaughter doesn&#x27;t want the item hard to find a good</li>
