      <li>great product will most  certainly will buy this again</li>
      <li>I love this era in which we can use hairspray without letting everyone KNOW that we are doing it.  </li>
      <li>It really kept it at a 16-20 hour hold which was great for my lifestyle.  </li>
      <li>so perhaps the darkness makes it show up more.</li>
      <li>Holds up in the most fierce wind without being crunchy.</li>
      <li>I love how it smells.</li>
      <li>Time for her to enjoy it too!</li>
      <li>great smellin&#x27; product that really works~!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
      <li>I like it because it is good in wind and does not have a funny residue.  </li>
      <li>I use this for styling, because it is a strong hold, but I can still style after spraying.  </li>
      <li>There are always sales on this and is available in almost all drugstores.</li>
      <li>it has a nice finish and does hold very well, but I use got2b spiking wax beforehand.</li>
      <li>he touch and it leaves my hair nice and soft after spraying it on :)</li>
      <li>And though it didn&#x27;t hold quite as well as the product I normally use, it still did an outstanding job.</li>
      <li>the hold was good for a long time.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
      <li>For starters the first ingredient is WATER!  </li>
      <li>I have fine, straight hair, but I like a lot of volume and lift.</li>
      <li>I do have dandruff, however, I can tell the difference because it appears all the way to the ends of my hair and doesn&#x27;t show up until it has finished drying, even after I have freshly washed my hair.</li>
      <li>The price is right too.  </li>
      <li>My daughters absolutely love this hairspray for their long hair in the winter.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good finishing aerosol spray that won&#x27;t ruin the hard work you just put into styling your hair, this is not it.  </li>
      <li>but if you put too much, this will smell like alcohol.</li>
      <li>Really helps keep my hair in place and yet also very lightweight and flexible.</li>
      <li>It holds very well, I just can&#x27;t seem to figure out why I am getting these flakes.</li>
      <li>The product held up very well</li>
      <li>I also really like the smell of this</li>
      <li>oh my what a nice bonus because ive tried other hairsprays that just down right stink !!</li>
      <li>Much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried for this purpose.</li>
      <li>I also am very sensitive to the smell of certain brands.</li>
      <li>This product smells GREAT but it sprays heavy and leaves the hair sticky and wet.  </li>
      <li>So I kind of want to give this a 2.5 as it does only half of what it is advertised to do.</li>
      <li>I certainly think that in the humidity that I deal with in my present location, it works very well.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff &amp; used it in the past.</li>
      <li>I have tried others and they do not hold nearly as well !</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t fall flat, like it does with most other hairsprays</li>
      <li>I only had one small issue  the spray nozzle seemed to clog very easy ,&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, on the plus side, Garnier Fructis Style Anti-Humidity Hairspray Extreme Control, Extreme Hold has a pleasant scent, as opposed to other brands, including my normal brand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does indeed hold very well, and when i try to run my fingers through my hair it does get stuck, but only because hairs are stuck together.</li>
      <li>It blocks humidity completely, and it doesnt make your hair look sticky or greasy.</li>
      <li>Now i am knocking out A LOT of Christmas shopping early &amp; i am buying this for my tween daughter.</li>
      <li>It gives it enough weight to keep the static from taking over, but doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff.</li>
      <li>and I use a flat iron to make my hair straight.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, after my third time using the first bottle, it clogged and warm running water didn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>The spray is okay, but the nozzle on this can is ridiculous.</li>
      <li>I have this in extreme and it holds more like a med strength in other brands.</li>
      <li>my hair was soft and did not have like a film on it like some hair sprays leave ,  I do find this on sale here on amazon as well as at some major retailers  .also</li>
      <li>Many times, hairsprays, other than the brand I normally use, leave my hair looking oily, or else they don&#x27;t hold, which makes them a total waste of money.</li>
      <li>I have fine thin hair and live in a humid area of the country.</li>
      <li>Could not figure out the problem until I grabbed my old can of another brand and used the last of it</li>
      <li>For humidity I combine this with a frizzy leave in conditioner because if I don&#x27;t it barely helps.</li>
      <li>It held my hair better than all other products, though not as well as the hairspray I usually use.</li>
      <li>It is at least worth a shot !</li>
      <li>Therefore, I would definitely recommend this product for others, and I am certainly considering this brand again, because it does have other hold levels that could very well match or exceed my other product, and I do prefer the scent of this product...</li>
      <li>Now that I did my research, if water is listed in the first few ingredients put back on the shelf!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love how it smells. Goes on a bit sticky, though. I honestly can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s helping against humidity or not.</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> I like it because it is good in wind and does not have a funny residue.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff &amp; used it in the past. Now i am knocking out A LOT of Christmas shopping early &amp; i am buying this for my tween daughter. Time for her to enjoy it too! This stuff smells SO GOOD &amp; works great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have short cropped wavy-straight hair, which turns into an afro in humidity. I usually straighten it just a bit to even it out, and this totally shields my hair from humidity. I would give this five stars if it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel so brittle.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed this with the other GF anti-humidity hairsprays but even just a little bit of this hairspray gives me very visible flakes once it dries. I do have dandruff, however, I can tell the difference because it appears all the way to the ends of my hair and doesn&#x27;t show up until it has finished drying, even after I have freshly washed my hair. It holds very well, I just can&#x27;t seem to figure out why I am getting these flakes. I have dark, curly, thick hair so perhaps the darkness makes it show up more.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this hair spray, because Garnier Fructis is a reliable manufacturer, but was very disappointed.  Garnier Fructis Ant-Humidty hair spray keeps its hold - but it&#x27;s also sticky, and my hair looked stiff, as if I&#x27;d used styling mousse or gel on it.  It washed out after vigorous shampooing, and seems to have dried my hair out somewhat.  Its staying power is fabulous, but I&#x27;m not happy with the side effects.  I won&#x27;t buy this hair spray again.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair, but I like a lot of volume and lift. After teasing (back-combing) my hair, I spray this all over, and my hair stays in place all day - it doesn&#x27;t fall flat, like it does with most other hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairspray works well when I curl my hair (beach waves or tighter), as well. I usually spray a tiny bit on to the strand before I use the curling iron. This is the only hairspray that keeps my hair curled all day - my hair goes flat with all other hairsprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have tried a lot of hairsprays, and this is the strongest hairspray I&#x27;ve found. It keeps my hair in place all day long.</li>
    <li> I use this for styling, because it is a strong hold, but I can still style after spraying.  I have such thick, heavy hair that regular sprays are too weak for my hair, for styling purposes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the strongest hair spray. I have this in extreme and it holds more like a med strength in other brands. Mine does make my hair just a little hard to the touch but not sticky. For humidity I combine this with a frizzy leave in conditioner because if I don&#x27;t it barely helps. Combining the two products works well and is the only thing that can tame my humidity caused frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I really  liked this hair spray for the price.it smelled really great  the hold was good for a long time. I only had one small issue  the spray nozzle seemed to clog very easy ,&lt;br /&gt;  I  do like this size bottle .it last a good while for the price excellent!!!!  my hair was soft and did not have like a film on it like some hair sprays leave ,  I do find this on sale here on amazon as well as at some major retailers  .also with a coupon you can save even more !!!  great product will most  certainly will buy this again</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY hairspray i will buy !!! I love this hairspray ! I have tried others and they do not hold nearly as well ! And the smell oh my what a nice bonus because ive tried other hairsprays that just down right stink !! The hairspray leaves your hair without that greasy finish which is a big plus for me ! This hair spray also has no build up ! I would recommend this especially for the price you can not go wrong !! It is at least worth a shot !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very funny about hairspray, and this is not a product that I&#x27;ve ever used before, so I was a little skeptical about using it. Many times, hairsprays, other than the brand I normally use, leave my hair looking oily, or else they don&#x27;t hold, which makes them a total waste of money. However, I was pleasantly surprised with Garnier Fructis Style Anti-Humidity Hairspray Extreme Control, Extreme Hold. It held my hair better than all other products, though not as well as the hairspray I usually use. However, on the plus side, Garnier Fructis Style Anti-Humidity Hairspray Extreme Control, Extreme Hold has a pleasant scent, as opposed to other brands, including my normal brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I am left with a difficult decision. The next time I need hairspray, will I choose Garnier Fructis Style Anti-Humidity Hairspray Extreme Control, Extreme Hold or will I go back to my regular hairspray product? It&#x27;s a tough decision, because the scent of this product doesn&#x27;t leave me gasping for breath, like my regular hairspray does. And though it didn&#x27;t hold quite as well as the product I normally use, it still did an outstanding job. Therefore, I would definitely recommend this product for others, and I am certainly considering this brand again, because it does have other hold levels that could very well match or exceed my other product, and I do prefer the scent of this product...</li>
    <li> got this at a local mall till it got discontinued....great smellin&#x27; product that really works~!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got this at a local mall till it got discontinued....great smellin&#x27; product that really works~!!!</li>
    <li> this is not a heavy spray, it keeps the hair in place, very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;will buy this hair spray again.</li>
    <li> I loved it it work soooooo good will be ordering again</li>
    <li> what more can I say :) I use this and unlike other sprays it does not make my hair all sticky and nasty tot he touch and it leaves my hair nice and soft after spraying it on :) Ooooh and it smells good too :)</li>
    <li> For starters the first ingredient is WATER!  No hold, weighs the hair down and made my hair look greasy. Now that I did my research, if water is listed in the first few ingredients put back on the shelf!</li>
    <li> I like Garnier shampoo and conditioner but tried volumizing as well as anti-humidity and both are sticky leaving my hair feel like it has been glued together. Could not figure out the problem until I grabbed my old can of another brand and used the last of it; bingo found the problem. I also believe this has messed with my hair color since using it.</li>
    <li> My hair is crazy thick and wavy, so i straighten it alot and often it curls up again through out the day. but if i use this, it stays straight and perfect. It blocks humidity completely, and it doesnt make your hair look sticky or greasy. PERFECT 5 STARS.</li>
    <li> This product smells GREAT but it sprays heavy and leaves the hair sticky and wet.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good finishing aerosol spray that won&#x27;t ruin the hard work you just put into styling your hair, this is not it.  Heavy spray weighs down the hair.  Looked like I stepped out in the rain.  No bueno.</li>
    <li> All these bad reviews are people over exaggerating. It does indeed hold very well, and when i try to run my fingers through my hair it does get stuck, but only because hairs are stuck together. it has a nice finish and does hold very well, but I use got2b spiking wax beforehand. It is a great product and is great for men and women alike, but should not be used with longer hair. Probably works best with 2-5 inches hair length. Definitely recommended for budget hairspray. For people who want to get a nice texture with great hold.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hairspray! Holds up in the most fierce wind without being crunchy. Smells delightful!</li>
    <li> The problem is with the can AND the product. I purchased 2 cans thinking the price was too good to pass up. Unfortunately, after my third time using the first bottle, it clogged and warm running water didn&#x27;t help. On to the next bottle, which clogged after just one use! Even the amount of spray I did manage to get on my hair was horrible, it made my hair really course. I gave the product 1 star because it smelled good.</li>
    <li> My daughters absolutely love this hairspray for their long hair in the winter.  It gives it enough weight to keep the static from taking over, but doesn&#x27;t leave hair stiff.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff as an adhesive for holding 3D printed parts to a glass build platform on my Makerbot Replicator, and it works great.  Much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my hair stay in place, look shiny and smells nice.</li>
    <li> The product held up very well and I have no issues with it at all.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product as it is advertised as an anti-humidity hairspray. I certainly think that in the humidity that I deal with in my present location, it works very well. On the other hand, it does not have the extreme hold I was expecting and when I sprayed a little more than I usually do, it dried white and flaky in my hair. So I kind of want to give this a 2.5 as it does only half of what it is advertised to do.</li>
    <li> Caused large amounts of buildup, and hold wasn&#x27;t that great. Threw it away after a day.</li>
    <li> unfortunately i bought this product from target&lt;br /&gt;i have curly hair that blow out with the humidity&lt;br /&gt;i bought this spray ,,, it smells well&lt;br /&gt;but it sticks so badly that when i pass my finger my hair was pulled out and it doesnt even hold&lt;br /&gt;it like like my hair was sweaty ... :(&lt;br /&gt;not happy</li>
    <li> Being in Missouri we get a lot and I mean A LOT of humidity in the summer and I use a flat iron to make my hair straight.  Nothing and I mean NOTHING would keep it from poofing back up, I was so frustrated until I get this hair spray.  It really kept it at a 16-20 hour hold which was great for my lifestyle.  I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
    <li> Next time I will choose something with less hold. This one leaves a residue even after shampooing. I chose poorly.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that needs to stay in place. I also am very sensitive to the smell of certain brands. This one works great and I do not feel that I am choking when I use it.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it. she uses it all the time. At 1st she didn&#x27;t like it but after she used it 2 times she loved it.</li>
    <li> The spray is okay, but the nozzle on this can is ridiculous. I have never had one clog after the second use. Wasted my hard earned money!</li>
    <li> This is a great value. Medium hold and not too sticky.</li>
    <li> Great hair spray! Really helps keep my hair in place and yet also very lightweight and flexible. There are always sales on this and is available in almost all drugstores. I also really like the smell of this but if you put too much, this will smell like alcohol. You get a lot of product in this can and will last about 2-3 months if I use this everyday.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It works well for me.  It holds well all day.  The price is right too.  I can&#x27;t even get it locally for the Amazon price I paid.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have been using it for years. I have fine thin hair and live in a humid area of the country. This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> I love this era in which we can use hairspray without letting everyone KNOW that we are doing it.  This is the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Definately not good holding. I like the smell &amp; It washes out well. I really like hard holding hair spray myself. Wont buy again</li>
