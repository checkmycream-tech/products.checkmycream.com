    <li> I&#x27;m a big time fan of Listerine mouthwash. Used it for years and iv never had any major tooth problems (besides 2 cavity as a child but I didn&#x27;t know better then).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anayways I don&#x27;t really have a preference on toothpaste so iv been trying different brands every month for quiet awhile. I figured since I liked the mouthwash maybe the toothpaste would be good also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I was disappointed. Within seconds I started to gag, the toothpaste has a strong cough syrup like taste. For some people this might not be a problem, however iv always hated the taste makes me weak to my stomach and for lack of better words I vomit 80% of the time when I have to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to seem so negative because as for the toothpaste I&#x27;m please just really dislike the flavor so iv removed 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Purchased in store shipping was the cost of the item).</li>
    <li> I manage a dental office in upstate NY. We do a lot with reps from all brands of toothpaste and give out samples of their products to our patients. I have used ONLY Listerine Mint Gel toothpaste for more than 10 years at 6 to 7 dollars a tube my cost when I can find it, even though I have access to other brand toothpaste at no cost. NOTHING, in my opinion, beats the cleaning power or the strong flavor of this wonderful product!! This is a total adult toothpaste that&#x27;s difficult to find in pharmacies or grocery stores and I am so grateful to be able to get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have used it for years.  For me it works great in dealing with tooth tartar and staining.  The original formula for the product did not have flouride as an ingredient.  This reformulation does.  Heartily recommend it.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste! It leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than any other brand I have used!</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste gel that doesn&#x27;t foam up in my mouth and make me want to throw up.  It&#x27;s the best out there!    I can&#x27;t find it in any of the stores that used stock it.  I believe those stores had to remove it just to enable their other brands to move. [[ASIN:B001E77MG8 Listerine Essential Care Toothpaste, Powerful Mint Gel, 4.2-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that has been discontinued in New Zealand. Probably won&#x27;t buy any more as it works out very expensive with the postage.&lt;br /&gt;Our family loves this toothpaste. When our children come on holiday they search to find it in our home.&lt;br /&gt;Best ever</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive teeth, and this is pretty much the only toothpaste I can tolerate: the texture isn&#x27;t grainy or abrasive at all. For those who are sensitive to taste, it&#x27;s a very strong mint -- it will leave your gums, lips, and tongue tingling -- but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for, so it&#x27;s a win all around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an effective toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Ordered Listerine toothpaste that was shown in the photo in listing. Vendor shipped another, not what was shown on site. Shame on them</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste you can buy but hard to find in stores. Does a great job fighting Gingivitis and plaque.</li>
    <li> I searched in every drugstore looking for this well known toothpaste and never found it. I did  not think at first to check on line and was thrillled to find it readily availabe. It was so nice to get it delivered. Great toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Great product, price too high</li>
    <li> I love Listerine toothpaste and it is becoming difficult to get at a grocery store.  It is like brushing your teeth and using a mouthwash at the same time!</li>
    <li> Great in reducing tartar</li>
    <li> good product, prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is impossible to find in stores. Nothing works like this does as far as cleaning teeth and freshening breath.</li>
    <li> Nothing beats Listerine Tooth Paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine Tooth Paste provides a clean teeth feel and all day freshness&lt;br /&gt;to the mouth. I truly believe this tooth paste prevents plaque build up,&lt;br /&gt;and cavity prevention when used accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad it is no longer carried in super markets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is still in production.</li>
    <li> Smaller tube than I  had thought.  4.2 is not the normal size of toothpaste tubes, otherwise just as i expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years after my hygienist recommended it.  When I go for a cleaning now, they tell me how much more healthy my gums are.  Listerine toothpaste (no matter what type) is keeping me and my mouth healthy!  A great &#x27;perk up&#x27; every morning!  Very difficult to find the past year in any local stores. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste ever made. I went for quite a few years with teeth that were steadily deteriorating. I had no medical coverage, nor did I have money for a dentist. This was the only toothpaste on the market that could desentitize and alleviate pain in my teeth. If I ran out of this product, then within 48 hours I would have to get some form of pain medication for relief. Then after obtaining more Listerine it would take up to 2 days to calm the nerves down. No other product on the market can give relief like this toothpaste. I finally obtained dental insurance to start the process of reworking my mouth, but Listerine kept the pain away for 12 years.</li>
    <li> The subject line says it all, this is the best toothpaste in the history of EVER, and I&#x27;ve used lots of different brands.</li>
    <li> My local Kroger used to carry this toothpaste but, for some reason, stopped carrying it.  I tried to explain to the manager that, in all the years I have been using Listerine toothpaste, I have never had a cold.  He said he would start carrying the product again but, he hasn&#x27;t.  I like this toothpaste so much, I buy it in bulk from Amazon.</li>
    <li> in india other brand tooth pest cost rs 45 fourty five and this is near rs 1000 one thousand to me includ import and currier so you can thik about this brand .this is 7 star not five star tooth past , no bad smell fresh mouth through day if you smoke or using your toung for all other love making activity</li>
    <li> This is truly essential care that delivers the best results for oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this toothpaste but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the stores anymore, so happy to be able to order it on-line!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, nice taste, doesn&#x27;t foam up in huge amounts, which can be a problem if you have a sensitive gag reflex. The aftertaste is pleasant and it does a nice job of cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have run my own experiment with other toothpastes and Listerine Essential Care really makes a difference in my dental check ups.  It really inhibits tartar formation and plaque.</li>
    <li> if you like strong toothpaste, buy this.  love it.</li>
    <li> Product I received was not the product pictured! It was &amp;#34;the other&amp;#34; Listerine box as pictured in other ads. I had compared prices based on this picture of the box. So keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> This product gives a clean, fresh taste in your mouth that makes you feel confident to talk with others.  It also cleans the teeth very well.</li>
    <li> This product is no longer carried in the market and they stopped making it in 2012 as per a Listerine Representative.  I know because I contacted them doe to adverse affects.  I used the product for two weeks and noticed that my lips were seriously chapped and damaged.  I never have chapped lips.  Tried balm, lipstick and it got worse and worse.  I started developing sores in my mouth and skin was peeling  off in my mouth.  It clicked after I brushed my teeth and several layers of skin peeled off.  I stopped using the product and contacted the company.  They said it was probably a bad batch and said that they no longer produce the toothpaste anyway.  It took a week for my mouth to begin to heal.  My daughter also was using it and she experienced sores and stopped using it and the sores went away.  Have you seen what is in it,  the same ingredient that we use to take muscle pain away.  That creme that causes our skin to hit up and feel very hot.  There is a reason why the company doesnt make this anymore.  But they wont recall it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Smells great nice an strong smell but taste like pure crap that makes you want to throw up doesn&#x27;t even get foamy just feels like water</li>
    <li> I have loved Listerine toothpaste for it&#x27;s clean, sharp taste. It is very difficult to find in stores these days. I love the way my mouth and teeth feel after brushing.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is pleasant tasting and not at all sugary. It leaves my mouth with a clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;It is getting harder to find, so I got a bunch at once.</li>
