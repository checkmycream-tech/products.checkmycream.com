    <li> This feels heavy in my hair. The smell is horrible. It smells a little like dirt.</li>
    <li> I love what this leave-in conditioner does for my fine hair, which I typically air dry.  It leaves it shiny and soft without weighing it down.  I REALLY wish they&#x27;d do something about the smell though.  There&#x27;s a plastic-y kind of smell that offsets the awesome citrus goodness from Paul Mitchell Shampoo Two.  I would use it much more frequently if it had a matching citrus fresh scent!</li>
    <li> all of Paul Mitchell products are great; my hair is always soft, shiny and smooth.  I am so glad that Amazon carries many of these items for subscription!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner. Makes my hair look great plus it&#x27;s an awesome shaving gel to boot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years! Not heavy. Perfect for fine hair. A little goes a long way. So the bottle will last a good 6months!</li>
    <li> Order it all the time, like it</li>
    <li> The best leave-in conditioner I have found. We use on 3 different hair types:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wavy, fine and dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. Thick, tangly &amp; straight&lt;br /&gt;3. Curly, baby fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes hair super soft, reduces tangles and conditions even the most moisture challenged hair.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff.  Used post-shower....simply apply a little evenly throughout all hair after you&#x27;re out of the shower.  Leave in then style as you normally would.  My hair is always soft and manageable.  And I have very thick curly hair.  So does my daughter and my wife.  I&#x27;ve turned both of them on to this product and they both love it.  I&#x27;d call it &amp;#34;indispensable&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love it perfect Paul Mitchell as always</li>
    <li> Any product I have ever bought of Mitchell&#x27;s I really have no complaints. If you &#x27;follow directions&#x27; it is as advertised. I love that most of his products can be used as lotions like this one! I use it almost everyday and it lasts forever. Can be used pre-styling, to keep frizz at bay or just by itself for a wet-look updo! Definietly recommend!</li>
    <li> Product is as described. No issues with delivery</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter because I love it and she needed something to condition her long hair.</li>
    <li> Made my hair oily, maybe I used to much.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! My daughter is on the swim team and uses it after every swim. It&#x27;s helped her hair so much!</li>
    <li> I love this leave-in. However, either the formula changed or mine was tampered with. It smells the same but is really watery. It was thicker the last time I purchased it. I heard of professional products being resold by companies even though they are old or whatever. I am going to purchase from Folica or Sleekhair.com next time just to make sure the product hasn&#x27;t changed. My bottle&#x27;s bar code was covered up by another barcode sticker. Shady to me.</li>
    <li> Product was what I wanted. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The conditioner used to be thicker and I used as a styling &amp;#34;gel.&amp;#34;  It is to liquid for this purpose, so I&#x27;ll need to find something else.</li>
    <li> Great product. Has not changed as far as I can tell from its quality in years past. Has been really good during this winter season of dry air inside.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair moisturizer and soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 20 years.  So I guess it speaks for itself.  It detangles without leaving a typical lifeless feel like regular conditioners.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Hi! Love this conditioner very good for color hair.</li>
