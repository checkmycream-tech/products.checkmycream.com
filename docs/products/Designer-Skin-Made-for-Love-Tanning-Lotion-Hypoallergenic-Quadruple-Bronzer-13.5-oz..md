      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now a much more bronze color, and the tan is staying with me longer than with no lotion.  </li>
      <li>Well maybe a hint of color, but nothing to notice or feel comfortable wearing shorts with!  </li>
      <li>day edit - ok....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It has a mild fragrance but not as obnoxious as many others tend to have.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used several others but this brand makes a great color.</li>
      <li>Works well and gives you great color but the odor after tanning was a little to strong for my liking.</li>
      <li>It goes on really easy and smooth its not greasy at all and its very soothing.</li>
      <li>I havent noticed much with the bronzers in it but other then that its a great lotion I do love it.</li>
      <li>It smells fine, not a strong smell at all, and it feels nice going on, but it DOES NOT give me any color!  </li>
      <li>so I need a lotion with a lot of bronzers when I do to make it worth my while.</li>
      <li>Tried this after using lots of different others and it gives you a nice bronze color.</li>
      <li>It left kind of a funky after tan smell.</li>
      <li>its just right.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and many indoor tanning lotions give me a rash but</li>
      <li>It was a good deal for a basic tanning lotion, but I will be trying some new ones and alternating with my usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>The only positive thing about Made For Love is the smell.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tan in the tanning beds because I&#x27;m fair, blonde hair, and blue eyed</li>
      <li>It smells amazing, but not worth the price.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Its also full of really good ingredients so this is a great lotion for everyone whos into natural products,  and its not super expensive.</li>
      <li>The bronzers in this product aren&#x27;t very significant.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish I bought this lotion on Amazon as opposed to the salon where I paid almost twice as much.</li>
      <li>I have gotten so much darker using it.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>This is a great value and if you only tan once every few weeks, this should last you a while</li>
      <li>I am extremely new to the world of indoor tanning and use this in my rotation, it does not make me look orange</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin this is for you.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I&#x27;ve recently become allergic to tanning lotions - even the professional spray tans!  </li>
      <li>It is moderately moisturizing and would recommend it to any newcomers or those who wish to tan in a tanning bed but have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I got pretty dark from it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that doesn&#x27;t cause an outbreak.</li>
      <li>smell is OKAY but not great.  </li>

<li> smell is OKAY but not great.  </li>
<li> I will be sticking with my old tanning lotion (California Tan&#x27;s Epicurious with Black Tea and Shitake)</li>
<li> and my skin is not sensitive at all.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like some lotions do   </li>
<li> but I think it&#x27;s because the skin was still super sensitive from the lotion I tried before this one that gave me a really bad allergic reaction.</li>
<li> I have really sensitive skin and its hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve spent my teens and 20&#x27;s sun-worshipping</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if Designer Skin seals their products, but this wasn&#x27;t sealed, something I expected from \\&quot;Sealed Tanning</li>
<li> My skin is very sensative and this is the only lotion that doesnt make me itch like crazy</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sensitive skin, but I have noticed that I have never experienced any irritation after using this.</li>
<li> so finding a tanning lotion sensitive enough for my skin is very difficult.</li>
<li> There is basically little or no scent to it, and I&#x27;m not bothered one bit by it.  </li>
<li> What a waste.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s a waste of time slathering this on every day after my shower.  </li>
<li> This was less than 20 bucks!</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not a good idea.  </li>
<li> Duh!  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t fake bake often</li>
<li> I hate it</li>
<li> I hate the after tan smell you get with a lot of lotions.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m quite allergic to fragrance and because of this have never used lotion in a tanning bed fearful of a reaction.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve recently become allergic to tanning lotions - even the professional spray tans!  Don&#x27;t know why this has happened in my 30&#x27;s but my skin gets bumpy and itchy, like torturously itchy!  I can&#x27;t tan in the tanning beds because I&#x27;m fair, blonde hair, and blue eyed so it&#x27;s not a good idea.  I&#x27;ve spent my teens and 20&#x27;s sun-worshipping so I have to stop.  I read the reviews of this stuff and it sounded great so I bought it.  It smells fine, not a strong smell at all, and it feels nice going on, but it DOES NOT give me any color!  I&#x27;ve used it for months and nothing.  Well maybe a hint of color, but nothing to notice or feel comfortable wearing shorts with!  I hate it, it&#x27;s a waste of time slathering this on every day after my shower.  And this is saying a lot because I&#x27;m so white you need sunglasses when I wear shorts, so any color would be noticable.... but not this crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same day edit - ok.... I think I know why this didn&#x27;t work for me.  After reading about similar products I realized this is a tanning lotion you are supposed to apply BEFORE tanning outside or in a tanning bed!  Duh!  I&#x27;m a dork!  Soooo, I wouldn&#x27;t know if this works or not.  I bought it so I could STAY OUT of the sun.  What a waste.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin this is for you. Also if you like to tan and then spray tan this is for you. It goes on really easy and smooth its not greasy at all and its very soothing. Its also full of really good ingredients so this is a great lotion for everyone whos into natural products,  and its not super expensive. I havent noticed much with the bronzers in it but other then that its a great lotion I do love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t fake bake often so I need a lotion with a lot of bronzers when I do to make it worth my while. This one creates a great color even after one use and it smells good too.

I wish I bought this lotion on Amazon as opposed to the salon where I paid almost twice as much. This is a great value and if you only tan once every few weeks, this should last you a while</li>
    <li> I wish they still made this...I can not longer find it. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and many indoor tanning lotions give me a rash but Made for Love was very easy on my skin.  It has a mild fragrance but not as obnoxious as many others tend to have.  I am extremely new to the world of indoor tanning and use this in my rotation, it does not make me look orange like I&#x27;ve heard a lot of bronzers tend to do.  It is moderately moisturizing and would recommend it to any newcomers or those who wish to tan in a tanning bed but have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve used several others but this brand makes a great color. Even the after tan lotion is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about 4 or five times now and my skin looks absolutely amazing I have the perfect tan forming!</li>
    <li> For a hypoallergenic tanning lotion it works well,   overall I&#x27;d say this is a good product.   It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like some lotions do   and it doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy, its just right.</li>
    <li> really liked the product</li>
    <li> This product is the Best</li>
    <li> The bronzers in this product aren&#x27;t very significant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is OKAY but not great.  I will be sticking with my old tanning lotion (California Tan&#x27;s Epicurious with Black Tea and Shitake) once this is used.  It was a good deal for a basic tanning lotion, but I will be trying some new ones and alternating with my usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it wasn&#x27;t sealed...I don&#x27;t know if Designer Skin seals their products, but this wasn&#x27;t sealed, something I expected from \\&quot;Sealed Tanning Lotions\\&quot; but I will probably continue to order from them.</li>
    <li> Tried this after using lots of different others and it gives you a nice bronze color. It made me itchy after I used it so i don&#x27;t know about the hypoallergenic part and my skin is not sensitive at all. It left kind of a funky after tan smell.</li>
    <li> I hate the after tan smell you get with a lot of lotions. This doesn&#x27;t have that! Shipping was fast and I got exactly what I ordered. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I have gotten so much darker using it.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This lotion did nothing for my tan. I paid around $30 for it and I felt like I got no results. The only positive thing about Made For Love is the smell. It smells amazing, but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for me! My skin is very sensative and this is the only lotion that doesnt make me itch like crazy when Im done tanning.</li>
    <li> I got pretty dark from it. My knees still got kind of blotchy and itchy but I think it&#x27;s because the skin was still super sensitive from the lotion I tried before this one that gave me a really bad allergic reaction. I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite allergic to fragrance and because of this have never used lotion in a tanning bed fearful of a reaction.  This product is AMAZING.  There is basically little or no scent to it, and I&#x27;m not bothered one bit by it.  I also can not believe the instant difference I see in my tanning.  I&#x27;m now a much more bronze color, and the tan is staying with me longer than with no lotion.  I highly recommend this product.  It was just what I was hoping for!</li>
    <li> I loved this lotion... I have really sensitive skin and its hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. This was great. Also it beats buying tanning lotion at a salon! This was less than 20 bucks! In a salon it would&#x27;ve been like 60!</li>
    <li> Works well and gives you great color but the odor after tanning was a little to strong for my liking.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed last year with eczema so finding a tanning lotion sensitive enough for my skin is very difficult. This lotion is amazing for that!! It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that doesn&#x27;t cause an outbreak. The color doesn&#x27;t happen as quickly as I&#x27;d like, but you still see great results. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin then its a great lotion , helps you achieve a good looking tan . the smell is great don&#x27;t have that yucky burned smell after laying in tanning bed .</li>
