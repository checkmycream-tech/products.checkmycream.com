      <li>BEAUTIFUL FRAGRANCE.</li>
      <li>I am so happy that I bought it.</li>
      <li>all the time - great combo of floral &amp; musk.</li>
      <li>It makes me feel good when I wear it.</li>
      <li>I love it and it being the oil it lasts on my skin all day!  </li>
      <li>She has bought the perfume and says the roll on smells so much better!</li>
      <li>Nice scent - not for me.</li>
      <li>I love the scent.  </li>
      <li>Zero words to describe my love for this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I get so many compliments.  </li>
      <li>I love this oil, every time I wear it</li>
      <li>I love the roll on oil as it feels so smooth on the body and just imparts an amazing fragrance.</li>
      <li>The chances are that nobody around you will even have the same fragrance--original and perfect!</li>
      <li>but I love the oil.</li>
      <li>you will have many followers asking, \\&quot;What do you have on?  </li>
      <li>If you love Amazing Grace (swoon) and the like (Bobbi Brown, the Clean fragrances), you will be over the moon with IF.  </li>
      <li>Worth every cent, and you will love it!</li>
      <li>It smells incredibly light and refreshing, but I wish it lasted longer</li>
      <li>In the end, IF is a hip, young, energetic fragrance that I would certainly recommend if you like fresh, happy, citrus scents:-)</li>
      <li>They more or less answered me that all the vials are the same…I may be old, but I have loved this perfume since 1945 and was so happy to find it again on line…If I had received a nicer answer from APOTHA</li>
      <li>I love this scent so much, it&#x27;s so pretty and feminine.</li>
      <li>In addition, this line is so unique.</li>
      <li>Just smells clean.</li>
      <li>Such a clean, soft, delicious scent.</li>
      <li>VERY TASTEFUL, NOT TOO OVERWHELMING.</li>
      <li>Fresh, clean and if you layer (lotion, body wash, pure oil, perfume spray)</li>
      <li>love this scent, very subtle - great for day time</li>
      <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my mom because she really enjoys the smell!</li>
      <li>(what&#x27;s new)!!  </li>
      <li>I had to wrap it in tissue paper which was to say the least \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; and not the ideal way to present a gift.</li>
      <li>I really like the scent</li>
      <li>Instead it is going to cast a spell around you and anyone who is close to you will delight in a wonderful aromatherapy that they wont credit to a chemical, artificial perfume but instead to your natural scent.</li>
      <li>The reason I said that is because there was not as much oil in the second vial as the first.  </li>
      <li>It also sis not smell the same as the first one..  </li>
      <li>I also have this fragrance in the spray and to me the oil smells very different, not bad just different than what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>It was made in the late &#x27;90s and became a favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>I pulled the sleeve off and saw that it was half full.  </li>
      <li>This reminds me very much of a fragrance called Mukki that came in a solid white bottle shaped like an old-fashioned milk bottle.</li>
      <li>I love the floral scent, but the fragrance didn&#x27;t seem to last as long on my skin as I expected it would, especially because it&#x27;s an oil.</li>

<li> Not wow.</li>
<li> When you wear it someone will ask what you are wearing,it is subtle, but it does command attention when worn!Be ready for the compliments.</li>
<li> It actually reminds me of the GO perfume oil from Urban Decay (they&#x27;ve discontinued the Urban Decay oils, unfortunately).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if the spray on perfume smells the same</li>
<li> Lasts all day and usually still lingering in the morning.</li>
<li> $ 65.00 for an oil and only to fill half way makes me mad.  </li>
<li> LIKE ALL PERFUME PRODUCTS,KIND OF EXPENSIVE</li>
<li> I am sorry but the roll on smells like bug spray when I put it on.</li>

    <li> My sister uses this product all the time. I purchased for her birthday. Considering the price, this product should have a gift type box for presentation as a gift. I had to wrap it in tissue paper which was to say the least \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; and not the ideal way to present a gift.</li>
    <li> The delivery was excellent. Shipped very fast. I also have this fragrance in the spray and to me the oil smells very different, not bad just different than what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This reminds me very much of a fragrance called Mukki that came in a solid white bottle shaped like an old-fashioned milk bottle. It was made in the late &#x27;90s and became a favorite of mine. It was eventually discontinued and I&#x27;d given up finding something close to it.</li>
    <li> Such a clean, soft, delicious scent. I love the roll on oil as it feels so smooth on the body and just imparts an amazing fragrance. Worth every cent, and you will love it! In addition, this line is so unique. The chances are that nobody around you will even have the same fragrance--original and perfect!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not going to slap and grab and yank your nose into smelling it. Instead it is going to cast a spell around you and anyone who is close to you will delight in a wonderful aromatherapy that they wont credit to a chemical, artificial perfume but instead to your natural scent. That is what \\&quot;If\\&quot; does. It evokes a cloud of softness, femininity and kindness. You will find people simply want to be around you and relax in your presence.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent, luxurious, best perfume I ever owned. I am so happy that I bought it. I have the oil version, it just lingers, simly delicious.</li>

    <li> BEAUTIFUL FRAGRANCE. VERY TASTEFUL, NOT TOO OVERWHELMING. LIKE ALL PERFUME PRODUCTS,KIND OF EXPENSIVE BUT BY COMPARISON, NOT OUT OF LINE.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this.  I really like the scent but now I won&#x27;t buy again.  I pulled the sleeve off and saw that it was half full.  I think this is a sleazy way to sell a product.  $ 65.00 for an oil and only to fill half way makes me mad.  Maybe the plastic cover is their way to cover this up no pun intended.</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance that receives alot of attention when worn. When you wear it someone will ask what you are wearing,it is subtle, but it does command attention when worn!Be ready for the compliments.</li>
    <li> I love the scent.  The roll-on is perfect to keep on your dresser or throw in your purse.</li>
    <li> This scent reminds me of Hawaii.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for years. I get compliments on it all the time - great combo of floral &amp; musk. Lasts all day and usually still lingering in the morning. Would be lost without it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil, every time I wear it I get so many compliments.  It makes me feel good when I wear it. I have worn one fragrance only for a long time, but now this oil has become my signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> Just smells clean. Not wow.</li>
    <li> Zero words to describe my love for this fragrance.  If you love Amazing Grace (swoon) and the like (Bobbi Brown, the Clean fragrances), you will be over the moon with IF.  Fresh, clean and if you layer (lotion, body wash, pure oil, perfume spray) you will have many followers asking, \\&quot;What do you have on?  You smell amazing!\\&quot;  Get it and you&#x27;ll see just how yummy it is.</li>
    <li> I am sorry but the roll on smells like bug spray when I put it on.</li>
    <li> This is my number one choice for perfume. I love this scent so much, it&#x27;s so pretty and feminine. I&#x27;m not sure if the spray on perfume smells the same but I love the oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom because she really enjoys the smell! She has bought the perfume and says the roll on smells so much better!</li>
    <li> The reason I said that is because there was not as much oil in the second vial as the first.  I wrote the company and told them.  It also sis not smell the same as the first one..  They more or less answered me that all the vials are the same…I may be old, but I have loved this perfume since 1945 and was so happy to find it again on line…If I had received a nicer answer from APOTHA I would buy it again, but not now….Not Amazon&#x27;s fault !!!</li>
    <li> love this scent, very subtle - great for day time</li>
    <li> Nice scent - not for me.</li>
    <li> I love it and it being the oil it lasts on my skin all day!  My sister recommended it to me!</li>
