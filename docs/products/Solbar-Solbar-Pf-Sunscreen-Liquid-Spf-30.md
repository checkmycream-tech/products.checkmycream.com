      <li>Recommended by my dermatologist, and it is effective, even in Florida!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good value,  however,  </li>
      <li>A gel sunscreen goes on well, absorbs well, and has fair durability against perspiration.</li>
      <li>Good stuff.  </li>
      <li>Living in Hawaii, we need really good sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>This is a good replacement for Pre-Sun which seems to have been discontinued.</li>
      <li>but this is just as good.</li>
      <li>This gel sunblock as a nice light consistency; it&#x27;s perfect for the face if you have oily skin.</li>
      <li>The cream (50) was awesome, this gave me an itch, mild, but still.</li>
      <li>I use it for many years, a great sun blocker.</li>
      <li>Really nice sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>SolBar was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it&#x27;s the best recommendation I have ever gotten on a product that really works well.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist strongly recommended this brand as well since it is good for the skin and will not cause breakouts.</li>
      <li>You have to be willing to use it for it to do you any good after all!</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin that burns easily and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my face and it is the best one I&#x27;ve found so far for not giving me acne.</li>
      <li>It is great because it is alcohol based, meaning not at all greasy, and it dries right away.</li>
      <li>I applies so easy and is not greasy!  </li>
      <li>I break out easily from sunscreen and it didn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like using hand sanitizer, but a smidge more moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of most sunscreens</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if you rub it off with a towel you would have to reapply it.  </li>
      <li>24/7 goes on nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>so I feel safe using this product.</li>
      <li>Have bought more of the 50 already.</li>
      <li>I have always had problems with oily skin and feel like most sunscreens feel like another layer of grease on my face, but solbar goes on and feels like i&#x27;m not even wearing any sunscreen</li>
      <li>Much better.</li>
      <li>With the current prescriptions that I use, I have to also apply a sunscreen to protect my skin and this works great!</li>
      <li>Love the gel texture feeling on my face.  </li>
      <li>I love it and it does the job.</li>
      <li>Get SolBar :)</li>
      <li>And if you&#x27;re into sports, you sure need a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Most days, I can apply once and not reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I just love this product.  </li>
      <li>I am a sailor &amp; fisherman who spends many days in the sun.</li>
      <li>If you put it on before you get wet or start to sweat it works best.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many sunscreens and SolBar does not have that greasy feeling cool and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Made with alcohol so not a lotion and absorbs easy.  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy or oily, and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Reapplication was easy halfway through the day-</li>
      <li>I like the gel type sunscreen because it goes on easily over the hair on my arms and legs.  </li>
      <li>Easy to wear every day.  </li>
      <li>Dries very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It is a gel and not a cream, so it dries very quickly.</li>
      <li>I goes on clean and lasts most of the day, despite lots of sweat.  </li>
      <li>The smell of alcohol, one of the &amp;#34;inactive&amp;#34; ingredients, is strong, and the list of ingredients contains Oxybenzone (6%).</li>
      <li>It does have a bit of a strong smell when you put it on</li>
      <li>SolBar doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like Coppertone.  </li>
      <li>But alone, it works well, goes on smoothly, seems to easily absorb to cover the skin.</li>
      <li>Sure, it evaporates quickly, presumably leaving the screen in place, but it does that by being carried by something like alcohol, I guess, and it takes a lot to get coverage on one&#x27;s face.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft when I use it and has a sort of pleasant shimmer that doesn&#x27;t look oily.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and invisible.</li>
      <li>My husband is the primary user since his job puts him in the heat/outside often.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s the ONLY sunscreen</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to depend on the alcohol evaporating after application, but I can confirm it is indeed grease free.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff especially for my husband who doesn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel.</li>
      <li>The lotion that they make is far superior.</li>
      <li>No stupid &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; either.</li>
      <li>I liked it because it was PABA free and was reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>Goes on easy n dries quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I already used this product, but it is great sunblock!</li>
    <li> great stuff.  Expensive though.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that was natural, mostly sweat proof, and easy to rub in. This met all my requirements! I was a bit skeptical of the product at first, because it didn&#x27;t look like any sunscreen i&#x27;d ever used. Because it&#x27;s alcohol based, it&#x27;s clear and a bit goopy, but it absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film. I&#x27;ve worn it on two hot, sweaty days, with lots of sun exposure, and I only got burned where i forgot to apply in the first place. Reapplication was easy halfway through the day- it doesn&#x27;t seem bothered by sweaty skin! It does sting sometimes during application (especially when I apply it on my face), but that&#x27;s only because of the alcohol base.</li>
    <li> I like the gel type sunscreen because it goes on easily over the hair on my arms and legs.  The cream style seems to get all gummed up and it&#x27;s not fun.  I&#x27;ve used this brand a few times so far this year and no sun burn!  I can&#x27;t say how waterproof it is but I used it while working in the back yard and it seems to stay on even when sweating.  I&#x27;m sure if you rub it off with a towel you would have to reapply it.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use it on the top of my head which is increasingly vulnerable to the sun.  It is great because it is alcohol based, meaning not at all greasy, and it dries right away.</li>
    <li> THIS SUNSCREEN IS RECOMMENDED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS. IT IS NOT GREASY AND IS A BROAD SPECTRUM SUNSCREEN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I avoided using moisturizers and sunscreens on my face because of oily skin and a tendency towards acne. When I told my dermatologist about this, she suggested using a gel sunscreen. It took a while to find one, but eventually I found SolBar PF Liquid 30. I am so happy with it! Not only does it not promote acne, it actually improves it! And it keeps the oiliness down.  The dermatologist said that some people complain of dryness when using gel sunscreens, but I have not had that problem with the SolBar. My skin feels soft when I use it and has a sort of pleasant shimmer that doesn&#x27;t look oily. The dryer parts of my face don&#x27;t seem to be any dryer than before.  The gel is alcohol-based and can be irritating to eyes and nasal membranes when put on too heavily, too quickly.  It will cause a burning sensation if you rub your eyes without washing it off your fingers.  The Environmental Working Group gives it a \\&quot;3\\&quot;, which is the best score it gives for a non-mineral sunscreen (it does contain oxybenzone).</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen! It isn&#x27;t thick and white like some sunscreens, but provides incredible protection from the sun. Because it is more expensive than regular sunscreen, I use it primarily on my face. I have never gotten sunburned when I&#x27;ve used this. And I don&#x27;t have to reapply it like you do regular sunscreen. It does have a bit of a strong smell when you put it on (it&#x27;s alcohol based), but that goes away in a second.</li>
    <li> I wanted PreSun but this is just as good.</li>
    <li> SolBar doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like Coppertone.  SolBar is easy to apply and fast drying.  SolBar screens the sunlight well.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen.  It goes on in seconds and has the consistency of hand sanitizer (Purel).  I use it on my arms every day during the Summer months.  I was never willing to do that before with creamy sunscreens.  You have to be willing to use it for it to do you any good after all!</li>
    <li> I have lupus. Need sunscreen 24/7 goes on nice and smooth. No idea that solar had a gel. Goes on smooth and invisible. Just like to know if there is any zinc in it</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen as it&#x27;s not as heavy as some sunscreens. I feel I can put it on my face without that greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This brand was recommended by my dermatologist. I like this gel version for my body because it doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue.</li>
    <li> Best sun screen I&#x27;ve ever used. Yes...it &amp;#34;disappears&amp;#34; shortly after application and you don&#x27;t look like you walked into a cream cheese pie. No stupid &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; either. Great stuff my dermatologist at Kaiser Permanente Medical recommended to me.</li>
    <li> I love it. Made with alcohol so not a lotion and absorbs easy.  Clear solution.  I use it on my face and it is the best one I&#x27;ve found so far for not giving me acne.</li>
    <li> Had tried this as a sample from dermatologist&#x27;s office. This sunscreen is non-greasy and absorbs fast.  It is especially good for using on the face.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my Dermatologist.  It goes on the skin easily and dries fast.  I have had some skin cancer so I feel safe using this product.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the product!!!!! So far Amazon has not been helpful or refund my money!</li>
    <li> I am light skinned and this sunscreen comes highly rated in many ways.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that the texture is a bit funny and that it stains clothes.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen on my face mainly and it works well. It is a gel and not a cream, so it dries very quickly. It does have alcohol as an ingredient, but the smell is masked by the sunscreen&#x27;s mild fragrance. This was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This works great.  Most days, I can apply once and not reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the alcohol base.  Stings when applied to my freshly shaved face.</li>
    <li> Really nice sunscreen.  It goes on clear and offers nice protection from the sun.</li>
    <li> The product is great.  It is the only sunscreen product that I can use and not worry about getting a zit.  But the  shipper sent it in an evelope instead of a box and it leaked out!!!  Shipper you need to use a box.</li>
    <li> I got a couple of samples from a dermatologist office and will be buying a full package.  Not only is it a good sunscreen but it&#x27;s not messy.  I put it on my mostly-bald head before going for a walk during my lunch hour at work.  You wouldn&#x27;t dare put the traditional sunscreens on your head like that in an office setting - your hair would end up greasy looking.  This product goes on very nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave traces behind.</li>
    <li> I use it for many years, a great sun blocker.</li>
    <li> This should sold in our area!  It is easy to apply and does a very good job of protecting my skin without using grease and messy lotions.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin that burns easily and quickly.  I have been using this product for a little over a month and I haven&#x27;t gotten burned at all this summer.  I can put it on, and forget about it.  I can go in and out of the water multiple times, and haven&#x27;t had to worry about reapplying.  It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes or make me feel sticky.  This product goes on smooth and leaves my skin soft and smooth looking.  This sunscreen is the best sunscreen I have ever used. The only negatives is that sometimes it will bunch or create little bits of skin (think when your skin is peeling after a sunburn).  It also has a subtle alcohol smell when you first put it on.  You can wear this sunscreen on your face- but initially the alcohol smell is a little strong.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  It goes on kinda cool and doesnt feel sticky.  I hope some day they make it in spf 50.  I highly recommed it.</li>
    <li> SolBar PF (SPF 30) was recommended by my dermatologist, however, no local store carries it. Once again, Amazon came throught via a Marketplace partner. My only disappointment is that this order did not qualify for free shipping. Otherwise, the entire transaction was first-class.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen so much because I never get burnt when I use this product.  SolBar was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it&#x27;s the best recommendation I have ever gotten on a product that really works well.</li>
    <li> I really like Sol Bar but I prefer the cream instead of the clear. Works really well and I will use it just will purchase the cream next time. Other wise I will always purchase Sol Bar. Thank You</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this while teaching swimming lessons.  She has very fair skin and has not gotten sunburned yet.  It does not irritate her sensitive skin either.</li>
    <li> This is a good replacement for Pre-Sun which seems to have been discontinued. I went cycling for 3 hours and had no sunburn.</li>
    <li> Great block.  Not greasy.  Stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Living in Hawaii, we need really good sunscreens.  And if you&#x27;re into sports, you sure need a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of sunscreens over the years and not one I&#x27;ve tried lives up to the manufacturer&#x27;s representation that the sunscreen will not sting the eyes.  Well, this SoBar 30 gel doesn&#x27;t even make that claim and yet it really works!  I only use it on my face--it&#x27;s about $10 for a 4 oz bottle--and use various other mineral and non-mineral sunscreens for the rest of my body.  Never has SolBar gel stung my eyes while playing tennis, surfing, or working in the yard!  In 2011 it was ranked a #3 sunscreen on the Environment Working Group&#x27;s sunscreen review, which is a pretty high ranking for a non-mineral sunscreen.  Great stuff in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. I am a lifeguard and got a sample of solbar from my dermatologist and think that it works great! I have always had problems with oily skin and feel like most sunscreens feel like another layer of grease on my face, but solbar goes on and feels like i&#x27;m not even wearing any sunscreen</li>
    <li> My husband prefers this sunscreen over any--it is not fragrant--just as he likes--it does not have a flowery scent!</li>
    <li> Love that this is not greasy for my oily skin, but if I apply too much, it rubs off with my makeup foundation.  Just use a little bit and you&#x27;ve got 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The gel is tough to get used to. The lotion that they make is far superior. it is not the easiest to apply.</li>
    <li> I used the SolBar PF Sunscreen on a 2 week trip to Myanmar.  I am fair-skinned and got great protection (i.e., no burn) despite spending hours out in the sun.  This is a great product. I goes on clean and lasts most of the day, despite lots of sweat.  You&#x27;ll have to figure out what works best for you, but I&#x27;m loading up on this.  I goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of most sunscreens so my dermatologist&#x27;s P.A. gave me a sample of this.  This is one I can actually wear all day (but eventually, like all sunscreen, you got to take a shower). It goes on extremely easy and it has a faint smell that is not added, probably just the smell of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a bit greasy.  So if you have oily skin it probably won&#x27;t work.  However, if you have dry skin, like me, you can just use it instead of a lotion.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy n dries quickly. I used to use Presun but it&#x27;s not available anymore and this is the closest thing I can find. It does have alcohol base so the initial smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> The only kind I can use due to allergies</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff.  he uses it every day.  He&#x27;s had a reaction to other products but not this one.</li>
    <li> My husband uses the SolBar every day since he is out in the sun all day working.  The product is a lot thicker than the other gel that he used for years, but can no longer find.It took some getting used to, but it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> The reason I got this was to avoid a preservative in most other brands that I get horrible itching from that lasts a week. The cream (50) was awesome, this gave me an itch, mild, but still. Have two bottles and won&#x27;t use. Only the 50 cream works for me. Have bought more of the 50 already. Like the brand.</li>
    <li> Being out in the sun in Las Vegas without sunscreen (or anywhere for that matter) is not an option. My husband is the primary user since his job puts him in the heat/outside often. Being part Irish he also burns easily. SolBar liquid is the only product we&#x27;ve found that lasts and keeps him from turning into a crispy critter :) Three bottles arrived in fine shape, the only thing they could do &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; is to choose a smaller box perhaps? Anyway, great stuff. Get SolBar :)</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works!</li>
    <li> Non greasy, works very well.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen we buy.</li>
    <li> A gel sunscreen goes on well, absorbs well, and has fair durability against perspiration. An SPF 30 should be re-applied every 2 hours which is the only drawback.</li>
    <li> Love the gel texture feeling on my face.  First tried a sample from my dermatologist office and  had to order.  I have tried many sunscreens and SolBar does not have that greasy feeling cool and refreshing.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the snot-like consistency, or the sting of alcohol, when first applied, this works well. It does leave you somewhat shiny, and as others have stated, must be worn alone with nothing else (no moisturizer or even hyaluronic acid or gel underneath it) or else it soughs off and feels like your skin is peeling off. But alone, it works well, goes on smoothly, seems to easily absorb to cover the skin. I&#x27;ve worn it in full sun in 104-degree heat and not burned. I did reapply on my face when I sweated it off after an hour of running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have not noticed any eye sting from it. This could be that I haven&#x27;t applied it to my forehead (since my baseball cap covers that area), but that&#x27;s a huge difference from other products. I have applied it below my eyes, and even when I have rubbed my eyes with it on my fingers, haven&#x27;t noticed a sting.</li>
    <li> Awesome for people with oily skin.  I never use any other sunscreen on my face now.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff especially for my husband who doesn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel.</li>
    <li> SolBar Liquid spf 30 was recommended by my dermatologist and I took his advice.  This one in particular is now my favorite.  It does not feel sticky or greasy on the skin.</li>
    <li> A very good product that provides impressive sunblock protection.  However, it has two minor limitations.&lt;br /&gt;The liquid feels oily after application.  Next, it is pricey.  This is a reliable product that&lt;br /&gt;does everything its manufacturer promises.</li>
    <li> Really like the sunscreen.  The service was excellent.  Martha</li>
    <li> Alcohol can be very damaging for the face. I&#x27;m not sure why people are giving this such good reviews! Definitely check out the ingredients list before you pay!</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this from my boyfriend and field tested it in the backcountry of the Southern Sierra. No stinging eyes from sweat-melted sunscreen, a problem I seem to have with everything else I&#x27;ve ever used, even the sports blocks. As a bonus, it left my skin feeling soft and helped clear up acne. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve been in the field for a week without breaking out.</li>
    <li> I have a bald head so I&#x27;m always trying to find the best sunscreen to protect me from the Hawaiian sun.&lt;br /&gt;This one goes on clean, albeit with a slight alcohol smell, but it absorbs instantly into the skin, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;It manages to stay quite a while in spite of perspiration. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that it goes on clean - invisible on the skin - and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I applied the sunscreen to heavy but there remains a thin almost transparent film which doesn&#x27;t fully absorb into the skin.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  No greasy white film.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a cyclist and out in the sun all day, you have to use sunscreen, especially in the summer. If you frequently ride on dirt roads, then the usual greasy stuff just isn&#x27;t going to work for you. The grease attracts dirt and dust, and you pretty much end up covered all over with dust and mud. Which does make for effective sunscreen, but feels icky. It doesn&#x27;t look that great either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I used Quest Products&#x27; Lifeguard Sunscreen. Unfortunately, they seemed to have been discontinued. That product had other issues (such as precipitating when it&#x27;s cold), but it was never greasy, SPF 15, and worked great. You just had to apply it a few times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my search for a replacement product, I came across Solbar. It&#x27;s also alcohol based, but is a gel rather than a liquid. It doesn&#x27;t seem to depend on the alcohol evaporating after application, but I can confirm it is indeed grease free. I took it out for a 3.5 hour ride, including a dusty dirt path, and did not get covered in dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big con is that it&#x27;s expensive. Amazon sells it for around $11 for a 4oz bottle, and I have yet to find a cheaper source for it. Then again, it&#x27;s SPF 30, so I think I can get away with applying it only once a day, so it probably evens out. Recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband and I like this product because it is effective and doesn&#x27;t feel wet or greasy---good for everyone in the family.</li>
    <li> I dont know if this is how this product is supposed to be, but it just doesn&#x27;t go on well. Sure, it evaporates quickly, presumably leaving the screen in place, but it does that by being carried by something like alcohol, I guess, and it takes a lot to get coverage on one&#x27;s face.This looks like a cream in the picture, but mine is a clear smelly kind of stuff.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is perfect for me.  I hate lotions and that greasy feel they leave on my fact, and I hate to look like &amp;#34;Casper the Ghost&amp;#34; after I put on sunscreen.  This clear liquid is almost Gel-like (think consistency of hand sanitizer), and I have no qualms at all about putting it on every morning after I put on face moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this one for kids.  My dermatologist strongly recommended this brand as well since it is good for the skin and will not cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that would do the job without being too toxic and I came across this product.  I liked it because it was PABA free and was reasonably priced.  We took it with us to Florida and it worked great. It has a totally different consistency from most sun screens.  Instead of being thick, white and difficult to absorb, it is a light gel that rubs in easily.  My husband who always fights me about wearing sunblock because he hates the thick, gunky mess used this happily and told me not to ever buy any other sunblock.  I&#x27;d have to say I agree.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this goes on, does not make my face oily and protects from the sun. Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I recently had a skin cancer removed.  The dermatologist advised me to wear sunscreen daily.  I have some acne issues, and wear makeup regularly, so I was concerned about the idea of wearing sunscreen every day.  The dermatologist told me to use this sunscreen for my very specific need everyday on my face, hands, neck, and chest.  It&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s the ONLY sunscreen my MD or I knew of that IS A GEL.  It&#x27;s like using hand sanitizer, but a smidge more moisturizing.  I put it on every morning before I put on any moisturizer.  Thank heavens for this product - there&#x27;s nothing else like it.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time outside in the sun. I prefer a clear gel over a white cream/lotion that may look like war paint.</li>
    <li> This is an alcohol based product that is not greesy at all. A little bit goes a long way and dries quickly when applied to the skin.</li>
    <li> I received something similar and not what is shown here. I didn&#x27;t want to bother with all that involves filling out forms, sending it back and winding paying more than what I already did. Will no longer order this product on line. Period.</li>
    <li> This gel sunblock as a nice light consistency; it&#x27;s perfect for the face if you have oily skin. No strong alcohol scent.</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  I applies so easy and is not greasy!  I wear it golfing and fishing and even if I sweat a lot it stays on all day and protects from sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample from my Dermotologist&#x27;s office and ordered it online from you as I could not find it in any store in Green Bay, Wis. I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This poduct looks great clear who wouldever guess that it smells worse than turpintine burns everything it touchs, and oh yeah it blocks your pores which causes tiny white pimples. Oh well my girlfriend who recommended it loves the the stuff. Can anybody say regift!</li>
    <li> This product was recommend by a friend of mind and it is a great sunscreen. It may cost a little more but you would not be disappointed in your purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a roofer in south Florida.sun protection in imperative for this type of work. I wanted a product that would apply easily,non greasy and sweat resistant. Solbar liquid is that product.it also is great for water sports.I only use this product now and recommend it to family and friends</li>
    <li> Not sticky at all and my doc recommended it!  Stays on!  Great for the golfer too!  Feel very much protected!</li>
    <li> If you hate those white sticky sunscreen lotions like me, this is the alternative for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my local stores stock is lotions.  So finding liquid sun screens at amazon I gave this one&lt;br /&gt;a try.  It met all my expectation.</li>
    <li> Just tried this for a few days.  I like that it isn&#x27;t greasy feeling. I break out easily from sunscreen and it didn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
    <li> A+.  LOVE this stuff.  Goes on clear.  No white stuff to rub in.  Has alcohol in it so also serves to close my face up after shaving.  No greasy feel.  Dries very quickly.  Easy to wear every day.  And works very well in full sun situations like a 5 hour golf round.</li>
    <li> Excellent, non greasy , non smelly. It works</li>
    <li> This is a gel, not a regular liquid.  In addition, it contains alcohol which dries the skin. The former product was a cream with moisturizing properties.  Much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using alcohol base sunscreen for twenty years.  I am so glad I found this stuff.  If you put it on before you get wet or start to sweat it works best.  I am a sailor &amp; fisherman who spends many days in the sun.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is hard to find at a Drug Store. Dermotologist recomended it to me. It is not greasy or oily. I love it and it does the job. I was disapointed with the shipping . When I ordered it it said no charge for shipping. I got charged with one click order. That irritated me and no answer to an email I sent to the shipper. Will not use them again. Silence telles you something also. Its an answer actually. The one finger salute.</li>
    <li> Applies clear, dries a little too fast. Take care when applying near eyes and nose.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a sample initially from my dermatologist. With the current prescriptions that I use, I have to also apply a sunscreen to protect my skin and this works great! It does not irritate my skin or face, which is especially important. I have only used the liquid formula. It can be a bit greasy which makes my skin look oily. For me, using a little works better.</li>
    <li> The liquid/gel version of this sunscreen initially goes on smoothly but as it wears, the product begins to flake or peel.  There is also an overwhelming vapor or smell emitted that is very unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the cream version of Solibar for years and find it to be a very effective and wearable sunscreen, no pore clogging or rash that can sometimes be associated with sunscreen.  I can even apply to my sensitive face without worries of a negative reaction.  My Dermatologist recommended the Solibar brand to me and I will continue with the cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of its recommendation for sensitive skin and my daughter has eczema.  It it&#x27;s a good value,  however,  it has a strong alcohol base. It also beads up as you rub it on your skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy the product again.</li>
    <li> We/ve been using this for years.  It takes a bit longer to put on as compared to sprays, but really protects well even when going swimming!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect sunscreen.  It&#x27;s a gel that dries quickly and it is not sticky and works all day!  This was prescribed by my dermatologist and I was using it every day.  I still do and I am never without it.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!. Recommended by my dermatologist, and it is effective, even in Florida!  Have even talked my husband into using it daily.</li>
    <li> It does not rub in well, will leave a white cast to where ever you apply it, but it will last a long time in the water.</li>
    <li> I liked PreSun ,used it for at least 25 years, and this is just as good</li>
    <li> not real crazy about the gel-like consistancy, but it totally protects my skin, and i love it!  would&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
    <li> This product has worked well. It was delivered timely. it is much better than the other brands of sun blocker. It is not greasy or oily, and easy to apply. Can&#x27;t find it in a lot of stores.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great if you have a beard - is easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t leave you with white flaky stuff on your beard like every other kind of sunblock does.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of a fair-skinned friend, one of a couple of lotions suggested. One whiff on opening the bottle argued that it wasn&#x27;t for me. The smell of alcohol, one of the &amp;#34;inactive&amp;#34; ingredients, is strong, and the list of ingredients contains Oxybenzone (6%). According to the Environmental Working Group, Oxybenzone penetrates the skin, gets into the bloodstream and acts like estrogen in the body. It can trigger allergic reactions and health harms including endometriosis in women and low sperm counts in men. I won&#x27;t be trying this one again.</li>
