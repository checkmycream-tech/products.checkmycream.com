      <li>I love these oils and that they are conveniently packed making it easy to take anywhere.  </li>
      <li>Love these easy and convenient to use</li>
      <li>Amazon had my money refunded very easily and quickly though.</li>
      <li>The oils are fine.  </li>
      <li>These are sample packets that should be free.  </li>
      <li>Now I know which ones I want to buy in full size.</li>
      <li>For being samples not bad.</li>

      <li>Overall was okay with my purchase.</li>
      <li>However, be aware that the product description it states 2 of each of the 5 types of oil</li>
      <li>These essential oil packets are the perfect size for traveling or when you need a small amount!</li>
      <li>Young Living Distributors are NOT supposed to sell ANY of our products on online ~ !!!</li>
      <li>Barely any oil in some of the packets, like not even a drop&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I thought that the packages were a little smaller than what I would have liked them to be.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re interested in Young Living Essential Oils, then find a distributor that you know or email me</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s barely any oil in these any ways, they are SAMPLES.</li>
