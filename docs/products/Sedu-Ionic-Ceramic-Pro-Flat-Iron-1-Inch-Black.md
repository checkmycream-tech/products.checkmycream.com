      <li>I love this item.  </li>

      <li>MY HAIR LOOKED BETTER BEFORE I PUT THE IRON THROUGH.</li>

      <li>It straightens curly/wavy hair very quickly without blow drying.</li>
      <li>I bought mine from folica.com over a year ago and its still going strong even after dropping it umpteen times.</li>
      <li>Yes, strong.</li>
      <li>I liked it at first</li>
      <li>It also makes it too hot to the touch on the plates when you&#x27;re using it, which I liked on my CHI because I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it when using it.</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair and tend to straighten it often in the winter.</li>
      <li>This straightener is so smooth, gliding easily through my hair.</li>
      <li>The light kept flickering on and off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>IT SEEMED CHEAPLY MADE.</li>
      <li>Does a fantastic job</li>
      <li>So this is working out good so far</li>
      <li>Let me tell you, its worth the money!</li>
      <li>I ordered this flat iron because of all the great reviews I had read, plus my hair is really thick and wavy and read it was perfect for that.</li>
      <li>I love the varied temperature control ( though I tend to use it on high) and it heats up very quickly, which I</li>
      <li>I have really straight hair thanks to this lovely machine!  </li>
      <li>The Sedu heats up quickly and you can adjust the temperature according to your hair type.</li>
      <li>I really love my new straitener.</li>
      <li>It has been well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I was able to flat iron my hair in one pass which is important to me because I want to minimize risk of heat damage.</li>
      <li>It leaves you hair silky, soft, shiny, and strong.</li>
      <li>AT FIRST WHEN I TOOK THE IRON OUT OF THE BOX</li>
      <li>but Im sure some amazon sellers have better prices out there as usual.</li>
      <li>and so it definitely works better on the chemically treated portion of my hair.</li>
      <li>so you have to use higher voltage over here than in the states.</li>
      <li>It is very light weight and does as well as my $25 flat iron I bought at Walmart.</li>
      <li>Love the long cord for one thing.</li>
      <li>When doing my research this flat iron had the most high reviews</li>
      <li>My hair has stayed straight for days since my purchase, with the use of a little baby powder to absorb the oil, and just touching up my ends, I was able to avoid washing my hair for 3 days(!), which saves my hair a lot of damage.</li>
      <li>Thirty seconds after turning it on..it is ready.  </li>
      <li>so it takes a lot to get my hair straight.</li>
      <li>Gets very hot&lt;</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have as much</li>
      <li>my hair is the healthiest its ever been since my hair isn&#x27;t damaged as much by the iron compared to others.</li>
      <li>I HAVE USED MANY FLAT IRONS BEFORE OVER THE LAST 15YEARS INCLUDING BABYBLISS PRO IRONS, I WOULD SAY EVEN MY FIRST HOT TOOLS IRON</li>
      <li>I have never spent more than $30-40 when purchasing a flat iron, but now I wish I would have sooner!</li>
      <li>I WAS SO EXCITED TO RECEIVE MY NEW FLAT HAIR IRON IN THE MAIL.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you purchase.</li>
      <li>Because of that i dont see myself going natural, but much respect to those women who have.</li>
      <li>with humidity, which isn&#x27;t normal since my hair is fine and doesn&#x27;t have a ton of weight to it to hold it down if it is humid.</li>
      <li>I just ordered this product (new) from Folcia in October 2012</li>
      <li>I live in Germany</li>
      <li>I WILL NEVER TRY ANY NEW IRONS AGAIN.</li>
      <li>The description given is accurate, it does not pull hair, glides easily and smoothly, hardly any damage to hair shaft with daily use,silky shiny hair achieved, protective plates.</li>
      <li>only con is that its pretty flimsy casing, and I feel like if I drop it, it will crack.</li>
      <li>Its so lightweight to hold and the plate size is just right to do long hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like the plates fit together well and don&#x27;t make it as tight on my hair as it could.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This certainly did NOT make MY brown eyes blue!!!</li>
      <li>Since using this straightener, I have noticed a HUGE difference in use a few uses.</li>
      <li>I feel like it&#x27;s not damaging my hair like my old irons did.</li>
      <li>It definitely does the trick but not as fast</li>
      <li>so much i bought this on as a back up for traveling!</li>
      <li>Works really well and leaves hair perfectly straight and smooth, however the plates were a little smaller than I expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m African American and my hair is all natural</li>
      <li>I ultimately chose the sedu and I have absolutely no regrets .</li>
      <li>I also have noticed it stays  straight with only a little flip and no frizz(!)</li>

<li> i do have very thick curly hair.</li>
<li> It was broken when I received it.</li>
<li> and now it is useless.</li>
<li> Remember Dee Snyder from Twisted Sister?  </li>
<li> I am really frustrated because I want the product, but one that works for me over here.</li>
<li> but it failed to heat or switch on!!</li>
<li> *HORRIBLE</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Had the 1 1/2 inch flat iron so downsized to this and it is awesome! I love Sedu so much i bought this on as a back up for traveling!</li>
    <li> Love the long cord for one thing. Also, my hair was already fried from a previous straightener. So this is working out good so far</li>
    <li> The Sedu iron I&#x27;m sure would be great if I could use it. I live in Germany so you have to use higher voltage over here than in the states. I ordered this flat iron because of all the great reviews I had read, plus my hair is really thick and wavy and read it was perfect for that. After buying it though I realize it&#x27;s only 120 volt and I have not been able to get a hold of the seller. I am really frustrated because I want the product, but one that works for me over here.</li>
    <li> It stopped working in 6 months.... this is an expensive Flat Iron, so thought it would last longer!! but it failed to heat or switch on!!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron 4 YEARS AGO! It has been amazing. I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair and this product has allowed me to \\&quot;stretch\\&quot;out my relaxers to every 3-4 months. It has been well worth the money. I have thick coarse curls and so it definitely works better on the chemically treated portion of my hair. Because of that i dont see myself going natural, but much respect to those women who have. Overall I have reduced the amount of heat I use on my hair so I don&#x27;t have as much damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: No cord issues here!</li>
    <li> I bought mine from folica.com over a year ago and its still going strong even after dropping it umpteen times. Its so lightweight to hold and the plate size is just right to do long hair. The description given is accurate, it does not pull hair, glides easily and smoothly, hardly any damage to hair shaft with daily use,silky shiny hair achieved, protective plates. The temp can go up to 430 degrees although I dont recommend that. It straightens curly/wavy hair very quickly without blow drying. I air dry my hair. Never straighten when wet! Be careful with ears, the plates scorch! I have even perfected creating loose waves with it by twisting halfway through the hair. Looks very nice. I paid a little over $100 but Im sure some amazon sellers have better prices out there as usual. I highly recommend you purchase. Go to youtube to see reviews.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend said it was ok!</li>
    <li> I WAS SO EXCITED TO RECEIVE MY NEW FLAT HAIR IRON IN THE MAIL. AT FIRST WHEN I TOOK THE IRON OUT OF THE BOX IT SEEMED CHEAPLY MADE. I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO JUDGE THE IRON UNTIL I TRIED IT OUT.&lt;br /&gt;IN THIS CASE LOOKS WERE NOT DECEIVING. YOU CAN HEAR YOUR HAIR FRYING AS YOU STRAIGHTEN YOUR HAIR. MY HAIR LOOKED BETTER BEFORE I PUT THE IRON THROUGH. I HAVE USED MANY FLAT IRONS BEFORE OVER THE LAST 15YEARS INCLUDING BABYBLISS PRO IRONS, I WOULD SAY EVEN MY FIRST HOT TOOLS IRON I USED  15 YEARS AGO WAS BETTER THEN THE SEDU IRON. IF YOU ARE LOOKING A AN AWESOME HAIR IRON I WOULD STICK WITH BABYBLISS PRO I WILL NEVER TRY ANY NEW IRONS AGAIN. TO TOP IT ALL OFF I HAVE TO TAKE THE TIME OUT OF MY DAY TO SHIP THIS BACK TO THE SELLER  ***HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE****</li>
    <li> I love this item.  Thirty seconds after turning it on..it is ready.  I would recommend this brand.  Does a fantastic job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by this flat iron. I&#x27;m African American and my hair is all natural so it takes a lot to get my hair straight. I was able to flat iron my hair in one pass which is important to me because I want to minimize risk of heat damage. The Sedu heats up quickly and you can adjust the temperature according to your hair type. It leaves you hair silky, soft, shiny, and strong. Yes, strong. With my last flat iron, my hair would be brittle and weak. Not so with the Sedu! I am very happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> Pros- Minumizes fly aways&lt;br /&gt;  Gets very hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- i still have to go over my hair a few times to get it straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i do have very thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second sedu flat iron in 1 year. It was broken when I received it. The light kept flickering on and off.&lt;br /&gt;This Is not a cheap flat iron and it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Works really well and leaves hair perfectly straight and smooth, however the plates were a little smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> When doing my research this flat iron had the most high reviews but honestly it is not as good as my daughters GHD pro.  It definitely does the trick but not as fast and my hair isn&#x27;t as shiny with this one as it is with my daughters GHD. I don&#x27;t feel like the plates fit together well and don&#x27;t make it as tight on my hair as it could.&lt;br /&gt;I received it very quickly so the seller held up their end of the deal beautifully. It is very light weight and does as well as my $25 flat iron I bought at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read alot of reviews and done my research trying to decide between the chi and the sedu . I ultimately chose the sedu and I have absolutely no regrets . You can tell the difference between other flat irons by the way the ceramic plates feel and look . my hair is the healthiest its ever been since my hair isn&#x27;t damaged as much by the iron compared to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this one last month and now it stopped working. I liked it at first and now it is useless. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have never spent more than $30-40 when purchasing a flat iron, but now I wish I would have sooner! This straightener is so smooth, gliding easily through my hair. It heats up ridiculously fast and my hair feels great after I use it. I feel like it&#x27;s not damaging my hair like my old irons did. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this after my CHI died after six years of use, and I wanted something of the same standard. The reviews I read on this were good, and it was Cyber Monday, so I took advantage of the deal and ordered it. Let me tell you, its worth the money! I loved my CHI, but I LOVE this! I have fine, curly hair and tend to straighten it often in the winter. Since using this straightener, I have noticed a HUGE difference in use a few uses. My hair has stayed straight for days since my purchase, with the use of a little baby powder to absorb the oil, and just touching up my ends, I was able to avoid washing my hair for 3 days(!), which saves my hair a lot of damage. I also have noticed it stays  straight with only a little flip and no frizz(!) with humidity, which isn&#x27;t normal since my hair is fine and doesn&#x27;t have a ton of weight to it to hold it down if it is humid. I have also noticed my hair looks incredibly shiny and healthy, even my boyfriend noticed a difference in the way my hair looked. It even feels healthier and smoother since I started using it. I love the varied temperature control ( though I tend to use it on high) and it heats up very quickly, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con is that its pretty flimsy casing, and I feel like if I drop it, it will crack. It also makes it too hot to the touch on the plates when you&#x27;re using it, which I liked on my CHI because I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it when using it.</li>
    <li> I have really straight hair thanks to this lovely machine!  Remember Dee Snyder from Twisted Sister?  That was me before i received this.  Now, I&#x27;m Crystal Gayle!  This certainly did NOT make MY brown eyes blue!!!</li>
    <li> I just ordered this product (new) from Folcia in October 2012 and it hasn&#x27;t even been 6 months and it has stopped working. As soon as a turn it on I begin to use it and as soon as I am done I turn it off. It is never left on without use.</li>
    <li> I really love my new straitener. I have had this for a couple of months.  My hair stylist burnt my hair off, and it has helped taming my hair along with the sedu blow dryer.</li>
