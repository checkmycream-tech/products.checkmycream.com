      <li>I have always liked this product and have bought it 3 times.  </li>
      <li>your own conclusions.</li>

      <li>but my this product gave a nice sheen to my skin</li>
      <li>Anyway, I wanted to cast a bit of a bright light on the products by sharing my experience.  </li>
      <li>OWNTHE COMPLETE SYSTEM OFFERED BY MEANINGFUL BEAUTY!!!</li>
      <li>For the price, you are getting good quality rich, emolient products.  </li>
      <li>I was able to cancel the treatment for my face.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve now used Meaningful Beauty for a year.  </li>
      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>I tried the Meaningful beauty line and in my opinion it&#x27;s garbage.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the commercials, ads all of that bogus stuff from Meaningful Beauty.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Ok</li>
      <li>I just love, love, love the Night Cream.  </li>
      <li>I ordered Meaningful Beauty from their online site.  </li>
      <li>Please warn all your friends and put this meaningful beauty scam out of business.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 50s and have been using Meaningful Beauty skincare for about 3 years now.  </li>
      <li>I still have all transactions from my online banking of where meaningful beauty has taken money out of my account without my permission even after cancelling and has not sent me any product after stealing money from my account.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, most of the procedures cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.  </li>
      <li>I should&#x27;ve known better.</li>
      <li>I have many people ask if I am my husband&#x27;s daughter.</li>
      <li>The product is okay</li>
      <li>Go to Google and type meaningful beauty and ripoff.</li>
      <li>If you also try the \\&quot;free\\&quot; vitamins offered with the meaningful beauty face kit, that is enrollment in a separate autoship</li>
      <li>So it was with quite a lot of enthusiasm that I waited for my shipment of the Meaningful beauty products to arrive.</li>
      <li>Glad I looked them up before I called in for one of their specials.</li>
      <li>I find it that it works better at night than in the day</li>
      <li>For any folks tempted by Meaningful Beauty - beware.</li>
      <li>Customer service reps need more training.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews.</li>
      <li>She takes most of my wrinkle caps</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure as time progresses</li>
      <li>I will keep them for myself :))</li>
      <li>I am pleased with my order.</li>
      <li>Do not buy Meaningful Beauty unless you want to cancel your credit</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this product without worry about getting more charges.  </li>
      <li>I am glad to find this serum on here.</li>
      <li>What more can I say.</li>
      <li>I have used it and was set up with a monthly plan with meaningful beauty.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>Just seems to makes the face look better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE SERUM...</li>
      <li>*Upon ordering this product, I was told that my monthly payment of $52.64 (including shipping) would get me the bop of the line package of Meaningful Beauty.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT,</li>
      <li>please let me know:)</li>
      <li>like I&#x27;m sure they give everyone, \\&quot;oh, didn&#x27;t you know?  </li>
      <li>LOVE THE RESULTS OF CINDY CRAWFORDS GLOWING SERUM.</li>
      <li>Meaningful Beauty, according to my c.c. company had 60 days to prove their case, but they did not and could not</li>
      <li>This is my favorite product out of this line.</li>
      <li>Meaningful Beauty is a subscription service - but once you cancel they continue to charge your account for up to 6 weeks even AFTER you have cancelled the subscription.  </li>
      <li>I immediately called the service rep and explained that I did not request nor want any more of this product.  </li>
      <li>I really love the meaningful beauty products.  </li>
      <li>I fell in love with the Infomercial and went online to order it.</li>
      <li>, well, you can return the product and we will refund you your money and we will cancel so you won&#x27;t get any more shipments.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>i love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I watched the Infomercial on Meaningful Beauty</li>
      <li>So even after you call to cancel because they are charging you more than their \\&quot;this is not a bill\\&quot; says they charged you for the product plus 5.99$ shipping and handling, you are still STUCK paying 2 more months for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so i thought this product would help her even more.</li>
      <li>I am reporting her to the Better Business Bureau and turning the matter over to an attorney.</li>
      <li>I stopped using the meaningful beauty product and presto, all the rash went away.  </li>
      <li>I suspect they are attempting to do a better job with handling complaints.  </li>
      <li>Way better products are out there.</li>
      <li>Olay was much better and cheaper</li>
      <li>I re-purchased it because it is the best moisturizer I have used in a long time!  </li>
      <li>and I was amazed at everything and was really excited to order it!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow--I almost expected my face to burn and peel off after reading some of the reviews for the Meaningful Beauty products.  Even so, I decided to give the products a try and I must honestly say that while although some of the products did not work for me, several of them did and amazingly so.  The thing is--nothing works the first time you use it, but with repeated use, I have seen a noticeable difference in the way my skin looks and feels.  I now order only the items I&#x27;m pleased with and get the low membership price, which is actually a bargain for me--considering the improvement in my skin.  I order the refills only when I need them and have never been overcharged or erroneously charged for something that wasn&#x27;t shipped. In the beginning, trying to get simple questions answered was a bit of a challenge, but recently when an item I did not order was shipped in error, they couldn&#x27;t do enough to make things right.  I suspect they are attempting to do a better job with handling complaints.  Anyway, I wanted to cast a bit of a bright light on the products by sharing my experience.  And to those who were disappointed and had problems, you were right to stop your orders, but to suggest that everyone could expect the same experience wasn&#x27;t entirely fair or even accurate.</li>
    <li> The product is okay I find it that it works better at night than in the day, you cannot put make up over it regardless if it dries.  Chalky and foundation separates by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. What more can I say. Your request for so many words is annoying though. You should let people express how they like not how you like.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE RESULTS OF CINDY CRAWFORDS GLOWING SERUM. This item is a must TRY.......AN ABSOLUTELY MIRICLE WORKER OON MY SKIN. ANY RACE /ETNIC GROUP WILL BE AMAZED.  Oh!  ANOTHER&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;MUST TRY\\&quot; IS THE CAPSULES!!! AMAZING !&lt;br /&gt;I OWNTHE COMPLETE SYSTEM OFFERED BY MEANINGFUL BEAUTY!!! JUST ORDER MORE GLOWING SERUM!!!!! USE IT AS A TOUCH UP OR REFRESHER DURING OTHER TIMES OF MY DAY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product...my skin is amazing after using it!  lIke the prices on Amazon better than actualy website!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of infomercials or their products but what woman would not like to have Cindy&#x27;s complexion? Anyone out there disagree? I did my research and found a lot of negative reviews and claims of this being a \\&quot;scam\\&quot;. I gave the product line a try and I really love it! The only negative comment would be that the products contain to much fragrance. Other than that, I am headed back online to purchase more of this skin care line. Like all products, some work well for some and for others the results can vary. I am 42 - look 30 - and have very dry skin. My skin is glowing and radiant using this product line. Good luck - I hope it works as well for you!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my order. I received it on time and packing was good. Shipment was accurate and product was sealed new</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE SERUM...I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 4 MONTHS NOW AND I ALWAYS HAVE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GLOW. I LOVE IT, HOPEFULLY \\&quot;U WILL 2\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I like this product alot because I can wear on days I do not want to apply any make-up, I like the hint smell of melon and the glowing look I get on my bare face. I have a small sting when applied after facial wash but I have not notice any side affects to my skin. I do not use Glowing Serum at night&lt;br /&gt;only in the day with my favorite lipstick and I am out the door!</li>
    <li> I watched this informercial while folding laundry and paying about 30 percent attention.......walking in and out of the room. Havent ordered it. BUT am SHOCKED at everyone saying its a scam and the accusations of fraud. As I said, I paid about 30 percent attention, and EVEN THEN heard them say they automatically send you the kit every month unless you cancel. I HEARD it. NOT even read it, but HEARD them say it. And saw the fine print. It even talked about guaranteeing a locked in price for future shipments. I have ordered from WEN and other TV products. If it is a monthly supply they ALWAYS auto ship and ONLY give you the option to cancel the auto ship within the first 30 days.  I also find it hard to believe they don&#x27;t explian that on the calls. If I heard it by only half listening, then I must believe these comments are made by angry consumers who did NOT pay attention to the fine print, or lsiten to everything someone says. I am guilty at times of this too. But for people who are interested in buying this product, DO NOT believe this. They clearly state it on their commercial. As always when you give someone your card information, you should request information in writing and ask questions. Don&#x27;t wait for hourly employees to give you all the information. Be proactive to protect yourself. This will also save you some anger and time!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about ordering this product since Valerie Bertinelli is an actress and of course she is making money by endorsing this product. I also think the infomercial is ridiculous, especially when the Dr says the product contains a \\&quot;special melon extract\\&quot; that doesn&#x27;t appear to have a proper name. The infomercial has gimmick written all over it! So why did I decide to give it a try this product, even after reading negative reviews? Because a lot of reviewers said if you were to choose just one item from the skin care line, the glowing serum was worth buying AND I just turned 43 and have become a nut about taking care of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference right away. When I use it, my skin looks radiant! I highly recommend this product and will be re-ordering it when I start to run low. I hope I can purchase it off Amazon again as I am not a fan of Guthy-Renker and hate being bullied into buying something regularly. The Amazon transaction was very smooth and I was able to order it and receive it with my Prime account the next day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since march. My skin has always been dry and nothing seemed to work. I was skeptical when my mom gave me a bag of meaningful beauty. I used to tell my mom it was meaningless beauty :P, because I thought it was a scam. I may be 19 but the anti aging cream is the only cream that makes my face not dry! Def a big fan. Not every product works for everyone, so don&#x27;t go off of anyone&#x27;s reviews. Just try it for yourself. Different strokes for different folks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for seven years. I like all the items in my kit(s) except for the wrinkle smoothing capsules. The capsules could be smaller because the product inside is quite heavy on the skin. I mix it with the firming cream to change the texture. I have many people ask if I am my husband&#x27;s daughter. The glowing serum is wonderful. I wish the serum came in a giant bottle so I could use it everywhere! The serum is light and refreshing. The cleanser is gentle enough not to break out my sensitive, prone-to-redness-irish skin but removes makeup well. The day and night creams are similar. The eye lifter is also a light product. I still use Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste Rash Protector Spray as my make up primer. I disagree that any of the products help mineral makeups glide on smoothly. You need Dimethicone to accomplish a smooth finish. ANYWAY- I don&#x27;t have a dramatic before and after story because I&#x27;ve been using the product since I was 23. I have not noticed any change. I started young because the women in my family age rather quickly.  I am guilty of not using all the products constantly other than the day cream. I try to use them three times a week (as my five children allow). I should have a huge wrinkle in the middle of my forehead due to genetics and the what in the world mom look I wear without end BUT I DONT HAVE ONE! I buy this for my mother-in-law also. She takes most of my wrinkle caps but I&#x27;m sure as time progresses I will keep them for myself :))</li>
    <li> The product was good. The product container was deceiving. An inside compartment which contains product isn&#x27;t half the length of outside dimensions.  Given that, it&#x27;s not really worth the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This product is no different than any other that you can get except that they package in in bottles which have false bottoms that make it appear that you are getting far more of the product than you are. Oil of Olay is still the only product with Scientific research behind it and it&#x27;s far less expensive.</li>
    <li> I ordered the intro set. I tried several of the products. They are greasy and the smell is not pleasant. when I went to return it, i got a bit of a runaround. The return form requires item numbers..which are NOT listed on the shipping materials. I had to talk to a second person to help me fill that form out...and I am pretty savvy. I think many people would just keep it so they don&#x27;t have to deal with the red tape</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother getting Meaningful beauty-the products themselves are over priced and dried out my skin with out making any difference whatsoever....but the way it is sold through Guthrie Renker is a HUGE scam and a real pain when you want to cancel...I love to try new products and there are soooo many others cheaper or more expensive but that actually work at making your skin look better. Cleanser is terrible, day cream is absolutely nothing special, day glo same thing, eye cream-not good, melon cream seems ok...certainly much more expensive then you are led to believe. $150 for a 3 month supply-they send one box and then charge 69.95 the first month and then 39.95 the 2 consecutive months...SOOOO NOT worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> Meaningful Beauty is a subscription service - but once you cancel they continue to charge your account for up to 6 weeks even AFTER you have cancelled the subscription.  BE FOREWARNED!  This is not a subscription service you want to get caught up in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called to complain that they were continuing to charge me 5 weeks after cancelling the subscription, I was told they were \\&quot;so sorry\\&quot; but that&#x27;s the way it is.  At this point they have over $100.00 of mine and I have NO products for the money.&lt;br /&gt;Must be nice that they can get INTEREST FREE LOANS from the public while they HORDE our money!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say it works.  i didn&#x27;t really like it nor did I see any obvious change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for about 2 weeks and couldn&#x27;t tell if it did anything.  May be it is not for my skin type.</li>
    <li> First, they send you this way too often for any normal human being. If you try to work out issues or cancel online, you will be sent in circles.&lt;br /&gt;Calling customer service is a joke. They try to circularly argue why they are charging your bank account MORE THAN what your bill reads! And here&#x27;s the catch that I, that reads all the fine print, STILL don&#x27;t get. After the first 30 day supply at 39.99$ the next is a 90 day supply that you are stuck paying for for three months! So even after you call to cancel because they are charging you more than their \\&quot;this is not a bill\\&quot; says they charged you for the product plus 5.99$ shipping and handling, you are still STUCK paying 2 more months for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service tries to make you feel stupid. I explained I wanted to cancel because I was upset that my bill says 39.95$+5.99 shipping&#x3D; 45.94$ but my bank card was charged $48.94. He TRIED to convince me that because the 90day shipment was larger there was more shipping. Then why was that NOT reflected in their \\&quot;this is not a bill\\&quot; statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole system is completely bogus and false advertising. DO NOT get yourself stuck in this system!</li>
    <li> Meaningful Beauty is absolutely the worst business I have ever encountered. I returned the product in the spring of 2012 as I didn&#x27;t like it, and they have continued to try and collect $79.90 for two years!  I have written, I have called, I have tried every avenue possible aside from contacting an attorney to resolve the matter. They turned it over to a collection agency who sent me letter after letter, which I continually responded to with the statement that I had returned the merchandise despite the fact they charged my credit card.  I am now receiving letters from a second agency the first one sold it to - it is now two years later, for the same $79.90! I am once again writing to this new agency the same letter as all the others stating I do not owe the money.  What a huge disappointment in Cindy Crawford as not only a representative of a product, but as a business person.  I now see her as a total fraud, someone who pushes a questionable product with a business practice that is beyond reproach. I am reporting her to the Better Business Bureau and turning the matter over to an attorney. I can&#x27;t help but wonder, especially after reading so many of the complaints posted, how often she plays this game with people who actually pay for things they&#x27;ve returned, or better yet never received or didn&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great product. But if it&#x27;s such a great product and keeps you looking so young then why does Cindy Crawford feel the need to use BOTOX.  Seems like she and Valerie Bertineli are misleading everyone to believe that it&#x27;s this product that makes her look so young!  Use it if you want but don&#x27;t expect the same results unless you add Botox to the mix.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff. it&#x27;s the best serum ive ever come across. it gives your face a natural, warm glow. out of all of her products, i prefer the serum</li>
    <li> This product is a joke. It&#x27;s expensive and does crap for you. I tried it for 3 month and saw absolutely no difference on my skin.</li>
    <li> This product does not work and it smells awful! Not worth the money or time!! Really think before you purchase this!</li>
    <li> For the price, you are getting good quality rich, emolient products.  I have aging skin and the glowing serum softens lines and keeps my skin looking moist.  As with most of the Meaningful Beauty products, I especially love using the night cream, the creme de serum (looks like a dreamsicle swirl) and the glowing serum.  She has a close relationship with Dr. Sebagh, a renowned cosmetic doctor.  I don&#x27;t think Cindy and his collaboration would create shoddy products.  He sells his own formulations on his site at a much higher price point.  Worth a try.  I&#x27;m still a customer after 4 years.</li>
    <li> These products work no better than other products. They are not upfront with the total cost. Yes, you get a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; with your FIRST credit card charge. But understand, YOU WILL BE BILLED TWO ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS OF $49.95! Automatic shipments. Even when I called and CANCELLED after the first shipment because it did not provide the results it claims.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a scam!</li>
    <li> Used it then did without and noticed the difference, which is subtle.  Just seems to makes the face look better.</li>
    <li> Please like and share yer scams here to help other not to fall for the same scam!!! XXXX&lt;br /&gt;SCAM PRODUCTS!!!!!!! PLEASE ADD YOUR SCAM TO PAGE!!! costing the public millions everyday!!!!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;not all products work as well as seen on tv, choose wisely\\&quot; go to FACEBOOK you&#x27;ll find it under  SCAM products</li>
    <li> I had an allergy to the ingredients, called within 30 days of receiving.  They informed me they would send out labels to me to return.  Also stated they would be auto charging me 3 full payments for the next 90 days supply that was on its way.  They told me once I received my products, just return with labels and I would be fully reimbursed.  That was not the case.  I was still being charged by 3rd installment (January 31st transaction date), I sent back all products the first week of February.  No reimbursement for the initial charge, nor the 90 day (3 installments).  I called - they informed me that they would reimburse the 90 days since I did return within 60 days of purchase but refused to reimburse the original fee since I did not return in first 60 days even though I was still continuing to be charged.  Now I have returned all products, and they received payment, and I&#x27;m the one holding the bag.  Very poor customer service.  Customer service reps need more training.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second month, just got my 3 month supply. I am a person who never washed there face with anything but water because everytime I tried something my face broke out our it dried out. These products have been great.. My skin is so soft now and I wash it twice a day. My husband has noticed a difference in my face and I am 45. I really like the product and they have been very helpful to me everytime I have called.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Cindy Crawford. I have been doing her fitness videos for years now. So it was with quite a lot of enthusiasm that I waited for my shipment of the Meaningful beauty products to arrive. It may work for some, but for me it was a disaster. The glowing serum was the worst of it because it made by skin red, dry and irritated. I also had patches of dry circles on my face.  I stopped using the product, and my skin turned back to normal in a few days.</li>
    <li> i live in japan...and i thought it will take forever just to get it....but it was very fast....i really recomended it!! ;)</li>
    <li> I broke out in a rash that looked sort of looked like pimples after a few days of using the intro kit. Tonight, a month later, the marks are still there, almost in scar-like form. I am heading to the dermatologist in a couple of days to try and resolve the problem. In addition, I got another shipment without asking for it and was charged. The only good thing I can say is that customer service was really good; within thirty- six hours, my account was credited. Now having read reviews online, a rash seems to be common. I don&#x27;t  have particularly sensitive skin and have never had a problem with products. I will sample items before purchasing anything in the future.</li>
    <li> So, I was lucky enough to purchase from Ulta. I really like the product and was considering buying from the manufacturer. After reading the horrific reviews, I will continue to purchase from Ulta. Thanks all for keeping me from ordering from the website!</li>
    <li> I have always liked this product and have bought it 3 times.  My skin has a few dry areas that nothing seems to penetrate to help.  This is suppose to help your skin glow.  This is not why I re-purchased it.  I re-purchased it because it is the best moisturizer I have used in a long time!  If you have any dry patches it will take care of it!  Makes your makeup go on so smooth.</li>
    <li> I tried the Meaningful beauty line and in my opinion it&#x27;s garbage. It did NOTHING for my skin. Cindy Crawford should be ashamed of herself for scamming customers on these useless products.</li>
    <li> ANYthing to do with these Meanignful Beauty products and company is crooked, sneaky and the whole crew should put put out of business.  They use an incredibly sneaky bait &amp; hook approach to ensnare customers, and are abusive on phone when you try ti deal with them.  They racked up over $200 on my credit card, charging different amounts each month.  My credit card company came to my aid when I reported all this nonsense, and I learned that there&#x27;s no point in just trying to block their charges, as the company will just bill you under another company name that your card doesn&#x27;t recognize.  The only recourse is to cancel your card and get a new one.  My credit card company is taking this issue to dispute.  Cindy Crawford, the doctor, and the actresses giving testimonials are shameful to be involved in doing this to people.</li>
    <li> This review is not about the product but of their deceptive practice of over billing. I ordered the vitamins and was told they would be 15.95 and so far I have been charged 32.95 three times for one bottle. They claim that this was an installment purchase. Close to 100 dollars for a bottle of vitamins that I can get from one a day for far less? I hate auto ship type products but my husband wanted to buy this for me as a gift so I feel bad about not using. As for the product...not impressed. Save yourself a lot of headaches.</li>
    <li> It is time for Cindy Crawford and all her customers and potential customers to read all of the complaints on numerous web sites about her business practices.  Thousands of people are innocently purchasing a trial order of Cindy&#x27;s products to only be harassed month after month (and some for years) for product they have not ordered.  Even when the unwanted product is returned and credit card companies have successfully closed disputes with Cindy&#x27;s marketing company Guthy-Renker, customers are still being harassed for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have an e-mail from the Guthy-Renker company stating that my account was closed per my request and that all charges were deleted back in November 2013 and I have a letter from my credit card company stating that my dispute for the false charges has been settled successfully,  I have just received a \\&quot;Statement\\&quot; from Guthy-Renker that my account is delinquent and that I have not responded to multiple bills.  My story pales in comparison to many other more serious stories of harassment by Guthy-Renker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy, what is it going to take to stop this mess?</li>
    <li> I agree with the other posts that signing up for the monthly plan is a waste and you end up getting cheated. They sent me products I didn&#x27;t order and different sizes than I ordered. They promptly refunded my money, canceling wasn&#x27;t too hard, but they never refunded shipping even though they sent me products I didn&#x27;t order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product was a shinning star in the midst of an otherwise mediocre skin care line. I have combination, acne prone skin so acne moisturizers that are strong enough to work, dry out my skin. I put a tiny amount of this product in with my acne moisturizer and my skin is no longer dry and, unlike other moisturizers, it isn&#x27;t so heavy that it causes breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this particular product, but not on the manufacturer&#x27;s auto-replenish. It&#x27;s not worth the full price, but with searching it can usually be found for a reasonable amount.</li>
    <li> I ordered this direct from their website and I ordered the $39.95 \\&quot;trial\\&quot; batch.  I did not realize, however, that all of the products are miniature sized, i.e., they&#x27;re a full 1/2 less than any of the regular, full-size products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I was automatically signed up for another shipment every 90 days.  Now, how would I know I even WANT to keep going with the stuff when I don&#x27;t have enough to fully try it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok but I think you can purchase stuff just as good locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cancelled any further shipments and will not shop with Cindy Crawford or this company again.  Beware the deceiving advertising/\\&quot;offer.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> In the infomercial, the special french melon that the extract comes from looks exactly like a canteloupe, so I figured what the heck, I will cut a canteloupe in half and smear some of the insides on my face and neck as a face mask. I also mixed a little olive oil in with it and a tablespoon of greek yogurt to make the consistency more likely to not just drip off my face. I have to say, I am very pleased with the results so far - and it was made with natural ingredients from my refrigerator, no preservatives or nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> I found that the customer service people have very negative attitudes when you try to order extra products on the phone. This one refused to send the free gift offered in the catalog. I called a supervisor who was very aggressive and instead of letting speak my concern over the rude treatment she stated &amp;#34;we are going to ignore whats in the catalog&amp;#34; She was going to charge $25 an item for each item in the gift set (samples that sell altogether for $29). Pay for a free gift!!!!! Its not worth  buying this product to deal with malicious, rude, downright hateful people!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works ok, but to expensive and it does not last very long for the price</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product out of this line. It does wonders for the look and feel of my skin</li>
    <li> I received 2nd pkg a couple of weeks after the first batch even after asking them to not send for 90 days, then they sent me more and charged me even though I told them to cancel!  They just keep sending and charging!!  BEWARE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the commercials, ads all of that bogus stuff from Meaningful Beauty. They are merely a bunch of thieves. DO NOT SHOP FROM THEM!!!!This is what I wrote to them never got a response! I have been billed for this product at least 4 times and have only received 1 time. I called my bank and changing my account # also had my bank investigate you, I was lucky to get all of my money returned and back in my account within a week of filing a dispute because my bank did a great job investigating this!!!! I cancelled this product but have been charged a couple times a month since. I still have all transactions from my online banking of where meaningful beauty has taken money out of my account without my permission even after cancelling and has not sent me any product after stealing money from my account. Make sure you keep a record of all transactions, phone calls you made to this fake company and write a dispute letter to file with your bank. I stated that their unauthorized withdrawals from my account were causing problems with my other bills and causing financial hardship This is the most horrible business I have ever dealt with!!! the company has been stealing over $80 a month from my account!!! BEWARE!!! When you go through all of this pain, does it really matter if the product works or not, stick to natural stuff: honey, almond, avocado oils and grated potato, glycerine and cucumber puree masks for thirty minutes :) Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> Meaningful Beauty - this company is morally bankrupt. Wouldn&#x27;t want my name associated with such. I give the 0 star rating.</li>
    <li> Ladies do not get fooled into buying Meaningful beauty products in the first place.  Do spread the word that what you are buying into is $150/90 days for a mediocre skincare product.  For me it was too drying on my skin(and I started out with very oily skin all my life)so I cancelled the membership within 10 days.  They failed to cancel my membership, nor did they tell me when I cancelled that I would be charged $150 if I did not return the product in 60 days, and got second shipment to my surprise.  Surprise surprise - you bought , not $47 for the products but $150!  Since I did not bother to return for $47 refund now I am out $150 for something I never used. They deceive people to make money.  Sad business but I will never buy anything from them and or anything Cindy Crawford endorses again. From reading other reviews I gather I am not the first sucker who got bitten.  I am not proud of it.</li>
    <li> i lovethis poduct it just lights my face up !!! Its a must have !! Cant go wrong with this !!!</li>
    <li> If you end up going through their website later and you want to cancel the automatic delivery, be careful that they don&#x27;t try to sell you on postponing and being charged 2 months later out of no where, and having to return everything before being refunded. Make sure you are very clear about wanting to cancel, completely. It seems like just a bunch of salesmen behind this scheme.</li>
    <li> *Upon ordering this product, I was told that my monthly payment of $52.64 (including shipping) would get me the bop of the line package of Meaningful Beauty. Took forever to actually get it.&lt;br /&gt;*Once I opened the product I was surprised at how small the bottles and tubes were. You only get @ 10 of the little &#x27;anti-wrinkle&#x27; campsules they show Cindy Crawford gushing over on the commercial. THEN I noticed it tells you to use the &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; night cream, but it&#x27;s NOT THERE! Isn&#x27;t that why we ordered this product in the first place???&lt;br /&gt;*I called &#x27;customer service&#x27; to ask about the products that aren&#x27;t included and was told by a young man that the night cream was an additional $42.95 each time I would order it (on top of the monthly package price) and the capsules are an additional $49.95 for a 60-day supply! When i told him I thought that was false advertising, he had no idea how to respond and just kept telling me how much extra the products I really wanted were (...after long pauses. I don&#x27;t know how a 20-something boy is going to understand the consumer needs of a 48-year-old woman).&lt;br /&gt;*After thinking about the conversation and lack of products, I called back to inquire about cancelling my shipments and was connected with a different 20-something year old boy. He couldn&#x27;t have cared less about the situation. I was told they already sent out my next shipment and the next payment would be posting to my bank account that day. Waited, waited, waited. Two weeks later, no payment out of my account and no shipment. Called AGAIN and was told the shipment was never sent -- that they had put it on hold.&lt;br /&gt;SHEESH! I&#x27;m going to have a consult with a local plastic surgeon on their own skin care line which is half the price of Meaningful Beauty, and see how that goes. I&#x27;m just really disappointed! Since Cindy Crawford has Dr Sebagh at her disposal, she probably doesn&#x27;t know how terrible the customer service is with her own product line. Too bad. Your money is best spent elsewhere. (and \\&quot;Boo!\\&quot; to Valerie Bertinelli for being a sell-out. Wonder how much she got paid to host the infomercial? These celebrities do a lot more to look young than use Meaningful Beauty, I can assure you.)</li>
    <li> I was really surprised to see such negative reviews. After watching the infomercial a hundred times and not being convinced- I decided to ask a salesman about the product at my local Sephora. They sell tons of products at Sephora, and if they&#x27;re on commission there are certainly a lot more expensive products than Meaningful Beauty. But he said if you&#x27;re looking for moisture- this is a great product. My skin feels dewy- (which I like). I literally feel like I&#x27;ve had a facial each time I use it. The one negative- if you&#x27;re prone to dark marks or blemishes which I am- you have to order a separate product that does not come with the initial kit.</li>
    <li> I really love the meaningful beauty products.  Makes my skin soft.  I don&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference in firmness, but overall very happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that people that put reviews here would stick to reviewing the PRODUCTS, and not the website that has NOTHING to do with ordering on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a complaint with Guthy-Renker and their customer service take it there, not here.&lt;br /&gt;I want to know if the products work, have fragrance etc, not all your troubles with a company that has nothing to do with how well the product works or doesn&#x27;t work, those reviews are not helpful at all.</li>
    <li> This company takes money out of your account and does not send product. When on the phone with them, I said they were crooked and they hung up on me.</li>
    <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!! This product should be called meaningless beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  I found this out after waiting 10 days for my shipment and received nothing... not an email or even a phone call.  So I called them.  They said it was on back order but would be delivered in 5 days.  Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  Also something to remember if you buy the product from their site they automatically set you up for monthly shipments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the products immediately.  The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample.. so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  I used the product as directed on my neck and my neck broke out too. My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  It was so painful. I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I took pictures just incase they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called them, explained what happened and they refunded the purchase price, but not the shipping.  The refund was tedious... i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product... don&#x27;t they already have this information?  They told me to hold onto the product for a month incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post pictures of howbad this product was for me.</li>
    <li> I saw on the internet where this whole line is listed on the worst skin care list.&lt;br /&gt;Draw your own conclusions. I used this before seeing that list and returned it.</li>
    <li> My wife wears this beauty serum and we made some before and after photos for ourselves and the product really works. Being the jokester that I am added both to her laptop on the screen saver that pops up after 20 minutes and she isn&#x27;t computer savvy enough to make it stop. hahahahaha.</li>
    <li> 1. Product. Made skin worse&lt;br /&gt;2. Did not signup for Autoship&lt;br /&gt;3. Nightmare trying to cancel Autoship&lt;br /&gt;4. My next step is to report this company to Ripoff Reports.Com</li>
    <li> I love this product and all the other ones from the Cindy Crawford skin care line ...&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the results</li>
    <li> I just love, love, love the Night Cream.  I&#x27;m in my 50s and have been using Meaningful Beauty skincare for about 3 years now.  Everyone thinks I look 10 years younger.  Regular use of the masks, toner, creme de serum all help to smooth out lines, and make my aging face look radiant and glowing.  Consistency is the key.  Nothing works if you only do it once or twice a week.  In the a.m., I use a facial scrub in the shower, followed by Cindy&#x27;s toner, eye firming cream, than the daytime moisturizer.  At night, I cleanse again and replenish with the rich, luscious night cream and creme de serum.  My skin just drinks it up!  I hear a new and improved formula for the entire line is set to be released later this year which should help some see results even faster.  I&#x27;m a loyal MB user.  [...]</li>
    <li> This product is a joke, do yourself a favor and get over the curiosity of the product and the low price. Cindy is in this to make money and she doesn&#x27;t care any more about your skin than her next door neighbor. I have several friends who are aestheticians and they all urged me not to us the product because of the poor ingredients and the lack of any essential skin care ingredient. I asked after i started using it because my skin looked worse after using it (dry, wrinkles more noticeable, tough).  Then I tried to cancel the delivery of this obnoxious scam and they want me to pay for future deliveries, won&#x27;t refund the charges for product I have yet to receive and won&#x27;t cancel the future orders until I pay for them, but I don&#x27;t want the product!! I&#x27;ve filed a complaint with the better business beauro and called my cc to prevent any further approval of charges and the refund of the charges I haven&#x27;t receive product for and was I satisfied with. Save yourself the headache and buy a product that can be trusted that will provide results. Lesson learned. I should&#x27;ve known better. There is no great skin line</li>
    <li> This product is not good and its really a 40 day supply you would have to use dab to cover your whole face for 90 days.  I have never had out breaks and suddenly I had them bad until I stopped using it.  What ever you do don&#x27;t order from the company they took 2x&#x27;s amount out of my account and made me pay to ship back the original to give me the money back. The facial wash wouldn&#x27;t even take the make up off my face.  This is a bad product all around!</li>
    <li> Go to Google and type meaningful beauty and ripoff. Read the complaints of the victims of this terrible company that steals money from your account without your authorization. As for the product, according to many, its not good. Keep in mind that good reviews are often faked. Especially when dealing with a disreputable company. Don&#x27;t support them. It&#x27;s not worth it. Glad I looked them up before I called in for one of their specials.</li>
    <li> The products might work but the company is a fruad.  Worst customer service ever.  Thier billing and auto-enrollment is set up to trick you and steal your money.  That makes me think their product is a scam as well.  They should be able to rely on a good product to drum up sales and not fruadulent bill collection.</li>
    <li> Do not buy Meaningful Beauty unless you want to cancel your credit card.&lt;br /&gt;This company is run by a pack of scammers, once they have your card number they will charge it until you cancel it.&lt;br /&gt;I knew that this company might do this after reading reviews online so I watched my card and sure enough a month later after my ONLY purchase... I get a package at my doorstep.. what&#x27;s this? I didn&#x27;t order anything.. ah! Cindy Crawford and her melon head Dr. Saba.. must be charging my credit card and ordering me stuff on my behalf.  Apparently that one item i did order wasn&#x27;t enough for them.&lt;br /&gt;On the package it read &amp;#34;Your Bonus gifts valued at $45 dollars are inside!  Bonus&#x27;s are free... while I received a fraudulent charge on my credit card for  nearly $60 dollars from Miz Crawford for her &amp;#34;Bonus&amp;#34; gifts.  Now my card is canceled and they&#x27;re going to have to deal with a payment dispute from my card company.  Vanity pays a high price... but Cindy was hoping you wouldn&#x27;t know how high the price was until she fraudulently charged your credit card a hundred times .</li>
    <li> I am glad to find this serum on here. I have used it and was set up with a monthly plan with meaningful beauty. Never purchased form amazon though. This will be the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying this is an amazing serum. I only used it on a clean face before make up. Which I believe is what the directions say to do. This serum leaves you face so smooth and dewy. Every time I wore it under my makeup I was complimented.  People would come up close to my face and say your skin looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised to see so many bad reviews... It looks like the reviews are upset customers that signed up for the product and didn&#x27;t know what they were getting into. I did have a few shipping problems with them but found their customer service to be accommodating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said I will order this serum and probably the face wash.  They were the two products I loved when I was receiving a three month supply. My personal experience was great with meaningful beauty and I do recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> PLEASE, PLEASE listen to what I am telling you.  I bought this product then when online within 24 hours to cancel it and they kept telling me they could not find me in their system, even though I received an e-mail confirmation and a confirmation #.  After countless, countless phonecalls and B.S., I ended up cancelling my credit card so they could not charge to it, but they just waited a month until I got a new # and put it to that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I SENT the product back \\&quot;REFUSED.\\&quot;  I never even opened it or looked @ it because of all the stuff I had read online about them.  These are the same people who do Pro Active and the guy that does the hair stuff - Wen or whatever it&#x27;s called.  Everything I read was how they could never get the charges to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, 6 months ago (September 2012)my credit card company issued a credit and the case was closed.  Meaningful Beauty, according to my c.c. company had 60 days to prove their case, but they did not and could not and I was issued my credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I opened my mail and they have sent me to a collection agency in N.Y., which is really probably them demanding that I pay them the full amount of something I NEVER got and what was closed 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!!!  DO NOT deal with these people.  They are corrupt and evil and will do anything to con you out of your $$$$.  You are just going to cause yourself a WORLD of trouble and conflict and hassle and, now, harassment!!</li>
    <li> This company is deceptive in their advertising and selling. I ordered this after seeing an infomercial and I was led to believe that I would get the kit for $39.00 and change. I received the kit and was billed for 3 consecutive months of that amount! I figured it was on me for not understanding their scam. So be it. Then4months after that initial call, I receive another kit and was billed for $149.00 and change. What? I have never seen anything like this! I immediately called the service rep and explained that I did not request nor want any more of this product.  I told the rep that I am immediately send this back, he was kind and provided to me the information on where to send it. I did try the product, for me the far less expensive drug store products are better. I am just baffled that this can go on in the business world and very dissapointed that Cindy Crawford would put her name on this and deceive the public!</li>
    <li> My wife has battled achne for a little over a year now. It started clearing up so i thought this product would help her even more. Suddenly it made things even worse. She stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BIGGER ISSUE....I ordered it online for like $40 and somewhere it was hidden that i was signing up for monthly products. I found reviews that talk about similar issues. I will post those on the bottom. I called and talked to a supervisor, after a support agent said she wouldnt give me my money back, and she told me that i was going to have my money back in 2 business days. Guess what happened next? Yup no money back. I called and freaked out and the agent said it was going to be 5 days. I tried to explain to her that my account changed and that i would not get it back. She was an idiot and nothing was resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> A nice touch to highlight my cheeks with a slight glow.It just makes me feel &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; knowing that I have added something to brighten my cheeks.Only use it for special occasions or when I just want a change in skin tone.</li>
    <li> Olay was much better and cheaper</li>
    <li> This is a good product for clear dry skin. MY forehead wrinkles are not going anywhere but my this product gave a nice sheen to my skin..evens the tone of my skin and helps eliminate pours.  Buy I dont have probems other than dryness. Good product.  Stupid name</li>
    <li> I use this product with my regular skin are for a softening of lines and wrinkles. It also gives a dewy feeling to the skin</li>
    <li> I started itching like crazy and had a rash on my neck and face.  I didn&#x27;t know what caused it at the time.  I went to my dermatologist and she diagnosed the rash on my neck as dermatitis and gave me medicine to put on it.  She felt the stuff on my face was a pre cancerous condition that she would treat in the office.  We made an appointment to do this.  I stopped using the meaningful beauty product and presto, all the rash went away.  I was able to cancel the treatment for my face.  A waste of money.  By the time I realized what was happening it was too late to return the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these products a week ago and they arrived as promised. They seem to be fine, but nothing I would buy again. EXCEPT that, through dishonest sales, (and if I didn&#x27;t read the VERY fine print hidden deep within my order&#x27;s invoice) they signed me up to buy their products every 30 days! Without my permission. This is fraud.&lt;br /&gt;If the product is as good as the company claims, why do they need to deceive people into buying it?</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING MEANINGFULL BEAUTY FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS NOW.  MY SKIN LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  I GET MY PRODUCTS ON TIME WITH NO HASSLE.  YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SKIN TO HAVE GOOD SKIN.  IF YOU DON&#x27;T DRINK WATER GOOD LUCK TO YOU.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I&#x27;m in my sixties, with pretty good skin, but it does make my skin soft, and gives it some &amp;#34;life&amp;#34;.  I do use a waterbased makeup over it, and my skin looks good all day.</li>
    <li> WELL!!!!!  I got sucked in again!!!!!  I dont know how they do it but they do!!!!!!  First of all you \\&quot;think\\&quot; your ordering products for 40 bucks, then they try to talk you into all kinds of other stuff.  I finally completed the order and authorized a charge of $35.00.  I cancelled the membership about a week later so I didnt start getting monthly charges.  I wanted to try this product without worry about getting more charges.  The next month guess what!!!  I get charged AGAIN!!  Now they say I didnt oderer the 40.00 offer they advertise, they say I ordered a 3 month supply and its going to cost me $$150.00!!!!  WOW, funny cuz no one EVER said anything about this stuff coating me $150.00!!!!!  I&#x27;ve ordered merchandise from this Guthy Ranker, or what ever the name is and have regretted it EVERY time!!  THis is no exception!!  Secondly the product isnt even worth the 40 bucks I thought I was spending.  It leaves your face feeling very dry. I would not have ordered it again anyway So... save yourself the money and hassle, DONT DO IT!!!!  RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T GO FOR THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL OPEN AN ACCOUNT AND WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE SHIPPED. THESE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE, BOGUS,  AND DON&#x27;T WORK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I KEPT ON RECEIVING THESE PRODUCTS AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SO BAD, ALL THEY HAVE TO SAY IS SORRY WE CANT TAKE IT BACK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DONT WASTE UR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS</li>
    <li> I am completely disappointed with this product. It did nothing for me. As a matter a fact I believe it had a reverse affect. THe dark circles under my eyes bacame darker, the puffiness did not go away. The fine lines did not diminish either. I tried the product for 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am not at all sensitive to creams or serums. But, the smell of this product makes me feel like an over perfumed granny. It also makes me skin dry and red. I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews. There are a million better products out there!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Valerie Bertinelli and was a believer until her endorsement of this product (and her last book). I ordered the introductory set which I knew would come in smaller sized bottles but I was stunned to find that the bottles were micro mini AND had false bottoms that only filled half. I recieved literally drops of this product for over $50.00. A lukewarm product at an insane price. I am so disappointed. Cindy and Valerie can kiss my A_ _</li>
    <li> Cindy Crawford and her over the hill shills pitch the product.  It is a scam.  You will get better skin care results from using natural products grown in the backyard.  The FDA has to start controlling the otc products sold on infomercials to protect the public from profit motive scams</li>
    <li> Cindy&#x27;s face is more likely a product of neurotoxins (Botox, Dysport and the like) and fillers (Juvederm, Sculptra, etc), lasers, and peels-not from these superficial products she peddles.  There are no miracles in a tube.  Celebrities undergo many procedures, brow lifts, neck lifts, and face lifts but the aging face can initially be helped with fillers and neurotoxins before undergoing a surgery.  Unfortunately, most of the procedures cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.  See a dermatologist (initial consultations are usually free).  I&#x27;d recommend three consults with three board-certified dermatologists (ones that specialize cosmetic procedures). Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this stuff but do invest in some good sun screen, some Retin A, and skip the tanning beds.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ver read the other reviews and thoroughly agree, the product isn&#x27;t any better than what your can purchase in your local Walmart.  The fraudulent charges being made to people&#x27;s credit card, including mine is unbelievable, I had to close the account I made the purchase with to stop the charges.  CONSUMERS BEWARE!!!!</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. They sign you up to receive an endless supply of overpriced  garbage, like $130.00 vitamins that you never wanted but they keep sending you anyway, and they refuse to take back and refuse to stop charging your credit card. They said they&#x27;d send several return RMAs but they said several times to \\&quot;look carefully, because they look like junk mail.\\&quot; which is clearly a warning that it&#x27;s some kind of trick for them to not send it and insist that you must not have seen it. I didn&#x27;t see them send anything, and yet there are new charges on my card. They&#x27;re response is, show me an affidavit. And if you stop payment on your card they will send it to collections and destroy your credit for not paying. These people are flagrant criminals and they&#x27;ve been sued for fraud. The product causes acne and rashes anyway. Please warn all your friends and put this meaningful beauty scam out of business.</li>
    <li> I ordered Meaningful Beauty from their online site.  The products themselves are fine... not great and for what they cost, not worth it.  The problem is they rope you into their scam where you are signed up to get first a small supply, then a 90-day supply, then more.... continuously charging your credit card much more than you agreed to pay.  Once you cancel, it still takes a while to get them to stop charging your account.&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to try this, be sure to ask what is the overall price.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve now used Meaningful Beauty for a year.  I don&#x27;t break out from the products.  The Glowing Serum is neither glowing or a serum. It is a pink lotion.  They send it to you if you get the products automatically sent to you.&lt;br /&gt;I look no better if I use it than if I don&#x27;t.  What a waste!</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Way better products are out there.</li>
    <li> So, this morning while I was getting ready for work I watched the Infomercial on Meaningful Beauty and I was amazed at everything and was really excited to order it! I&#x27;m 26 but I&#x27;ve been looking to start using something now figuring it would be easier to help prevent it then try to get rid of it later. I fell in love with the Infomercial and went online to order it. I never order off of TV and I hardly ever order offline. I don&#x27;t know why but something told me to check out some reviews and/or reports on it first, and thank god I did! I can&#x27;t tell you ladies how happy I am I stumbled onto here before buying this! I have dealt with crap and scams a couple of times before and it is just a joke. Thanks for taking the time to post a review...you saved at least one person a lot of money, time, and frustration! On another note...if any of you found a product that does keep you looking youthful and definitely something for dark circles (I work 75 hours a week...and my eyes show it!) please let me know:)</li>
    <li> For any folks tempted by Meaningful Beauty - beware. This is an autoship scam.  Accepting a trial kit is an automatic enrollment in monthly delivery and billing. Easy to get the product and have your credit card debited. Difficult to return. If you also try the \\&quot;free\\&quot; vitamins offered with the meaningful beauty face kit, that is enrollment in a separate autoship plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamins run about $100 with shipping for a 90 day supply. If one cancels the beauty trial , one must also specify cancellation of the vitamins. You cannot simply request cancellation of your account and have everything stop. It&#x27;s been 8 days since I requested a return shipping label for an unopened first time shipment of vitamins and it has still not arrived. A call to customer service assured me that it was on it&#x27;s way and I could not return the product without the label. I was also cautioned to pay for proof of return receipt at the post office and I will be charged for the return shipping as well for a product I never requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this experience I would caution future buyers to avoid anything marketed by Guthy Renker.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the reviews who complained about stopping shipments.  If you want to cancel or hold your account, they ignore your requests and bill you anyway.  Mine were sent without my authorization, and trying to get any help is impossible. Why in the world would Cindy put her name behind this scam??? The products are fine although not as big as presented, but the customer service is just ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about the product. It wasn&#x27;t terrible but it didn&#x27;t do anything special and made me break out so I stopped using it.  The company, however, is high on my s*** list.  Within the 30 day trial period (within which time you are supposed to have the opportunity to cancel any further supply of the product), I was charged for the next 90 day supply of the product.  I called to ask about this, and they gave me the line, like I&#x27;m sure they give everyone, \\&quot;oh, didn&#x27;t you know?  If you don&#x27;t cancel within 30 days we automatically ship a 90 day supply to you.\\&quot;  Yes, I said, I actually did understand that, however, it had only been about 2 1/2 weeks since I received the product. \\&quot;Oh\\&quot; the customer person said.  \\&quot;Ok, well, you can return the product and we will refund you your money and we will cancel so you won&#x27;t get any more shipments.\\&quot; Wait...but I never authorized this charge in the first place.  They were pre-charging me for this and I had not agreed to it.  I didn&#x27;t want to make a huge deal about it since they were willing to refund my money, so I let it go.  The product arrived and I was going to return it.  Before I had the chance to do so, I got charged ANOTHER amount of money from them.  This time, I called, and I was pissed.  I accused them of fraud, and asked to speak to a manager, and I finally got her to agree to refund my money right then, without me having to first return the product.  She said she would send me a return label and I could send it back.  I am going to do that, once I get my money this company stole from me.  If I see another charge on my account, I&#x27;m thinking of filing a police report, or talking to a class action attorney, because this seems to be a reoccurring theme with this company and has happened to many, many people.  Shame on you, Cindy Crawford, for putting your name on this product, with a company who commits fraud on its customers.  This is the last time I buy anything endorsed by a celebrity.</li>
