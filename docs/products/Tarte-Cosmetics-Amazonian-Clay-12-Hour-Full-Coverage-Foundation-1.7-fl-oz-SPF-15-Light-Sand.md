### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This foundation matches my color so perfectly, I am just amazed!</li>
      <li>Great for all types of skin!  </li>
      <li>So that part is really awesome.</li>
      <li>I used a foundation brush to apply this and it gave me an airbrushed look with excellent coverage.  </li>
      <li>and I must say the two work beautifully together.</li>
      <li>It does not break me out though, and that&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>To be fair</li>
      <li>Medium coverage, SPF, good size tube, and color on point.</li>
      <li>I recommend using the tarte bb/primer cream underneath for a better more flawless look.</li>
      <li>I purchased this and am in LOVE!</li>
      <li>and I love this foundation!</li>
      <li>Tarte makes a nice bamboo brush</li>
      <li>It does have excellent coverage but could get flaky with too much.  </li>
      <li>I was gifted this foundation and I love it!  </li>
      <li>So far, this is one of the best foundations I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy,  same great product 👍</li>
      <li>It goes on like a BB cream or tinted moisturizer, but it looks way better than either of those.</li>
      <li>Like it creates divites in my blackheads, this makes them stick out more.</li>
      <li>My favorite foundation I wear all day</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought this for more money elsewhere, got it cheaper here.</li>
      <li>I do think if I use it too many days in a row, I notice a breakout or two in that</li>
      <li>I do like to top this with a powder since I have oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I love the ingredients and the coverage.</li>
      <li>I love this makeup, it stays on all day.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not too sure this is a strong 4 stars, maybe more of a 3.8.</li>
      <li>This is the first foundation I&#x27;ve found in a long time that I love love love!!!</li>
      <li>A pro in that my skin looks dewy and luminous without me having to purchase another product to get this effect, but a con since my usually-oily nose reflects light like it&#x27;s made of ceramic after I&#x27;m done applying.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not greasy or cakey feeling, glides on smooth and a matte finish.</li>
      <li>I have light skin</li>
      <li>Tarte is a fantastic brand</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved everything I&#x27;ve tried by them so far.</li>
      <li>First off, I really love the color</li>
      <li>I put organic rose hip oil on my face followed by organic jojoba oil and then a light all natural cream followed by this.</li>
      <li>but I mixed it with the medium shade in the summer for a bit more warm complexion to match my tan.</li>
      <li>and it does not clog my pores and gives you full coverage</li>
      <li>After I apply, it dries very quickly into a soft matte finish that is just lovely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, not knowing what \\&quot;Amazonian Clay\\&quot; was, I imagined that this foundation would be super mattifying.</li>
      <li>Maybe you&#x27;ll be among the lucky ones.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite brands, high quality product well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I recently switched all of my cosmetics to clean and safe products.</li>
      <li>Clay mask is right.</li>
      <li>It does all it promises, it&#x27;s full coverage, looks natural, feels light and comfy, and it truly lasts all day even through vigorous workouts.</li>
      <li>Really loved this foundation, yet it seems a little chalky.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s totally wearing off in my more oily regions.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read many labels recently and found pore clogging ingredients in my \\&quot;non-comediogenic\\&quot; products!</li>
      <li>I get full, lightweight coverage very easily, and it lasts through the typical workday (despite the box instructing you that you should reapply every 2 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You need a dense kabuki style brush for the foundation to apply properly and without streaks, this gives a very natural finish (it looks just like your skin, it&#x27;s truly amazing).</li>
      <li>Tarte presents themselves as a natural company but when you look at the Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation ingredients you will see it&#x27;s FULL of silicones, polymers, toxic chemicals.</li>
      <li>It is full coverage as described but it could be just a little better.</li>
      <li>I also tried the Bare Minerals liquid foundation, but the Tarte Amazonian Clay liquid foundation is thicker (but feels weightless when you wear it) and has much better coverage on the first application than the Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>(fair sand) and consistency (very matte and a little goes a long way), and most foundations (including colorstay) burn my skin upon application, but this one only did so very mildly in the really sensitive areas on my face.</li>
      <li>it really covers so well.  </li>
      <li>I am finding that I really like the Tarte brand.  </li>
      <li>Hands down my favorite foundation ever.</li>
      <li>made me look 10 years older this</li>
      <li>I purchased all of my Tarte products directly from their web site with free shipping and a 20% off coupon for my entire order!</li>
      <li>I had to take off 2 stars to account for the 2 highly Comediogenic pore cloggers contained in this product.</li>
      <li>My skin feels velvety soft with this on and it looks flawless without giving a fake look!</li>
      <li>I have light neutral skin with pink undertones.</li>
      <li>I hope this works out because i really want to love this stuff and make it an everyday thing!</li>
      <li>Good coverage just a little dry for me.</li>
      <li>If you want a foundation that will sink right into your pores and tiny lines</li>
      <li>I use to use Cinque, but have been switching my products to more natural items without any harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin so soft and does not cause breakouts on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>If you want to possibly completely ruin your skin permanently.</li>
      <li>Ok, so let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve loved this foundation as far as the coverage, but hated it as far as the amount of acne it has caused.</li>
      <li>I like that Tarte products are made from clay and have basically natural ingredients</li>
      <li>foundation is fairly thick as opposed to the more runny foundation you get by Revlon or Maybelline or whatever.  </li>
      <li>Very bad, I am surprised there are so many good reviews on this.</li>
      <li>I was, also, unable to get a good color match with Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>I barely had to use concealer -</li>
      <li>/&gt;I found out recently that many products contain pore clogging and irritating ingredients, so you must read labels and do not just trust anything that says \\&quot;non-comediogenic\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Tarte also lasted the entire day, while Bare Minerals did not.</li>
      <li>So as a background, I normally use Revlon Colorstay Foundation in 150 buff (which is too pink for me), but I&#x27;m trying to switch everything over to cruelty-free brands, so</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good coverage just a little dry for me. I use it with moisturizer to go on easier.</li>
    <li> I use to use Cinque, but have been switching my products to more natural items without any harsh chemicals. I&#x27;ve tried several name brands that were just plain awful. I purchased this and am in LOVE! This foundation seriously covers my red skin and stays on all day long!! It leaves my skin so soft and does not cause breakouts on my sensitive skin. A little pricey, but you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your face. I blend in with a brush.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I do not even concealer with this!! I did however buy it cheaper at my local Ulta store for 32. I would totally recommend.</li>
    <li> So far, this is one of the best foundations I&#x27;ve purchased.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing caked-on makeup.  It goes on like a BB cream or tinted moisturizer, but it looks way better than either of those. I am finding that I really like the Tarte brand.  I&#x27;ve loved everything I&#x27;ve tried by them so far.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite brands, high quality product well worth the money. Not greasy or cakey feeling, glides on smooth and a matte finish. I recommend using the tarte bb/primer cream underneath for a better more flawless look. Doesn&#x27;t break me out even if i fall asleep wearing it.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite foundation ever. I have quit looking for greener grass, because this is it. Medium coverage, SPF, good size tube, and color on point.</li>
    <li> First let me say I actually love this foundation, but am so disappointed that it contains skin damaging ingredients. It does all it promises, it&#x27;s full coverage, looks natural, feels light and comfy, and it truly lasts all day even through vigorous workouts. However, if you have the least bit acne-prone or sensitive skin you MUST BE CAREFUL to test this slowly on your face.  Two of the ingredients are among the WORST known pore-clogging and skin irritating: they are sodium chloride and potassium chloride. Knowing how bad some of the ingredients are, I do not use it all over my face. I only use for spot concealing bc it really covers so well.  I do think if I use it too many days in a row, I notice a breakout or two in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out recently that many products contain pore clogging and irritating ingredients, so you must read labels and do not just trust anything that says \\&quot;non-comediogenic\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve read many labels recently and found pore clogging ingredients in my \\&quot;non-comediogenic\\&quot; products! To be fair I don&#x27;t think Tarte listed this as non-Comediogenic, and it should be noted that some people do not have problems with these ingredients. Maybe you&#x27;ll be among the lucky ones.  Some websites to visit for this info are: zerozits.com, caryskincare.com, and puredeming.com.  Also you can just google search \\&quot;Comediogenic ingredient list\\&quot;.  I had to take off 2 stars to account for the 2 highly Comediogenic pore cloggers contained in this product.</li>
    <li> I was gifted this foundation and I love it!  My friend gave me the powder foundation AND this liquid foundation.  But she bought me the liquid in a darker shade than the powder, so I used the powder in the winter, and have been using this now that I&#x27;m beginning to get a bit of a tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation is fairly thick as opposed to the more runny foundation you get by Revlon or Maybelline or whatever.  The coverage is good for my acne-prone, 40 year old skin, and I only need to dab a little bit of concealer on bad areas.  It covers everything else.  It goes a long way. I do like to top this with a powder since I have oily skin.  It does not break me out though, and that&#x27;s great.  (Other than the breakouts I get no matter what!)  I like that Tarte products are made from clay and have basically natural ingredients--I think that&#x27;s one of the main reasons they contribute less to breakouts than regular makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Great for all types of skin!  I purchased for myself then bought another for my daughter.  She loves it too!</li>
    <li> I used a foundation brush to apply this and it gave me an airbrushed look with excellent coverage.  I barely had to use concealer - usually just for my dark circles. I have light skin but I mixed it with the medium shade in the summer for a bit more warm complexion to match my tan.</li>
    <li> The coverage is similar to medium coverage drug store brands that I buy.  The make-up does not last any longer than drug store quality make-up and is much more expensive.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in conjunction with [[ASIN:B006QV2XDY Tarte Airbrush Finish Bamboo Foundation Brush]] and I must say the two work beautifully together. I get full, lightweight coverage very easily, and it lasts through the typical workday (despite the box instructing you that you should reapply every 2 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, not knowing what \\&quot;Amazonian Clay\\&quot; was, I imagined that this foundation would be super mattifying. It definitely is not. A pro in that my skin looks dewy and luminous without me having to purchase another product to get this effect, but a con since my usually-oily nose reflects light like it&#x27;s made of ceramic after I&#x27;m done applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nothing an hourly tissue blot can&#x27;t handle, but this, coupled with the fact that this foundation costs slightly less than $40 for only 1.7 ounces (you will use at least a nickel-sized dollop for every application), will have me looking elsewhere for my \\&quot;Desert Island\\&quot; foundation.</li>
    <li> It was very difficult to match colors and the foundation I got is a bit light.  It does have excellent coverage but could get flaky with too much.  I love the ingredients and the coverage.</li>
    <li> Really loved this foundation, yet it seems a little chalky. Like it creates divites in my blackheads, this makes them stick out more. It is full coverage as described but it could be just a little better.</li>
    <li> I recently switched all of my cosmetics to clean and safe products. There are a lot of nasty chemicals in makeup because the industry is not regulated and I decided that I didn&#x27;t want those chemicals in my body! Tarte is a fantastic brand and I love this foundation! I went into Sephora to get color matched, don&#x27;t buy a foundation without trying it on for color matching! My color is Light-Beige and I am formerly N4 in M.A.C.&#x27;s Studio fix. I have light neutral skin with pink undertones. I purchased all of my Tarte products directly from their web site with free shipping and a 20% off coupon for my entire order! You need a dense kabuki style brush for the foundation to apply properly and without streaks, this gives a very natural finish (it looks just like your skin, it&#x27;s truly amazing). Tarte makes a nice bamboo brush but I prefer my [[ASIN:B0045W22SW Sigma F82 - Round Kabuki brush]]. This foundation matches my color so perfectly, I am just amazed! After I apply, it dries very quickly into a soft matte finish that is just lovely. My skin feels velvety soft with this on and it looks flawless without giving a fake look! I also tried the Bare Minerals liquid foundation, but the Tarte Amazonian Clay liquid foundation is thicker (but feels weightless when you wear it) and has much better coverage on the first application than the Bare Minerals. Tarte also lasted the entire day, while Bare Minerals did not. I was, also, unable to get a good color match with Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for more money elsewhere, got it cheaper here. I&#x27;m happy,  same great product 👍</li>
    <li> Let me tell you !!! This is the first foundation I&#x27;ve found in a long time that I love love love!!! If putting on with a brush  it looks air brushed !!! It stays on so well!!! I&#x27;ll never turn back to anything else !!!</li>
    <li> Ok, so let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve loved this foundation as far as the coverage, but hated it as far as the amount of acne it has caused. It clogs my poors and causes really bad acne that has turned to red marks that scar. It&#x27;s winter and it&#x27;s very cold. What does clay do when it gets cold? Expands/cracks. Very bad, I am surprised there are so many good reviews on this. Tarte presents themselves as a natural company but when you look at the Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation ingredients you will see it&#x27;s FULL of silicones, polymers, toxic chemicals. I  just threw mine away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients: Titanium dioxide 6%, Zinc oxide 3%&lt;br /&gt;Other ingredients: Water, cyclopentasiloxane, octyldodecyl neopentanoate butylene glycol, polyglyceryl-4 isostearate, dimethicone crosspolymer, PEG/PPG-18/18 dimethicone, mica, dimethicone, silica, phenoxyethanol, cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 dimethicone, stearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, sodium dehydroacetate, caprylyl glycol, phytantriol, hexyl laurate, triethoxycaprylylsilane, sodium chloride, hexylene glycol, lysine, tocopherol, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, nylon-12 fluorescent brightener 230 salt, polyvinylalcohol crosspolymer, kaolin, magnesium chloride, potassium</li>
    <li> I love this makeup, it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Clay mask is right. If you want a foundation that will sink right into your pores and tiny lines this is it. If you want to possibly completely ruin your skin permanently. This is your makeup. This is by far the WORST MAKEUP I have ever used. I put organic rose hip oil on my face followed by organic jojoba oil and then a light all natural cream followed by this. It SUCKED the life out of my face dried it up made me look 10 years older this S***ake tarte clay BLOWS</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation I wear all day and it does not clog my pores and gives you full coverage</li>
    <li> So as a background, I normally use Revlon Colorstay Foundation in 150 buff (which is too pink for me), but I&#x27;m trying to switch everything over to cruelty-free brands, so i figured I would check this out, because it&#x27;s meant to last long as well. First off, I really love the color (fair sand) and consistency (very matte and a little goes a long way), and most foundations (including colorstay) burn my skin upon application, but this one only did so very mildly in the really sensitive areas on my face. So that part is really awesome. However, it just does /not/ have the staying power i wanted it to have. Five hours into school and it&#x27;s totally wearing off in my more oily regions. I know a setting spray would probably aid this, but their &amp;#34;12 hour&amp;#34; claim is phooey, and I&#x27;m even wearing a primer by them, and have powder on. I&#x27;m going to see if maybe the urban decay setting spray will help out, but I have to get some money to purchase it, then I think I will check back in. and I&#x27;m not too sure this is a strong 4 stars, maybe more of a 3.8. I hope this works out because i really want to love this stuff and make it an everyday thing!</li>
