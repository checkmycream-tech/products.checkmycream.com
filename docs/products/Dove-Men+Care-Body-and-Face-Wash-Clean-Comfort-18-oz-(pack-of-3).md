      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>Great Item for the price and a really good deal for what i paid for it</li>
      <li>for the scent, it&#x27;s fairly subdued and not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a good product.</li>
      <li>but I read that its best to just get something that is primarily directed as face wash for that.</li>

      <li>the interest of writing a good review</li>

      <li>fragrance, to each their own, but this doesn&#x27;t smell that good.  </li>
      <li>The lather is perfect with the right type of smell.</li>
      <li>You will love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve sworn by Dove products ever since moving to the Denver area in the &#x60;70&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m happy that my \\&quot;manly man\\&quot; can now enjoy these benefits as well.  </li>
      <li>Great price through Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save.&amp;#34;  However, wish Dove Men body washes came in a fragrance free version.</li>
      <li>This is a nice body wash.</li>
      <li>/&gt;A nice combination.</li>
      <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw when opening up the package.....</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely with my bath brush.</li>
      <li>Honestly would rather buy Dove Men Care Odor</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall - I liked this body wash.</li>
      <li>Just some nice smell but no fragrances.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easily as good as, or better high-end department store brands.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The most surprising aspect about this wash was the fact that there is virtually no scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more than a hint of perfumey fabric softener, fairly chemical-y.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a lot of body wash for the price, which is nice</li>
      <li>It lathers up nicely has a pleasant, not too strong aroma and cleans effectively.</li>
      <li>Said it made his skin feel great, made him feel clean, liked the smell.</li>
      <li>It does a great job making you feel clean, according to my husband.</li>
      <li>Smells good, lathers well, easy on the body.</li>
      <li>Have a good soothing or invigorating fragrance (while not being so strong as to cause a headache)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very strong.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling nice, not stripped like most soaps.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It rinses very cleanly, which is nice.  </li>
      <li>This product lathers nicely, and rinses very clean.  </li>
      <li>This product seemed very good at first and at first, i loved it.</li>
      <li>I must confess that I am not a habitual body wash user, being more of a bar soap person myself.  </li>
      <li>close to the satisfaction Mr Bubbles provided many moons ago :)</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>It just isn&#x27;t any better at moisturizing than anything else out there.</li>
      <li>I love this body wash.</li>
      <li>for the fragrance, its just OK.</li>
      <li>My husband said it wasn&#x27;t his favorite scent, but that it was definately a manly smell.</li>
      <li>I love this shower gel.</li>
      <li>i like it very much, smooth and smell really nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>me some more flavors</li>
      <li>you use it MORE than once a day?</li>
      <li>My favorite body wash.  </li>
      <li>I love this body wash and the price could not be beat.</li>
      <li>and it isn&#x27;t a ton more, so</li>
      <li>-- mmmm I LOVE the smell of this on him.</li>
      <li>Really glad this line keeps expanding.</li>
      <li>, we found the scent to be okay.</li>
      <li>Now things that could be better:  -It doesn&#x27;t have a pump</li>
      <li>love it.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very good, nice and masculine, and clean.  </li>
      <li>The scent is crisp and pleasant but with no undertones (fruit, floral, or citric) that I can identify.</li>
      <li>so when Dove decided to come out with a men&#x27;s line of products, I was very excited to have my boyfriend try them out.</li>
      <li>Pretty good product, fresh and good smell.</li>
      <li>It has a nice, clean smell and leaves you feeling refreshed all over.</li>
      <li>This product did exactly what I hoped for - nice lather ( do any of you notice some products refuse to do this? ) and has a nice scent.     </li>
      <li>That being said, the Dove Men+Care line is pretty good.</li>
      <li>The best process I have found for using shower gels is to get yourself and the applicator wet, turn off the water, work the product into a lather and scrub yourself, then rinse it all off.</li>
      <li>What I enjoy most about this body wash is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and feels good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only did he like itbut it made his skin feel incredible and</li>
      <li>Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The bottle is designed well, easy to use while showering.</li>
      <li>When it comes to a body wash, I want something that&#x27;s going to leave me clean and smelling better than I did when I took a shower.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Surprised daily by this scent .. 7th wonder thing to me ... never thought a man should user this to shower... I think this improves my health... close to the satisfaction Mr Bubbles provided many moons ago :)</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is not overwhelmingly intense, does not feel as if it is drying my skin out and is reasonably priced in my opinion.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m not a dude. But I am the wife of a dude.&lt;br /&gt;And as the wife of a dude, I like my personal dude to smell fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;But not cologne-y, and not like a bottle of knock-off drakar noir exploded in his midst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND because I am demanding. I like his skin to feel soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Men + Care definitely left his skin soft and smooth- for that I would give it maybe 3 or 4 stars... My husband uses regular bar Dove quite a bit, and if anything this seemed to rinse \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance though... I give that a 1 (by the way, I love the fragrance of regular Dove).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an odd match for a dude...  It&#x27;s more than a hint of perfumey fabric softener, fairly chemical-y.  As far as comfort goes- the fragrance was so strong that it was not comforting in the least, but I have a very sensitive nose and sensitive skin and with the combination of the two I ordered my beloved back into the shower to hose himself off with plain ol&#x27; awesome Dove bar....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfection! And now he smells clean and that is sexy.</li>
    <li> The basic contention of this product is that men and women need different products to clean their skin.  I frankly don&#x27;t believe it, although I can see where it is a good marketing ploy.  My husband and I have both tried it.  It&#x27;s ok but we see no difference between this on his skin as compared to mine.  A guy will simply feel like less of a wuss putting this in his gym bag.  My advice?  Get whatever skin product you like regardless of how girly or masculine the packaging!</li>
    <li> This from the Man in my life:  Dove&#x27;s Bath Gel for Men, their recent entry into the growing male skin care market, is a sure winner. The aqua-colored gel instantly turns into a rich, foamy lather when it hits the washcloth. The scent is mild and refreshing like good soap and the feel on the skin is gentle and soothing. I actually looked forward to showering with this stuff: it&#x27;s a great way to start the day or to cool down after an intense workout. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I must confess that I am not a habitual body wash user, being more of a bar soap person myself.  The scent is very good, nice and masculine, and clean.  However, the consistency is too thin for my liking, it is far too runny and not foamy enough, so you end up have to use a whole palmful at a time.</li>
    <li> This product seemed very good at first and at first, i loved it. However, around 2 months after using it, i discovered i was always itching my outer thigh and the area directly behind my armpits (i was using the new dove deodorant also) was getting very dry (something very uncommon for me because my skin rarely dries out). After changing my body wash and deodorant (about 3 weeks later) my symptoms are beginning to leave. This product is very harmful to your skin and it doesn&#x27;t manifest its negative consequences until it&#x27;s too late. The dry skin is almost impossible to get rid of and even now (almost 2 months after i stopped using this product), my itchy skin is still evident. I went to my dermatologist and he said that the irritation was caused by the chemicals in this body wash and it could take a long time for the irritation to recede because of how long i was using the product. I would never recommend the men&#x27;s product line to anyone (but \\&quot;regular\\&quot; dove products have always been a favourite of mine). Stick with the brands that have been around for a long time - Axe, old spice, etc</li>
    <li> Nice scent, clear gel product. Does not dry out the skin. Not like woman&#x27;s Dove product (creamy, opaque). Worth a try, gentlemen.</li>
    <li> I like this clear gel-like product so much more than the cream-textured equivalents made by Dove and other body wash makers. It foams just as well, it moisturizes just as well, smells less cloying than most and, best of all, rinses cleanly. The scent is crisp and pleasant but with no undertones (fruit, floral, or citric) that I can identify. You mostly smell it while showering, because it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin later to compete with deodorants or other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, what made my rating go from a 4 to a 5 star is that I found it less slippery in the shower than previous products I had tried. (I recently almost slipped in the shower while using a Johnson and Johnson body wash that left my acrylic shower mat a little greasy.) Those of us who are in the age group in which we need moisturizing, are also in the age group in which we have to be very careful to avoid falling. Using ordinary caution, this product rinses well off the body, and doesn&#x27;t make the shower floor or surfaces any more slippery than ordinary soap.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. It has the \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent that we all like and it also cleans very well. My skin does not feel tight and dry like other body washes do. I recommend!</li>
    <li> I choose this item and gave it to my husband to try (and yes, I even tried it once to see what it was like even though it is most definitely a mans smell). He likes the way it lathers up and rinses off easily even in our hard water, but neither of us care for the scent. I&#x27;m not sure what the smell is....maybe a sandalwood or something of the like, but neither of us cared for it. The scent didn&#x27;t last long on the skin after showering, so that was a good thing for us. Scent is a very personal thing and some may really like the scent of this wash, we just didn&#x27;t. I would like to see this product is some other scents or even in a non-scented variety. Overall, great product and would pick it up again if I could get a different scent.</li>
    <li> The soap cleaned my body without irritation, so I guess it did it&#x27;s job.  But I expected more from a product that costs more than my Suave shampoo ($1.47/bottle).  I just don&#x27;t see the point in spending more on a product that does the same thing.  It didn&#x27;t do it any better, and it didn&#x27;t smell better (in fact, I like the variety of scents that Suave offers).  But it did the job and it isn&#x27;t a ton more, so I only took off one star for not living up to my expectations.  I think this product hooks people on the idea that it is just for men, like it&#x27;s some sort of secret club or something.  Soap is soap, if a woman uses this product she&#x27;ll get the same results.  I don&#x27;t know, it just seems like false advertising to play on people&#x27;s insecurities.  Perhaps I&#x27;m just in a cynical mood...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically shower gel for men. Definitely has a manly-smelling cologne added: some men will like the scent and some will not, we found the scent to be okay. I&#x27;d recommend smelling this in the store before purchasing since scents are such a subjective thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product to work and lather exactly as most of our other shower gels do. Like most shower gels, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the skin much, so if your skin is used to being pampered with moisturizing soaps, this may dry your skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For being a \\&quot;wash,\\&quot; it does a good job of cleaning and for its purpose, I give it 4 stars. While we would appreciate a more moisturizing wash, some folks (particularly young men with already oily skin) will appreciate the lack of additional moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually distinguish between types of body wash, but I must say that I found this new Dove product especially invigorating. It has a nice, clean smell and leaves you feeling refreshed all over. Another nice thing is that it&#x27;s concentrated, so that you can use less of it per shower, extending its lifetime.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like this. The scent is supposed to be subtle, but it&#x27;s overpowering to me and neither manly nor pleasant. It seems to do a well enough job cleaning and rinsing off, but that can be said of just about any body wash product (or soap for that matter). I&#x27;m not really liking it for washing my face either (I use a different Dove product for that) as it really doesn&#x27;t seem to get deep into the pores. My skin feels about the same. I&#x27;ll finish this bottle, but this won&#x27;t make me quit buying Old Spice...it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell...it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> This body wash lathers up well, but you need to use a good amount; it isn&#x27;t concentrated.  The scent is similar to \\&quot;[[ASIN:B000VOLLG2 English Leather]]\\&quot; Aftershave.  The bottle is designed well, easy to use while showering.</li>
    <li> By time people read the reviews of this product, it will be lonesome.  Naive me (my husband) just started using the product without reading the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shower was as advertised. Didn&#x27;t feel any soap residue on my skin and I thought it had a nice fragrance left on my skin which lasted for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 showers my skin started to itch again. I nominally use a body wash that has no fragrance. I can usually get away without putting lotion on my body for about 4 showers, but not so with the Dove. I had to put on lotion after every shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to using the other bodywash. So far I haven&#x27;t had to put lotion on after 3 showers.  I haven&#x27;t researched my regular bodywash, but I know I&#x27;m not itching a few hours after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove has been around for awhile, so I have to believe people like it.  Just doesn&#x27;t work for me, and the ingredients are little concerning.  Don&#x27;t they make just soap anymore?</li>
    <li> What I enjoy most about this body wash is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash has this nice texture, and feels very high end.  I also enjoy the very large size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t personally enjoy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance, to each their own, but this doesn&#x27;t smell that good.  It&#x27;s not stopping me from using it right now, but I&#x27;d prefer either something with no scent, or a more pleasing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll agree, as another reviewer wrote AXE does smell better, as does Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give me some more flavors and I may switch to you Dove, but for now I&#x27;m still \\&quot;stuck on\\&quot; Old Spice.  (And hoping they come up with their new Fresh line in a bodywash!  (that stuff smells AMAZING!))</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what I hoped for - nice lather ( do any of you notice some products refuse to do this? ) and has a nice scent.     I like the notion that you smell it in the shower, and when you get out ( clean, fresh), but it DOES NOT overpower you, as you go about your day.    Easily as good as, or better high-end department store brands.  This is something I will continue to buy, without question.</li>
    <li> Great smell not over powering I love this body wash</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who uses one of the old bar soaps known for leaving a \\&quot;sticky soap film\\&quot; behind.  He is a man of habit though and wouldn&#x27;t use it even when I reminded him of the great commercial they had for the super bowl.  So, I hid his soap and left him with either this or puppy shampoo for his morning bath.  That did the trick! Not only that but this stuff has a really nice, subtle masculine scent.  mmmmmmmmm, I LIKE this stuff!  He smells sexy but not until you get really, really close, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the girls at work \\&quot;sniffing after him\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of writing a good review I did some additional research and used it on myself in the shower:  This product lathers nicely, and rinses very clean.  It does a good job of washing off sweat, dirt, grease, etc. without having to reapply.  After using it, I did not have dry or itchy skin and I felt clean and refreshed.  The scent was faint and kinda woodsy, it reminded me of sandlewood but very subtle.  While this product is for men, I would use it again. As for my husband, I hope he keeps using this -- did I mention? -- mmmm I LOVE the smell of this on him.</li>
    <li> For someone who lives in a semi-arid high-altitude climate (think Colorado), this product is essential.  And anyone who endures seasonal dry weather should look into this product as well.  I&#x27;ve sworn by Dove products ever since moving to the Denver area in the &#x60;70&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m happy that my \\&quot;manly man\\&quot; can now enjoy these benefits as well.  This body soap has a mild, clean smell - no perfume-y overtones.  If you&#x27;re a male and experience dry skin at times, this one is for you</li>
    <li> The scent is so delightful that I use it myself. Although, I chose it for my husband.      Give it a try as you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is the worst body wash I have ever used and I have used a few (from most regular mass market products like Axe, Old Spice to designer brands like Armani, Dunhill). The things that I expect from a bodywash/shower gel are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It should clean you very well and leave you feeling fresh (BUT while doing so it should not dry your skin). In the long run it should be good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It should not have any ingredient which is harmful for the skin. Specifically I avoid the following like plague: Petrolatum, Parben, Mineral Oil (apart from these, I also try to avoid SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate) but it is hard to find a body wash or shower gel without SLS - its pervasive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Have a good soothing or invigorating fragrance (while not being so strong as to cause a headache)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before beginning this review let me tell you why I avoid the ingredients Petrolatum, Parben and Mineral Oil - all these ingredients, in the name of &#x27;moisturizing your skin by locking in vital moisture&#x27; actually form a sheath on top of your skin and clog its pores. This is extremely unhealthy for the skin since skin, for being healthy, needs to be able to breathe freely for expelling impurities out of the system. The implication of using products (body washes, shower gels) with these ingredients is that you do not feel as fresh after the shower (compared to products  without these ingredients) since your skin pores are clogged and suffocated. Though I noticed that this Dove Men + Care Clean Comfort Body Wash contained Petrolatum (and SLS), I wanted to give it a try since I hold in high regard Unilever in general for their well engineered products and the Dove brand in particular for their moisturizing bar soap which is one of the best soaps for skin and is a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I was shocked when I used this. It is the worst of all worlds - This body wash almost does not clean you at all but leaves such a heavy residue on your skin that you will feel horrible - as if you did not have a shower at all. And dare you use this when you are a little more unclean than usual - when you come out of the shower you will wonder whether you had a shower at all. There is absolutely NO feeling of freshness OR cleanliness that you expect from a shower. Now some might argue that usually &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; body washes are intended more to moisturize than to leave you feeling squeaky clean - well I&#x27;m not talking of anything even close to squeaky clean here - when you have a bath (even if it were with the world&#x27;s most moisturizing soap/body wash) you expect to feel a minimal level of freshness (otherwise there is no point of a bath - you might as well smother yourself with moisturizing lotion instead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok - so this does a horrible job of cleaning. So what about its claims of moisturizing ? The only thing this body wash does is clog your pores and leave your skin feeling suffocated - not supple and well cared for. So if you have an oily skin or if you are a little stale from perspiration and get into the shower with this, you will feel horrible since this will 1) not clean you in any way 2) lock in the dirt that you had before the shower - can you imagine how bad that can feel ? I wonder whether this product was well tested on actual people (which is a basic requirement and the norm with any cosmetic manufacturer of credibility/repute) before being rolled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance, its just OK. Nothing that you would look forward to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed with Unilever for releasing such a badly engineered and tested product. This is extremely uncharacteristic of this very good FMCG company. I threw this in the bin after using it thrice (I was disgusted after the very first use but wanted to give this a chance just in case the first day was a &#x27;bad bath day&#x27; - but alas the bad was not in the day - it was in the gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this review was a passionate oneand so could come across to some as bordering on the weird - for after all its a body wash isn&#x27;t it ? Your life does not depend on it. But well, I am very particular about the decisions I make for my health, grooming and well being. This product was so horrible that it disgusted me to the extent necessary to elicit such strong feelings of dislike and disapproval. However, as I always suggest, do not take my word for it - try this yourself (if you want) with an open mind but at the same time being conscious of what to test/look for after reading this review - because after all you are the best judge of what suits you and what is good for you. Also, I strongly suggest that you try to find a cleaning product without SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate), since SLS penetrates the skin and even the internal organs easily and can cause havoc like endocrinological imbalances, neurological disorders, organ toxicity and cancer on long term use.ll its a body wash isn&#x27;t it ?

    <li> This exact product is $3.82 at Kroger&#x27;s and even less at Walmart.This exact product is $3.82 at Kroger&#x27;s and even less at Walmart.This exact product is $3.82 at Kroger&#x27;s and even less at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just marketing, or something different about this body wash, but it&#x27;s the only one I see labeled body wash AND face wash.  That makes it very convenient for going to the gym, since I can carry one less bottle.  (Nivea has shaving cream, body wash, shampoo, but I love my shampoo... and again, the label there doesn&#x27;t actually say it&#x27;s a face wash.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rinses very cleanly, which is nice.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s terribly moisturizing, which is funny for Dove, since that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re known for.  The claim that it is...  but after using Dove Nutrium, my skin feels a definite difference.  After using using this, it didn&#x27;t feel dry, but definitely didn&#x27;t feel nearly as moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most surprising aspect about this wash was the fact that there is virtually no scent.  I expect Men&#x27;s stuff to smell spicy, and other lines of this body wash definitely do, but not this mild formula.  I was initially somewhat disappointed, since I usually like smelling \\&quot;manly\\&quot;, but it turns out it&#x27;s actually makes it very good for going to the gym at noon, because when I get back to my office, I&#x27;m not knocking anyone out with my formidable scent.</li>
    <li> Dove Men + Care Clean Comfort Body Wash, 18-Ounces Bottles (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Dove body wash for the past few weeks since I got it. I use the Axe Detailer with it, although Dove seems to have a similar product. It works well. It lathers up nicely has a pleasant, not too strong aroma and cleans effectively. Not much more I can ask from such a product. I saw from the Amazon page that you can save some money by subscribing to it. That&#x27;s a good thing as it&#x27;s a little bit pricey. But, it works well and I like it. I&#x27;ll save one star for the high price but it earned the rest as a high quality product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Dove product user for years so when Dove decided to come out with a men&#x27;s line of products, I was very excited to have my boyfriend try them out. Of course, he was hesitant about using something that was always intended for women. After a little prodding, he reluctantly tried it out. Not only did he like itbut it made his skin feel incredible and he smelled great. He&#x27;s already asked me to get him another bottle soon. I think he might take my recommendations in the future. :)</li>
    <li> As someone with sensitive, often too dry skin during the winter, I leaped at the chance to try this product.  However, while I was pleased with it, I couldn&#x27;t say it was any particular improvement over the [[ASIN:B000R961M0 Dove Cool Moisture Beauty Bar]] I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Dove makes two additional varieties in addition to this [[ASIN:B002TSA916 Dove Men + Care Clean Comfort Body Wash]]: [[ASIN:B002TSA91Q Dove Men + Care Extra Fresh Body Wash]] and [[ASIN:B002TSA91G Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body Wash]] in what is assumed to be mildest to strongest order, and the other two varieties are also available in bar form: [[ASIN:B002TSA90M Dove Men + Care Extra Fresh Body and Face Bar]] and [[ASIN:B002TSA90W Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body and Face Bar]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your choice of body wash or bar will in part be determined by your weapon of choice.  [[ASIN:B002TSA90C Dove Men + Care Active Clean Shower Tool]] users, [[ASIN:B0017TZD7S Axe Detailer Shower Tool]] users, and users of [[ASIN:B000GCAJB2 Shower Pouf]]s that haven&#x27;t had a testosterone injection are limited to the body washes while [[ASIN:B00198JG6Q Salux Japanese Beauty Skin Cloth]] users can use either body washes or bars.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to getting dry, particularly during the winter months and dry weather. I thought I would give this new line a try and it was alright. The scent is just right as it is not overpowering but definitely detectable, although I can understand some people being turned off by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary moisturizing ingredient in this body wash is the same as in many others - petrolatum. Those saying that this body wash does not moisturize enough - I would recommend letting the lather set on your body for at least a minute or two. Petrolatum is not an instantaneous moisturizer and needs some time to settle on the skin to do its job. Try aiming the water off of you as you lather and let it set for a couple of minutes. Even with this technique, however, this body wash just isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as it says, especially in comparison to Dove &#x27;Deep Moisture&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - I liked this body wash. I&#x27;m rather picky with my personal hygiene products and Dove For Men passes with an average score.</li>
    <li> Does it fight dryness? Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it later up well? Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it rinse off easily and completely? Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you use it every day? Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you use it MORE than once a day? Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the scent &#x60;girly&#x27; or overpowering? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it compare to other body washes? It&#x27; better, in my opinion, but I have by no means tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still prefer a separate product for my face and neck, though, due to some oily skin closer to my hair. It really is good that I can get really clean after doing some heavy / hard exertion and scrub everything well without drying out my skin. The best process I have found for using shower gels is to get yourself and the applicator wet, turn off the water, work the product into a lather and scrub yourself, then rinse it all off. I also like to use the product on my feet using a brush like this: [[ASIN:B00002NC1L Rubbermaid Dish Brush]] . It does seem a little more slippery on the soles of my feet until I can wash it off well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product. I will probably keep buying it after the sample is gone.</li>
    <li> Great for my sensitive skin. Goes on nicely with my bath brush. Rinse clean and has a very nice gentle clean scent.</li>
    <li> Smells good, lathers well, easy on the body. I highly recommend this product to all the fellas out there! You will love it!</li>
    <li> A favorite of my teenage son.  Great price through Amazon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save.&amp;#34;  However, wish Dove Men body washes came in a fragrance free version.</li>
    <li> -The smell is subtle.  -It works well in hard water.  -It feels clean.    It&#x27;s great.    Now things that could be better:  -It doesn&#x27;t have a pump (cap is tat the bottom). A pump would help me be more consistent and not be wasteful.  -There is no info if it&#x27;s environmentally friendly. Given a choice I&#x27;d opt for something at the local organic store that I know is eco friendly.</li>
    <li> My husband complained that this left a film on his skin, so I tried it to see what he meant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  It has a pleasant, masculine scent, nothing like those teenager-targeted body sprays. It&#x27;s not so overpoweringly manly that I can&#x27;t use it, but it&#x27;s definitely not a girly scent. It leaves my skin feeling nice, not stripped like most soaps.  I tried to explain to my husband that he was getting clean and putting light moisturizer on at the same time, but he refused to try it again, which is his loss.  It has a nice texture and make a good lather and won&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dried-out.</li>
    <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw when opening up the package.....one of the bottles was wrapped up tight in plastic because the snap-tight bottom didn&#x27;t exist. So obviously there was soap everywhere within the plastic \\&quot;bag\\&quot; because it had no lid whatsoever!!! I can&#x27;t believe anyone would have thought this could be a usable product to send a buyer, very very unprofessional!!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I don&#x27;t fall much for marketing hype and to me soap is soap. That being said, the Dove Men+Care line is pretty good. It gets me clean, doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell (just a clean one) and works pretty well. I also use the deodorant and that is a good compliment to this as well. I&#x27;m not one for a lot of frills - I had been using Old Spice or Suave, but tried the Dove during the winter because my skin was dry. It works. As a bonus, it can usually be found on sale somewhere at a big box store. The only thing I will say is it doesn&#x27;t lather quite as much as some other soaps - to me that&#x27;s a positive, but it might not be to others.</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to like this product. I purchased it from another retailer in a gift set after using the facial moisturizer. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;  The people giving this high ratings must have totally smooth bodies with no armpit hair. I use a crystal deodorant as I don&#x27;t have a need for anything strong and it tends to be the easiest to wash or in the shower. Not so with Dove Men+ Care body wash. Like many low cost moisturizing men&#x27;s body washes, it contains petrolatum, which is basically Vaseline. It mixed with the deodorant creating a nasty, water repellant goo on my pits and pit hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I tried my usual brand of wash that contains the same cheap surfactants as this, minus the petrolatum, and after three washes in vain,  I resorted to a clarifying shampoo that finally broke up the messy scum the Dove produced.&lt;br /&gt;  Like I said, I wanted to like this, but it of the entire Dove Men +Care line the only product a I&#x27;ve found to be usable is  the Hydrate moisturizer. And I&#x27;m not sure I won&#x27;t switch back to Neutrogena from that. Dove has done a great marketing job, but their products remain budget products made with the cheapest ingredients.</li>
    <li> OK... this stuff works great.  BUT... big BUT... when I WASH myself I do NOT want to STINK from the wash I use.  I have cologne for the scent I want.  The first time I used this, my shower actually smelled like it for TWO DAYS!!&lt;br /&gt;Come on Dove... you have a great product.  Who did you FAIL to have test this.  Give me UNSCENTED wash.  Geez... a 5 star product FAILURE.</li>
    <li> Wife likes the way it smells and I don&#x27;t mind it.  the Dove Men line is actually pretty decent overall. I have sensitive skin and none of the stuff in the line has bothered me.</li>
    <li> This is not a fragrance free product. The fragrance is very strong. I did not like it at all.</li>
    <li> I have used dove products previously which tend to be softer on skin. The product is scented well but not too much. The product is just as harsher as any other body wash on the market. Even the ingredients are same as any other product on the market.The product dries my skin and I had to give up its use during winter time. The product doesn&#x27;t stand up to its name of moisturizer. Won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product that keeps me smelling nice, the women are happy so I am happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this in lieu of Dove bar soap, and it has worked out pretty well.  I also bought some terrycloth mitts and it is working well so far.  This soap smells good, especially in combination with the same scent anti-perspirant.  They are good male scents, not flowery or generic, without being overbearing like some colognes.</li>
    <li> Fraudulent Product--my purchase came watered down from original by at least 50% in comparison to store bought.</li>
    <li> As all Dove products this is great, use it all of the time.</li>
    <li> When it comes to a body wash, I want something that&#x27;s going to leave me clean and smelling better than I did when I took a shower.  But I don&#x27;t want it to be so overpowering that other people flee the room when I enter.  I also want something that&#x27;s on the masculine side of things and isn&#x27;t overly floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Dove Care for Men series.  I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it&#x27;s pretty good.  I swim laps a couple of times a week in a heavily chlorinated indoor pool.  So my first expectation is that the body wash would help remove that feeling of dryness and general chlorine-ness that can sometimes occur.  And it did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is the dispenser on the top is large enough to get out enough but not so big that you&#x27;re getting a ton more of the body wash then you need.  It allows for a greater degree of control and to use as little or as much as you need.  (I tend to err on the side of starting out with too little and getting more as needed rather than having too much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, it&#x27;s fairly subdued and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice combination.</li>
    <li> I received one bottle of this stuff awhile back and have been using in consistently for weeks. I&#x27;m not impressed. I don&#x27;t see any change in my skin moisture wise and no real reason to buy this product. It seems to perform no better or no worse than any product I would have bought using a coupon for whatever is on special down at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For grins, my wife used it a number of times as well and saw no difference either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have a coupon and it is on special, go for it. The scent is little strong, but not bad and it will foam up well and get you clean. It just isn&#x27;t any better at moisturizing than anything else out there.</li>
    <li> Honestly would rather buy Dove Men Care Odor Guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a very light scent, not too bad but the issue is with it&#x27;s cleaning ability. I often work out intensively and when I come home and take a shower with this, i still feel like I need to take a second shower because I simply feel like it was not enough and I still might not be as clean as I could&#x27;ve been. However with the Dove Men Care Odor Guard, as strange as the name might sound, along with the fact that the fragrance lasts on your body a whole lot longer, it is made to clean even after the sweatiest, most brutal workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you use Odor Guard, you will probably never come back to this</li>
    <li> Great stuff, almost no sense. Buy it in bulk and never go to the store.</li>
    <li> I made be getting used to the Vaseline brand, which is practically scent-free and leaves your skin highly moisturized. There&#x27;s nothing particularly wrong with this Dove product (and we used their soaps around the house) but I prefer the scent to be lighter.</li>
    <li> Gave this product to my 18yo son away at college, and he actually thanked me.  Said it made his skin feel great, made him feel clean, liked the smell.</li>
    <li> First I really like the smell of this product, at least out of the bottle. On my husband, it didn&#x27;t smell quite as good. But like many fragrances, they smell just a bit different on each person. My husband said it wasn&#x27;t his favorite scent, but that it was definately a manly smell. It rinses off well, but doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize as well as Dove&#x27;s other products, which in my opinion was a bit odd. It does a great job making you feel clean, according to my husband. It is also convinient as it is a product that can be used for several applications, which means less clutter in the shower. Great product for a man who is not concerned about moisturizing issues and enjoys the scent.</li>
    <li> Just as expected, Dove men&#x27;s care body wash with the clean comfort smell (pretty much smells like baby powder).</li>
    <li> I love this shower gel. it leaves a refreshing scent after usage and I never got tired of it after 3 years of usage.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product, fresh and good smell. Decent price with &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27;. I&#x27;m using my second batch of 3 bottles and still like it.</li>
    <li> It makes a great body wash. I haven&#x27;t tried using it as face wash but I read that its best to just get something that is primarily directed as face wash for that.No problems and it was packed well.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Too bad they aren&#x27;t keeping it on the local store shelves.</li>
    <li> I have not tried the other scents but am not impressed with the \\&quot;Clean comfort\\&quot; one.  It smells like cheap deodorant.  You know that smell when an old man wearing Hi-Karate has been on an elevator?  That&#x27;s what it smells like to me.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash.  I just like the way this lathers and the scent is there, but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash and the price could not be beat. Amazon has the lowest prices on everything. The lather is perfect with the right type of smell.</li>
    <li> very hard to get out of the bottle</li>
    <li> Packaged well and very pleased with the purchase. Great price.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very gentle on skin with mild smell.</li>
    <li> Not sure what clean comfort smells like but as a guy I don&#x27;t like Dove&#x27;s take on clean comfort.  Apart from the smell I suppose this functions as a body and face wash should.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s body wash and keeps you clean. :)  Purchased this in a 3-pack for a good deal - definitely can&#x27;t beat it at Target or any other bulk-type of stores.</li>
    <li> The Dove BODY WASH is great...leaves you feeling fresh and clean! smells good and because of the bulk and size of this order..it lasts!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because of his dry skin as recommended by my dermatologist.  He now loves it.</li>
    <li> As a gamer, I don&#x27;t like to fuss with my socially required hygiene so when I found a deal for this 3 pack of Face and Body wash that included a $20 discount on any EA Origin title, I had to take advantage of it. I picked up the new SimCity. I spent a lot of time in the shower trying to wash off the horribly invasive feeling of the always on DRM and while my computer is infested with EA&#x27;s Origin Platform, my skin has never felt better. I cried a lot playing SimCity, but didn&#x27;t experience a single tear using the gentle formula of this product on my body and face. The bottle is easy to hold, so you will never drop it in the shower, giving EA another chance to take advantage of you. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Clean and refreshing, but I have started to prefer less chemically organic shower gels...</li>
    <li> This is a nice body wash. In a pack of three it&#x27;s tough to beat the price as well. I like how it feels and smells. Unfortunatly my wife is not crazy about the smell but it&#x27;s nothing she hates so just be aware that you&#x27;ll have three bottles of it once you&#x27;ve bought it. Might be a good idea to try one bottle first before getting the economical three pack.</li>
    <li> hard as h3ll to squeeze the bottle to get anything to come out and the scent is a bit too much. even for a man.</li>
    <li> Switched to this over Dr. Bronner&#x27;s after more intense workouts. I prefer natural soaps, but the dove is hard to argue with in how effective it is at fighting body odor and how well moisturized it keeps my skin. I also don&#x27;t think they produce a scent I have any qualms with. Really glad this line keeps expanding.</li>
    <li> Smells great. I saved about a buck for all three of them. Not a bad deal for face and body wash.</li>
    <li> I care about my skin and how it looks, feels, and smells. And to all you guys who think using &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; soaps is girly you&#x27;re wrong. This product is amazing! It keeps my skin soft all day and I get constant compliments (majority are from my girlfriend but hey, still counts) and i don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a wet dog.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this to any guy who wants to look and smell healthy</li>
    <li> My skin gets very dry if I use regular soap, so when I tried this I was really happy that my skin feels a lot better. I also like the scent because while it is noticeable, it is not overpowering. I feel very refreshed after a hot shower with this, more so then I did with regular or moisturizing soap. Also, it is much easier and cheaper to buy these on Amazon with subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lathers well and seems to keep skin moistened.</li>
    <li> The smell of the soap and texture is good but the soaps do not come out well when i try to pump</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this body wash for several years now and love it.  My wife loves it as well.  You can&#x27;t beat the price when these go on sale with subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> Great price - will purchase again</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s a lot of body wash for the price, which is nice I suppose (3 x 18 oz).  I&#x27;ve stopped using it because I find it too strong-smelling.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to scents, I suggest avoiding.</li>
    <li> Great Item for the price and a really good deal for what i paid for it very happy wit it</li>
    <li> I usually use Old Spice. All the guys use old spice so I want to try something different and I came upon this on amazon. i like it very much, smooth and smell really nice. However, it is very thick and take a little effort to squeeze it</li>
    <li> Keeps you fresh and clean. Fragrance free wash for men.........This is the only considerable one I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well and keeps you fresh. Just some nice smell but no fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Price is also very competitive compared to BJs/Costco since they carry pack of 3 (2 x 18oz, 1 x 13.2 oz) for the same price. You get 3 18oz bottles on amazon for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;I was using the old spice one before but it is not so viscous and ends up spilling all over the tub from my hand.</li>
    <li> My sons and husband use this body wash, and this was a great purchase. It did save me money and it came right on time.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I never really liked using bar soaps (especially when you find hairs on it from other family members). It usually left my skin feeling like its been stripped of its natural moisture, but that all changed with this product. As with the dove men +care products on the market this body wash has excellent lathers, keeps skin feeling moisturized, and has a very pleasant manly smell that doesn&#x27;t come off strong after you are done showering/bathing. I really can&#x27;t see myself using other body washes or soaps anymore. Good job Dove!</li>
    <li> I had never used a Dove product before but, I was pleasantly surprised.  My experience with other products left my skin dry and some of the scents were overpowering.  Dove has several different washes for any skin type.  Depending on the season I can change between them.  A small amount goes a long way - you feel clean when you step out of the shower.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work.  I think plain old soap is better.  I&#x27;m on a well, and I&#x27;ve heard that the water here has a lot of sulphur in it, so that could be some of it, but I expected better from this product.  It just doesn&#x27;t really have a scent.  I really liked the smell of the Clean Comfort deodorant, but this doesn&#x27;t quite smell the same, and it&#x27;s not as strong.  I need something stronger than this apparently.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in it, and won&#x27;t be buying it again.  I think Old Spice High Endurance body wash is better (and cheaper)!</li>
    <li> I buy this for my boyfriend. We bathe at least two times a day. This body wash doesn&#x27;t lather like the non men formula and has 1/3 less body wash, so that makes this body wash pricey in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do like this scent more than the one with the green label.</li>
    <li> My two teenage boys use this daily.  Same cost as Walmart, without tax and my time taken to go buy it.  Highly recommend!</li>
