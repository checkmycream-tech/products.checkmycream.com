      <li>The company was very gracious, when they found out that we thought it was for both arms, they sent us another matching sleeve in record time and gave us a good deal.</li>

      <li>Unlike most other stores here that say you only get one.</li>

      <li>The only problem we had was that you could not get the quantities correct, which caused me to have to purchase more and pay heavy shipping cost.</li>
      <li>tight fit for adult arm and only 1 per package.</li>
      <li>Says &amp;#34;sleeves&amp;#34; but you only get one for a higher price than you get multiples with other companies.</li>
      <li>In life all things arent suppose to fit everyone, Well the sleeve was extremly tight and kept rolling down my arm, but for the price what can you expect????</li>

<li> These are very small and will not fit most.  </li>
<li> These leaves were too small, made mainly for kids.</li>
<li> Two normal women size 5 could not get past</li>
<li> SUPER FAKE</li>
<li> My only complaint is that they&#x27;re a bit short on me</li>
<li> Money well spent.</li>
<li> I wanted it to go on the shoulder and half down my arm.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s ridiculous that you order expecting 1 pair and instead receive one individual sleeve!</li>
<li> Also these will not fit an adult unless you have bone thin arms.</li>
<li> too tight and colors too faded</li>
<li> One thing though, yes I am a little petite</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it was only 1 pair.  </li>
<li> Not the usual panty hose material, its a bit stronger.</li>
<li> If I would have known they were so small</li>
<li> The reason why I took one star is because it was WAY too small.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, when it arrived, there was only one sleeve for one arm.  </li>
<li> I could not get the widest part of the sleeve past my hand.</li>
<li> Too small for my arm and disappointed there was only one sleeve for the price.</li>
<li> but they were not very impressed with the way they looked on (color, quality).  </li>
<li> (My arms are on the thin side).</li>
<li> I guess I didn&#x27;t  see where it says \\&quot;random styles</li>
<li> This item looks really fake, it does not look like a tattoo i can tell that</li>
<li> The tattoo you sent was the wrong one.</li>
<li> It looks so fake when you put it on and one was torn when I got it.</li>
<li> This sleeve and three others I got don&#x27;t go on the shoulder. :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I thought I would get two different ones as shown. But it is all right. I am not writing any more!</li>
    <li> These are very small and will not fit most.  They are good for kids but not for adults. If I would have known they were so small i would not have purchased them. If you are buying them for a child - then they are great.</li>
    <li> The tattoo you sent was the wrong one. It looks very real but it is not for a women. It has flames and clouds or smoke I guess. When I order the sleeve I has hoping to find temp tattoo sleeve, as in rub on tattoos. I guess no one makes those? I wanted it to go on the shoulder and half down my arm. This sleeve and three others I got don&#x27;t go on the shoulder. :(</li>
    <li> Fast ship &amp; great product! Well worth the buy.I able use them for my sons Halloween shirt which came out super cute  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because of the speed in which it came. I ordered it five days ago and it came today. The reason why I took one star is because it was WAY too small. When yet say &amp;#34;one size fits most&amp;#34;, ITS A LIE! I took off another sat due to just how cheap it really is. It looks so fake when you put it on and one was torn when I got it. Will be requesting a refund. In the photos I added, you can see where it is both too short and is torn.</li>
    <li> The product description says \\&quot;sleeves\\&quot; which implies two individual sleeves or one pair, so I ordered it for my sons to play in.  Unfortunately, when it arrived, there was only one sleeve for one arm.  The packaging and the invoice says \\&quot;sleeves\\&quot; on it so I plan on contacting the seller about this.  It&#x27;s ridiculous that you order expecting 1 pair and instead receive one individual sleeve!</li>
    <li> These leaves were too small, made mainly for kids.</li>
    <li> Warning you only get 1 with the order. Unlike most other stores here that say you only get one. They choose to picture five and then deceive you into thinking that you atleadt get two. I bought 6 from another vendor for the same price Will not shope with this store again.</li>
    <li> my husband wants me with sleeves so i bought them as a joke (I also have grafts on both forearms they cover) but jokes on me cuz i love them and can&#x27;t wait il it gets warmer too wear them. One thing though, yes I am a little petite so they weren&#x27;t as snug as i would have liked.</li>
    <li> This was a lot of fun.  I gave these out at a party and it looks somewhat realistic.  It does run and tear easily though.  It is good for 1-3 times worth of wear.  Great for a rock star party.</li>
    <li> One size fits most, should be listed one size fits most kids.  Two normal women size 5 could not get past their elbows.&lt;br /&gt;The sleeve fit on a skinny size one.  I could not get the widest part of the sleeve past my hand.</li>
    <li> for his bday party we got them to go under his shirt and he took them off but our 4 year old loves them haha</li>
    <li> tight fit for adult arm and only 1 per package. Got this for our circus party. What&#x27;s a circus w/o a tattooed lady?!</li>
    <li> I got these for my boyfriend&#x27;s son. They fit him perfectly. He is 7 but big for his age. They are an exact match for his skin tone and well made. Not the usual panty hose material, its a bit stronger. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> This looks so real.i took a pic wearing it and my kids thought i got tattoed!</li>
    <li> Too small for my arm and disappointed there was only one sleeve for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this same \\&quot;Lucky\\&quot; sleeve and also a Geisha Girl at the store 5 Below. They were $2.50 each. I broke my arm and needed something fun to cover my blinding white cast which I will have for 6 weeks. Yes, you can see the seam, which I turn in, but everywhere I go people tell me \\&quot;Awesome cast cover!\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> These are for children. It says 8 and up on the package but it fit my 3 yr olds arm perfectly. I will still use them - I just cut the top elastic piece of and will use them for a forearm sleeve.</li>
    <li> Very deceptive. Says &amp;#34;sleeves&amp;#34; but you only get one for a higher price than you get multiples with other companies. Also these will not fit an adult unless you have bone thin arms. Definitely made for kids but not marketed that way.</li>
    <li> I got these to cover some scaring and they work very well</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR KIDS.. SUPER FAKE LOOKING IN PERSON BUT IN THE PICTURE IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE MY CHILD HAS A TATTOOED ARM. FITS MY HUBBY TOO</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t  see where it says \\&quot;random styles shipped\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;So you may not get what you think you ordered.  I received a tribal design&lt;br /&gt;which is not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> picture of 4 - actually is only one</li>
    <li> Bought these for a dance concert and they worked awesome! On stage it looked like my arms were really painted with tattoos. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I thought that I was getting 4 individual or 2 pair of sleeves as shown in the picture.  Unfortunately, it was only 1 pair.  They were &amp;#34;alright&amp;#34; for my young nephews for halloween but they were not very impressed with the way they looked on (color, quality).  Worn once, then tossed.  Ok for one-time event for kids.</li>
    <li> Not the best material,&lt;br /&gt;It did not stretch enough and isn&#x27;t long enough, and the first I put on broke.&lt;br /&gt;I had to sew it again.</li>
    <li> In life all things arent suppose to fit everyone, Well the sleeve was extremly tight and kept rolling down my arm, but for the price what can you expect????</li>
    <li> I would have preferred to chose the design I received. I don&#x27;t like this one.  I forgot about it and didn&#x27;t send it back so now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> This needs to be a bit longer and also i thought it would come in one pair but It didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> The only problem we had was that you could not get the quantities correct, which caused me to have to purchase more and pay heavy shipping cost. The product was excellent for why we purchased it. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Dee Bradshaw</li>
    <li> Cool design for sure. Ordered for my sons Halloween costume but these need to fit tight for the right look. These would only fit adults.</li>
    <li> These are hilarious and really look real.  I had my grandma wear them and she got lots of looks in the grocery store, haha!  My family dressed up nicely for our annual Christmas photo, but all of us added these.  We didn&#x27;t mention them at all in the Christmas card... I wonder what our family and friends thought! : )</li>
    <li> The company was very gracious, when they found out that we thought it was for both arms, they sent us another matching sleeve in record time and gave us a good deal.</li>
    <li> fun fun fun.  i love it. as i do have real tattoos i am going to play a april fools joke on  my mom with it</li>
    <li> Unless you look like Mac in the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; segment of the famous Charles Atlas advertising comic, don&#x27;t bother with these. I gave them to my nephew, a 12-year-old, and they fit him fine. I guess they&#x27;re designed for kids, anyhow.</li>
    <li> I wore these to a Halloween party at and got lots of compliments. Everyone said they looked real from a distance.They were very comfortable. I had no problems either with pinching or with slouching. (My arms are on the thin side). They stayed in place. My only complaint is that they&#x27;re a bit short on me</li>
    <li> High quality, product, exactly as advertised. Great value for the price.  Would buy again.  As a consume, it&#x27;s nice to get what you expect/want.</li>
    <li> This item looks really fake, it does not look like a tattoo i can tell that and i&#x27;m pretty sure others can too.</li>
    <li> Size is fine, but the design Is</li>
    <li> tattoo sleave was to short and to small to fit my arm plus the design was not as good at all.</li>
    <li> Is this a pair or does it just come with one? That way i know how many to purchase for my kids</li>
    <li> too tight and colors too faded</li>
</ol>
