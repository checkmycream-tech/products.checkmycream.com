    <li> This product is really nice.  I recently had highlights done on my hair and this shampoo protects the highlights longer than my previous shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of shampoo.  I have fine hair but lots of it.  This shampoo gives my hair shine and volume.  (I do get highlights and perms).</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo.  It soemtimes works better in hard water than soft, but I use it anyway in all climates.  The conditioner by the same company are my favorite twosome in the shower!</li>
    <li> Very THIN SHAMPOO!  So thin that I was thinking someone robbed me.. I don&#x27;t know that for sure, but I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Love the product, a little goes a long way and it does wonders for my chemically treated/sea salt-battered hair. LOVE Aquage! The Seller also got me the product lightening fast!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> It made my hair come out in clumps!! It doesn&#x27;t smell good and it made my hair that didn&#x27;t fall out, feel like straw. Highly disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this shampoo many times from a salon and what I received this time when purchased from Amazon had a completely different smell and texture from the one in the salon. It did was crap and made my hair feel disgusting. It ended up being a complete waste of money because it was thrown in the trash. I do not recommend purchasing this product online because you never know what you&#x27;re going to get.</li>
    <li> Good product just a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it is strengthening my hair, but I like the product and how if smells and feels.  Will come back after I used the whole bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the very best product to make your&lt;br /&gt;hair strong and healthy. A real must if you wear Hair Extensions. Great for shampooing them.</li>
    <li> Of the literally 100&#x27;s of purchases I have made on Amazon, this was the 1st that I was very, very unhappy with! It arrived in a timely manner however as a long time Aquage user I know exactly what the thickness &amp; consistency of this shampoo is. This definitely was NOT regular salon Aquage. It is literally just a step above water, a white, lightly creamy water! I will NEVER purchase it anywhere other than my trusted salon again!</li>
    <li> I love this product line and where I am living now it is next to impossible to find...I have found my new Aguage seller! I didn&#x27;t even have a chance to track it,I received it so fast. It was carefully packaged as well.</li>
    <li> I agree with the review that stated that the bottle received is watered down and does not smell as strong as salon purchased bottles. I have been using this shampoo for over a year and have bought from my salon. I wanted a better price so decided to order from Amazon. This is definately not the same as the shampoo purchased from my salon and my hair is showing the difference.</li>
    <li> Tremendous item, thank you</li>
    <li> Terrible. Doesn&#x27;t lather at all. I do not think this is the real product, as I have purchased this shampoo at a salon several times and liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> Such a great shampoo for a great price</li>
    <li> I like this product very much  I do feel that it somewhat strengthens my hair and with the serum makes it easy to manage</li>
    <li> A friend of mine who&#x27;s a stylist recommended the Aquage line to me when I told her I was looking for a quality product that would help preserve my hair color.  I love the shine and softness to hair after using this shampoo with the conditioner from the same line.  Also love the scent.</li>
    <li> This product is not &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; it is definitely not the same quality as what I ordered in the salon and i am highly disappointed and dissatisfied.  I thought I was getting a great savings but ends up I spent money for something I will never use and now I have to go purchase this again at full price...</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon because I have been using it for 8 months and wanted a better deal price-wise. The bottle I received is watered down and does not smell as strong as salon purchased bottles. I will suck it up and buy from my local salon.</li>
    <li> Works great for damaged/dry hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquage off and on for years and found this to be the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  It actually feels stronger, is healthier, and very shiny.</li>
    <li> Agauge  strengthening shampoo &amp; conditioner gave me hope, after reading all the great reviews, I spent $50.00 on the shampoo &amp;conditioner. What a nightmare! I have thyroid disease,my hair is a total mess! Thin, weak, breaking, split ends, does not grow. I thought protein would help my ugly hair! Total opposite, this Aquage Strenthening shampoo &amp;conditioner made my hair worse, spongy, even thinner! Changed my hair color to brassy orange! I have yet to find a good shampoo for women with thyroid disease. So sad.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo, especially in cold weather.  Works well in cold weather, gives shine and body.</li>
