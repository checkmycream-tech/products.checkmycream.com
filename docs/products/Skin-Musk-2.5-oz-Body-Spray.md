    <li> I was unable to purchase the body spray at our local discount store, so decided to look on line and was glad to find the item that I was looking for.  This body spray is not too heavy of a scent, but stays fresh for most of the day.</li>
    <li> Awesome product but need perfume to go with</li>
    <li> This fragrance is lightly sweet, but not cloying. It makes a great deodorant, too. Men are particularly drawn to this fragrance. It is sexy. It isnt overpowering. People can really only smell it on you if they get very close to you. The price is great. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent forever!  I love it because it has a very light musk fragrance.  Not at all overpowering.  It seems to last most of the day for me.  Other perfumes that I have tried are too strong and when applying it, I always had to spray it into the air and walk into it otherwise it was too much!  Not with SKIN. Spray it on and ENJOY!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Skin Musk Body Spray for years, and it is all I use. I get headaches from most perfumes, but this light, wonderful smelling body spray does not give me headaches. I just simply LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is getting really hard to find these days though, so I was really excited to find it on Amazon.  The only problem is that it cost more to ship that the actual Body Spray costs.  Smelling Good All The Time.</li>

    <li> Great scent!  I used to wear this fragrance years ago, the body spray and the skin musk oil for 24 hour fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this off and on for years.  The body spray is perfect here in humid New England.  In addition to the great scent the feel of it is a nice pick me up in the heat.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and have worn it for 20 yrs. The package actually arrived faster than expected. But I couldn&#x27;t use the sprayer without it spraying and dripping/pouring all over. The scent was very off from what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like. It was very watered down. But I was most disappointed in the way it didn&#x27;t actually spray it poured out and dripped from the other side. Will not purchase again from here.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite scent for more than 20 years and for some reason, I can no longer find it. I randomly found it on Amazon and was thrilled. I got it and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I was very disappointed that the clean fresh scent that I was so used has been changed to a powdery kind of scent. It is not what I anticipated. I really wish they would change it back to the clean fresh scent. I got more compliments regarding what I was wearing and how clean and fresh I smelled all day long. Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I got this to layer with the oil version.  This spray has a powder-y finish that feels good and the fragrance is the perfect compliment to the oil.  There is no hint of alcohol or any diminishing of scent that trails off to a chemical headache-producing pungency of most concoctions on the market.  I wish more women wore this.</li>
