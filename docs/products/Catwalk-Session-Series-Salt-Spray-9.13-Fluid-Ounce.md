<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product does not give me the beachy waves I was looking for but I still love it!  My hair is stick-straight - so of course I want curly hair, right?  I knew it was going to happen but I bought this product anyway - and I am glad I did even thought my hair remains stick-straight.  I style my hair as usual and use this as a finishing spray.  It holds as well as hair spray but isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look stiff and wet all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my two boys, ages 2 and 5.  It&#x27;s an easy way to style their hair when they have bedhead.  Just spray and brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this spray, I have not received compliments on it like other reviewers, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite that strong, unless someone is all up in your hair or something but it&#x27;s still a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh smell and the spray makes my hair wavy</li>
    <li> I did a TIGI modeling shoot awhile back and this is one of the products I received in my \\&quot;goody bag\\&quot;. I have bought two sprays since! Once you go this salt spray you will never go back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me tell you a little bit about my hair. My hair is thick,thick,thick with natural wave. This product is meant for fine hair, but I decided to try it out anyway. For all you thick-haired girls like me this product works wonders! This spray gives me an airy, beach look unlike the weighed down look we are used to. My procedure is a little different then the average consumer of this product. I shampoo and condition my hair(I use TIGI Your Highness Volumnizing products). I then put my hair into a towel and wait for about ten minutes and then use a curl booster to scrunch my hair. I then spray the TIGI salt spray in my hair. I use a ton of this product because my hair is so thick and it seems to soak it all in. I make sure to emphasize spraying the top of my head(where all the annoying fly-aways seem to appear!) The end result is a beachy wave that I get compliments on wherever I go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this spray is good for a little \\&quot;pick-me-up\\&quot;. I will spray this into my hair if I&#x27;m going somewhere that is humid or I didn&#x27;t have time for a shower! It looks like I spent forever on my hair, and it only took me a second!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this product is for thin and thick hair. However every hair texture is different. I definitely recommend giving TIGI salt spray a try!</li>
    <li> I loved this...I used this to do beachy waves in my hair...it looked great and smelled great! I will definitely re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Great sea salt spray, adds volume to hair without the extra weight. Only issue I&#x27;ve had is with the spray pump, it seems to need cleaned out more often than any other sea salt spray I&#x27;ve used before. Worth the slight problem for the quality of the product though!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Gives me the California Beach Girl Hair in just a few sprays and lasts all day. I have no idea how it works, but it clearly does! Added bonus: it smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have to say 20 words and don&#x27;t have it.  This hair spray does exactly what it says.  Use it and muss your hair for a great just off the beach look.  It smells fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Salt spray is great for that &amp;#34;just went to the beach&amp;#34; look for your hair.  Works great together with the TIGI hair spray.  But I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day.  It gives you a nice messy look that looks great with short or medium hair for guys, but it can make your hair brittle if you overuse it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many beach sprays on my straight layered hair. This is not a good one! It does nothing for my hair-no waves whatsoever. The smell is very strong-too overpowering for me. I really like the Tigi Beach Spray, so thought I would like this one-nope. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Go with the Beach spray instead.</li>
    <li> Smells really good, fast shipping, and great product condition. The only thing is that the product didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, but everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work great for someone else.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work...just leaves hair feeling like it has gunk in it</li>
    <li> Great product-defines waves without stickiness.I use all of their products,and find them effective.Also great for touch-up next day,when don&#x27;t have tome to wash hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this spray for a couple weeks now, and I&#x27;m just loving it. First of all, it gives texture and waves exactly as advertised. I have a lot of hair, but it is baby-fine and I have the hardest time finding products to give it texture without making it look greasy and weighed down! This Tigi salt spray is so impressive though. I spray it on wet hair, scrunch, and let it air dry. So simple. Plus that, it deserves 5 stars just for the fragrance alone. I love it, and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great spray and love the scent!</li>
    <li> Great product and was shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> Offers great lift and hold for fine, thin hair.  I really couldn&#x27;t do without this.</li>
    <li> A much better product then Bumble and Bumble Sea Salt spray, this provides body and good hold for my curl stick curls. It is now a hair styling staple.</li>
    <li> Like this spray and ultra quit carrying it.</li>
    <li> I used this in the evening after washing my hair and before going to bed. I have thick but fine strands of hair. If I wash and go to bed, I usually wake up and have limp hair due to the conditioner. This product also smells amazing! I will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Smells so good and works awesome. It also seems to last forever, and it adds alot of texture to your hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  The hair dresser uses this on me so I have in search of it so not to pay retail.  Yes I have found it and $5 less than the salon...</li>
    <li> This product is the best for beach hair. It&#x27;s not dry and crunchy, in fact, your hair remains soft to the touch but still sticks those waves together. It also smells clean not salty.</li>
    <li> This spray is a godsend for my hair. My hair is between wavy and straight and a lot of frizz. I have tried everything to tame it, but nothing works. This spray really gives perfect beach waves every time, and is so simple to use. I spray it into my dry hair (i use a lot bc my hair is thick) scrunch it up and go. If you have time, you could wrap it in a bun, taking it down every once and awhile to scrunch it while it dries</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great!  It hasn&#x27;t dramatically changed my hair in any way, but it does its job and it didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
    <li> I have very long, semi curly, thick hair.  This product does give my hair a beachy wave, however left my hair very dry.  I would not buy this product again &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Some people claim to not like the smell, but I think it smells great! Every time I use it I get compliments on the scent. It really does give light beach waves, but I find I have to use hairspray to really make them stay.</li>
    <li> My hair type is fine and straight, shoulder length. I hate blow drying every day, so I use this at least twice a week and create a mussy type beach look with no effort. Perfect for those mornings from the gym or when you just hit snooze. If it can make my hair wavy with flair, it can do it for anyone. It smells quite good, too. All you do is comb, spray on wet, scrunch and go. It will get set as it dries. Also, I notice that if I use it regularly, my hair becomes wavy on its own sometimes.  Oh, and FYI, I used it once for three days straight with no washing, and my hair was rocking. I highly recommend, and I recommend using a lot of the product- it goes a long way- but still be liberal with the application.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to salt spray by a co-worker.  So after doing research, I came across the Tigi Catwalk Session Series Salt Spray and decided to give it a try.  After using it, I really enjoyed the smell of the spray and how it gave my hair a nice look as if I just came back from the beach.  Unfortunately after the 5th time using it, it did not hold my waves anymore.  The spray still had the nice smell to it, but it did not hold my waves in place anymore.  It was like spraying salt water to my hair - only making it sticky and flattening my waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the smell is nice.  But it will stop working after a couple of uses.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this because I&#x27;m on a budget when it comes to hair products and this one had pretty good reviews. It took me a while to understand how to use it on my hair type but now that I can I&#x27;m relatively sure I&#x27;m never letting this out of my sight. My hair is pretty fine but long and wavy. When I use this on my natural hair (at roots and all throughout hair) or even after curling it, it gives it such a nice beachy texture... This is the first product I have tried that actually does that. Plus.... the smell is amazing (even the boyfriend approves). I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have straight hair and this definitely put some wave in my hair. I would absolutely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Well, I bought this product with the hopes that it would add some texture to my hair. It didn&#x27;t really do that, but it did have some pretty nice effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair. My hair basically freaks out after I take a shower; it gets really frizzy. So, I straighten it, but that makes it really flat. Well, I ended up using this product after I straightened my hair, and it added a lot more volume. If you have super flat hair, then this will help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really notice any crunchiness, personally. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough of the product; I&#x27;ve been sticking to three or four sprays each time. Or maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m using it on dry hair. I don&#x27;t really know; but I didn&#x27;t want my hair to seem too dry, anyways, so that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, about the smell...I have to say that this product smells amazing. I&#x27;d use this stuff all the time if only for the smell. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like the beach, but it does smell very refreshing. Definitely my favorite thing about this product would be the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Tried another brand and came right back to this.</li>
    <li> Love it!  This is my go to hair styling product.  I have shoulder length, very fine hair, just spritz this on, blowdry my hair upside down,scrunch and done.  It gives it nice texture, some volume and lovely waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as others have commented, the scent rocks... like a day at the beach...</li>
    <li> I love this sea salt spray and have searched high and low to find it again when I ran out and my stylist no longer sold it. This seller shipped the product in record time and saved me from further &#x27;bad hair&#x27; days with this heat and humidity here in the midwest.</li>
    <li> I love that I have curly hair that stays curly but isn&#x27;t crunchy and doesn&#x27;t look like Ramon noddles.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel soft, yet holds it in place. Also smells great. Use it daily.</li>
    <li> This spray makes my hair feel like its a piece of food. Such a waste since now I&#x27;ll have to throw it away. Don&#x27;t recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this sea salt spray! I have a lot of hair, but the texture is very fine and straight. It takes me hours with a curling iron and tons of product to get it to do anything usually. This spray gives my hair great texture with very little work though! I spray it in when I get out of the shower, let it air dry a bit, and then finish it off with the diffuser attachment on the hairdryer. It gives me cute beachy waves that last most of the day, which is a big accomplishment for my fine, blonde hair!</li>
    <li> I love the product but I received a mess in a box! The bottles cap was loose and so the product leaked everywhere. It was less than half full when I got it</li>
    <li> Love this salt spray. works like a charm on my curls!</li>
    <li> This hair product is just ok - it leaves my hair feeling heavy and looks greasy. I was hoping for the equivalent of BB salt spray. Some of the reviews I read on here said similar things about the product - but the size, cost, and some of the positive reviews swayed be into purchasing it. I wish I had bought BB instead - even though 2 times the price - it makes my hair texture feel a lot better. Not a big fan.</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff does what they say.Would not use every day as it will dry your hair out. It adds value to your hair.</li>
    <li> smells like a slice of ocean and keeps my hair tamed in the most humid of humidity !</li>
    <li> Got this last weekend... I have used it everyday since! SMELLS FANTASTIC! Gives my fine hair texture that I was looking for when I use my wand! - Did I mention how great this smells? even if my hair is straight I spray a little because of HOW GREAT THIS SMELLS! :) haha</li>
    <li> Got the &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; version ...same great product for cheaper! Super awesome score. This is honestly the best sea salt spray on the market I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive brands and none come close to this one.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! I use it on dry hair that I just want to scrunch a little and pin back partially. I don&#x27;t have very curly hair, but this seems to work well on it. Just don&#x27;t use too much or it will look stiff.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on days when I was either too lazy to do my hair or was running late. I wanted something I could just spray and scrunch to get messy beach waves. After reading all the five star reviews here this seemed like it would do the trick. I&#x27;m a big fan of Tigi Catwalk products, my usual routine is to use Tigi Catwalk Curlesque in wet hair, scrunch and dry with a diffuser. I have long (slightly past the shoulder) semi-thick hair with a subtle wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my order I immediate sprayed some in my naturally dried hair, I was excited to see it scrunch up and the smell was WONDERFUL. The reviews here all stated that I should try it in wet hair and let it dry naturally so I did that the next day. It was awful. When it dried it was very frizzy, it didn&#x27;t look at all like beach waves, more like messy bed head. It was a tangled up frizzy, dry mess. Pretty awful. I really wanted to love it though so I tried a few more techniques. I tried using more product which resulted in greasy, dirty and still, somehow, frizzy hair. I tried less, which ended up in a non-wavy fuzzball. I tried spraying it in damp hair and using my diffuser on it which got a better result but it was still frizzy. I normally don&#x27;t notice a bit of frizz but this isn&#x27;t just slight frizz, this is full out 200% humidity frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of trying to wrangle this product to work with my hair, I&#x27;ve given up. It&#x27;s back to my old routine and I guess I&#x27;ll spray this in every once in a while just for the smell. I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily a bad product, it just did not work with my hair type.</li>
    <li> How can any oh you think this is a good product? If you want your hair to look like hell, then just stop washing it, it is much cheaper and there is no shipping and handling.&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst hair product I have ever used in my 50 years on the planet. I love the bed head look,and the Rasta look too, but this is the \\&quot;crunchy hair\\&quot; meets \\&quot;I live in an alley\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;Threw it away.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve bought it twice already. If I wasn&#x27;t so broke, I&#x27;d buy it again (will probably ask for this as a Christmas present, lol). Not only does it give hair a nice, subtle texture; but it also makes your hair smell SOOOO nice. Like, even if it was just the smell, I&#x27;d probably still buy it. I constantly get compliments that my hair smells awesome, like I&#x27;ve just stepped out of a salon.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Need to time the time and learn how much to use and when to use it.  I love this product and use it daily in my hair routine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a whim, as I&#x27;ve recently begun a somewhat frantic search for products that would give my hair some volume and style without heat. My hair is mid-back and very damaged due to daily heat styling and monthly coloring. It&#x27;s also very thin, straight, and frizzy with lots of breakage. I tried this product not expecting much, but WOW am I surpised at the results. I sprayed it liberally on damp hair after shampooing and then scrunched it really well. It took a while to dry and during this time I occasionally added a little more product and kept scrunching (not constantly, but now and then throughout the drying period. I mention this because other reviewers have said to spray and then leave it alone to get the best effect. I defintely didn&#x27;t leave it alone, and the effect is awesome!). But the time it was dry, it looks like this is someone else&#x27;s hair! It looks healthy with amazing waves and texture. I am so happy that I just ordered another bottle so that I don&#x27;t run out! Having my hair look so fantastic with no heat styling is a small miracle. Very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: I didn&#x27;t experience any of the stiffness or crunchiness that others have experienced. This likely is a factor of how much is applied (though I certainly didn&#x27;t skimp). And, as nearly everyone else mentioned, the smell is amazing. I think I&#x27;ve met my new best friend! I will be using this most days, I suspect.</li>
    <li> See picture of my hair in the product image gallery (I&#x27;m wearing the striped shirt). I sprayed liberally on dirty/wet hair, then twisted sections and clipped the twists back while I was putting on makeup/doing stuff around the house before work. I then sprayed more salt spray on the twists, and a little hair spray, unclipped the twists and left them as ringlets until they were totally dried. Once dried, I crunched my hair up and threw a bobby pin in (without spraying anything else on my hair... mostly \\&quot;crunched\\&quot; to loosen the ringlets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this product on clean/wet hair, and just twisted (no clips or hairspray), and it worked very well. Once you twist your hair, spry the twist and let it dry before touching again. The more you play with your hair while it&#x27;s wet, the less the product will work, so keep that in mind. When I used the product on wet/clean hair, one of my friends asked \\&quot;how did you get your hair so cute?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again, and again, and again! Can&#x27;t wait to use it after swimming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type: fine, but I have a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> I was told this was a great product by my hairdresser. I wanted something that would define my curls and not be sticky however, this product made my hair feel like dredlocks. Smells great tho!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the spray. The scent isn&#x27;t that great either. I make a homemade spray that works better.</li>
    <li> Best salt spray I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, rather fine and unfortunately thinning hair that has some natural wave to it. For years I&#x27;ve been blowing it dry straight or putting it up in a ponytail, but I got bored with that look. So I&#x27;ve been trying out new products, saw a video about putting curls in fine hair which required a salt spray, and got this Tigi Catwalk Salt Spray. First, let me say the smell is nice - a bit overwhelming but pleasant.  Second, MOST IMPRESSIVE-I got instant volume. THANK YOU TIGI! I&#x27;ve been using Tigi Bed Head Superstar Queen For a Day Thickening Spray and a curly mousse to give volume to my blow dried hair, which I&#x27;ve liked, but this beats the thickening spray for volume by at least 50%. Last, used on its own, on damp hair and scrunched, this product definitely gives the \\&quot;beach hair\\&quot;. Bottom line, I really like this product and will next try the curling gel to see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you interested in one way to use this spray, here&#x27;s how I use it: To get fun \\&quot;new\\&quot; curls, I do the following: after washing my hair I spray my hair with the salt spray then blow dry my roots, then take chunks and roll them up loosely into curls and pin them to my head. I then go about my morning and within an hour I spray my head with more Tigi spray and some hair spray then take out the pins. I turn my head upside down, shake out the curls with my fingers, apply a few more squirts of hairspray, then voila - I&#x27;m good for the day. And on the morning of day 2 after sleeping on it, I use some dry shampoo, use my fingers to brush it out, apply some salt spray, and go through the day with a more rumpled, beach hair look (which I like better).</li>
    <li> ........and it does give me SOME texture but not as much as the volumizing powder that Aveda sells.  I like the smell but I will not buy this product again because it contains a form of paraben, which I try to avoid in my family wherever humanly possible.  Amazon&#x27;s price was also $15 cheaper than my salon wanted to charge.</li>
    <li> I have wavy, yet frizzy hair. When I used this product sparingly, it did wonders and smelled great. It helped smooth out my frizziness and enhanced my waves and most importantly kept them soft and nice to touch. Other products can make hair hard and crunchy. A recommendation, for best results I let my hair air dry almost completely.i found that if I applied when wet, it kept the wet look even when dry and if I dried my hair or even let it dry completely it did nothing for my waves, although it still made my hair soft and smell nice. So for optimum wave definition, I would spray lightly and finger come it through nearly dry hair. You can always add more as needed, but once you&#x27;ve out too much in you&#x27;re stuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have thick dry hair, so it doesn&#x27;t need to be washed everyday. When I used this product my hair was still soft and smelled nice on the second day, although it didn&#x27;t hold the waves and was more straight, but that gave me two days worth of looks with the same washing and product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It reminds me of the beach when I used to live by the water. It does make your hair dry though so I would not recommend using it everyday. It certainly added some vavoom to my always straight hair.</li>
    <li> This product gave me wavy hair with more texture...that part was nice.  The bad part is that it leaves your hair dirty feeling, and dull.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
    <li> this spray smells soo good! I love it! I use it EVERY day and I always get compliments about how my hair smells when I use it!</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of sea salt sprays and this is hands down my favorite. It performs wonderfully and has a pleasant smell. A little goes a long away.</li>
    <li> Product was fast and just what I ordered.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product smells amazing which is important, because it if doesn&#x27;t&#x27; smell good, it is not going in my hair.  Second of all, it always comes out in a mist not nasty clumps that make my hair look dirty.  And third and most importantly it gives me the perfect amount of texture and strand separation without looking dirty or greasy.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The smell is quite strong and perfumey, but this product does not leave my hair greasy/ crunchy/ or wet looking.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work well for my fine hair. I&#x27;ve tried using it on dry hair and on wet hair, it always makes my hair feel starchy, as if I sprayed a TON of product in it, even if I use it sparingly. It adds texture but makes my hair pouf out (even with shine/oil drops) and rough to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great though.</li>
    <li> Noooooooooooo  don&#x27;t waste your money.  It is basically water, and deflates your hair style!  Not recommended with curly hair, unless you don&#x27;t want curls.....lol</li>
    <li> The product is great I&#x27;m a guy with thick hair and use the spray to get my hair up. But I would not order from my beauty center again.</li>
    <li> this definitely ads grit to your hair, which is great if you have fine hair like me. I have noticed when i use it in the roots that it works almost like a dry shampoo and i don&#x27;t have to wash as often. SUPER awesome. It smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> It gives your hair texture and makes for a perfect beach wave.  It also smells d i v i n e, so it works for a hair perfume on those non-shower days.</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair. I have just undergone chemo and this gives great body to my hair.</li>
    <li> Comparable to the more expensive Bumble &amp; Bumble product. Does it&#x27;s job, but not much more to say about it!</li>
    <li> OMG&gt; I love Tigi Catwalk Sea Spray- sprays like this don&#x27;t tend to effect my hair, or it doesn&#x27;t last long, but this makes my hair wavey and volumey and bouncy wonderful! (Don&#x27;t judge me, I have flat sad hair.) It lasts all day, smells incredible, and there&#x27;s alot you can do with it. I like to spray lightly and then throw together a loose side braid. By the time I get to work it looks model quality, and then I can take it down for that night and have a full head of messy, beachy waves... That smell like I just walked off South Beach. It never has that plastic hairspray feel, and have I mentioned the scent?&lt;br /&gt;Definitely hit Purchase. More than once. If only they sold this crack by the case...</li>
    <li> The product works okay. However, I do not like the smell. I&#x27;m just personally not a fan of that vanilla-y scent</li>
    <li> as soon as i got it i ripped through the package to get the catwalk salt spray and used it right away........i realize it doesn&#x27;t work the same way on everyones hair, for me it worked okay but didn&#x27;t give me the look i was expecting........ i guess i was hoping for a more beachy look.... over all it worked okay and made my hair look shiny,healthy and slightly wavy look.</li>
    <li> Love this salt spray! Product is lightweight, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t make hair crunchy. Smells wonderful, too! Perfect for hot, humid summer days.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this product on my fine hair and I was amazed by how much volume it adds to my hair without feeling weighed down or greasy.  You put it on after you blow dry and/or flat iron your hair.  It adds volume and lift and gives you the bed head look without feeling greasy.  I highly recommend this product.  It smells great too!</li>
    <li> It took me awhile to get the usage right, but I find the more you use the better the result: spray on towel-dried hair, comb through, twist the strands, sleep on it or otherwise let air dry and voila! - amazing, thick, beachy waves that last for days when it dries. I have been searching for a product like this for years and am so happy to have found this one. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> read about this product on a blog... I am amazed at how well this product works... not just for a little more wave/style when I don&#x27;t have the time to curl/straighten my hair... but I literally can go 2 more days without a wash... I&#x27;m an every other day girl with SUPER thick hair, but my hair gets greasy at the roots at my part and crown... I use a dry shampoo when necessary, but still feel like I need to wash it by the end of the day with the dry shampoo stretching me out to avoid a wash... I washed my hair on a wednesday, used this product and loved the results. Used it again on friday and styled with a curling iron for different look and made it to saturday morning, when I washed my hair only because it is part of my saturday work routine... and I didn&#x27;t need to! that&#x27;s insane!!! Buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> With all the options for sea salt spray on the market, this doesn&#x27;t compete. Very strong masculine smell. Overpowering and doesn&#x27;t hold curl.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, not too sticky or heavy. One of the better salt sprays for the money.</li>
    <li> This is great for beach hair look the smell is amazing  and great for wavy look.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! (not really oceany though) If I&#x27;m feeling lazy I just spritz some in right after the shower and gives a little body and wave. Or just use as a finishing spray once you&#x27;ve styled your hair!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I use this salt spray for purposes not listed in its description. I use it to add volume  AND as a replacement for dry shampoo. I have medium-thick semi-wavy black hair, and though I used to be in the habit of washing my hair every single day, I have gradually changed this to one wash every three or four days. Salt spray took away the growing pains, and I find it works so much better than dry shampoo at counteracting any oiliness. I spray a little on my roots on both wet hair (when I wash it) and dry (when I don&#x27;t wash it). It&#x27;s great even after a workout, giving your hair nice, pliable texture. Since I stopped washing/blow-drying my hair every single day, it&#x27;s thicker, more lush, and feels like the hair I had when I was a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the salt spray smells wonderful. I love it, as does my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> I have thicker hair so this product doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would like it to. I will keep on experimenting with it though!</li>
    <li> This really gives you those beachy waves!! My hair is straight and fine but it made my hair look fuller with soft waves. Blow dry on low heat and scrunch hair.</li>
    <li> I have thin Asain hair. It was too heavy and just flattened it out. BUT it smells super good so i just mist on the inside of my hair for a little &amp;#34;haven&#x27;t washed for 2 days&amp;#34; perfume :)</li>
    <li> i have really crazy hair this tames it into soft spirals  love love it</li>
    <li> I have fairly fine hair...so finding a product that gives me good body without being heavy can be hard. But this is the real deal. I am so happy with it! It gives me the texture of 2nd day hair on day 1. I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim. I have naturally curly hair. I was looking for a product that would renew my curls in the morning. I work full time and attend school full time and have to shower at night then sleep on my hair. This helps my curls look fresh and bouncy. The smell of the spray could replace my perfume but it fades quickly. I will definitely keep this stocked in my bathroom for life. It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I like the smell, and it seems to work well without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> AMAZING, I&#x27;ve tried several salt sprays, WORKS SOOOOO WELL!</li>
    <li> I love being able to just spray, sprunch and go in the mornings and this is great for that. I usually flip my head over and do 4 sprays, then flip back up and do 4 more. It&#x27;s very strongly scented, kinda vanilla like, reminds me of high school and all the girls spraying bath and body works stuff all the time, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay strong for very long afterwards at least.&lt;br /&gt;It works all day, sometimes if I&#x27;m going out for the night I might spritz a little more on to freshen it up.&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t volumize at all, so I either need to use a separate product or just used a blow dryer with a diffuser for a minute.</li>
    <li> The product smells nice and works very well for my wavy, thick hair.  I love the control and touchability my hair maintains throughout my long work days.  Plus, my face never breaks out the way it does with other hair products.  Unfortunately, I only got about halfway through the bottle before the spray pump totally failed.  It almost seems like it&#x27;s clogged!  What&#x27;s worse is that I love this product but have no way to get to it or use it now!!</li>
    <li> I left a previous review where I criticized the bottle and the cheap pump spray mechanism; I have since received two bottles without the problem, so it seems that the issue is fixed.  I was spending too much money on the salt spray product made my Bumble and Bumble, this is a more reasonable priced alternative.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the shizzzzzzzzle! my hair smells so good. I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m going to be catwalking all over the place.</li>
    <li> wife loves it, holds great.</li>
    <li> I use this instead of stiff hairspray.  Works great if you use a light touch of it.  Spritz a few times, fluff and go!  Wonderful scent.  Far less expensive than buying in my salon.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Costs $30 in the salon so this is an excellent price. I have naturally thin hair so this is really good for adding some body and thickness. My stylist recommended it and I love it. Great smell to it while going on but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy but it&#x27;s hard to find products that are just right. I&#x27;m always in search for a product that won&#x27;t make my hair look wet all day, weigh it down, or make it look oily. So when I found this I was very pleased because it makes my waves more pronounced and tendril-like without any negative side effects. Don&#x27;t use too much of it or it won&#x27;t look right. I also LOVE the way it smells. I take it everywhere and make sure I pair complementing shampoos/conditioners with it.</li>
    <li> I have fine but thick hair that goes just past my shoulders and this product did nothing for it. I was hoping for a soft wave that I could scrunch and go, but all that happened was to make my hair look like I didn&#x27;t brush it. I gave this product two stars because it smells great and I think it would work for someone that maybe has more natural wave to their hair than I do.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  Maybe I used too much but my hair was left slightly harsh feeling.  That&#x27;s the only way I can describe it (not really sticky or crunchy feeling but not soft either, although I didn&#x27;t expect salt spray to leave my hair super soft), possibly a little gummy feeling as well?  It did give me pretty good waves though.  I will use the whole bottle up eventually.</li>
    <li> I literally never write product reviews on Amazon, but this stuff is really good.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from it other than a little added texture, but it&#x27;s way better than that.  I literally sprayed it in my wet hair, scrunched it with my hands a few times and then just let it dry, and I have soft but defined waves that are SHINY, like shiny right down to the tips.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best salt sprays I have found. smells great and works well on dry and/or damp hair...even good for light/fine/thin hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for anyone with thick, wavy/curly, course hair.  And bonus: it smells AWESOME!</li>
