### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are perfect.  </li>
      <li>These bands are perfect!  </li>
      <li>These elastics are great for people with blond hair who would rather not have their elastic stick out.  </li>
      <li>Great for controlling my frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>The color is great on these, but the elastic isn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I use three at a time and it&#x27;s very comfortable and they match my hair!</li>
      <li>Love these!  </li>
      <li>I love these!  </li>
      <li>The customer service was excellent and the product was exactly as advertised, and cheaper than buying in a store.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought another popular brand</li>
      <li>I love these no metal elastics, you don&#x27;t have to worry about metal bits catching and pulling your hair.</li>
      <li>And the color is beautiful and really matches my hair well.  </li>
      <li>These come in a couple of shades so they&#x27;ll blend in better with more than just one shade of blond hair.  </li>
      <li>I have never been able to find these in any store.  </li>
      <li>Will definately buy more.</li>
      <li>Using thinner bands allows you to use one or more at a time so you can control the tension.  </li>
      <li>These are great at first but stretch out really large when you use one for about a week.</li>
      <li>Fortunately the two tone color makes it work.</li>
      <li>These guys blend right in to my hair.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great colors for blond hair, but they don&#x27;t work in really thick hair.</li>
      <li>Would not hesitate to order more of the same when needed.</li>
      <li>my first snapped in my hair on the first day.</li>
      <li>Received this product more quickly than expected.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t care for the other popular brand.  </li>
      <li>This brand is very high quality.  </li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t hold up my hair for a whole workout.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I wear my hair up everyday for work, so having bands that match my hair color is nice.</li>
      <li>I am a blond going dark so the darker are better but combining really does help for my natural highlights</li>
      <li>Very happy to have found these blonde hair bands as they look more professional and subtle on blonde hair than the usual dark brown bands so readily available.</li>
      <li>What can I say - they&#x27;re bobby pins, and like any other bobby pin they will hold hair securely.  </li>
      <li>They stretched a tiny bit with use but are still just fine</li>
      <li>I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair and these felt too cheap to rely on.</li>
      <li>I tried using them for when I pull my hair partway back, but then I have to wrap them around so many times that it starts to look ridiculous.</li>
      <li>These are not regular hair ties as I was hoping - these are the very thin kind.</li>
      <li>I have to use two to hold up a ponytail -- I have super thick wiry hair.  </li>

<li> They are thin, but exactly what I wanted.  </li>
<li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t read the explanation very well, but they are very thin - not the standard regular size of pony tail holder.  </li>
<li> elastic, however, is far too thin to last long.</li>
<li> Not worth the money</li>
<li> For me, these elastics were a let down.</li>
<li> These are thinner than I expected, about as thin as a regular rubber band, but they do the job and don&#x27;t pull on the hair.</li>
<li> and they don&#x27;t hold in the little strands because the holder itself is so thin.&lt;br</li>
<li> Other hair bands are too thick for me and are too tight putting tension on my hair.  </li>
<li> I would (and will) buy these again, you know how these little hair things tend to get lost!</li>
<li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews that called out how thin these bands are.  </li>
<li> I had to quadruple them up together in order to put my thick hair in a pony tail and/or bun.</li>
<li> They were way too expensive for really thin rubber bands that broke when you stretched them</li>
<li> I have had these now for about six months and none of them have broken yet.  </li>
<li> /&gt;However, this may not be a bad thing - it&#x27;s just not what I was looking for and needing.</li>

    <li> my seller was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;the bicolour choice is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;the elastic, however, is far too thin to last long. my first snapped in my hair on the first day.</li>
    <li> They were way too expensive for really thin rubber bands that broke when you stretched them</li>
    <li> For me, these elastics were a let down. They&#x27;re great colors for blond hair, but they don&#x27;t work in really thick hair. I had to quadruple them up together in order to put my thick hair in a pony tail and/or bun. Some of them even broke.</li>

    <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews that called out how thin these bands are.  I have slightly longer than shoulder length hair and these felt too cheap to rely on. They are not standard hair tie thickness. They didn&#x27;t hold up my hair for a whole workout. I will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> What can I say - they&#x27;re bobby pins, and like any other bobby pin they will hold hair securely.  The selling point is the Subscribe &amp; Save option - now I never run out, and don&#x27;t need to remember to pick them up at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just didn&#x27;t read the explanation very well, but they are very thin - not the standard regular size of pony tail holder.

    <li> I love these!  This brand is very high quality.  I&#x27;ve bought another popular brand and they always eventually break.  I have had these now for about six months and none of them have broken yet.  And the color is beautiful and really matches my hair well.  I have never been able to find these in any store.  I don&#x27;t want to buy a pack with 10 brown ones just to get 10 blonde ones.  Love these!  Will definately buy more.</li>

    <li> Have been unable to find locally, glad you had them.  Don&#x27;t care for the other popular brand.  These are perfect.  Thanks</li>
    <li> These are not regular hair ties as I was hoping - these are the very thin kind. I need two or three for a ponytail and my hair is of medium thickness. I tried using them for when I pull my hair partway back, but then I have to wrap them around so many times that it starts to look ridiculous. Now they&#x27;re being used to hold stacks of cards together, ha.</li>
    <li> These are thinner than I expected, about as thin as a regular rubber band, but they do the job and don&#x27;t pull on the hair.</li>

    <li> These guys blend right in to my hair.  I am a blond going dark so the darker are better but combining really does help for my natural highlights (I don&#x27;t know about dyed in highlights).  They stretched a tiny bit with use but are still just fine and i have had them for about 6 months or so now.  I would (and will) buy these again, you know how these little hair things tend to get lost!</li>
