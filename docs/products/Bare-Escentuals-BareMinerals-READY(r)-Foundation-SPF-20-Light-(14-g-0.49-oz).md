      <li>I wear a light color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Bare Escentuals for years and loved their powder foundation.</li>
      <li>I even bought the special blending brush- yadda yadda-</li>
      <li>Great foundation, and much cheaper than Bare Escentuals website</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nice to sell that old products.</li>
      <li>I normally really like this product line, but I was less than impressed with this foundation.</li>
      <li>The other products I have bought from Bare Minerals have always been perfect of highest quality.</li>
      <li>The pressed powder goes on smoothly and lasts so much longer.</li>
      <li>I liked it enough to keep using it</li>
      <li>I like the lighter more natural coverage of the powder foundation.</li>
      <li>actually my old kabuki brush did a better job of an all over even look than the blender brush or foundation angled brush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always love Bare Minerals, they are always my first choice in skin coverage.</li>
      <li>I am very surprised at how well this powder covers my problems areas and blends SO smoothly into the skin.</li>
      <li>As a new Mom I was excited to order this foundation for an easier quicker application.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only 23 bucks for my shade (light)!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a lot more yellow in this color than the picture shows.  </li>
      <li>When I saw \\&quot;BM\\&quot; had made a pressed powder foundation, I was immediately intrigued and this was my first purchase of it.</li>
      <li>It also goes on smoothly; therefore, it looks natural.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Details: I am still using the standard flawless face brush from \\&quot;BM\\&quot; or another brush I have, the same ones I used with the loose powder.</li>
      <li>, so I am glad there is an alternative to paying such a high price.</li>
      <li>Coverage is ok, butu doesn&#x27;t hold up for a long time!</li>
      <li>this is really all you need to have</li>
      <li>Thanks for reading</li>
      <li>Thanks for reading</li>
      <li>but I really like this one.</li>
      <li>I rarely need touch ups with my bare minerals...</li>
      <li>I can agree that the pressed powder seems a slight touch more matte than the pressed powder, so that is something to consider.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally used pressed powders because I feel like it looks caked on</li>
      <li>It is easy to put on , small enough to fit in any purse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very pleased that I decided to give this \\&quot;new line\\&quot; a try, and I truly would recommend to anyone at least trying it and seeing if it works as well for you too.  </li>

      <li>Love Bare Minerals products - you can use a little or a lot and it is natural looking</li>
      <li>It is nearly weightless on your skin.</li>
      <li>I travel frequently</li>
      <li>Just seems to melt into the skin &amp; give a natural texture.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy and it feels like I am not wearing any makeup.</li>
      <li>not worth paying more than the loose foundation.</li>
      <li>Also, I realized that I use less foundation because the pressed covers way more than the loose powder.</li>
      <li>I wish the finish was a little more luminous (like the loose version is)</li>
      <li>She says Bare Minerals is a quality makeup that does not irritate her skin.  </li>
      <li>Bare Escentuals...</li>
      <li>I have been using Bare Minerals for years</li>
      <li>I too am one of those folks who have been using Bare Minerals foundation, eye shadow (etc) for years now.</li>
      <li>so, a little does very much indeed go a long way with this new product!</li>
      <li>However, using the moisturizing \\&quot;BM\\&quot; mineral veil (with their white mineral veil brush that I *highly* recommend), all over warmth powder or one of your personal favorites for some satin-like sheen on your skin solves that issue entirely in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is not a good fit for my complexion.</li>
      <li>A very small, gentle glide across this pressed powder will really get quite a bit of foundation onto your brush -</li>
      <li>I use the Bare Minerals concealer brush and circle &amp; blot it in the spots that need extra coverage.</li>
      <li>I have dry sensitive skin &amp; bouts of rosacea.</li>
      <li>You do indeed, as other reviewers have pointed out, have to be very careful when swiping the brush across the compact, not to press in too hard because you will get a lot of loose powder and will lose a good bit of the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking to my old loose powder instead-</li>
      <li>Sometimes, and this could just be a heavy hand or something, it does settle in certain areas like the forehead or chin.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t like to use it as an all-over color because the color I ordered, Medium, is a tad too pink for my skin.</li>
<li> I have tried 3 other powders (including the loose BareMinerals powder) that DID NOT come close to concealing as well as this powder.</li>
<li> I have a feeling that since a little goes a long way with these, the difference will be slim to none.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time-</li>
<li> But, again I think that&#x27;s just a heavy hand some days.</li>
<li> I received it with the powder broken inside it, so powder goes everywhere when I open the compact.</li>
<li> no magic canvas finish..</li>

    <li> Love Bare Minerals products - you can use a little or a lot and it is natural looking</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  The color was way too yellow.  I wear a light color but when it&#x27;s brushed on it was actually yellow instead of flesh color.  Unusable  The other products I have bought from Bare Minerals have always been perfect of highest quality.</li>
    <li> I travel frequently so I love make up that travels well and doesn&#x27;t spill all over in my bag or on the floor if I drop it or my kid gets hold of it.  Great coverage and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.  She says Bare Minerals is a quality makeup that does not irritate her skin.  It also goes on smoothly; therefore, it looks natural.  She expects to buy it again.</li>
    <li> Was not the correct color</li>
    <li> Great foundation, and much cheaper than Bare Escentuals website, so I am glad there is an alternative to paying such a high price. Great quality, and love that there is spf in it too</li>
    <li> I got it on April 2014.&lt;br /&gt;The product I received was Expiring in June 2014.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s nice to sell that old products.</li>
    <li> I rarely need touch ups with my bare minerals...but when I do this is perfect compact to carry with me</li>

    <li> There&#x27;s a lot more yellow in this color than the picture shows.  This is not a good fit for my complexion.</li>
    <li> Great coverage. Lasts all day. Light feeling. Been using this product for 8 years. I have fair skin. Feels good.</li>
    <li> Covers all blemishes. I&#x27;m always love Bare Minerals, they are always my first choice in skin coverage.</li>
    <li> It does not blend as well as the regularbare minerals. It looks chalky when applied. Very sad I wasted my money on this!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly on my skin,and the color was spot on. Good for my combination skin. Had a great mailing time too!</li>
    <li> The power wont stay on my face.</li>
    <li> Love love love this powder foundation.  You can control the amount of coverage you get.  It is nearly weightless on your skin.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals...what more is there to say?, beautiful make up, does everything it promises to do, this is absolutely as good as all the other products in this brand!</li>
    <li> Great texture. I find gives good coverage &amp; a better finish for me than Laura Mercier, Larenim, or Pur. Just seems to melt into the skin &amp; give a natural texture. I have dry sensitive skin &amp; bouts of rosacea. This does not irritate my skin at all, &amp; provides great sunblock protection which does not fade they the day. I wish the finish was a little more luminous (like the loose version is) but it&#x27;s a good trade off for the convenience of pressed.</li>
    <li> This is great to carry in a purse. It has good coverage and the color blends easily with my skin type.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally used pressed powders because I feel like it looks caked on but I really like this one. I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals loose powder for about two years I liked it enough to keep using it but it had its flaws. It \\&quot;faded\\&quot; throughout the day and I always resented the fact that it didn&#x27;t last all day. The pressed powder goes on smoothly and lasts so much longer. Also, I realized that I use less foundation because the pressed covers way more than the loose powder. I don&#x27;t even have to use concealer! Sometimes, and this could just be a heavy hand or something, it does settle in certain areas like the forehead or chin. But, again I think that&#x27;s just a heavy hand some days. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only 23 bucks for my shade (light)! At Sephora it&#x27;s $28 plus tax. I just ordered for $29 including shipping! Love it. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Bare Escentuals for years and loved their powder foundation. As a new Mom I was excited to order this foundation for an easier quicker application. Unfortunately it goes on so thick it&#x27;s not what I was expecting. I like the lighter more natural coverage of the powder foundation.</li>
    <li> It is easy to put on , small enough to fit in any purse.&lt;br /&gt;I am surprise it can last all day.</li>
    <li> I like this foundation only as a spot covering concealer. I use the Bare Minerals concealer brush and circle &amp; blot it in the spots that need extra coverage. I am very surprised at how well this powder covers my problems areas and blends SO smoothly into the skin. I don&#x27;t like to use it as an all-over color because the color I ordered, Medium, is a tad too pink for my skin. I use a different brand compact powder type to blend. I have tried 3 other powders (including the loose BareMinerals powder) that DID NOT come close to concealing as well as this powder.</li>
    <li> Coverage is ok, butu doesn&#x27;t hold up for a long time! I even bought the special blending brush- yadda yadda- actually my old kabuki brush did a better job of an all over even look than the blender brush or foundation angled brush ( whatever you call it).. not worth paying more than the loose foundation. I&#x27;m sticking to my old loose powder instead- and actually you are wasting a lot of the powder because you have to tap it back on compact which looses a lot of it! Don&#x27;t waste your time- no magic canvas finish..</li>
    <li> i love this make up....i went a shade darker for summer.....it covers everything......yet it feels very light........this is really all you need to have that great NO MAKE UP LOOK........</li>
    <li> I have been using this foundation for 4 years now and i love it. It is not heavy and it feels like I am not wearing any makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for years and I am always able to find the best price for this product on line.</li>
    <li> I normally really like this product line, but I was less than impressed with this foundation. One sweep across each area of the face is supposed to be enough, but it just wasn&#x27;t. Disappointed, but sticking with the regular loose powder foundation.</li>
    <li> I too am one of those folks who have been using Bare Minerals foundation, eye shadow (etc) for years now. I always wondered why they only had the option of a loose powder in a container, because for me, no matter what I did, I&#x27;d always have trouble not loosing so much of the powder into the sink or air.

A very small, gentle glide across this pressed powder will really get quite a bit of foundation onto your brush - so, a little does very much indeed go a long way with this new product! I personally have not noticed any difference in color between the pressed powder and the loose powder. I ordered both of the same colors I always had and don&#x27;t see any change of concern or frustration. (My personal opinion, and I could be wrong, is that for some... colors may appear different because of how the application goes on - being that it takes such a little stroke to get so much foundation on your brush). I can agree that the pressed powder seems a slight touch more matte than the pressed powder, so that is something to consider.
