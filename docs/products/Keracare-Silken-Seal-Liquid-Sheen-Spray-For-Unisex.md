    <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my hair. I take very good care of my hair and am very picky about what I put in it. When straightening my hair, I like for it to be light and free, without being weighed down. I literally only put a few sprays of this on my hair after washing, and my hair was beyond gross and greasy. I have 3A/3B mid-back length hair that does have texture. This product was not good for my hair.</li>
    <li> GREAT hair product. I spray it on each section of my hair before I flat iron it, and it looks great! It smells really good too. It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but worth it. Hair doesn&#x27;t look oil or greasy after you use this, it&#x27;s salon quality!</li>

    <li> This sheen does a great job of protecting my relaxed hair from heat damage. My hair has more elasticity and body than it did even when I was natural, for 4 years. As for my regime... My hair is extremely fine (3B/3C) and jaw length. After shampooing and conditioning, I use a small amount of Kheils leave in, A few pumps if Niarobi foam, spray on about two pumps (6 inches away) of Kera K Silken, comb through and sit under the dryer. I curl with a ceramic curling (I don&#x27;t blow dry at home). I know for a fact that the difference is in the Silken, as I have had the same routine for 3 months before purchasing the Kera Kare Silken. Silken literally leaves my hair looking salon smooth. It&#x27;s my secret weapon!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer, especiall for relaxed hair.  It keeps my hair from breaking off in between relaxers.  I love it!</li>
