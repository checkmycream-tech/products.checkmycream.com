      <li>The formula is gorgeous just in the bottle.</li>
      <li>Like with any acid, I always follow with a moisturizer after to get the best results, even though ISA Xanadu&#x27;s serum does contain a lightly formulated amount of Vitamin E oil.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I am very happy how this serum changed the way my favorite foundation brand looks on me, because it does a great job as far as moisture retention goes.</li>
      <li>All opinions are my own</li>
      <li>However, the opinions expressed are honest and my own.</li>
      <li>con is I didn&#x27;t care for the smell from the rose extract.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And it has almost a gel-like consistency going on and dries really nicely, so you can use this as a primer too.</li>
      <li>It develops a luscious rose perfume after it is applied to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>gold + rose extract</li>
      <li>As good as the product is, I feel as if the packaging could be better.  </li>

      <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>I was given the opportunity to try out the XANADU 24K Gold with Hyaluronic Acid Vitamin C, E and Rose Serum</li>

      <li>Despite the free item, my opinions remain 100% Honest and my own.</li>
      <li>As a gift, it would delight because it looks elegant on the dressing table.</li>
      <li>I tried it again, avoiding the eye area, and found much better results.  </li>
      <li>Just the results as a primer under my foundation made it a winner because many primers on the market contain so many synthetics</li>
      <li>Just the results as a primer under my foundation made it a winner because many primers on the market contain so many synthetics</li>
      <li>I really love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Not only is the packaging extremely attractive the product is as well!</li>
      <li>Thankfully the bottle itself made it in one piece although I think it would have fared better</li>
      <li>Most of the time a gold flake gets stuck in the opening of the nozzle and the moisturizer comes shooting out.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>the big competition of Retinol- a great anti aging ingredient to renew your skin cells!).</li>
      <li>packaging is cute with a cute bottle on the inside to boot.</li>
      <li>Well... I thought I&#x27;d do a word play with &#x27;gold&#x27; too :)</li>
      <li>I love it, personally.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was well packed and arrived safely.</li>
      <li>Overall, a great product!</li>
      <li>I love that it does not leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>Maybe that is where my savings is :)</li>
      <li>Maybe that is where my savings is :)</li>
      <li>, I have been using this for just under a month and love the results I am</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in the mornings for the most part but have also used at night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>It looked nice when the light or sun hit my face.</li>
      <li>I had no problems, my skin was ok with it.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it leaves my skin SO soft and smooth</li>
      <li>I love that it is not just a serum, but also a foundation primer.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>The kind of thing you want to have light glimmer through while it sits on your vanity.....</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s even better on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After 4 straight weeks of using the Xanadu 24K Gold Serum, I&#x27;m loving my results!</li>
      <li>I was able to apply it easily to my skin avoiding the eye area.</li>
      <li>and I have to be completely blunt, the gold just makes me happy and</li>
      <li>often put some on my cheeks so gold flakes would sit on my skin and give me a nice golden glow.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has rose fragrance but the serum smells exactly like that very popular fragrance from the 60s - Love&#x27;s Baby Soft.</li>
      <li>bottle is easy to use , it has a pump</li>
      <li>/&gt;It pumps out easily for me</li>
      <li>package is sleek and beautiful and it definitely calls attention to it by the shape and sparkles inside.</li>
      <li>The packaging is pretty nice too whether you leave it on your desk, nightstand or bathroom vanity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>really liked having the bottle out , it was pretty to have displaying on my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
      <li>Also: this serum smells very fresh and clean!</li>
      <li>Not only does it leave my skin kinda goldy and catches the light in certain situations, but it also smells good and feels great on my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just out of this world, hands down the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin and is looking for an awesome skin hydration solution.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this for the first time last night, and wow, ow wow, oh wow!  It&#x27;s not a facelift in a bottle, but my skin looked so good this morning!  It just looked lovely!  Clear, soft, and glowing!  I still have the wrinkles I&#x27;ve earned, but my skin&#x27;s texture and appearance is wonderful, and everything is so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is gorgeous, but that can be said of lots of products on the market.  It&#x27;s necessary to be tough with the bottle; you have to snap the top off to the side.  Once that&#x27;s done, prepare to luxuriate in the product.  It&#x27;s thick and silky; you just know you&#x27;re doing something wonderful for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff seems to uncover your skin&#x27;s inner thirty year old.  It&#x27;s good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product was received for review, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.  My skin feels and looks amazing.  I&#x27;ve used lots of pricey skin sera that didn&#x27;t measure up to Xanadu.</li>
    <li> Came with absolutely no directions:/.</li>
    <li> The first thing I thought when I  opened this 24K Gold Vitamin C Serum, was this stuff looks MAGICAL. Such a pretty little bottle, with an amazing product inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, so at first i was a little skeptical, because of the strong scent of rose. I do not use scented products ever. With having dermatitis eczema, it can leave my skin burning, and itchy. I checked out the ingredients in this serum before using, did a little research. I was really comfortable with what i researched. I was stoked to see that there was not any alcohol ingredients in this serum. which i find is in a lot of products. That is the one ingredient i steer away from.. because it really does a number on my skin. with all that said, after the first use, i was hooked. I had no problems, my skin was ok with it. My face felt like silk. A little goes along way. 2 pumps of the serum covered my entire face. I love that it does not leave my face feeling greasy. It absorbs quick, and leaves my face glowing. I love it.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s 24K gold in this!! And Vitamin C and Vitamin E! And Rose Extract! And Collagen! And Hyaluronic Acid! And so much more! It&#x27;s just out of this world, hands down the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used. Not only does it leave my skin kinda goldy and catches the light in certain situations, but it also smells good and feels great on my skin. What more could you ask for? I recently read that back in the day, royal Egyptian women used gold on their skin because of its anti-aging properties. So the anti-aging properties and science behind this can&#x27;t be ignored. This also smells great, probably from the rose extract. And it has almost a gel-like consistency going on and dries really nicely, so you can use this as a primer too. Honestly, this is just amazing. It&#x27;s the girliest thing ever...gold + rose extract &#x3D; YES PLEASE! Best of all, it leaves my skin SO soft and smooth afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> After 4 straight weeks of using the Xanadu 24K Gold Serum, I&#x27;m loving my results! First, I really like that instantly my skin has a healthy glow to it thanks to the 24K gold that&#x27;s infused inside of the serum. The serum has Vitamin C so it brightens my skin, plus Vitamin E to help moisturize my skin without feeling heavy or greasy. The Xanadu 24K Gold Serum is a luxurious skin care product that works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also loving the fact that in addition to all the organic ingredients it also has Rose extract that helps sooth, and heal my acne prone skin. So, if you&#x27;re like me and have moderate acne, or breakout occasionally, then don&#x27;t worry about any stinging since the Xanadu 24K Gold Serum is formulated without ingredients that are harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the Xanadu 24K Gold Serum it&#x27;s usually in the morning on fresh cleansed skin alone, or my favorite way which is as a primer before I apply foundation. My skin feels smooth, and it really looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the way my skin looks after using the ISA Professional Xanadu 24K Gold Serum. My skin feels softer, and is soothed thanks to the organic ingredients inside the very luxurious bottle of Xanadu 24K Gold Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: The ISA Professional Xanadu 24K Serum was sent to me complimentary for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product to review, I used it under and around my eyes because that&#x27;s how I have used serum products in the past.  DO NOT DO THIS!  I was so worried about getting gold in my eyes that I couldn&#x27;t sleep!  I tried it again, avoiding the eye area, and found much better results.  After washing my face and applying under-eye cream, I pump 2 pumps into my palm, rub my hands together, and smooth over my face and neck.  I apply my regular moisturizer on top of the serum.  After using this product for a few weeks, I feel like my skin is softer, smoother, and it&#x27;s possible that my acne scar is starting to look better.  As good as the product is, I feel as if the packaging could be better.  The cap can be difficult to remove, and the pump seems a little bit awkward.  Overall, a great product!</li>
    <li> This comes in a handy little pump bottle that is easy to use, you can actually see the gold pieces on your skin and inside the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin glittery but gives it a fantastic glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love naturally scented products and I am a big fan of rose scented things, this only has a very light smell but it&#x27;s gorgeous, this blends into my skin great and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling sticky or greasy like some serums do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really comment on the anti ageing effects but it has brightened up my skin a little, I have been using this for just under a month and love the results I am seeing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for testing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Xanadu by ISA for over a month now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I have used Vitamin C serums and moisturizers with hyaluronic acid for several years now because they both work very well for my aging skin without being greasy or causing break outs. Xanadu also adds Vitamin E, but it is a non-oily formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the 24K flecks of gold and wondered why they would be in a facial serum. It turns out women have been using gold in their skin care for thousands of years. Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pumps out easily for me and I have been applying it daily to my face, neck and chest after cleaning and exfoliating my skin. It glides on like silk, because of the hyaluronic acid, and absorbs quickly and completely. The Vitamin C promotes even skin tone and brighter skin. My skin feels soft and smooth and I am seeing some evening out of skin tone a this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gold flecks do end up on your skin and you can see them when you first apply the serum, but they seem to absorb or break up after about an hour or so. The flecks are subtle - it&#x27;s definitely not like glitter on your face - but you should be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has rose fragrance but the serum smells exactly like that very popular fragrance from the 60s - Love&#x27;s Baby Soft. [[ASIN:B00D0DHEXA Love&#x27;s Baby Soft by Dana Cologne Spray 2.3 oz (Women)]] It isn&#x27;t an overpowering fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t linger long but that&#x27;s what it smells like. I love it, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is gorgeous and the gold flecks make it shimmer. As a gift, it would delight because it looks elegant on the dressing table. But the quality ingredients and wonderful performance are why I can recommend this to anyone. You can get good quality but less expensive facial serums that contain hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C but with the 24K gold, I believe it is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was provided a free sample but a positive review as not asked for or promised or implied.ied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in the mornings for the most part but have also used at night.&lt;br /&gt;I often put some on my cheeks so gold flakes would sit on my skin and give me a nice golden glow. It looked nice when the light or sun hit my face. When you put the serum on you don&#x27;t have to worry about a lot of flakes on your skin or one area. It distributes pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;They say gold awakens the inner beauty of the skin &amp; nurtures it to produce the overall effect of glowing skin. It has been used from ancient times for herbal medicine as a symbol of eternity. It has been known to gold detoxifies, firms, revitalizes, reduces fine lines and wrinkles and improves the elasticity of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It kept my skin moisturized and felt good on. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky instead soft &amp;amp; supple.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is easy to use , it has a pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked having the bottle out , it was pretty to have displaying on my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Only con is I didn&#x27;t care for the smell from the rose extract.&lt;br /&gt;I have received this complimentary for review purposes. All opinions are my own</li>
    <li> The serum is light; spreads easily and is absorbed quickly. It is not sticky, and it has no scent that I can detect (realize it&#x27;s allergy/pollination time in So. California). I like that when I apply other things like moisturizers, sunblock and/or foundation over the serum, there is no drag.  I hesitate to call it a primer but I think it makes a great base for a primer or BB/CC cream. (It does say that on the bottle that it&#x27;s a primer. It does not say that on the box. )  The packaging is pretty nice too whether you leave it on your desk, nightstand or bathroom vanity.&lt;br /&gt;This product can be purchased at Isa-professional.com  or on amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;  The price is astonishing at under $60 for  a 1 30 ML/1 fluid oz of serum.  (Other products that can&#x27;t deliver the quality ingredient list as Xanadu sell for five times that amount of money- and people buy those products) .&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience with this product and the  incredible ingredient list, I would highly recommend this product to seeking to get serious with their skincare. This one is really in  class where there are few competitors! Affordable and efficacious, this product offers a marriage of cosmeceutical ingredients, natural ingredients and a technologically sound delivery system for the price of a  hair cut.  It&#x27;s a winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: I was asked to review this product.  I was given this product  either for free or with a code where I paid a token amount.

    <li> Not my favorite because the smell is really overpowering.</li>
    <li> So pretty and make skin glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Xanadu serum is so pretty in the bottle. The photos do no to it justice. It&#x27;s so cool to just hold it in the hand and let light shine through it and admire it. But it&#x27;s even better on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 24k serum comes in a solid glass bottle with a dispenser pump and that inside of a box. The box is pretty too and is a red burgundy color with gold highlights on the words. Looks much more expensive than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gold seems gimmicky but it&#x27;s actually got a thousands year old history of being used by women for beauty purposes. And there&#x27;s alot of gold in it. It seems like that would be obtrusive on the face but once applied it almost melts onto the skin, giving a golden youthful glow. I&#x27;m not worried about wrinkles yet but I do notice that my skin is tighter than before I started using this. The smell is rose to me and reminds me of flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know too much about the ingredients, but doing a search online turned up nothing bad. There&#x27;s vitamins and moisturizers and rose etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. And at this price on Amazon, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> Nice serum,can recommend to sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Ok yes, I was completely intrigued by the name alone. Once I saw the bottle I was fascinated by the golden particles inside as well.&lt;br /&gt;The package is sleek and beautiful and it definitely calls attention to it by the shape and sparkles inside. This is a small glass bottle with a pump for a perfectly dispensed amount of product for you.&lt;br /&gt;The serum does have bits of golden particles when on your skin which blends and melts into the skin upon application. I love that it is not just a serum, but also a foundation primer. It does give my face a smooth canvas before my foundation routine without leaving my face dry. I also want to mention you will not be sparkling like a glitter fairy either. It is just the right amount and just rub it in well and you will be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;This glides on so smoothly and I have to be completely blunt, the gold just makes me happy and smile.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and between floral and powder like to me and I really like how feminine the scent is.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few weeks as you can see I put a really nice dent into the product here. I have been loving the result to my skin and I have had a lot of recent compliments on my skin and well the and one other product is new and you will see that in another post.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts, opinions or experiences.</li>
    <li> I have had the pleasure to review the XANADU 24K Gold Serum by Isa Professional, and I must say... It&#x27;s quite luxurious! This sparkling delight has a smooth application and dries almost instantly with a matte finish to prep your foundation. The Vitamin C brightens your skin, The Vitamin E gives it moisture it needs, The Rose Extract gives a spring-like aroma on your skin, and The 24K Gold flakes leave a warm glow with sparkles for all to envy!</li>
    <li> You cloned La prairie good serum:) love it</li>
    <li> 4.5 out of 5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was given the opportunity to try out the XANADU 24K Gold with Hyaluronic Acid Vitamin C, E and Rose Serum I could not pass it up because I have read about the positive effects of precious metals such as gold, platinum and copper have on skin but never tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already use Vitamin C, E and Rose oil, but this moisturizer has collagen and other natural ingredients which help keep tiny lines and wrinkles look filled, and help your skin looking healthy and younger looking. However it has gold. It is said that using gold will decrease the collagen depletion, boost elasticity and blood flow in your skin. The little golden flakes actually melt into your face after a bit and disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unique moisturizer is clear with the exception of the gold flakes throughout it. I use three pumps to cover my entire face and neck. It glides on smoothly and quickly absorbs into the skin. Once a week I use a micro needle roller on my face to get the moisturizer deep into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my size super soft and moisturizer all day long. We are in the middle of winter in western New York and temperatures have been below -15, my skin has not gotten dry or chapped since I started using this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took a half a star is because the pump for the bottle needs a better design. Most of the time a gold flake gets stuck in the opening of the nozzle and the moisturizer comes shooting out.</li>
    <li> This product reminds me of old hotel shampoo that my Aunt used to give us that she saved up during her travels for work and visiting family. Some call it an Old lady smell but for me it just brings back memories. I supposed its the rose extract that gives the smell to it. I didn&#x27;t find that the smell hung around after application and it absorbed. The serum itself is runny clear liquid with gold flakes. I was able to apply it easily to my skin avoiding the eye area. Due to the gold flakes it can&#x27;t be used near the eyes. I have&#x27;t experienced any break outs with this product currently. It left my skin feeling soft and moisturized and not at all drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute with a cute bottle on the inside to boot. I received mine fulfilled by the Amazon warehouse and the cap for the serum was broken when it arrived. Thankfully the bottle itself made it in one piece although I think it would have fared better had it been shipped on its own and not in a large box with many other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase this in the future? Probably not, not for any reason of the product itself it works for me but I think there are many other affordable options out there I would be willing to buy instead. If you are looking to splurge or pamper yourself then I recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received one or more products for review purposes only. Despite the free item, my opinions remain 100% Honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Well... I thought I&#x27;d do a word play with &#x27;gold&#x27; too :) The Serum came as a &#x27;for review&#x27; item but I never promise the vendor a &#x27;good review&#x27; in exchange because I do my best to be objective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This XANADU earns its 5 stars not only because of the little gold flakes that make the bottle&#x27;s contents sparkle and look expensive but mainly because Ms. Dent who used it for the past few days says so. Her skin is super-sensitive and she can&#x27;t use most similar products because of rashes. This XANADU though, her skin seems to tolerate it well and she&#x27;s been using it twice a day. She is happy with it and the 5 stars is her rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting a little technical, the 1 oz. contents come in a nice bottle with a spray dispenser at the top - definitely not something Cleopatra had on her dresser way back then. Stated contents, besides water and gold include Vitamins C and E, Collagen, Rose Extract, Hyaluronic Acid (a common ingredient in skin-care products), Creatine... and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Ms. D has been using it daily for the past couple of weeks which is unusual for her.</li>
    <li> So unique. The bottle is glittery. Almost like those touristy souvenirs.  I had no side effects and used for a night. Skin feels smooth. Some gold glitters will be left on the skin! Great gift idea as well. A sample was provided for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I wish that I can give this product 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product. Before I received this, I had a problem with serums. Even Paula&#x27;s Choice Serum irritated my skin and made me break out. This one did not. I was shocked with the mix of happiness. I finally found a product that works with my sensitve skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a gold product, the quality and the gold pieces inside the solution will leave your skin glowing and more radiant.  The scent is right, and is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, after a week of use, my skin is definitely more brighter. However, I do not know what are the long term results.&lt;br /&gt;Will it help reduce wrinkles?&lt;br /&gt;Is this a good wrinkle preventor?&lt;br /&gt;Will my skin glow without this product?&lt;br /&gt;Can I wear the Vitamin C serum in the sun?</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. I&#x27;m so happy I found out about this serum. I use it daily and my face is always glowing!</li>
    <li> It may be too early to tell but the product seems to be clogging my pores more than anything. So far, I am not very impressed. Especially, for the high-priced tag. I will give it a few more days before I discontinue use.</li>
    <li> Let´s get into the fun with my 24K Gold Vitamin C Serum! First of all: it looks so so cool! You can actually see all the little gold specks in the gel-like serum. It looks truly divine! Imagine this bottle on your vanity! So gorgeous! Your girl friends will be so jealous! ;-)The little pump is very convenient and gives you the right amount of product. This serum is not greasy or heavy but rather very light weight and diminishes in your skin within seconds. It hydrates my skin nicely but I can imagine that you need to put a moisturizer on top of it if you tend to have really dry skin (mine is more on the oily side). Now, you have to be aware that the little golden specks will show up on your face- not that you shine like a giant piece of gold- but here and there you will notice some tiny little golden sparkle. Pretty similar to some bronzer´s out there that contain golden glitter.Also: this serum smells very fresh and clean! Not only does it contain real 24 Karat Gold (I am not sure that gold really does something for your skin- but the golden flecks really look nice!) but also: Vitamin C (the Antioxidant you need in your life if you want to fight the first signs of aging on your skin!), but also Vitamin E, Collagen, Rose Extract (smells great!), Hyaluronic acid (plumps up your skin!), Creatine and Matrixyl-3000 (I call Matrixyl-3000 the big competition of Retinol- a great anti aging ingredient to renew your skin cells!).</li>
    <li> I have used copper infused creams and serums in the past and with great results. I was eager to try gold, as I have nail polishes with gold flakes but never tried a gold infused product in my skincare routine. You do a courtesy google search and you find everything from masks and lotions, but all pretty much guaranteeing collagen stimulation, so I decided to look further into the data when it came to clinical results. I could find none! I found information in dental work and such, to even devices that contained the metal and for surgical procedures but nothing when it came to topical application. So, I went into testing this product by what results I witnessed and that means I needed to take extra care, so I decided to stop use of anything that may aid the product when it came to performance. Yup, and I did it for 22 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with that I have tested out and was currently using a Vitamin C/Hyaluronic acid combo prior, so I expected results from daily use prior, to continue to present themselves (or even increase) with the use of ISA Professional&#x27;s Xanadu formula. The formula is gorgeous just in the bottle. The kind of thing you want to have light glimmer through while it sits on your vanity.....it&#x27;s that pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (as posted on their Website):&lt;br /&gt;24K Gold, Deionized water, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Collagen, Rose Extract, Hyaluronic acid, Creatine, Beta-Glucan, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide (Matrixyl-3000), Epidermal Growth Factor, P-anisi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned the vial holds a beautiful serum but does that beauty transfer to the face? I was afraid of looking like Tinkerbell attacked me with highlighter powder after application, but thankfully my skin looked moisturized and natural with pretty much the same amount of glow left behind like any other product would leave. No chunky glitter look when it comes to application because I never exactly liked shimmering lotions that resulted in shimmering clothes and anything else you touched. You apply the product like any other serum by the thinnest going on first and I allow it absorb before proceeding to the next product. Like with any acid, I always follow with a moisturizer after to get the best results, even though ISA Xanadu&#x27;s serum does contain a lightly formulated amount of Vitamin E oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;The price point is high but so is the metal and the claims made. This one I was looking at as it&#x27;s a buy or a bust in my mind......there was no in-between when it came to testing, so no 3.5 stars and the such. The product needs to outperform my $20 bottle that claims to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At day four, I noticed that any inflammation my skin exhibited from seasonal allergies to sun exposure was not as visible. That undesired puffy look I achieved I could only describe as how I look after doing the nasal spray, allergy pill and then eye drops in each eye regimen. Hey, I&#x27;m a little of a Puffer fish when I first wake-up! After I do my &amp;#34;so nature won&#x27;t kill me regimen&amp;#34;, I must admit my skin looked smoother than my $20 bottle could do. So, in 4 days this product surpassed what I had been using and this is why I continued use. In two weeks time, I did have a glow that remained and this was before product application. My skin had a nice healthy shine and a natural plump achieved by how well my skin could hold and distribute moisture. This made any fine lines less visible and that is always a positive! The bottle is easy to use and the dispenser pumps out the required amount with zero waste. No bacteria can build like when stored in a jar, and I can say a lot has been thought out when it comes to the Xanadu formula. I like products that work and I admit, I don&#x27;t always like the price tag. You bet I wish it cost less and the thrifty person in me wants a coupon or even a 1/2 off sale but sometimes we do have to pay for results. My results were positive and the only reason I discontinued use......well, I&#x27;m testingmore stuff! I did however keep the bottle because I plan to add it to my skincare regimen when I discontinue use of the product I am currently testing. Just the results as a primer under my foundation made it a winner because many primers on the market contain so many synthetics and yes you get a smoother face, but later your skin&#x27;s health pays for it. With Xanadu, I did not have to worry about a plethora of chemicals that would cause a break-out and still achieve a smooth complexion that made applying foundation easier and I use less of it too! Maybe that is where my savings is :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from ISA Professional.

    <li> I have been using this as a makeup primer and I have been loving how my foundation is looking like on my skin! I&#x27;ve always had problems with dry patches on the sides of my mouth, nose and on my temples. I am very happy how this serum changed the way my favorite foundation brand looks on me, because it does a great job as far as moisture retention goes. I have very sensitive skin and this formula didn&#x27;t make me break out in any way, shape or form. This product is a &#x27;must try&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the way it feels going on or the longer lasting effect of it on my skin. It looks gimmicky with the gold flakes but they actually make me feel like I&#x27;m using some thing special. It pumps out a small dollop at a time, I use two, one for each side of my face, which doesn&#x27;t seem like it will be enough but it covers my skin so perfectly and sinks in evenly. It feels great and one use lasts all day. I would caution users that it has a heavy perfume smell. Personally, I really like it and it doesn&#x27;t last long but it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks beautiful on a dresser or make-up table as well. I&#x27;m amazed that you don&#x27;t see flecks of gold on your skin since they seem so prevalent in the bottle but they aren&#x27;t visible once I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> This serum leaves my face feeling lightly moisturized and smooth. I like the base that it creates for makeup and it helps my makeup last longer on my skin! It does have a slightly perfumey fragrance, which I&#x27;m not a fan of but it doesn&#x27;t last for a long time. Overall, this is a great serum for combination skin (my skin is also acne prone) if you are concerned about taking care of your skin!</li>
    <li> This serum has become a new part of my beauty routine. My favorite use for it so far, is as a makeup primer. It does a great job at protecting and mosturizing your skin while the flecks of gold add the prefect amount of brightness to youe look. A couple of pumps is enough to cover the entire face and while it feels a bit oily at first it dries surprisingly quickly leaving your skin feeling smooth and taught, smelling faintly of roses. I recommended this serum to women of all ages</li>
    <li> I have just received this 24K gold serum today, and the packaging is so cute!&lt;br /&gt;Through the clear glass bottle, the gold flakes are so shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it this morning after toner and before makeup. It felt really moisturizing and gave my face a bit of a glow! It also helped my foundation to last longer on my face without flaking or fading.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never before had a serum or cream that had gold inside. Since I&#x27;d never really had any experience with Gold and how it helps your skin, I decided to try to d o a little research. I guess that the Egyptians were probably the ones who began using Gold as a treatment in skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold is said to not only help to aid in hydrating, firming and moisturizing skin, gold also is said to help with treating skin disorders including autoimmune diseases. But, gold isn&#x27;t the only active ingredient in the Xanadu Serum, it&#x27;s also filled with Vitamin C which helps to brighten your skin and help to balance your skin tone; Hylauronic acid helps in providing much needed moisturizing. Also included is Matrixyl 3000 which goes a long way in helping to stimulate the collagen that our bodies stop producing once we hit a certain age and to help promote skin repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this now for about three weeks and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results. I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the dark circles under my eyes as well as have noticed that my skintone seems to be more even than it has ever looked. I still struggle with balloon lids on my eyes, but I think that as much as a skincream can do, it&#x27;s helped to decrease and tighten those troublesome spots. The only thing that gives me a little pause with this cream, is the scent. It&#x27;s a little overpowering and smells very old ladyish to me, but that&#x27;s just a very small and personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Sample Provided for my Inspection and Review</li>
    <li> It works wonders. I have very sensitive skin and I have to be very careful when using anything with Vitamin C and this one works wonders. I mainly bought this because my face is still oily but becoming very dry at the same time. It is very light in weight, not sticky at all, and manages my occasional breakouts really well. It just feels so good after application. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin and is looking for an awesome skin hydration solution.</li>
    <li> Item arrived yesterday .  It was well packed and arrived safely.</li>
    <li> Xanadu 24K Gold Serum is presented beautifully in a modern version of an ancient Egyptian cosmetic jar such as Cleopatra would have used. It has a clear cap and and a pump that dispenses just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has hundreds of flakes of gold leaf suspended throughout. It is viscous for easy application, but absorbs quickly. It develops a luscious rose perfume after it is applied to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Various ingredients are included to moisturize and plump the skin, remove dead cells, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and actually encourage the growth of new skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These benefits will not happen overnight, but twice-daily use will improve the appearance of delicate facial skin over time. Eating well, maintaining hydration, exercising, using sunscreen, and getting enough sleep should also be incorporated into every beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is impressive: Deionized water, 24 K gold, vitamin C, vitamin E, collagen, rose extract, hyaluronic acid, creatine, beta-glucan, palmitoyl oligopeptide (Matrixyl-3000), epidermal growth factor, p-anisic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isa Professional provided serum for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> When I first recieve this product I initially thought for my skin type it would make no significant difference, as other things I&#x27;ve tried have done nothing besides make my skin too dry or too oily, I WAS WRONG!  Using this had mad a tremendous difference in my everyday morning and school routine! My skin is no longer dull and dead looking, it actually brings my golden undertone out! I love it! Not only is the packaging extremely attractive the product is as well! I don&#x27;t have to pile on lotion or different products simultaneously for one affect because this does it all. It&#x27;s combatting my dark spot affects while making my skin look and feel refreshed! My skin is baby soft once using this, and a bigger plus is that whenever I want to wear foundation for big events, I can still wear this underneath! It&#x27;s a great base for foundation and actually goes quite we&#x27;ll with it, and the beautiful gold flicks always add a great sparkle to my original skin tone! I absolutely love this product!!!</li>
