      <li>the price is better than that of other leading competitors.</li>
      <li>nice little machine, works well, saves tons of time, works great right out of the box, have bin using it everyday with no problems at all, the photo may make it look a little cheep</li>
      <li>product was quickly delivered and properly packaged stencil stick and paper was included as listed.</li>
      <li>crisp lines, no need to tape the carbon paper to the transfer paper and multiple options to have it printed exactly the way you want.  </li>
      <li>It does print thick and catches every detail but it alot better than manual!</li>
      <li>I can only get it to work on a outline only and the light and dark button I can not tell any difference deffintily good for just for outlines but not a whole picture with shade in it.</li>
      <li>but this repair is something that I should not expect on what was called a brand new item.</li>
      <li>Straight out of the box the power cord doesn&#x27;t fit snug in the back its loose and the printer looses power.</li>
      <li>Im not sure how long it will last but quite happy with it so far.</li>
      <li>The only downfall is this copier doesn&#x27;t do so well with thin or light lines or light shading.</li>
      <li>it shipped and was delivered early.</li>
      <li>So I can&#x27;t buy any more which really sucks.</li>
      <li>Have to let cool down between uses.</li>
      <li>This machine highly encourage any one who is into tattooing to get this machine I will definitely do business with this seller again</li>
      <li>Trust me, it is not cheap and is worth every penny.</li>

<li> There was a slight problem with it.</li>
<li> We get lots of use out of this little guy, stencil cream that came with</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time reading the instructions, use the YouTube tutorial (Search \\&quot;Monster Point Thermal Copier.)</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t want to waste your paper, darken the lines with a pencil.</li>
<li> i bought a knock off copier a couple of months ago and just like the reviews said it was a waste of paper and time.  </li>
<li> There service on this small problem was extrordinary.</li>
<li> No more hand cramps.</li>
<li> /&gt;would have given 5 stars but the directions are hard to follow had to look it up on youtube.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected and seems to be quite wasteful with the expensive paper</li>
<li> Would highly recommend to anyone who is sick and tired of hand jamming stencils..</li>
<li> the dvd is a little cheesy</li>
<li> I am disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I first saw this copier I was kind of \\&quot;iffy\\&quot; about it because it was kind of expensive for something so cheap looking. Trust me, it is not cheap and is worth every penny. This copier saves so much time and hand cramps. I just got it this morning and its already paid for it self with the one tattoo that I did an hour after I got it. Very easy to use. Don&#x27;t waste your time reading the instructions, use the YouTube tutorial (Search \\&quot;Monster Point Thermal Copier.) I love the fact that there is a \\&quot;mirror\\&quot; option. The only downfall is this copier doesn&#x27;t do so well with thin or light lines or light shading. If you don&#x27;t want to waste your paper, darken the lines with a pencil. Shipping was very quick (FedEx). Took 4 business days from the day I ordered it til it was on my door step in Northern IL. Piercing Pros goes above and beyond any other seller on Amazon/Ebay. Excellent customer service, shipping and products are always great and worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works great in our tattoo studio. Holds up well. Lots of use daily. Have to let cool down between uses. Not long.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best items I have purchased on amazon&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve had mo issues. I watched a video on this and bam worked the first time. I love ot</li>
    <li> Barely prints a usable thermal copy, tried so many different things... save yourself time and draw your stencils by hand or just save up for a good thermofax machine</li>
    <li> My Partner bought this thermal stencil copier the other day for his studio, so I ask him to show me how it work when he did I was so amazed of how clean the lines were, tracing day are over for me I buying one............</li>
    <li> Straight out of the box the power cord doesn&#x27;t fit snug in the back its loose and the printer looses power. I have to hold the cord in place to run the machine.</li>
    <li> Not the most solid machine but for the price works well. Im not sure how long it will last but quite happy with it so far. According to all the reviews I have read it lasts at least a year so is worth it to me. Ive had other ones only last a month or two. So a year or longer would be awesome</li>
    <li> This was a great gift for our friend/tattoo artist.&lt;br /&gt;This has been the one thing he was missing and has greatly helped him.</li>
    <li> I can only get it to work on a outline only and the light and dark button I can not tell any difference deffintily good for just for outlines but not a whole picture with shade in it.</li>
    <li> This machine made  the job a lot easier. Great price and fast delivery. Will be checking out your site again for future supplies</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this machine.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t even need to TRY to make a stencil.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy, compact and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a tattoo artist, I used to work in a shop but now I have my on studio and I travel a lot to tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to pack/unpack, very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And most of all, it really makes great stencils! All of the lines are dark and defined.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my step son who does tattoos he used it out of the box and loves it</li>
    <li> Incredible ecstatic about this! In the time it saved me in one day it basically paid for itself. A must have for any tattoo artist</li>
    <li> First day I had it the button pad peeled off ... A little extra glue seems to keep it in it&#x27;s place but this repair is something that I should not expect on what was called a brand new item.</li>
    <li> It worked okay did jam up a couple times but if I had it to do again I&#x27;d still buy it. The paper they sent is awesome but not sure who makes it. So I can&#x27;t buy any more which really sucks. All in all it&#x27;s okay not like the tgermograph at my old shop but I also don&#x27;t have $2500 lying around to spend on that either so for me this was a good choice.</li>
    <li> It does the job and the price is better than that of other leading competitors. Saves the hand cramping and time, makes back it&#x27;s money quickly.</li>
    <li> I used to hand trace stencils but this has made my life so much easier.  It does print thick and catches every detail but it alot better than manual!</li>
    <li> We get lots of use out of this little guy, stencil cream that came with it is really awesome.</li>
    <li> Kind of a pain in the ass to use. Does the job though. Only one stencil per page though makes for a lot of stencil paper wasted.</li>
    <li> Gotta tell you this thing rocks. Talk about crisp clean lines this machine does it! No more hand cramps. Easy to use. If you dont have one save up your money and get it.two to three tattoos its paid for!</li>
    <li> It works great. There was a slight problem with it. There service on this small problem was extrordinary. I can&#x27;t say enough good about this company.</li>
    <li> i bought a knock off copier a couple of months ago and just like the reviews said it was a waste of paper and time.  this specific copier is amazing so far. crisp lines, no need to tape the carbon paper to the transfer paper and multiple options to have it printed exactly the way you want.  like I said, \\&quot;so far\\&quot;, but I can tell already this machine is a must buy for the artist. it shipped and was delivered early. I just cant say enough about this copier other than from artist to artist...buy it and be impressed.</li>
    <li> I am very please with my Monster Point. I use it to make silkscreen . Love it.. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Machine works excellent. Just watch the video, to learn how to feed the paper the right way. Used it as soon as I received it. Saves a lot of time. Everything I asked for.</li>
    <li> This little powerhouse is exactly what I wanted.. Kills the stencils every time I use it.. Would buy this again in a heartbeat.. Would highly recommend to anyone who is sick and tired of hand jamming stencils..</li>
    <li> The machine is well worth the money saves a lot of time shipping. Was very fast. I love. This machine highly encourage any one who is into tattooing to get this machine I will definitely do business with this seller again</li>
    <li> well this machine paid for itself with the time it saved me after 1 tattoo,  and unlike some thermographs,  it works with pictures printed from either laser or toner printers!!!!  i highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as expected and seems to be quite wasteful with the expensive paper it&#x27;s requires. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this printer it makes my life so much easer. I would recommend this printer every time. the stencils come out clear and go on easy, only down side it will not print full color stencils, but I don&#x27;t mind ! the stencil stay it comes with is wonderful, im defiantly buying more the dvd is a little cheesy but o well its an extra.</li>
    <li> product was quickly delivered and properly packaged stencil stick and paper was included as listed. stencil stick works great.&lt;br /&gt;would have given 5 stars but the directions are hard to follow had to look it up on youtube.</li>
    <li> Good machine. Need to have perfect vector image for it to look right, but it&#x27;s a good machine. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it. We have had no issues with this and it is a time saver. Sometimes the stencil paper can crinkle just take your time when you are lining it up and all will work well.</li>
    <li> nice little machine, works well, saves tons of time, works great right out of the box, have bin using it everyday with no problems at all, the photo may make it look a little cheep but its really built well</li>
    <li> So far this stencil machine is one of the best on the go machines I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve printed out 100 stencils on it sense I got it. It has not jamed once or printed out a blurry stencil. This is a must for the home or traveling tattoo artist.Also it doesn&#x27;t take up to much space. A PLUS!</li>
