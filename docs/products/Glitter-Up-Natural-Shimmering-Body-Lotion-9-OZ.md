      <li>The texture leaves the skin very soft, although I would say this is more of a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; feel rather than a lotion.</li>
      <li>This product is so much fun to wear...</li>
      <li>Awesome product, timely delivery Highly recommended to anyone who wants a little glitter added to their routine or a lot..</li>
      <li>Now depending on your use for this, that will determine if this is right for you.</li>
      <li>just right...</li>
      <li>but once it dries the glitter just falls right off.</li>
      <li>I love it, personally, in as far as it is exactly as advertised.</li>

      <li>Will be purchasing this again in the future! :)</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Recently purchased this because I needed to be able to wear glitter while I&#x27;m tripping balls.</li>

      <li>you will love it...makes you feel so different from others because they do not glitter!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>This is packed full of glitter so depending on how much you want on, you can rub it in fully with your whole hand or gently rub it in.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the lotion itself isn&#x27;t the best quality.  </li>
      <li>Not a good look for him lol</li>
      <li>At first I used too much, but it depends on how much you want for that day or occasion.</li>

      <li>Very glittery/ shimmery product.</li>
      <li>More glitter than expected!  </li>
      <li>and &amp;#34;shimmer.&amp;#34; This is much more suited to little girls to dress up as a fairy princess, for this purpose, I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>No icky smell.</li>
      <li>I have also purchased the other one in gold, and I&#x27;m going back to look for more colors from this company</li>
      <li>I got both bottles in gold and clear.</li>
      <li>The flakes are bigger but not big enough to be noticeable on your skin when the light is not reflecting on it.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s all natural and not tested on animals.</li>
      <li>Gave it to my  10 year old granddaughter.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several body glitters trying to find something that puts a ton of glitter on the skin for a very shiny reflective effect.</li>
      <li>This is far too glittery.  </li>

    <li> If you want MAXIMUM glitter this is the product for you! This is not just a shimmer lotion. I purchased it to use with my mermaid costume and I doubt I&#x27;ll ever wear it in &amp;#34;real life&amp;#34;...it is very glittery. The glitter pieces aren&#x27;t as big as craft glitter but you can definitely see each piece. The smell is pleasant and not overpowering. I could smell it when I first put it on but not after 10 minutes or so.  It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This product is so much fun to wear...have it in the gold glitter too...you will love it...makes you feel so different from others because they do not glitter!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice lotion but the sparkles come off easily. Still very pretty! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It adds the right amount of sparkle!  Great transaction and quick shipping! Will be purchasing this again in the future! :)</li>
    <li> Perfect! Bought this so we can sparkle and shine like princesses and fairies at Disneyland and this lotion does just the trick. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this every day, as people would wonder why I am covered in glitter, but for our occasion it is delightfully perfect. Another user said it is gritty, but it isn&#x27;t. Pleasant smell, goes on smoothly and easily, glitter sticks and stays. It is amazing and I am so excited to have received this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for belly dance or any old time!</li>
    <li> Loveeeeee these lotions perfect sparkle and smell great!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this Lotion for a few years and I love it! It is very subtle - a hint of sparkle. A little goes a long way. I use this everyday and I get a lot of compliments. I will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> Pure to Basic is awesome lotion. I got both bottles in gold and clear. This stuff is great for going out or wearing under regular lotion, for that extra shimmer!</li>
    <li> Loved it...not too glittery for me...just right...and it comes off easy with water..so you will have to reapply if going swimming.</li>
    <li> The glitter in this lotion stays in chunks and does not smooth out very well... Not what I was looking for and I will not be wearing this lotion. But it does say glitter lotion so maybe I should have just picked a different product all together. The seller was very nice and It&#x27;s ok...</li>
    <li> the bottle says &amp;#34;natural shimmering&amp;#34; body lotion.  The bottle was ordered as a gift and it&#x27;s looks like someone  poured a bottle of glitter into a lotion bottle. It&#x27;s 90% glitter and 10% lotion-- it does not look &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.. As a prime member I should be able to return or exchange this product because I am extremely unhappy with the 2 items that were ordered on the same day.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion. No icky smell. Kind of a suntan lotion smell. I think coconut. I mix with my fav lotion because it does have a lot of sparkle. In ur Palm a dab of glitter up and more of ur own lotion.</li>
    <li> I like it but once it dries the glitter just falls right off.</li>
    <li> More glitter than expected!  Nice product for a young person to wear to a party.</li>
    <li> Very glittery/ shimmery product. I used it for my daughter prom and it was really nice. I am def satisfied!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, timely delivery Highly recommended to anyone who wants a little glitter added to their routine or a lot.. Lots of fun!</li>
    <li> This glitter body lotion is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I&#x27;m not sure why some are saying the glitters are disco sized. the glitter is a beautiful nice sparkle. At first I used too much, but it depends on how much you want for that day or occasion. if you add too much just mix a nice lotion to your skin to sooth it out. The texture leaves the skin very soft, although I would say this is more of a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; feel rather than a lotion. The smell is also very pleasant. I wish I knew about this lotion in the summer so I could have added a nice shimmer to the nice summer tan glow. but this one is beautiful for winter and the holidays. Oh.... and the bottle....is BIGGER than I expected. Thank You!    -Kisses</li>
    <li> Love this glitter cream. Subtle, smells wonderful and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love it, personally, in as far as it is exactly as advertised. Glitter in a lotion. Boom.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;Glitter-Up\\&quot; body lotion offers tremendous sparkle.  Absorbs easily into the skin and leaves behind a nice sparkly quality.  A simple application truly lasts for the majority of the day.  My only complaint is that the lotion itself isn&#x27;t the best quality.  It&#x27;s a thinner product....perhaps necessary due to all of the glitter inside?  I recommend this lotion for it&#x27;s sparkle alone - you need to apply a thicker body cream for your skin prior (if you need protection).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several body glitters trying to find something that puts a ton of glitter on the skin for a very shiny reflective effect. This is the best one I&#x27;ve found, it has both small pieces and more normal sized pieces of glitter. This provides a nice shimmer and sheen effect. I&#x27;ve tried sprays and lotions available on Amazon, Walmart, and Bath and Body Works. This has the best shiny look so far. If someone finds something better please leave a comment and let me know what! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It smells yummy and it makes the skin glitter.</li>
    <li> Grands love, love, love, love this  all natural ingredient lotion.  Gives them a glow like a pearl.  They are now wearing it to school every day, although I purchased it for a party.  :)</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my niece who was going to her first dance. It is a very good smelling lotion-- not greasy. Has just the right amount of silver glitter -- the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming but soft and nice.  Really liked it since it is a natural product and it leaves your skin feeling VERY silky! I was very impressed with this product. Great price too.</li>
    <li> This lotion has the right amount of glitter if you are a kind of person that like alot of glitter! This lotion leaves your skin so smooth and healthy and it is all natural ingredients too!!!! Buy this!!!! Try it before they sold out!!</li>
    <li> I have also purchased the other one in gold, and I&#x27;m going back to look for more colors from this company, if you like glitter this one is great, I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Super product.......speedy shipping  Mahalo (ty)</li>
    <li> Price was great...great sheen and sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Got the gold version as well.</li>
    <li> just all my wife wanted. Brights a lot and smells nice</li>
    <li> Love the lotion.  Sparkles are subtle!</li>
    <li> I love glitter but I was looking for shimmer not glitter. This product got all over my baby!! He was twinkling in the sun uugghh. I wanted a shimmer lotion Not a glitter lotion. I already have glitter lotion. If you are looking for a glitter lotion then this is for you. It is not very moisturizing either. I use kukui nut oil when my skin is damp then cocunut oil for moisturizing. This is a very thin lotion. If you only used this your skin would not be hydrated. I guess I can use it for certain outfits and the beach. So my search continues for a shimmer lotion sigh. It came with 43percent more so its 9 oz. It is natural and paraben free. It has a delicate peach scent which I really love. It is fragranced with essential oil. Use lightly or you will have glitter everywhere and on everything and one you touch. I wont be purchasing this again but like I said I will use it to sparkle on the beach or if I go out to dinner. Oh my poor husband was glittering in the sun too. Not a good look for him lol</li>
    <li> This is far too glittery.  Gave it to my  10 year old granddaughter.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Sorry to say that this lotion is much too glittery for, let&#x27;s just say the more mature of us out there!  I thought the lotion would have a subtle silver sheen to it, but the glitter was chunky and greenish! I applied some on my hands and wrists and the glitter came off and went everywhere! I guess I should have realized there is a difference between &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;shimmer.&amp;#34; This is much more suited to little girls to dress up as a fairy princess, for this purpose, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I adore this, but you have to learn how to work with it. I like to lightly rub it in with my finger tips, as it tends to foam up and the more you rub, the more glitter attaches to your hands. This is packed full of glitter so depending on how much you want on, you can rub it in fully with your whole hand or gently rub it in. Prepare for glitter coated hands which personally, I do not mind. I&#x27;m fine with everything I touch having a bit of glitter. I love glitter. If you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> This would have been perfect had it been unscented. Unfortunately the scent lingers and lingers, interfering with any perfume you want to wear.  Would have returned it but I lost the receipt that came with it.</li>
    <li> This sh*** is da bomb! Recently purchased this because I needed to be able to wear glitter while I&#x27;m tripping balls. All sparkle, no itch! And it&#x27;s all natural and not tested on animals. Makes my lil trippy hippy heart burst.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...I have a nail salon and use it after all my services to give them a little glitz.</li>
    <li> Love this nature based line of glitter lotion. The gold is my favorite but this is good when I wear silver jewelry. It is very glittery, I&#x27;m 48 and love bling and use this when I go out dancing!</li>
    <li> I hate buying shimmery lotions that are not shimmery enough of me. Now depending on your use for this, that will determine if this is right for you. It truly glitters. The flakes are bigger but not big enough to be noticeable on your skin when the light is not reflecting on it. I love the colors of the flakes and I would purchase more of this when I&#x27;m all out.</li>
