    <li> good value for the money and as remembered when I had used it years ago. nice clean scent without being overbearing and lasts quite awhile throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great price for a hard to find cologne...</li>
    <li> these products are best on the market and I bought 3 because they are not available on the local market.</li>
    <li> Do you like how you smell after leaving the barber shop? Then you will love this scent. It reminds me of the powder barbers use. Soft (not overpowering), but lasts a long time. This is a Cologne Splash which means it does not come in a spray bottle. You do have to be careful with a splash or you can put too much in your hand. Luckily, this is a big bottle. Eight ounces is quite a lot. Give it a try. It&#x27;s been around a long time and is different than most of the strong men&#x27;s scents being put out today.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be a very bad knockoff. No tingle when you apply it and no lingering aroma after one minute. The low price should have been a clue.</li>
    <li> service and product were good.</li>
    <li> Impossible item to find this at retail outlets.&lt;br /&gt;cons: fragrance not as strong/lasting as I remembered&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this</li>
    <li> Love this Cologne on my Hubby!</li>
    <li> Keeps my husband smelling good.</li>
    <li> good price- great product</li>
    <li> Smells great this is a great product recommend it to anyone.  makes a great gift for birthdays or christmas time.</li>
    <li> Colgne, after shave, perfume etc... are personal things ! Every one prefered different fragance. I have been using this cologne and others over $100/bottle over 30 years. This is the only one that I got complement from ladies young and not so young from U S and many other countries as well ! Amazing, this is the only one !!! Amazon is the place that I can get the best prices from !</li>
    <li> Excellent. Arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> if you are younger...I wont suggest you buy this...it reminds me of the old barber shop or the spray in some restaurant&#x27;s bathroom. Not a big fan. They wont let you return it once you buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for a 50-year-old relative and he loved it. It is strong and lasting. Good choice for those above 40 years old.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF USED THIS SINCE I WAS 20 NOW 70 LOL STILL GETS THE GALS THEY ALL SAY YOUNG AND OLD ?????..  GOD YOU SMELL GOOD … SEE IT WORKS</li>
    <li> Got this for my dad for christmas. He loved it.</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy</li>
    <li> I found this scent very pleasing and, just as importantly, long lasting.  For the price, the only other cologne that can compare that I know of it Old Spice, which is equally as good.  I certainly would recommend this cologne to anybody.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and quite inexpensive.. thanks!</li>
    <li> Beware item I received doesn&#x27;t have nozzle to spray cologne on me. How to use a cologne with the spray pump on it?</li>
    <li> the price is good  its hard to find a local stores except during holiday like Christmas  so order on line from amazon and stay stocked up for the year  and you don&#x27;t have to buy those packs with soap  you don&#x27;t use</li>
