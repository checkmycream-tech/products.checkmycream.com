    <li> The scent is amazing! My boyfriend loves it too!</li>
    <li> Sorry it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
    <li> I had this product before in a bottle, so when I ordered the same product in a tube, I expected the exactly same quality. However, the product has slightly different fragrance. It is not bad; it is just different. Also, the smell of this lotion is not lasting. My previous lotion lasted over six hours, but this one stays on my skin less than three hours. I have a feeling that this product is a perjury. In overall, I kept my purchase anyway; however, I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> excellent,love love Forever midnight.</li>
    <li> I wish bath and body works didn&#x27;t discontinue Forever Midnight.</li>

    <li> I prefer the body cream over their lotion but I absolutely love this scent and I know they will retire it soon.</li>
