### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This one is absolutely delicious.</li>
      <li>Have to keep looking for that perfect Vanilla, I guess.</li>
      <li>and I commented how delicious her scent smelled, and she told me it was Vanille.  </li>
      <li>Or, a wonderful well rounded vanilla/sweet myrrh scent by Santa Maria Novella called Opoponax; it&#x27;s very unique!</li>
      <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing - the best vanilla scent, period.  </li>
      <li>I loved this scent so when I found it online</li>
      <li>It smells so good you could eat it.  </li>
      <li>Like many folks, I am still pining away for L&#x27;Occitaine&#x27;s Vanilla, which was the world&#x27;s most perfect smelling vanilla fragrance ever.</li>
      <li>but unfortunately so many scents smell too sugary and fake....not this one!</li>
      <li>I love this perfume!</li>
      <li>and you smell nice all</li>
      <li>Years ago I used a vanilla fragrance that I really liked and received compliments on, but this did not come close.</li>
      <li>Not spending $100 on a bottle of perfume is a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>This is the best smelling fragrance, just a light sweet vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>I have a ton of vanilla lotions and perfumes and this is by far the best smell.  </li>
      <li>Now, I love the smell of sugar cookies baking, so it&#x27;s a nice scent . .</li>
      <li>When I find a suitable replacement, I will let everyone know.</li>
      <li>Great Vanilla scent, nice and aromatic, beautiful bottle and label, and from a long time Paris based company.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something that was warmer, more caramel-ly.</li>
      <li>I renewed my relationship with this scent and have had many compliments since.</li>
      <li>I was hoping Vanille would be just as yummy and become another favorite.</li>
      <li>this perfume to me, smells more like sugar cookies than vanilla perfume.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, and I&#x27;ve been told that I smell like cupcakes, chocolate, and cookies.</li>
      <li>totally affordable and totally awesome.</li>
      <li>I use it for a room spray because it can disperse and smells better.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>If you like vanilla you&#x27;ll love this</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE vanilla....</li>
      <li>No, probably not and neither have I. I work in healthcare and can&#x27;t wear anything strong smelling.</li>
      <li>it was so strong.</li>
      <li>Overly sweet - more so than the stuff in the grocery store for baking and cooking.</li>
      <li>Love this super sweet vanilla scent!</li>
      <li>That one was more musky, where this one is sweet (&amp; for some it may seem too sweet)</li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re into rich, lucious vanilla scents try the Vanilla by Les Nerides.</li>
      <li>I got really excited.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re usually quite unique and wonderful!</li>
      <li>For a warm true vanilla fragrance, actual vanilla extract dabbed on the skin smells better to me than Vanille.</li>
      <li>I purchased 2 bottles without sniffing first thinking this is from Paris and should be great, but it smells like the cheapest possible vanilla.</li>
      <li>It is such a good vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>This is a super sweet smelling vanilla.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good layered under other scents for special nights as well.</li>
      <li>Clearly lots of women love Vanille, but if you don&#x27;t care for those vanilla-scented candles, this may not be your fragrance.</li>
      <li>This, in my opinion, actually smells better once it been sprayed on which isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
      <li>of course it&#x27;s cheaper online and at my local beauty store :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m normally not a huge vanilla fan as so many smell cheap to me.  </li>
      <li>This is the beet perfume I have ever smelled or worn, it is so subtle and nice, not overpowering at all!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>so I know it very well.</li>
      <li>i first smelled it on an old hair dresser and went to anthropologie to find it.</li>
      <li>It smells somewhat like cotton candy at first, but settles into a nice subtle vanilla scent after a bit.</li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, I sent this back and the seller was very reasonable about the whole transaction.</li>
      <li>I bought this a few years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  </li>
      <li>For that warm, \\&quot;sugar cookie\\&quot; fragrance that other reviewers talk about, I much prefer Pink Sugar by Aquolina.</li>
      <li>This will be my favorite fragrance for a long,  long time!</li>
      <li>Pink Sugar is sweet (as the name promises), with a hint of vanilla, powder, and spun sugar.</li>
      <li>Or it is so old it somehow has turned to alcohol and COMPLETELY  lost its scent.</li>
      <li>I thought this scent was a little bit too sweet, even for vanilla.  </li>
      <li>I used this fragrance a long time ago and put it away, half full.  </li>
      <li>first found this at Anthropologie a few years ago.</li>
      <li>This batch seems less strong then others ordered in the past,  </li>

<li> But it&#x27;s enough to feel feminine and pretty, yet it&#x27;s subtle enough to mistaken for a lotion or hair product.</li>
<li> Long lasting!</li>
<li> This bottle has lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Does not last as long and just seems watered down.</li>
<li> And you only need a little bit so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
<li> Now it just smells like alcohol and it is such a waste.</li>
<li> It smells sweet but not in a tacky artificial way.  </li>
<li> Smells like REAL vanilla, not imitation crap.</li>
<li> I bought this at a little shop in hollywood b/c</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long at all, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve gone through at least 4 bottles of this perfume.  </li>
<li> I mean, have you ever found someone that said &amp;#34;yuck, I hate the smell of real vanilla&amp;#34;?</li>
<li> like vanilla because it offends no one ever and is subtle.</li>
<li> When I sprayed it on myself it made me nauseated</li>
<li> I like it, but when I am out in public strangers get it my face about how horrible this fragrance smells.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I found it to be cloying and artificial, identical to the fake aroma used in vanilla candles.</li>
<li> Even if I didn&#x27;t it would be impossible not to notice that somewhere along the line this was diluted with alcohol.</li>
<li> Highly disappointed.</li>

    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing - the best vanilla scent, period.  People always ask me what I&#x27;m wearing when I spray it on.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a little shop in hollywood b/c I absolutely LOVE vanilla....but unfortunately so many scents smell too sugary and fake....not this one! This one is absolutely delicious. Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This is the one scent I wear all the time ...for years.  This batch seems less strong then others ordered in the past,  but I would still order this over and over again.</li>
    <li> ha ha....this perfume to me, smells more like sugar cookies than vanilla perfume.  Now, I love the smell of sugar cookies baking, so it&#x27;s a nice scent . . .just not vanilla.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of L&#x27;Aromarine fragrances. Especially the sweeter scents like Mure Musc, Cola, etc. I was hoping Vanille would be just as yummy and become another favorite. Unfortunately, I found it to be cloying and artificial, identical to the fake aroma used in vanilla candles. After a couple of hours, I could no longer stand the smell, and scrubbed my skin to get it off. For that warm, \\&quot;sugar cookie\\&quot; fragrance that other reviewers talk about, I much prefer Pink Sugar by Aquolina. Pink Sugar is sweet (as the name promises), with a hint of vanilla, powder, and spun sugar. For a warm true vanilla fragrance, actual vanilla extract dabbed on the skin smells better to me than Vanille. Clearly lots of women love Vanille, but if you don&#x27;t care for those vanilla-scented candles, this may not be your fragrance. I will still continue to buy L&#x27;Aromarine scents. They&#x27;re usually quite unique and wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally not a huge vanilla fan as so many smell cheap to me.  This perfume is so different.  It smells sweet but not in a tacky artificial way.  I don&#x27;t smell the perfume on me after a while but I&#x27;m constantly being asked what I&#x27;m wearing.  This, in my opinion, actually smells better once it been sprayed on which isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
    <li> I like it, but when I am out in public strangers get it my face about how horrible this fragrance smells.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I love the smell, and I&#x27;ve been told that I smell like cupcakes, chocolate, and cookies. I love this perfume!</li>
    <li> I used this fragrance a long time ago and put it away, half full.  Recently, I was at a luncheon and I smelled it nearby. A woman who was at an ajacent table was wearing it and I commented how delicious her scent smelled, and she told me it was Vanille.  I renewed my relationship with this scent and have had many compliments since.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume to replace the Vanilla eau de toilete from L&#x27;Occitane I always wore but it was discontinued.  That one was more musky, where this one is sweet (&amp; for some it may seem too sweet) but I like the smell.  Unfortunately, the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long at all, otherwise I would give it 5 stars.  Have to keep looking for that perfect Vanilla, I guess.</li>
    <li> This is a super sweet smelling vanilla. I was looking for something that was warmer, more caramel-ly. Like many folks, I am still pining away for L&#x27;Occitaine&#x27;s Vanilla, which was the world&#x27;s most perfect smelling vanilla fragrance ever. When I find a suitable replacement, I will let everyone know. Meanwhile, I sent this back and the seller was very reasonable about the whole transaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this scent for years. Very simple no fuss scent. If you like vanilla you&#x27;ll love this</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling fragrance, just a light sweet vanilla scent.  And you only need a little bit so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this fragrance, nor did my boy friend.  Years ago I used a vanilla fragrance that I really liked and received compliments on, but this did not come close.</li>
    <li> Love this super sweet vanilla scent! It smells somewhat like cotton candy at first, but settles into a nice subtle vanilla scent after a bit. Long lasting! Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume today! This bottle has lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first found this at Anthropologie a few years ago. Saw on Amazon and decided to buy. Smells like REAL vanilla, not imitation crap. High quality. Only need a squirt and you smell nice all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like vanilla because it offends no one ever and is subtle. I mean, have you ever found someone that said &amp;#34;yuck, I hate the smell of real vanilla&amp;#34;? No, probably not and neither have I. I work in healthcare and can&#x27;t wear anything strong smelling. But it&#x27;s enough to feel feminine and pretty, yet it&#x27;s subtle enough to mistaken for a lotion or hair product.</li>
    <li> like it a lot  like it a lot.  I suggest you not require a number of words. it makes me not want to write anything</li>
    <li> It smells so good you could eat it.  I get compliments all of the time and I&#x27;ve started giving as a gift.</li>
    <li> I thought this scent was a little bit too sweet, even for vanilla.  I use it for a room spray because it can disperse and smells better.  When I sprayed it on myself it made me nauseated it was so strong.</li>
    <li> I loved this scent so when I found it online I got really excited. After about a week of wearing it, it totally lost its scent. Now it just smells like alcohol and it is such a waste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfum for years (have bought through Anthropologie before they stopped carrying) so I know it very well. Even if I didn&#x27;t it would be impossible not to notice that somewhere along the line this was diluted with alcohol. Or it is so old it somehow has turned to alcohol and COMPLETELY  lost its scent. There&#x27;s no scent whatsoever. Highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  Thank you Amazon for carrying it!  It is such a good vanilla scent.  I have a ton of vanilla lotions and perfumes and this is by far the best smell.  I always get compliments when I am wearing this.</li>
    <li> This is the beet perfume I have ever smelled or worn, it is so subtle and nice, not overpowering at all! I am sold! This will be my favorite fragrance for a long,  long time!</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 bottles without sniffing first thinking this is from Paris and should be great, but it smells like the cheapest possible vanilla. Overly sweet - more so than the stuff in the grocery store for baking and cooking. The L&#x27;Aromarine Vanille was such a dissapointment. If you&#x27;re into rich, lucious vanilla scents try the Vanilla by Les Nerides. Or, a wonderful well rounded vanilla/sweet myrrh scent by Santa Maria Novella called Opoponax; it&#x27;s very unique!</li>
    <li> Great Vanilla scent, nice and aromatic, beautiful bottle and label, and from a long time Paris based company.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> this is my signature scent. I wear it daily. it&#x27;s good layered under other scents for special nights as well. totally affordable and totally awesome. i first smelled it on an old hair dresser and went to anthropologie to find it. of course it&#x27;s cheaper online and at my local beauty store :)</li>
    <li> I have worn this for quite awhile but feel like they have changed the mixture. Does not last as long and just seems watered down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through at least 4 bottles of this perfume.  My husband loves it, and I get compliments all the time.  Not spending $100 on a bottle of perfume is a nice bonus.</li>
