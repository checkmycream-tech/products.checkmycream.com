<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The purchase looks just as it is presented in the picture.     I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the shipping time, but the item itself is perfect.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Helps with dry, itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Yes it took ages to arrive but it was coming from Africa. Yes the container was broken upon arrival but the contents were in no way damaged by this. This product is amazing!!! I use it for everything. My lips, my skin, my tattoos, my hair... the list goes on. It has almost no smell and what little smell it does have is natural and pleasant. It may seem a little gritty as you warm it up in your hands but this is an allusion as the granuals disintegrate as it melts. My favourite is how it is making my hair healthier. Once a week I work it into my scalp and hair and let it sit overnight. No more itchy dry scalp and my hair seems thicker and seems to grow faster. Yes it does look greasy but it washes out easily with shampoo. I love all natural products that are multi purpose and this is one of them. Plus 32 oz lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It came in before it was supposed! I use it on my elbow and it really helps lol! :D This product is great &lt;33 it has a fairly weird smell but its easy to get over!</li>
    <li> Great shea butter. But, the sncet is a little strong.</li>
    <li> Upon arriving, I had doubts about the products because, it was in big lumps in the containers. Since I have finally opened the product for use, I love it. It&#x27;s very smooth after rubbing together in your hands. I add a tad bit of oil to mine...helps with smoothing the product out.</li>
    <li> Product arrived really quickly and look as descrided and picture.  Good quality, consistent with what I have purchased from other venders in the past.</li>
    <li> I use it for everything, hair and skin and it smells super good too me. The price is amazing considering the amount you&#x27;re getting...a good purchase for sure..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m use to the yellow one that&#x27;s more moisturizing this is less greasy ...its cool I live in tx  where as I stayed in nj before where yellow Shea butter was necessary</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff for what I used it for.</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter! I&#x27;ve ordered 5 so far, and use it daily. I&#x27;ve seen great changes in my skin, so soft and not greasy. Perfect for all skin types!</li>
    <li> The best, I love it, it leaves your skin smouth, it helped a lot with my cracked heals, I will buy more</li>
    <li> Because I was very satisfied with the product even came in a timely manner. It&#x27;s the actual product I was looking for. One Negative thing I do have to say and it&#x27;s not really negative but it could use a better container to ship it in really not a big deal the product speaks for itself</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted! Arrived in a timely manner. This butter was better in value and quality than what I bought from a local seller. Will use this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as expected and arrived earlier than expected too.</li>

    <li> The real deal! Not to hard. Smells light and wonderful. Keeps my skin soft and moisturized. I also use it in my hair. I had been searching for a quality shea butter for a while now.

Arrived quickly by priority mail. No complaints and highly recommend.</li>
