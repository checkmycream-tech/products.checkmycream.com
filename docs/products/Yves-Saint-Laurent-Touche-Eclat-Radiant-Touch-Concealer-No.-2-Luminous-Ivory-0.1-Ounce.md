      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>Have purchased this over and over and always pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>Women love it.</li>
      <li>This is the best corrector out there, definitely!</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>love it love it</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>just wish it contained more product.  </li>
      <li>Nothing better on the market than this.</li>
      <li>I love this concealer.</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>I have given this to my two daughters and they also love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>wife says that it is one of her favorite makeup accessories.</li>
      <li>The product is okay, but pricey.  </li>
      <li>But there are cheaper better options.</li>
      <li>I can surely understand why that is so.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure one pays for the Yves Saint Laurent name.</li>
      <li>This is the first concealer/highlighter I have found that not only matches my fair complexion but it also has excellent coverage.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is the best reference point for any product that you might need, and if you become a prime member you have free second day</li>
      <li>Make sure it is the genuine YSL</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply this just where you want it.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on as easily, thicker.</li>
      <li>It was amazing and love it so much.</li>
      <li>firstly i think it is too light for me because i do not go to do the test while blogger reccomend and the 2 is best for Asian.</li>
      <li>real product is amazing and lasts all day as a light concealer.</li>
      <li>I think some people were trying to justify their expenditure by giving this product such great reviews.    </li>
      <li>Smooth coverage.  </li>
      <li>Use it lightly wherever you feel you need coverage.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
      <li>Consistency not as smooth.</li>
      <li>Went on smoothly and does not show wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>I also use it on the bridge of my nose to make my nose look more prominent (I have a flat nose) and on my chin to make it look more prominent.</li>
      <li>I know the price is high for something this size, but they DO love it!</li>
      <li>Well, it&#x27;s very nice, slim design, and I like the fact that I only pump out the amount I need.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>Also the color that comes out of the pen is way lighter than the original YSL.</li>
      <li>not the right color, not the right texture (more of a tooth paste...).</li>
      <li>I love that you can control how much you use by clicking the pen-like dispenser.</li>
      <li>I paid full price for this, but got a counterfeit.</li>
      <li>May not be true product....</li>
      <li>but overall do good job</li>
      <li>I would get an original product, but upon opening it I realized that it didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
      <li>My biggest issue is dark under-eye circles, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried even comes close to doing as good of a job at concealing them as this brilliant little pen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, not heavy at all and doesn&#x27;t sit in the lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy, provides good overage without looking heavy or too made up, and it does not cake up in creases and fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I think any woman who knows much of anything about &amp;#34;shading&amp;#34; that is over 25 uses this or something like it to light up (and thus blur)</li>
      <li>Great product, covers blemishes without being too heavy and highlights your skin with a luminous glow.</li>
      <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>It really is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Bought  this from Sephora and loved the way it covered dark areas and highlighted my face.  </li>
      <li>Is exactly the right shade for</li>
      <li>It is light, not heavy, glides on, under and over make-up, which ever you</li>
      <li>First clue.</li>
      <li>Have been using Touch Eclat for years and this is not the real thing!</li>
      <li>It really helps to cover the &amp;#34;I am still exhausted&amp;#34; look over my under eye concealer in the morning!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> # 2 Ivory is like &amp;#34;Snow White&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> DONT BUY IT IS FAKE!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an old favourite i my cosmetics bag, wouldn&#x27;t be without it........havn&#x27;t found one that matches its superb performance</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle!  It really helps to cover the &amp;#34;I am still exhausted&amp;#34; look over my under eye concealer in the morning!  I love it!</li>
    <li> May not be true product....case is different color gold. First clue. Print on case slightly different. 2nd clue. Consistency not as smooth. Doesn&#x27;t go on as easily, thicker.</li>
    <li> I purchased two &#x27;touche elat&#x27; products. Both products needed numerous &#x27;clicks&#x27; to engage product. The contents of the first product appeared to run out very quickly and also dry out. This has not happened to me before. If I have similar experience with the second box, I will not order through Amazon again. Product was still expensive - not much savings. Don&#x27;t know if supplier provided old product.</li>
    <li> Bought  this from Sephora and loved the way it covered dark areas and highlighted my face.  Looked so pretty. And then after two days of use I noticed red scaly puffiness near my eyes.  Stopped wearing my contacts and attributed to a cold I was getting.  Still wore it and used more and then finally saw that the Toche&#x27; was causing the puffiness and red flaky skin.  Not sure what is in the product to cause such a sensitivity will be sending back</li>
    <li> i use this as a concealer, it says highlighter but I wonder if that&#x27;s the same as concealing.  Well, it&#x27;s very nice, slim design, and I like the fact that I only pump out the amount I need.  mess free!</li>
    <li> A bit translucent​ but very smooth coverage that doesn&#x27;t cake during the day.  Am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchased this. I have tried other very similar products but I think this is the best of its kind. It&#x27;s easy to apply this just where you want it. The consistency is great -  It&#x27;s creamy, provides good overage without looking heavy or too made up, and it does not cake up in creases and fine lines around my eyes.  It&#x27;s great as a highlighter or for under eyes.</li>
    <li> I have reordered this product several times.  It is good for under eye concealer but not good for blemishes.  It is a tad luminescent so it might tend to draw attention to blemishes.  Not so luminescent that you have raccoon eyes though.  Great product!</li>
    <li> My favorite fix up product. love it love it love it</li>
    <li> I have been using Touch Éclat forever, I use the number 2 winter and autumn,  and number 3 during the summer. It is easy to apply, moreover it clarifies the eyes! Beatriz</li>
    <li> This is the best corrector out there, definitely! Women love it. I know the price is high for something this size, but they DO love it!</li>
    <li> This is an expensive product, and well worth it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it.  It&#x27;s very light, not heavy at all and doesn&#x27;t sit in the lines under my eyes.</li>
    <li> this product not only burned my eyes it caused pain.&lt;br /&gt;please protect yourself from this concealer.  It is to&lt;br /&gt;my mind a real danger.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, this was not what I expected.  The others were creamy and a different shade!</li>
    <li> Awesome delivery time and product.  I would recommend this product to girl friends and to family members. This product was recommended by a friend and it really works.</li>
    <li> firstly i think it is too light for me because i do not go to do the test while blogger reccomend and the 2 is best for Asian. so i choose this and it is good but a little bit of dry. u need to do mositure well.</li>
    <li> Nothing better on the market than this.</li>
    <li> Accidently discovered this product. It can be used as a light touch cover-up or full face make-up base.  Works really well.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> This came on the scene about 10 years ago now and has been a classic make-up must have for years now. I think any woman who knows much of anything about &amp;#34;shading&amp;#34; that is over 25 uses this or something like it to light up (and thus blur) those bags/wrinkled areas etc. I also use it on the bridge of my nose to make my nose look more prominent (I have a flat nose) and on my chin to make it look more prominent. This is the &amp;#34;Cadillac&amp;#34; of wrinkle/bag reduction/shading.</li>
    <li> I think some people were trying to justify their expenditure by giving this product such great reviews.    It&#x27;s expensive and doesn&#x27;t work any better at covering dark circles, etc. than cheaper drugstore versions.    Save your money unless you like to look \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; when pulling this out of your purse for a touch up.</li>
    <li> This is THE highlighter to which all others aspire, even if some people can&#x27;t pronounce it. Highlight, brighten, conceal? Check, check, and check. &#x27;nuff said.</li>
    <li> This is the first concealer/highlighter I have found that not only matches my fair complexion but it also has excellent coverage.  It has lasted a 12 hour work day without any issues and I have used it once for an outdoor wedding mid-summer in Texas without it running down my face due to the heat and humidity.</li>
    <li> Read about this in Vogue and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Great product, covers blemishes without being too heavy and highlights your skin with a luminous glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d tried a sample of YSL Radiant Touch before ordering it on Amazon. I loved the product, but when this arrived the packaging was really disappointing - I&#x27;m not sure if this is a manufacturer error or what, but when i first used it it was really hard to get any of the product out. I clicked the button several times and nothing happened. Then (this is after over 30 seconds) I clicked again and a huge glob came out all at once! This stuff is expensive, so I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about wasting so much on my first attempted application.</li>
    <li> This stuff is overrated! Its on like every &amp;#34;Must Buy&amp;#34; list but I just don&#x27;t think its that good! Its fine, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But there are cheaper better options. Plus the push button feature makes it less easy to control the amount it dispenses.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is real.  It&#x27;s much lighter weight than my old one and very hard to get the top off.,</li>
    <li> This is the best under eye cover that you can purchase. It is amazing does not go into the fine lines around your eyes makes you look more awake and maybe a little bit younger. Make sure it is the genuine YSL I am convinced that I got a counterfeit once on Amazon I could tell the difference.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this, as it is not the real product. It is not the right texture or color, Go to Nordstrom and pay the $40 to get the real thing, or go to a drugstore to get a cheaper product, as you will at least have the ingredients listed.</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer/highlighter I&#x27;ve ever used.  I would recommend, however, that you don&#x27;t click 30 times to get it started as instructed.  I got an awful lot on 30 clicks, far more than needed!  Maybe do 5 or 10 clicks at a time.</li>
    <li> This is far and away the best concealer money can buy. It was recommended to me by a makeup artist who puts it high on his list of must have products. He calls it &amp;#34;8 hours sleep in a tube&amp;#34; because of how well it covers dark circles. It isn&#x27;t cheap but I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on a recent Consumer Reports Shop Smart review.  I see no difference between this product at $40 and other eye concealers at half the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this product for a while and finally decided to order it on amazon. It was amazing and love it so much. Just bought the foundation as well!!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay. I live a solid stick cover up better.</li>
    <li> Too light, not good coverage.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I read a lot of fashion magazines and all the celebrities raving about this product. This is really great product. It&#x27;s mainly used as a highlighter, that&#x27;s how YSL advertises it. This product is not gonna make you happy if you are looking for a concealer, but great if you are looking to highlight certain parts of your face.</li>
    <li> Touche Eclat Radiant touch is supposed to be the most world wide purchased cosmetic...I can surely understand why that is so.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried this I know why people like it so much. I use it as a highlighter, nots a concealer, and it works great. I love that you can control how much you use by clicking the pen-like dispenser.</li>
    <li> Yves Saint Laurent TOUCHE ECLATRadiant Touch 2 Luminous Ivory YVES SAINT LAURENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says that it is one of her favorite makeup accessories.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s YSL! Always perfect! No need to say more!</li>
    <li> I dont&#x27; wear a lot of make up but this is a staple  glad a friend of mine tld me about it!!</li>
    <li> not a good quality product and cannot recommend.  blah blah blah why do i have to write more when my message is:  don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> Pricey so I won&#x27;t buy it again because regular concealer will do the same thing if you know how to apply it.  But I do like it.</li>
    <li> Is exactly the right shade for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it contained more product.  But you can carry it in your handbag.</li>
    <li> The product is okay, but pricey.  There are other products which do the same thing at a better price.  I&#x27;m sure one pays for the Yves Saint Laurent name.</li>
    <li> I truly think this is the best concealer out there.  Works great and easy to use applicator.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites and I would not be without it!</li>
    <li> It really does work to brighten and lighten areas on the face and also under the eyes.  Worth the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and this particular tube seemed to be old-- it is very thick and not easily blend able.  Normally it&#x27;s very creamy and soft. I think this tube was sitting on a shelf somewhere for a long time and was not fresh. :(</li>
    <li> Put more convenient in the bag, can use at any time, just can&#x27;t press too much, will produce too much liquid, there will be little waste</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about YSL&#x27;s Touche Eclat. It&#x27;s so easy to use, it&#x27;s not messy, it actually matches my skin tone, it goes on smoothly, it blends well, it actually covers up dark circles, I use two to three clicks every morning, and it lasts for four to five months. It&#x27;s just wonderful. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, this product is a fake! Have been using Touch Eclat for years and this is not the real thing! not the right color, not the right texture (more of a tooth paste...). Very disappointing that Amazon keeps working with this seller!!</li>
    <li> The shade is lighter than the ones produced and commercialized in other countries.</li>
    <li> People gush about this product, and I never understood what all the hype was about until I finally tried it for myself. I don&#x27;t think this stuff is the best highlighter on the market, but as a concealer, it is hands-down the best product on the market right now, bar none. My biggest issue is dark under-eye circles, and nothing I&#x27;ve tried even comes close to doing as good of a job at concealing them as this brilliant little pen. You get what you pay for in most cases, and in this instance, $40 is money well spent.</li>
    <li> This under eye concealer is the best.  Went on smoothly and does not show wrinkles.  Blends in beautifully.  Have purchased this over and over and always pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I read a review of this stuff that said &amp;#34;better than plastic surgery&amp;#34; - and i have to say, it&#x27;s not far from the truth.  It really is worth every penny.  Smooth coverage.  Great texture.  Hides bags and dark circles.  Make the Hollywood V under your eye and blend, after foundation, but before blush!</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking I would get an original product, but upon opening it I realized that it didn&#x27;t feel right. The weight of the product was different, and then I realized the cap on this was way longer than the cap on the original YSL. Also the color that comes out of the pen is way lighter than the original YSL. I paid full price for this, but got a counterfeit.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years. Great for obliterating my under eye dark spots &amp; for hiding uneven skin tone on my face. Well worth every penny. This company sells it for a very good price!</li>
    <li> WOW! I love it!!!  Great for highlighting around the eyes, the nasal bridge, and brow bones. Does not contain a lot of much if any at all shimmer so the look is very subtle.</li>
    <li> I have used Yves Saint Laurent Touch&amp;eacute; Luminous Radiance for five years, and I would not be without. I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes, but this provides coverage and luminosity for that area. I use it on both sides of my nose, my chin and upper lip. It is the most remarkable product. I have tried many products to cover imperfections, but this really is the best. It is light, not heavy, glides on, under and over make-up, which ever you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to purchase this product on a TV Selling show, but they stopped carrying it. Amazon is the best reference point for any product that you might need, and if you become a prime member you have free second day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important point in using this product is that you need to pump the chamber 30 times at least for the product to appear . Use it lightly wherever you feel you need coverage. You will not be disappointed. I have given this to my two daughters and they also love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-02-12</li>
    <li> For those of us with racoon eyes, this has been the best concealer I&#x27;ve used yet.  Lightening and covering without appearing like a concealer.</li>
    <li> It was very cheap, and as a result it was fake.&lt;br /&gt;The real product is amazing and lasts all day as a light concealer. Save your money and buy the real thing instead.</li>
    <li> Very hard to open - needs new case.  Otherwise, works well.</li>
    <li> Tube never dispensed product.  I don&#x27;t know if there was any product at all in the tube</li>
    <li> its nice to cover blk spot or undereye...i love it its nice product but i dont use it too much so cant say how long i can use it ..but overall do good job</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  There&#x27;s nights I don&#x27;t get enough sleep and when I use this I look awake and refreshed.  This is a beauty must-have!!</li>
    <li> Use this everyday for years!! Love it..</li>
    <li> Been buying the original product for years and this product is fake.  Nothing like the real stuff. Thick, smelly and a different package (although quite close!).</li>
    <li> I love this concealer. It is light and yet covers well, but best of all doesn&#x27;t fill in or cake wrinkles. I have used it for several years so I know when you start one of these you have to pump quite a while to charge the tube but it does come. This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought from this site, and it did take a long time to arrive, but I disagree with the others, it seems the genuine article to me it is exactly the same as all the others I have purchased.</li>
