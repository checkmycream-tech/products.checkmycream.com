<li> Works on a miriad of minor skin problems.</li>
<li> However, being a fixative, it enhances other fragrances, such as fruity, woody, or flowery scent.</li>
<li> /&gt;The only difference is Now oils aren&#x27;t over inflated on price like some other oils are.</li>
<li> I stood correctly, while experts described it sharp, warm-spicy, and earthy.</li>
<li> I mix with frankincense sometimes, or other oils.</li>
<li> I have been purchasing this product for 2 years and have always had a difficult time getting the Myrrh oil out of the bottle because it was thick like a syrup, usually took the dripper insert out of the bottle,now the Myrrh oil has a more thinner consistency.</li>
<li> just not right.</li>
<li> Also, the frequency of getting the sores has gone way down.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t think this is lesser quality oil just because it&#x27;s less expensive than other brands.&lt;br</li>
<li> Warning, it tastes bad but well worth it.</li>
<li> My first time with Myrrh was so unpleasant that I did some research on its &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is also being used heavily in perfumery since ancient time.</li>
<li> Tastes nasty but heals quickly.</li>
<li> The oil is very thick</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t taste bad in my homemade toothpaste though.  </li>
<li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>

    <li> A handy item to have in the first aid kit. Works on a miriad of minor skin problems.</li>
    <li> Between Christmas and New Years, my infected tooth really flared up and my dentist was closed for the holidays. I&#x27;ve put myrrh oil on the area and it truly does help. I can highly recommend this for oral problems. In my opinion, NOW sells quality essential oils at affordable prices.</li>
    <li> Great oil! Some NOW oils are lesser quality than more expensive brands, but that&#x27;s not the case with this oil. This Myrrh is definitely the real deal...so there&#x27;s no need to pay more.</li>
    <li> Great oil at a great price! Don&#x27;t think this is lesser quality oil just because it&#x27;s less expensive than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;The only difference is Now oils aren&#x27;t over inflated on price like some other oils are.</li>
    <li> This is quality Myrrh at a great price. I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s healing abilities. I&#x27;ve used it on pimples and sores in my mouth. Tastes nasty but heals quickly. It doesn&#x27;t taste bad in my homemade toothpaste though.  Will buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;And as always, amazon provides great service.</li>
    <li> Excellent antifungal for the toe nails.</li>
    <li> product arrived timely and intact</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe you can get a whole ounce of Myrrh essential oil for this price!  I have paid this price many times for a tiny little bottle at the local health food stores!  Plus I simply LOVE the NOW brand of essential oils!</li>
    <li> This is the real thing !!!</li>
    <li> Being a Myrrh virgin, I bought several brands just to compare. Now Foods&#x27; Myrrh smell in par with all the more expensive brands; a value buy indeed. Due to its healing power mentally and physically, this precious oil can be used in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also being used heavily in perfumery since ancient time. So, how does it smell like? I imagined it being woody, spicy, resinous, and cooling; a bit like its cousin Frankincense. The truth, to my nose, is latex glove, new leather shoe, and freshly-cut mushroom. My first time with Myrrh was so unpleasant that I did some research on its &amp;#34;aroma&amp;#34;. I stood correctly, while experts described it sharp, warm-spicy, and earthy. Perhaps it will take some time to get used to its unique aroma. However, being a fixative, it enhances other fragrances, such as fruity, woody, or flowery scent.</li>
    <li> An excellent product that I use in skin care, age-defying blend, and also for oral health.  I have bought this brand of Myrrh several times now and plan on sticking to it.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Winona</li>
    <li> This Myrrh EO is 100% myrrh - no carrier oil added. Lovely aroma.</li>
    <li> Now has the BEST essential oils at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice essential oil.  Good price and a reputable company to purchase essential oils from.</li>
    <li> Some one told me that Dr. Oz said to use 3 to 5 drops in a quarter cup of water and swish it around in your mouth for a couple of minutes for Canka  sores. It is unbelievable how great it works.  I have used it 3 times and each time the pain went away almost immediately. The pain stays away for a long time. Also, the frequency of getting the sores has gone way down. Warning, it tastes bad but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Bought it to concoct my own bug deterrent oil blend. Works great :)!</li>
    <li> Fast ship and great oil!!!</li>
    <li> Good deal for a good oil.  The oil is very thick so I made the stopper hole larger so the oil could come out more quickly.  Excellent for skin for and treating skin conditions.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed. I received my Now oil today, opened the package, cracked the lid open to smell this fantastic oil and.....it smells funny...just not right. Look at the label...NOT what I ordered or paid for. I bought 100% pure myrrh oil as shown by the photo and the description, but I got 20% pre diluted oil in its place. I&#x27;ll be requesting a full refund including my shipping as I was only given 80% of the product I ordered and for my use...it&#x27;s 100% unusable.</li>
    <li> I love it. I put a some in everything I can think of. Face and body lotions,(they feel creamier and softer on skin). Put in my mouthwash(breath stays fresher longer). I mix with frankincense sometimes, or other oils. Love the smell. Makes me feel earthy and back to nature, relaxed.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Exactly what I expected.  Now Foods is great source of EO&#x27;s.  Always verify plant species and extraction method.  Buyer be responsible.</li>
    <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
    <li> Good quality oil.  Just what I expect from my Amazon vendors!</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this product for 2 years and have always had a difficult time getting the Myrrh oil out of the bottle because it was thick like a syrup, usually took the dripper insert out of the bottle,now the Myrrh oil has a more thinner consistency. I hope they have not compromised the quality of the oil by diluting it.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil. fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I received the Myrrh oil on the estimated time.  Packaging was great.  I use this oil on face and hair, I love it.  I would recommended.</li>
    <li> I was blessed with this product</li>
    <li> Good product. Would recommend!</li>
