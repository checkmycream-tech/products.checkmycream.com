      <li>The covering material rips too easily.</li>
      <li>A testament to how strong the suction cups are, I guess,</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>The pillow was comfortable and nice at first.</li>
      <li>We have had 2 of these pillows and while they are comfortable they tend to rip easily, fill up with water and need to be replaced.</li>
      <li>Comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Comfy fit for tub-time.</li>
      <li>Comfortable</li>
      <li>The suction cups are really powerful, be sure to slide the pillow out of the tub and DO NOT PULL.</li>
      <li>This has been great, especially in the winter time.</li>
      <li>I like that I can easily clean it.  </li>
      <li>The suction cups really hold in place and the pillow cradles my head very comfortably.</li>
      <li>you can really relax and enjoy the whirlpool.  </li>
      <li>It proves my theory that quality things can be affordable.</li>
      <li>First use, I stuck it on the bathtub and went to reposition it and one of the suction cups ripped right off.  </li>
      <li>Was using it and tried sliding it to adjust it and the suction cups remained holding strong, but the plastic they were attached to ripped completely exposing  the inside foam which can no longer be submerged in the tub now.</li>
      <li>The picture show you what happened the first time she used it.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and dry.</li>
      <li>This pillow is very soft yet still provides adequate comfort.</li>
      <li>Suction cups on the back are STRONG and really keeps it in place.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this pillow!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Really bummed out bc</li>
      <li>The suction cups are a very sturdy hold as well.</li>
      <li>It fits rounded tubs and seems that it would also fit square tubs equally as well.</li>
      <li>The suction seems to work really well</li>
      <li>I stuck it to the bathtub and its still there ready and waiting whenever I need it.</li>
      <li>The seam at the bottom of the large part of the pillow came apart under normal use.  </li>
      <li>As far as bath pillows go though, it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
      <li>Our only complaint is that it&#x27;s not as large as we expected - works great though!</li>
      <li>and I read other reviews stating the pillows ripped easily.</li>
      <li>Week seams, it started coming apart after the first use; by the third it was beyond use at all.</li>
      <li>Was ok but did not last a long time before seems came open</li>
      <li>The suction cups were clearly engineered by an amazon.  </li>
      <li>As seen in picture, the bottom seam has completely opened up and it is unusable because the padding falls out.</li>
      <li>After about 12 uses which were just gently resting the head on this in the tub...it split open at the bottom seam.</li>
      <li>This is the second one of these that I&#x27;ve purchased, however it completely ripped apart at the seems after using it for just a week.</li>
      <li>But I heard a loud pop and suddenly there was a rip in the plastic.</li>
      <li>Make sure you wet the suction cups and stick it down where you want when the tub is DRY.</li>
      <li>This pillow is great re comfort, but suction cups fasten so tightly that the pillow is difficult to remove fro spa tiub.</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to my next bath as I opened the package, but when I took it out of the plastic wrapping, the seam of the plastic casing completely split open along one side as soon as I picked it up.</li>
      <li>Once attached to the tub, it was nearly impossible to remove, either wet or dry to a more comfortable position on the tub.  </li>
      <li>There were no instructions that mentioned that in order to move, you must individually and with much effort peel the suction cups off one at a time, and then half of the time they reattach onto the tub.  </li>
      <li>Padding is firm  (not particularly &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;) and the pillow generally stays in place.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s impossible to keep clean now.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
<li> It still ripped so this product either needs stronger material or less suction cups.</li>
<li> It is not particularly special but seems to work as described.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Pillow is comfortable and suction cups are very effective. Sometimes slides around on the back of the tub though, and the vinyl, while durable, always seems to fill up with air. I&#x27;m not sure how, or why, just that it is annoying when I&#x27;m trying to lay down in the shower and try to forget I am hungover. As far as bath pillows go though, it&#x27;s pretty decent. That said, tub pillows are a little sad.</li>
    <li> very comfortable stays well</li>
    <li> This has been great, especially in the winter time. It keeps me from leaning back on a hard, cold porcelain tub. The suction seems to work really well and it&#x27;s comfortable!</li>
    <li> Comfortable but it does not hold well to the wall and two of the suction cups ripped off the back when I was trying to adjust the placement of the pillow.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who loves to take baths. She seems to be enjoying it. It is not particularly special but seems to work as described.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great pillow for my Jacuzzi bath tub. Within a week, the foam had a hole in it and it balled all up.  Don&#x27;t buy!  Looks good but is not.</li>
    <li> The vinyl seams are weak, and the entire bottom seam split open after less than a week of use. If it weren&#x27;t for that, it would be a perfectly nice bath pillow.</li>
    <li> It was split at the seams.  Returned it and ordered a different brand.</li>
    <li> Better than what I though it would be. I stuck it to the bathtub and its still there ready and waiting whenever I need it. Nice support so I can read and soak.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a waste of money. When I opened the pkg the seams were split in 4 places, two each on top and bottom. Was able to use anyway a couple of times until today. As seen in picture, the bottom seam has completely opened up and it is unusable because the padding falls out.</li>
    <li> This product, after less than 6 weeks of normal use, started coming apart.  The seam at the bottom of the large part of the pillow came apart under normal use.  This is, obviously, a poorly made product and I would not recommend purchasing it.  I bought this for my wife and she is not pleased; to make matters worse it started coming apart just after the 30 day return period had expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russell J. Sepielli</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to use in the tub. The picture show you what happened the first time she used it. Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. It is poorly manufactured. It looks very nice and feels cushiony - I was looking forward to my next bath as I opened the package, but when I took it out of the plastic wrapping, the seam of the plastic casing completely split open along one side as soon as I picked it up.</li>
    <li> After about 12 uses which were just gently resting the head on this in the tub...it split open at the bottom seam. Worthless because now it is a soggy dripping wet sponge revealed and constantly leaking water and molding. Definitely do not recommend!</li>
    <li> This pillow lasted a couple months before it ripped.</li>
    <li> Works fine. sticks well to the tube.</li>
    <li> I have a two person indoor spa and I bought two of these head/neck rests. Very comfortable and suction cups hold!</li>
    <li> Comfy fit for tub-time.</li>
    <li> Stay stuck to the tub and very comfortable.  I like that I can easily clean it.  Best spa pillow I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift, I already have one. She loves it. Though, she has always loved baths...she can&#x27;t think how she ever took one without it.......Ditto for me</li>
    <li> Works great in the tub.  Comfortable.  Suction cups hold it in place.</li>
    <li> This bath pillow has made soaking much more pleasant. The suction cups really hold in place and the pillow cradles my head very comfortably. It is easy to keep clean and a perfect addition to my bathing. It was also a very good value price-wise. I am most pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Thought it was great and made w quality. But the plastic is so thin. Was using it and tried sliding it to adjust it and the suction cups remained holding strong, but the plastic they were attached to ripped completely exposing  the inside foam which can no longer be submerged in the tub now. Really bummed out bc I loved this pillow and thought it was made well.</li>
    <li> Nice design, but arrived with a torn seam.  Useless.</li>
    <li> made very badly and uncomfortable!</li>
    <li> Its okay, but the suction cups keep coming unstuck.</li>
    <li> Week seams, it started coming apart after the first use; by the third it was beyond use at all. The covering material rips too easily. It&#x27;s not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Very simple design but man!! it works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;My husband bought a fancy one before (and cost a lot more!) and this one is very similar to that. Suction cups on the back are STRONG and really keeps it in place. Easy to clean and dry. My favorite part is the filling inside is not too puffy or stiff which sometimes can be uncomfortable. It proves my theory that quality things can be affordable. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> We have had 2 of these pillows and while they are comfortable they tend to rip easily, fill up with water and need to be replaced. These pillows need to be made stronger.</li>
    <li> My wife enjoyed it until the cover ripped.  The suction cups are really powerful, be sure to slide the pillow out of the tub and DO NOT PULL.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. The pillow was comfortable and nice at first. But I heard a loud pop and suddenly there was a rip in the plastic. Later, when readjusting the pillow, another place ripped. Wish there was a way I could get my money back, but it has been too long since I have purchased.</li>
    <li> After only the second use, the outer plastic on the smaller pillow tore when i took it out of the tub. It&#x27;s impossible to keep clean now. Very disappointing. I had problems with getting the suction cups to work from the start.</li>
    <li> fell apart within one week</li>
    <li> Was ok but did not last a long time before seems came open</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for so long, and I finally got one!  It stays put well in our tub and is so comfy!  The cloth it came with is kind of useless as a cover, but I don&#x27;t think it needs it anyway!  I may never get out of my tub one of these days!</li>
    <li> Our only complaint is that it&#x27;s not as large as we expected - works great though!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good bath pillow.  It fits rounded tubs and seems that it would also fit square tubs equally as well. Padding is firm  (not particularly &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;) and the pillow generally stays in place.</li>
    <li> Installs easily and feels good when I am soaking.</li>
    <li> Makes bath time so relaxing.</li>
    <li> The pillow came apart at the seam after one use.  Useless !</li>
    <li> Great amount of cushion but way too many suction cups for the material. This was a gift and I read other reviews stating the pillows ripped easily. I told the person I gave it to to be careful when removing from tub. It still ripped so this product either needs stronger material or less suction cups. Its too bad because the pillow is very comfortable</li>
    <li> Nice bath pillow. Very comfortable and the suction cups stick pretty good. Make sure you wet the suction cups and stick it down where you want when the tub is DRY. That way it will get a good stick otherwise they will slide. I learned this the hard way.. Otherwise it is awesome..</li>
    <li> This pillow is great re comfort, but suction cups fasten so tightly that the pillow is difficult to remove fro spa tiub. My pillow tore when a housekeeper pulled it off for cleaning.  Due to comfort and low price I did purchase a second one.</li>
    <li> Good quality, confortable</li>
    <li> This spa pillow is perfect for my whirlpool tub... you can really relax and enjoy the whirlpool.  It has suction cups on the top section and the bottom section.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Loved it when I got it.  First use, I stuck it on the bathtub and went to reposition it and one of the suction cups ripped right off.  A testament to how strong the suction cups are, I guess, but it was not repairable because the vinyl was ripped.  I returned it and got a prompt refund, however.</li>
    <li> I chose these pillows for my two person corner jacuzzi that I have had for 9 years. For the past nine years I have been using these small, stiff rectangular pillows and never realized just how uncomfortable they were until replacing them with this pillow. This pillow is very soft yet still provides adequate comfort. The suction cups are a very sturdy hold as well. I highly recommend this pillow!</li>
    <li> I GUESS IT IS OK FOR THE MONEY I PAID</li>
    <li> The suction cups were clearly engineered by an amazon.  Once attached to the tub, it was nearly impossible to remove, either wet or dry to a more comfortable position on the tub.  When I attempted to move it, the vinyl tore, and after only one tub,it is now useless.  There were no instructions that mentioned that in order to move, you must individually and with much effort peel the suction cups off one at a time, and then half of the time they reattach onto the tub.  The suction is great but the downside is that the vinyl easily rips</li>
    <li> I bought one of these before, which lasted about 6 months before it ripped while un-suctioning it from the tub. This is the second one of these that I&#x27;ve purchased, however it completely ripped apart at the seems after using it for just a week. After this experience, I don&#x27;t think I will buy another.</li>
