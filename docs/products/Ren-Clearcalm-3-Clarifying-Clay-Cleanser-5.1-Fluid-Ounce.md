      <li>My skin is oily and sensitive as well.</li>
      <li>As part of a system, this integrates well and leaves your face feeling clean, tight, and refreshed.</li>
      <li>but it is gentle and non-drying so if you have dry skin you could probably get away with using it as well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a film for me, just soft clean skin that isn&#x27;t tight or soapy and dried out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love, love, love this cleanser! I have always had bad skin, but when I hit my 40s my breakouts changed for the worse. I started getting undergrounds along my jawline. Nothing worked and the acne never seem to come to a head. They felt like cysts. This cleanser cleared it up right away! My undergrounds were gone within two days and they have not come back. I always break out when I PMS, but have not done so since I&#x27;ve been using the REN CC3CCC. I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: My 11 year old has just started getting acne. The CC3CCC seemed to take the redness away from her pimples - making them less noticeable. But, I found it wasn&#x27;t as effective getting rid of them as it was for me. I suspect it was because my breakouts are more hormonal driven, and hers are environmental (oil, dirt, sweat). I purchased the Clean and Clear Advantage Acne Control for her since it is suited for her demographic. Her face cleared within two days, as well. She has only been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser. For a clay cleanser it is gentle enough to use every day and it smells lovely. It is a great way to reset your skin without having to use a clay mask and wait for 15 to 20 min before rinsing it off. I do recommend this for people with oily, sensitive, or acne prone skin but it is gentle and non-drying so if you have dry skin you could probably get away with using it as well.</li>
    <li> Great. It works really well and leaves flawless skin.</li>
    <li> i got this because of Ms Hirons (skincare blogger in uk) and i love it, i use this every-other night and i first cleanse my skin with my chanel foaming cleanser to remove my makeup and then follow up with this, i actually leave this on my skin for 10-15 minutes let it really sink in and then take a wash cloth or my clarisonic and remove it. leaves my skin soft and has helped my acne !!</li>
    <li> Cheaper than at sephora! Works great for acne!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different from other facial cleansers, but it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used in ages. I really enjoy it. Doesn&#x27;t leave a film for me, just soft clean skin that isn&#x27;t tight or soapy and dried out. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it helps, but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out which is great!</li>
    <li> I have used Ren products for a long time, but have only used this Ren product for a short time.  I suddenly had some breakouts and this product helps by being an antibacterial cleanser that exfoliating as it cleans.  I also use the Ren Rosa Centifolia Foaming Cleanser.  I usually switch them depending on my skin needs at the time.  It does not have perfume or many other things you don&#x27;t need or want.  It is as pure as you can get.  My skin feels so soft and looks good, if I do say so myself (I am a senior citizen).  Great product from a great skin care line.</li>
    <li> I know this works very well for most but this is not good for sensitive skin. The mess this cleanser made of my face. Burned for two days.</li>
    <li> Recommended by Caroline Hirons of beauty mouth blog, UK and she was right, this clay cleanser is really nice. It&#x27;s does a good job, a little goes a long way and the pump and bottle is very well designed for maximizing all of the product. Has a nice clay clean smell without any perfumy stuff added. My new gave.</li>
    <li> Love, love this face wash! Wish it removed make up better. I just get some make up removing wipes, and that takes care of the problem. I&#x27;m super acne prone and this wash doesn&#x27;t make me break out!!</li>
    <li> The product was a tad too oily for my liking and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a drying effect of what a clay cleanser should.</li>
    <li> I have used REN products before and have been satisfied until now.  This product does not remove anything from your skin, it just leaves a film.  I had to use a scrub brush and wash cloth to remove everything from my face.</li>
    <li> I switched to this after using Origins Checks and Balances for years because I wanted something more natural. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months now and LOVE it! My skin tends to be more oily and this really evens things out. It also seems to reduce redness, and I love the clean, natural smell.</li>
    <li> I am 46 and have had breakout prone skin since my teens. My skin is oily and sensitive as well. My cheeks are more on the normal, not as oily side but are extra prone to reactions and rashes. I&#x27;m someone who will react to absolutely everything I try, even the so called products tested by derms for sensitive skin. I have tried many products for my skin which seems to work at 1st but then my face will break out again. This cleanser is perfect for my skin. It will not foam or remove your makeup. I use fresh soy cleanser to remove my makeup and then use the clay cleanser. My face doesn&#x27;t get dry but feels clean and soft. I have used it for 6 months. I also use the day fluid twice a day and the night cream to my cheeks. The mask has a bad smell that I don&#x27;t  like but I have used a few times. Try the cleanser! I only give it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t remove my makeup and is expensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gentle but effective cleanser. It keeps my skin clear but not dried out.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever tried (and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried almost everything).&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on your face and your face feels great when you&#x27;ve rinsed it off. It even smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Great for acne skin. I&#x27;ve noticed. Big difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. My skin gets so irritated by other stuff, and this is gentle yet effective. I really enjoy using this cleanser!</li>
    <li> Loveee! I have sensitive skin and nothing seems to work, except Ren. As part of a system, this integrates well and leaves your face feeling clean, tight, and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a several years now. Works very well for my acne-prone skin, while being very gentle.  (Doesn&#x27;t even burn if it gets in my eye!)</li>
