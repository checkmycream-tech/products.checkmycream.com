<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a woman but it&#x27;s hard to find soaps in liquid and especially in bar form that don&#x27;t leave your body feeling dry or scummy. I want a nice fresh clean. That&#x27;s exactly what this soap does. The cleansing beads in it are actually exfoliate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would complain about is that they don&#x27;t last as long as other bar soaps (~1bar/week for me) but that&#x27;s probably because I like to be So Fresh and So Clean.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this soap as it does its job! Came quickly and love that it is a subscribe and save item.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It smells very manly not like other soaps. It rinses clean and has a little grit to it for scrubbing off that deep down grime. The women in the house don&#x27;t use it so it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Except for some really expensive Kiehl&#x27;s soap, this is the best I&#x27;ve seen&lt;br /&gt;Lathers easily and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are it isn&#x27;t cheap, and it runs out a little faster than some other soaps (probably due to lathering easily)&lt;br /&gt;Wait until it&#x27;s on sale then stock up!</li>
    <li> Solid, lasts longer than a month (even when used daily) and has a nice fragrance. Seems to dry the skin a bit, but am not sure if that&#x27;s the case in general. The price for 8 bars is the clincher. Got this for brand name, and will buy it next time.</li>
    <li> I love these bars as moisturizes my skin well and has a very good smell. Also I find it to be more convenient than the liquid ones as you don&#x27;t have to pop-up anything in order to use it. In my case, while using liquid soaps, fair amount of the liquid drips into the floor and I need to pour it 2-3 times to cover my whole body. Inefficient for me, with this in one shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with bar soaps is that you need to wrap it in plastic or something to carry it to the gym or other place.</li>
    <li> Man if the house lives this soap. Good deodorant protection, easy on his sensitive skin, nice scent. He loves the Dove men&#x27;s product line. Delivered with amazon subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Dove user for several years now. I saw this new Mens brand and picked up the Deep Clean version of this soap without reading every bit of fine print. Embedded in the soap are \\&quot;purifying grains\\&quot; which I didn&#x27;t realize give this soap a texture closer to Lava soap. That type of soap is fine for dirty hands, but at least for me it&#x27;s torturous to use this soap on more sensitive parts of the body. Definitely going for the Extra Fresh next time.</li>
    <li> I used the original white dove bars when I was young because my parents bought them in bulk.  They didn&#x27;t dry out my skin and kept me smelling clean, so I was fine with it at the time.  At some point, I decided I needed a more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; soap and made the switch to Irish Spring.  After finally conceding that it dried out my skin, I switched between a Dial and Old Spice body wash for men.  I hate shower poofs and found myself tearing through bottles too quickly, so I&#x27;ve finally come around full circle and have been using the Dove Men Deep Clean bars for several months.  The scent is quite similar to the old bars, but toned down a bit.  It&#x27;s a neutral tan color versus the white and they&#x27;ve added black colored scrubbing particles to it.  It&#x27;s stamped with the words men + care on the bar.  Is it all just appearance and packaging?  Probably.  But I&#x27;m using a different bar than my wife, it feels a bit more manly, and my skin wasn&#x27;t dry throughout the cold winter and spring months, so that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
    <li> I am a girl and I am completely obsessed with this \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; product. it smells amazing, has a great lather like all dove soaps, and has the exfoliating beads that feel amazing on my skin. highly recommend for any of the ladies that like a more masculine scent, and even more highly recommend for all the fellows out there looking to get fresh and clean (and the attention of a female...or male). I would huff the stuff if I could.</li>
    <li> Good soap. Smells nice, feels nice, lasts a long time. You probably won&#x27;t find it cheaper in stores. I checked my local stores and was unable to find a better deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 53 year old woman.  I&#x27;ve been a Dove brand fan for many years and one day I was shopping at Sam&#x27;s Club (east coast name for a store like Costco) and saw this new soap.&lt;br /&gt;With it just being him and I and our pets at home we don&#x27;t go through soap as fast and a family would, so buying large amounts really helps with the cost.  I was surprised at the small grains in when I first used it.  I was being lazy and didn&#x27;t want to get out of the shower and grab my pink Dove soap so I wound up using his.&lt;br /&gt;This is the soap I&#x27;m reviewing.  I loved loved loved it.  Not for my face because it&#x27;s a bit rough for that but my hands and legs and feet.  It feels so tingly clean and fresh.  It reminds me of spring when it&#x27;s deep winter and being from mid state Maine we know what deep winter is.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent because even though it&#x27;s been a couple of hours after I&#x27;ve washed I still smell the scent of the soap and feel fresh and clean.  You should really try it and see what you think.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this soap. I am actually allergic to the Dove Deodorant, but the soap has never bothered me. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this soap and it is hard to find in my local stores and if they do have it it&#x27;s not in a so called bulk pack.  Love the feature where you can have it delivered it to you at regular intervals..one less thing to have to worry about when I go shopping.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap.  Probably my favorite soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  I went to my local grocery store where I bought it and they didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;Deep Clean\\&quot; that I like so I was forced to buy whatever scent the blue one was.  Well the blue one dissolves twice as fast.  I also didn&#x27;t care for the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have decided to seek it out here and happy I have found it at discount.</li>
    <li> I got this soap and quickly developed grimy greasy skin on my face and pimples. I am 24 years old and haven&#x27;t had skin problems like this since middle school. I hope switching back to a simpler soap without moisturizing lotions will help get my skin back to normal because right now i&#x27;m looking ugly.</li>
    <li> The Dove Men +Care products are great and I use quite a few of them. I ordered this soap on Amazon because I always seem to forget to go down the personal isle in the grocery store when I am there.    This soap has a nice faint fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering but still remains after hours of working. The micro beads are nice in the soap and are not uncomfortable to me at all.     I ordered these on subscribe and save so they are even cheaper.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. It has the perfect amount of moisturizing agents in it. It is not too much (like some other dove products) and its not too little. It leaves my skin feeling smoothed and refreshed. As a matter of fact, I just walked out the shower and now writing this review. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> The description pretty much tells it all. Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin... and obviously it cleans as soap should.</li>
    <li> This soap cleans very well, and you can tell a lot of care went into it&#x27;s production. The smell is mild but pleasant, and being a concrete finisher, it does a fabulous job of getting me instantly clean.     This is a brand of soap I&#x27;ll stick with for a long time.</li>
    <li> A good sale on these made me decide to try them, glad I did. Great soap that lathers well and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either like other soaps do and has a mild scent I can live with. Guess it&#x27;s good to get out of your comfort zone every now and then, as long as it&#x27;s on sale!</li>
    <li> Of all the Dove Men +care bar soaps, this is my favorite.  I love the scent, and it is the closest (but not in the same class) as the Khiel&#x27;s Ultimate Man Body Scrub Soap.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A REALLY NICE SMELL SOAP TO BUY FOR MEN ,I LOVE IT! ALSO , IT CLEANS YOUR BODY REALLY GOOD, YOU FEEL IT WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THE SHOWER, WILL BUY IT AGAIN!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed Dove soaps for a long time.  Dove was recommended by a dermatologist, and I can see why.  It cleans but manages to keep your skin healthy.  The new Dove Men soaps are still great at keeping you clean and keeping your skin healthy.  However, if you are a man who wears cologne or who does not want to have much of a scent, these new soaps are not for you.  The Dove Men soaps all have a strong scent to them that will stay with you after showering.  If you like the scents, then these will be great soaps for you, but I prefer to wear certain colognes, and these soaps don&#x27;t blend well with colognes.  I would recommend the unscented Dove products instead.</li>
    <li> Simply can not get enough of the Deep Clean Fragrance, and has the side effect of making the bathroom actually more inviting. Don&#x27;t be put off by the &#x27;purifying grains&#x27; (unless you have extremely sensitive skin). Only issue I have is the bar dissolves and disappears slightly more quickly when compared to the &#x27;traditional&#x27; Dove beauty bars.</li>
    <li> This is a good, basic soap; it gets you clean, and it has a decent (not great, but not obnoxious) smell. It&#x27;s a good value, and it does its job. What else is there to say about it?</li>
    <li> Switched back to bar soap from gel soap because I was looking for a better exfoliating option. This soap is fantastic, the scrubbers help to remove dead skin but like all Dove products it is a fantastic moisturizer as well. Plus the scent is great for guys.</li>
    <li> Has a fine grit to it for exfoliating which I love, and certainly doesn&#x27;t dry you out like soaps I&#x27;m used to.  The fragrance leaves something to be desired.  The packaging screams &amp;#34;me too&amp;#34; at Axe buyers, dove Mens line, and Vaesline&#x27;s new Mens line of lotions etc but doesn&#x27;t have that pheromone / adrenaline / masculine thing going on at all...  In fact it&#x27;s barely passable as Mens, however barely does in fact mean that it does pass for a mens fragrance just remember there is no getting past the fact that it&#x27;s Dove.</li>
    <li> This perfumed soap is nasty. My wife says I smell awful after using it, and I have to agree: even after several hours, the funk that this soap imparted onto my skin is still there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I ordered several, I thought I&#x27;d donate the rest to a food pantry. However, after even a couple of days in my closet, the repulsive stench of this product overwhelmed me every time I opened the door. Finally, I had to throw it out. The smell of this soap is, however, superior to rotting garbage and I did enjoy how it freshened my garbage can for the couple of hours it remained in there before being taken out to the dumpster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not at all satisfied with this purchase. Though it has a good fragrance, it dissolves very fast and its too soapy to clean. You can&#x27;t take bath quick with this soap. To clear the soap on your body, you have to keep rubbing your body with water for a long time. This certainly a big disatisfier and I would certainly not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything you expect from Dove soap, plus exfoliating granules in the bar.  It&#x27;s rougher than I expected (which is a good thing for me)</li>
    <li> This soap smells great! (Deep Clean)&lt;br /&gt;I love the grains also.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Extra Fresh also.. But I prefer Deep Clean in terms of smell &amp; texture..</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Gets you clean (I&#x27;m a mechanic) and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out. Live in a small town and was unable to find at our local Walmart  They were always out</li>
    <li> I use this over the regular dove soap because it gives me a deeper clean and it helps when you go to the gym a lot versus the regular white bar of dove soap. Definitely recommended if you can get a good price on amazon, or check out walmart it is about $5 or less for 8 bars sometimes when they have weekly deals</li>
    <li> This has now become my favorite soap. I&#x27;ve used the different Method bar soaps, the Jack something or other brand from Target, Zest, and a host of others. The method bars were my favorite, but I think I will stick with these Dove bars now.  They have tiny little specks of some hard things which sometimes don&#x27;t make for a pleasurable lather experience, but I feel nice and clean after I use this bar.</li>
    <li> Okay, so it&#x27;s soap. But not just soap, it has (1) a grit to it for sloughing off dead skin, (2) a silky feel for rough skin, (3) a great fragrance that&#x27;s not to &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; and (4) this was a great price. Nice combo all around.</li>
    <li> Great soap. But I want the product in bigger size.</li>
    <li> Deep Clean:&lt;br /&gt;I have never been so impressed with a soap till I tried this. Amazon is great to search and see people&#x27;s review and then buy. The scent and the grip of soap is awesome. It really make you to go take bath in the morning. Great soap, I will try the other style, Extra fresh after this is over. Can&#x27;s wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra Fresh:&lt;br /&gt;I tried Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Deep Clean last year and was very impressed. Thought I will try Extra Fresh, but was disappointed.  For some reason, deep clean was way better for me. There was something about that brand. Still this is much better than regular dove brands after a long run or an exercise.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap, it gets you really clean without drying you out and it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a little old lady.  The scent is nice and mild enough that you won&#x27;t be stinking up a room with it.  I highly recommend this for any guy who gets dirty and doesn&#x27;t like the drying effects of most deep cleaning soaps.</li>
    <li> I now keep about 50 bars of this soap in my cabinet at all times. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of bar soaps over the years. This stuff really does the trick. One bar seems to last me about 6 or 7 days. I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll ever have to (or want to) change soaps. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> So the first rule of being a man is that if you have two options, always choose the one that is marked \\&quot;for men\\&quot;. If it doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;for men\\&quot;, how can you know, without a shadow of a doubt, that it is for you? I don&#x27;t dare use products \\&quot;For Women\\&quot; and I can only assume non-designated products are for people that are less manly than me. The old saying goes, \\&quot;You can tell a man by the manliness of his cleaning products\\&quot;. What, you haven&#x27;t heard that one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is good, seems to work, makes me smell nice. At least Mrs. Philyodaddy hasn&#x27;t complained about my odor in the X months that it has taken me to use 8 bars of soap. Furthermore, I haven&#x27;t gotten scabies or any other dirt-related diseases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seemed reasonable, although I don&#x27;t go to the store, so what do I know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore it is clearly a successful product. A successful product FOR MEN. You stay away ladies, you already got me kicked out the garden of eden, leave my soap alone!</li>
    <li> I used to wash my body with a Brillo pad and ajax till I found this bar of soap, It makes me feel clean and still leaves me smelling like a man and not a delicate flower. Gtg have a bear in my yard waiting to get chocked out.</li>
    <li> This soap smells strong and doesn&#x27;t even feel like soap - more like you&#x27;re showering with a handful of lady lotion. Get a cheap tea tree bar from your local Trader Joe&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> He loves the beads on it and how clean he feels after his showers. This really is a great soap for men.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for some time now and it is the best bar soap I have ever used. The beads in the soap make your skin feel amazing.</li>
    <li> I switched to this brand some time ago and it is all I ever use now.  Very happy with these products.</li>
    <li> I have always liked the softness of Dove soaps but never really like the feminine smell or packaging. After discovering this, it&#x27;s all I use except for a touch of AXE Snake Peel to finish off my daily bath/shower. It&#x27;s as soft as the ladies Dove but with a more masculine smell and appearance. Try it out.</li>
    <li> I just started using this and it is the best soap I have ever used. My skin is starting to feel much better just after a few days of using this. I signed up for the delivery every three months, this stuff is excellent!</li>
    <li> As a runner I can tell you that after 12miles in the 90degree sun I SMELL BAD!  I can also tell you that all the salt in my sweat usually results in my face becoming very very dry over a several week time span, but luckily for me this soap can fix both of those problems!  Yup you heard me... I can smell great and even have a nice non-dry face.  This is now the only soap I use and my girlfriend even comments about how healthy feeling my skin has become.  *wink</li>
    <li> i think this product is so good and economic that i will strongly recommend this to my friends who maybe need this.</li>
    <li> this product leaves an artificial-feeling residue and smells okay but not great. I tried two and then threw the other two in the garbage as my irish spring soap was much better overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for over a year now, and I love it!  It smells great, lathers great, cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like many other \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; soaps do.  The micro beads don&#x27;t bother me at all, in fact, I really can&#x27;t even tell they&#x27;re there.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I used to use plain old Ivory bar soap (chemical peel in a bar) on my face until I realized that it was starting to wreck my skin.  The Dove Men+Care is much better.  It doesn&#x27;t rinse off quite as easily, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dried-out as it used to.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor and the color of this soap. We&#x27;ve been purchasing this soap for a few years now and haven&#x27;t switched yet.</li>
    <li> I really like dove soap. It does a really great job of cleaning and leaves my skin feeling and smelling really nice. I had to order this on Amazon as it can be hard to find this soap sometimes.</li>
    <li> Cheap, smells, nice, helps body retains moisture. I am going through it pretty quickly, but I would recommend it to men.</li>
    <li> I never liked soap because they are made out of fat, but this soap. God, I love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave you&#x27;re skin dry like other soaps *cough Irish Spring cough* or body wash such as Axe or Old Spice. The small micro beads help exfoliate the skin a little.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would get more of if they go on sale</li>
    <li> After using the cheap gel-soaps from places like kmart, I decided to finally use some proper soap (since the other stuff wasn&#x27;t helping my skin in the slightest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers well, smells great, and my wife and I love the textured grains that rub off dead skin.  I wonder if the company is perhaps losing out on potential sales by putting the \\&quot;men\\&quot; tag on it, because it seems unisex to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the prices available on amazon, it is hard to go wrong on this product.  I highly suggest this product to anyone in the market for bars of soap.</li>
    <li> Pros: clean feeling, not harsh on skin, smells good, good texture&lt;br /&gt;Con: none yet as it&#x27;s still cleaning me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a product for guys that&#x27;s not cologne in a soap.  I purchased this because I was tired of all those axe body washes and other soap products that were more scents than substance.  I would use those body washes and feel like I took a shower in cologne and not really be clean.  Dove is the exception.  The scent is pleasant but not as strong a bottle of cologne (that&#x27;s what my actual cologne is for though right?).  Of course the pluses of any dove soap have been added to Dove Men&#x27;s- moisturizing soap (I have eczema and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin), clean feeling after use, and a line of complimentary products to complete the &amp;#34;get fresh&amp;#34; routine.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Buy it, you wont be disappointed</li>
    <li> Have been using this daily for a little over a month or so now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a nice light scent to it and would say it does a fair job at cleaning, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference from using regular soap/gel.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for men. I buy this for my husband. His dermatologist recommended he only use Dove products, he didn&#x27;t like my Dove scents, so I was glad to find the Men products. These have a nice scent and are gentle on his skin.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this soap, It was my first time purchasing this and I like the scent and how soft it is on the skin, I recommend this to everyone who loves to smell great.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite soap. Nice smell and great cleaning. This.is what we buy especially if we need something to pushier to the free shipping mark!</li>
    <li> As far as the soap part goes, I like this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even like the scent, and I don&#x27;t often like scents in products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is with the quantity of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two open bars, one on the sink and one in the shower, and the bathroom reeks. I keep the door shut (so the odor doesn&#x27;t permeate the rest of the house), but the window is open and it&#x27;s still overpowering. Who ever thought this level of scent was a good idea? What we have here is a product development chemistry department in desperate need of adult supervision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought man specific soap before.  I entered into this proposition with some skepticism.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the last few weeks, and there is something more masculine about the outcome (compared to using my wife&#x27;s stuff).  I&#x27;m not sure if it makes me more of a man, but it makes me feel like more of a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and since it&#x27;s soap, it does a good job of cleaning me up.</li>
    <li> A good soap for daily use, decent smell and not overly powerful scent. A $7.8 for 8 soaps a very good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not have too much moisturizer to make it overly difficult to rinse, and just the right amount of hardness to prevent it from getting soggy.</li>
    <li> I love buying dove products from amazon rather than in Walgreens or other supermarkets because you can save a lot of money buying them from Amazon. I have been using this products for more than a year without any complaint. The scent is really good and treats well my skin. Very happy with dove men bars :)</li>
    <li> Works very well like the lil scrubbing grains in this soap makes me feel very clean &amp; fresh,rinses well,,not much smell but like for the cleaning properies</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this soap a try.  After my first shower with it, I had a terrible itch all over my upper body.  After discontinuing use, the itch went away.  I&#x27;ve never had this sort of problem before.</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair and skin. This soap is the best I found for my skin type. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> When it first came out I loved it, but now I have come to realize that the bars only last about 1/2 as long as regular gold dial or irish spring. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got it for a great price, it&#x27;s moisturizing and exfoliating, and it&#x27;s dove... for MEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say, the subtle fragrance is the last factor that wins me over with this. Manly indeed.</li>
    <li> Great smell - does it&#x27;s job well too - a good moisturizing soap. Does have deep cleaning scrubbing elements in it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap. If Chuck Norris needed a shower, he would use this soap. Cleans very well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, but what little scent there is is manly. There is a little bit of grit in the soap which I like.</li>
    <li> All my life I&#x27;ve used Ivory. I love Ivory. I&#x27;m not big into deodorant soaps which I find, for the most part, too smelly. Plus, some deodorant soaps don&#x27;t easily rinse, I find. Now, Dove. Nice and sudsy and rinses easily. The odor is pleasant but not overwhelming. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> The bars look very manly.  They clean well.  However, I was not a fan of how strong the scent was.  It wasn&#x27;t a bad smell, but a little overpowering.  Did not work out well for me as I shared my soap with my wife.</li>
    <li> I didnt switch to any other soap after using it.. Its not so sticky on hard water and keeps a perfect balance in the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this soap,  Great smell to it, even after you leave the shower.  Cleans well and washes off easily. Try it!</li>
    <li> If you let this sit in water between showers and don&#x27;t let it dry out completely, you go through a bar a week.  But I like the scent and it&#x27;s not overpowering.  I can tell it&#x27;s got a moisturizer in there but not annoyingly so.  I&#x27;m not a moisturizer kind of guy, but I have Eczema and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  While it didn&#x27;t solve my Eczema, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like other soaps does, which helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can get a different soap holder so this will last longer, I&#x27;ll buy more.  If not, it&#x27;s too expensive to be blowing through like I have been.</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower all time and I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with the quality and the softness. It sheds the right amount of soap so the whole bar doesn&#x27;t disappear on you after using it for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Bad ass man soap, smells awesome, skin is soft.</li>
    <li> Every man should have their own box of this soap it take care of your skin and makes you smell great in the process.</li>
    <li> pros: smells good &amp; i guess helps fight odor to some extent&lt;br /&gt;cons: dissolves very quickly and could have been more germs / odor killing</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I bought this soap as a two pack so now I&#x27;m stuck with a kind of soap I hate. The soap deteriorated so easily it was amazing. Within two weeks of opening the box and getting the bar wet the entire thing was gone. Also when it deteriorated down to the point that it would be usable for another couple of days, it stopped smelling like it did when I bought it and started smelling like crappy hotel soap.&lt;br /&gt;So basically, if you&#x27;re looking for an expensive soap that deteriorates even when you&#x27;re not using it then definitely buy this. Otherwise I would look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I will not be buying this soap EVER again.</li>
    <li> As a man I have tried to find a decent bar of soap for men.  Good thing Dove is making one for us dudes.  Why should women have their own damn line.  Gender Discrimination right?  The soap smells great, lathers up nice and leaves my skin feeling clean.  Walmart has the 6 pack, Amazon has the 8 pack for a dollar and change more.  I am shopping at Amazon now.  I used the old Spice bar soaps those dried out very quick and left my skin dry.  This is the line for men I recommend.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended this when i got a skin infection.  works great, leaves my skin moisturized and smelling nice.  has a light exfoliant as well.</li>
    <li> I remain a bar soap fan and this one is about as good as they come (unless you get one of those expensive, rough, exfoliating ones). This Dove bar is definitely a cut above the Dials, the Zests and even the Levers out there.</li>
    <li> To me, this smells of cheap cologne such as a teenage boy might keep in a gym locker. Otherwise, it&#x27;s okay soap.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a fresh, cologne-like scent. Not so.  It&#x27;s just a gritty bar of soap that doesn&#x27;t lather well.  I used up the two scents I bought to get rid of it.  I won&#x27;t purchase again and I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t stink too much, and because it makes me feel like a manly man because it comes in a black box with red lettering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man, with eczema and because of it, I have really sensitive skin. As a child, I grew up using Dove soap (although I have used other brands when I needed it), but I will always prefer Dove soap. I do admit though, in the past, the Dove brand caters to women. When they released the Dove \\&quot;Men + Care\\&quot; line, I couldn&#x27;t have been more thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is pretty much the same formula as the regular Dove line but it has a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scent. As a bonus (I bought the Deep Clean), the \\&quot;purifying grains\\&quot; which lightly exfoliate your skin.  It lathers up very nicely and like all Dove bars, it rinses without that \\&quot;filmy\\&quot; residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a parting money saver thought, if you&#x27;re a user of this soap, I would suggest taking advantage of Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program.  Sometimes things are better purchased locally at a store, but this is one thing I couldn&#x27;t pass up because it saves you money.  Locally (at my Walmart), a 6-pack of these 4 ounce bars are $6.  On Amazon, I spent $8 for an 8-pack.  With Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save, you can save 5% or 20% (if you have 5 or more items on delivery).  This amounts to 40 cents with the default 5% off or $1.60 w/ the 20% off.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap expecting it to be a lot better than my normal soap, but after using it a couple times I found to be myself at a bit of a loss on why this is so highly valued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Good Strong Scent&lt;br /&gt;-It does not dry out the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t eat it&lt;br /&gt;-The exfoliating \\&quot;salts\\&quot; is a joke, get a real glove or sponge if you want that.&lt;br /&gt;-Not all natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price for a good product. It is worth about how much as I paid for it. I never really had any skin problems to begin with and I don&#x27;t use soap very often (which might have something to do with it) except to prevent myself from smelling. I bought this product for the good scent and to not dry out my fine skin, which it does have. It smells a bit artificial and may not be liked by some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given for what the product is, it is good, but I have had better.</li>
    <li> I  love this soap. Only one I use.</li>
    <li> This soap is super soft (disappears quick, leaves a lot of film in the tub, cracks when it dries after use, and becomes brittle when not much is left and disintegrates in your hands before other soap would do the same) and doesn&#x27;t smell great. I was bummed that Dove&#x27;s new product for men would not be a better product.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Dove Men+Care Body and Face Bar (Deep Clean) soaps as part of my quest to find a good performing body cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t over-dry my skin. I have to say that i believe i&#x27;ve found such a product, but with a few asterisks.     First, it does exactly what it says it does, it cleans your skin without over-drying. The soap was easily lathered. The purifying grains were a nice touch, not too harsh and works great when cleaning the skin with the bar itself, however when lathered into a wash rag or loofa, you don&#x27;t feel the grains at all. Possibly due to the grains not transferring over to the rag or getting stuck &#x27;inside&#x27; the porous fabric threads, but in any case not a problem for me (Although i did purchased the Deep Clean bar over the Extra Fresh version for the purifying grains). As i washed my body, the soap felt like average soap with no noticeable effects, however when i began to rinse the soap off my body, i noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t too dry as with other soaps. It wasn&#x27;t hydrated or moisturized as you would be if you apply Body Lotion on your skin, but it was for the most part nice and Supple.     The scent is a nice, classic \\&quot;Men&#x27;s\\&quot; fragrance. Not overpowering at all, in fact i&#x27;d prefer it to be a bit stronger, but that&#x27;s just my personal preference. I can still smell it on my skin so that&#x27;s nice.    All in all, this is an OK soap, definitely a step up from the Dial Antibacterial soap i&#x27;ve been using for a few months, however my high expectations weren&#x27;t met, possibly due to my overconfidence and high demands for the product itself. As long as you don&#x27;t expect this soap to moisturize your skin as well as lotion would but still won&#x27;t dry out your skin either, then this product is worth a try.    Would i buy again, sure, but i&#x27;d probably do some more research before shelling out another $9 for an 8 bar pack in case their something out there better at a reasonable price. If not then i&#x27;d continue to buy/use this.</li>
    <li> As a female, I am using mens&#x27; dove soap and I love it so far.  It smells just like Irish Spring and what I like the best about this soap is the grains which helps with the dead skin.  I would recommend males or females to use it.</li>
    <li> Grat soap. Nice sporty smell as well. Not as silky as regular dove. But, a great soap for the price.</li>
    <li> Clean, manly smell, feels good when you shower. This is not normal soap, I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so good to use, it just is.</li>
    <li> I opened the box of 8 bars... and the smell hits you like a punch in the face. I didn&#x27;t even open a single bar, but touched the box it was in and my fingers smell like cologne for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to put the soap in the garage because it was stinking up the whole house. I thought I might like a slight manly sent but good lord... its way too much.</li>
    <li> This will keep you feeling clean, and the moisturizing keeps your skin soft.  The purifying grains are a very mild exfoliant - good for keeping skin soft, and also helps keep pores clean, so it&#x27;d be good for guys prone to body acne, ingrown hairs, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is a nice, clean scent - not the typical overscent of most men&#x27;s body wash, but also not perfumey or feminine.</li>
    <li> I have bought this brand of soap before but the stuff delivered smells very strong and is very strong soap.  Maybe I got an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; batch.</li>
    <li> They are typical Dove bars, where they have so much moisturizer that it takes a lot to get a good lather going. Either way, the smell is what i wasnt too impressed with. The smell was too bland and really it smelled like watered down mens cologne. Don&#x27;t get  me wrong I LOVE Dove products just dislike the typical guy scents that most if not all companies have.</li>
    <li> Scent is pretty manly, but wouldn&#x27;t call it too heavy.  Leaves skin about right ... not too dry and not oily.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Great deal and value for the money, and having bulky items such as this delivered to your front door makes it all the more better.</li>
    <li> Great deal on amazon. The soap bar is great because it is gentle enough to use on the face. Try out the other smells.</li>
    <li> I have used the Extra Fresh scent of Dove soap for men and personally prefer the smell of that a tad bit better.  I certainly have no complaints about this product as it does it&#x27;s job quiet well.  The micro grains in this soap sets it apart from other &#x27;mens&#x27; soap and gives you that extra deep clean feeling.  Of course, the fact that it can be used on the face without over drying it, is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> I tried this soap because I do like Dove products, however, I&#x27;m not sure why this is labeled a man&#x27;s soap. Dove products are usually marketed as being gentle and subtle so I&#x27;m wondering if this soap is harsher on the skin than their regular soap in order to get the claimed \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot;  whatever that is supposed to mean. I do not like the scent on these soaps which is also too strong for my liking. I prefer scentless (meaning no added perfume) or very mildly scented soaps like Dove has in their regular products. I will not be buying this soap again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service, the soap is smooth and has very good scent for men.  The delivery was on time and in good condition.  Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap.  It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It cleans well and does not dry out his skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells great and has granules so it has a bit of a rough feel, which I love. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other soaps.</li>
    <li> Does the trick and for a discount price.  Can&#x27;t say it leaves me feeling more alive but it&#x27;s just hand soap so what can you expect.</li>
    <li> lathers well and smells great</li>
    <li> These Soap bars leaves my skin smooth as can be. I do not really recommend them for a facial soap. They are cheap facial soap at the very least. It last a while and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin up.</li>
    <li> Hello. Dove Men and Care Deep Clean is a fantastic bar soap for my fiancee. He works long hours out on the road and when he is in the need of \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot;, this bar soap softens his skin almost immediately. I love feeling the softness of his skin and now with this great bar soap for him, I can find another reason to draw closer to him!!! :)</li>
    <li> I just discovered these 2 soaps a month ago.  I was skeptical of the price but decided to try it.  Fantastic smell and also leaves the skin moisturized, but not greasy feeling like some female soaps can(I&#x27;ve only used female soaps when nothing else was available.)  I think it may be cheaper in the store, like Walmart. So do a little research before buying here.&lt;br /&gt;Both soaps smell great.  Only Lever is in the ball park. My 2 new favorite soaps.</li>
    <li> No complaints on this soap, have been using it for a while and skin is not dry and the beads/particles help exfoliate skin.</li>
    <li> Dove&#x27;s men care is the best soap Ihave found for a man to get the really cleam feeling. This was a very quick ship at a super price.I will be back for more. Great job to Amazon!</li>
    <li> Bought this Dove soap for both my husband and married son and they both like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dermatologist recommended it for my son when his skin became irritated and dry from using Irish Spring soap for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for some soap that I could use all the time that would allow me to get a deep clean while ensuring I stayed fresh. Dove for men is wonderful, with the micro beads you feel that deep clean every-time as well as the smell is refreshing yet manly. I know when you think of dove you think of women products but trust me you or your partner will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Husbands favorite soap (I love it sometimes too), it has little microbeads to exfoliate, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good soap and it keeps me clean.  The exfoliating bits inside the soap really do great work.  Wash your bum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for a couple days and i love it. I have really oily skin. Normally after I shower no more than 2 hours after my skin - especially my face is real oily and shinny. This soap didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all and it didn&#x27;t get oily at all! Sometimes I get a little pimple here or there and I can already tell my face is starting to clear up.  It smells great and give me an all day clean feeling. I am definitely going to buy again!</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t use this soap, my husband does. He is very pleased with it. He likes the scent and feels it does a good job getting him clean.  I am just glad I can get it on subscribe and save. I love it when things just arrive at my door as planned.</li>
    <li> In my view, this soap for a real man, a pleasant male odor resistant, the body after it is smooth and silky. Thanks</li>
    <li> As a woman who&#x27;s gone through menopause, my estrogen levels are rather; ahem, nonexistent.  Even before then, I was quite brawny for a female.  In my teenaged years I had bulging biceps whereas all the other girls had beautiful, skinny arms.  As a result, I&#x27;ve always had an unpleasant odor in my armpits and other shall-not-be-named body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a strong-scented soap for deep cleansing and odor masking, so I embarrassingly turned to Men&#x27;s Dove.  Since it claimed to be a face bar, I thought it might also help my puss-filled ZITS.  Three words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap stinks.  Not only did I break out like a pizza with extra pepperoni, but the scent quickly dissipated beneath my natural womanly stench.  I figured it might be able to mask it or at least get me through the day, but clearly I couldn&#x27;t even count on it to do that much.  I swear I saw three of my co-workers holding their noses in my presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  -Smells kind of funky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  - Does not mask body odor&lt;br /&gt;  - Fails to fight acne&lt;br /&gt;  - Smells kind of funky</li>
    <li> I can use the SAME type of soap on my face, that I use on my body...what MORE could you possibly need? Awesome deal!</li>
    <li> The scent of this soap is so oppressively dense that I had to put on a hazmat suit before returning to my bathroom. This is advertised as a &#x27;face bar&#x27;, but squirting sriracha into your eyeballs is more pleasant than washing your face with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this soap if you are starting up a guerilla army and aren&#x27;t overly concerned with complying with international treaties.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! I work at an animal feed mill and always smell like work when I get out of the shower at home.  I would Literally lay down in bed next to my wife 5 minutes after showering and she would say &amp;#34;you stink&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;I was using the gold dial bars which does a good job of cleaning but it wouldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; smell off of me. I could still smell the different ingredients on my hands after scrubbing them. So I started reviewing some different soaps and came across the Dove Men line and the deep clean one. Read the reviews and decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap gets the smell completely off of my hands and body. Lathers up real easy and rinses clean. After using this soap I would go up to my wife and let her smell me and ask if I stink, she says no. I no longer smell the work smell on my hands anymore after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone make or female that wants a soap that gets rid of the work smell and just does what it is supposed to do. I buy it by the 10 packs now and keep a bar at work to wash my hands with throughout my shift and before our lunch break. I will never use a different bar of soap as long as they keep making this one.</li>
    <li> A good product, it does the job a good smell, clean well keep using it therefore recommend its duration is normal.  un buen producto</li>
    <li> Finally a soap that cleans great and smells great for a man, at a great price, beats shower gel that I have been using for years!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the shape of DOVE soap is much better then the shape of Dial soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to get such a high-quality product at such a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this price is much less then what you would pay at the Big Box stores.</li>
    <li> I think the soap bars I received were old, because the boxes looked sun damaged (which was odd it was plastic wrapped) and the bars do not have a consistent color all the way around. The top looks darker, and to me it does not look like it was made that way. The bar I am using does smell nice. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying soap online again though.</li>
    <li> There is something special about Dove Men + soap. With other types of soap (e.g. Dial, Irish Spring), you are left with a soap residue feeling on your skin after use. Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar is great for use with your body or face. Even if you have skin problems such as acne, this soap is great for washing away body oil and leaving your face and skin smooth and clean without the irritation. What I really like about this particular Dove product is the microbeads. These are not rough beads, but you can feel them helping to scrub dirt and oils off your skin. This is really a fantastic product and worth the try if you haven&#x27;t used Dove Men + soaps before.</li>
    <li> Men, soap, and deep clean there is are only two things that can do that - Lava and Go-Jo. One has great big chunks of grit in it to really remove the dirt. The other has some kind of crazy oil that lifts off that beautiful black grime I get from working on cars. Dove made something else, not a cleaner bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I think Dove is trying to make a gentle exfoliating bar for men. And they more or less did that. This bar is really bad at removing deep grimy working on the car dirt, my definition of deep cleaning. Instead it tries to be gentle on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is creamy and soft, it generates gentle soft foam. The bar feels slippery in my hand and there are little brown granules in the bar. If those brown granules are supposed to be exfoliating bits, I couldn&#x27;t feel them at all. There was a ton of surfactant in this soap; it took a lot of water to rinse it off. Much more than other soaps I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where Dove lost me was the cologne or smell they put in this bar. Oh darn, that smell is super strong. It smells like my father who in his older age has decided to wear a lot of cologne. I&#x27;m not sure which brand he wears, but it is the same as in this bar. It&#x27;s just too darn strong. On the bright side, if my boys miss their grandpa, they can just pull out this bar and be reminded of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not really a deep clean product. The soap is a bit too soapy, taking too long to rinse off. And the soap smells like super strong cologne.</li>
    <li> I tend to be the sort of person who just buys the cheapest soap with the lightest scent available rather than try to find something with particular qualities. However, after using this soap, I may have to rethink that habit. This soap really does seem to leave skin feeling both clean (with no film left after rinsing) and quite soft. The claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. Compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that I get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain Kirkland brand at Costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men&#x27;s hair and body products. If it were a little less intense, it&#x27;d be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. If you&#x27;re okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> This soap does provide a good lather and it cleans very well, but has a very musky scent. It was much worse at first and have lessened with use, but it is still very musky, not a good scent to me, next time I think I will try the extra fresh or Aqua Impact versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does provide a very good and deep clean and it is not shrinking as quickly as some soap bars do. Overall, this is a great bar of soap, aside from the scent.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a bar of soap in years, and now I remember why - they&#x27;re not as sanitary or convenient as shower gel. Just because it&#x27;s soap, doesn&#x27;t mean germs can&#x27;t grow on it. Plus, I have a little dropsy, and don&#x27;t like playing &#x27;find the soap&#x27; after it falls and it noisily ricochets all over the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap does smell very nice, but it takes some effort to get the same lather shower gel instantly offers. It cleans well, and my skin feels nice, but it just doesn&#x27;t offer much to make me turn away from gel and go back to bars of soap. Guess it just comes down to personal preference.</li>
    <li> This is excellent soap, would refer to all of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used this since a long time for now.</li>
    <li> Smells good, lathers-up well, and deep cleans with some type of little abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this soap, it even contains moisturizers which keeps your skin well-maintained.&lt;br /&gt;But the best is... That lovely clean smell which is distinct yet not overpowering in the least.</li>
    <li> leaves no residue, lathers well, and leaves you feeling clean. arrived on time and packaged well. no complaints here. bye</li>
    <li> I have a hard time if find this, it&#x27;s always out stock.  It&#x27;s the best bad soap that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> After using regular Dove soap a few times I thought I would give the Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I like the feel of the soap, and I think my face is a little drier after using it than regular Dove soap (which I prefer).  I am using it solely on my face, and my complexion is noticeably improved.  I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little soap. It is gentle enough to use on the face as it contains both moisturizing cream and mild exfoliants. As it is marketed to men,it has a strong woodsy/green aroma. I personally prefer the freshness one finds in most men&#x27;s fragrances. I liked this one but  less is more. Although the scent dissipates somewhat, it is still quite noticeable. Therefore, I think it is better used as a body bar than a facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with Dove products has been positive. They are good quality and reasonably priced. I think most men would be receptive to skin care but I think that subtle fragrance is more appealing than aggressive perfumes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap, what else is there to say.  It smells good and get&#x27;s all up in there I guess. The little lava stones are the best part.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fantastic. The scent is clean and masculine but not over powering.  I liked the scent so much that I will keep buying these for the guys in my house. My son really liked the scent as well. This is a very rich and moisturizing soap. But it is also effective on odors- even pervasive ones. We farm and a lot of of the animal smells do not wash off with lesser soaps. My son has found this product is too moisturizing for his face. But it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 2 weeks now and Dove has hit the nail on the head! Leaves your skin feeling moisturized and refreshed while giving it a truly deep clean that guys need. Has even helped reduce the acne on my chest and back!</li>
    <li> Definitely a good soap. It doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin. It cleans it pretty well. The smell of it is decent. Good product.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say? Has a grit to it, which I like for some reason, and does not seem to dry out my skin like many others. I like using a bar, this does not have some excessive smell and I don&#x27;t itch from dry skin, plus I seem clean. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Dove Men is a great product that leaves me smelling fresh and feeling clean. It does not dry the skin much at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap to use period. Really feels like a deep clean but I would still suggest exfoliating on problem areas, luckily dove sells an exfoliating sponges that work like a charm!</li>
    <li> When I first read about this soap, I thought \\&quot;Sure, a clever advertising gimmick from the folks on Madison Avenue on behalf of the &#x27;cleansing cream&#x27; people.\\&quot;  But no, it&#x27;s something special.  I&#x27;m no expert on scents, but it sure doesn&#x27;t smell like a girlie soap.  And whatever the little particles imbedded in the soap are, they give a mildly stimulating feeling when the bar is rubbed on the skin.  Where do they go?  I&#x27;ve not been able to figure that out, but I&#x27;ve never found one on my body after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this soap won&#x27;t appeal to all members of the liquid body wash generation, but I strongly recommend it for others.  Here&#x27;s hoping Dove won&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
    <li> i like it&lt;br /&gt;this soap very clean soft feel&lt;br /&gt;smells good fresh scnet&lt;br /&gt;nice price good product i love it !</li>
    <li> This soap has a good smell but it does not lather as well as the white one. The grainy feel makes no difference.</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best bar soaps out their for the price.  I shower usually 2 times a day so one bar tends to go fast since I love to lather up. I personally prefer the bar soap over the body wash.  I still give kiels men&#x27;s bar soap the edge in quality, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
    <li> dove is always so, smooth, this one in specific its, really soft and you will feel clean after you use it..</li>
    <li> Everybody should have their own box of this soap it take care of your skin and makes you smell great in the process. That&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> Sort of like an Irish Spring clean scent. It has the same qualities that other Dove soaps have but with that crisp scent. It&#x27;s strong but it seems not to stick to you to make it too strong. The &#x27;scrubbing&#x27; elements are kind of nice if you use the soap AGAINST your body; nothing irritating or too impressive. Clean, seems to last longer than other Dove soaps (doesn&#x27;t disintergrate) as quickly. If you use their deodorants.. this works well with them.</li>
    <li> I have always liked the softness of Dove soaps but never really like the feminine (The scent is nice and mild enough that you won&#x27;t be stinking up a room with it.) smell or packaging. This soap didn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all and it didn&#x27;t get oily at all.</li>
    <li> Picture this: You just got done saving a family from a burning building and while heading home you decided to rescue that trapped family of bears in the tree, why you ask? Because your a man and we do awesome things.  But whats this?  You have a date with the lady, your going someplace fancy to enjoy cocktails and pleasantries, but your covered in ash and honey and bear spit; what now?  Well you get you manliness to the shower and grab yourself a bar of Dove Men +care.  Pretty sure that +care means you can go into the shower after fighting a honey badger, that&#x27;s right, and come out looking like brad pit or whoever the ladies swoon over these days.  Your skin will feel great and there are scrubbing thingy ma jigs in the bar that help to make sure you get cleaned up all nice and proper.  I don&#x27;t use a wash cloth, nor a luff a, I rub my manliness down with bar to skin prowess.  Was using irish spring but i never got any gold feeling from using it so I switched, you should do the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed soap before but I was surprised how much I like this soap. First it lathers nicely and while it does contain scrubbing grit it&#x27;s not an excessive about and isn&#x27;t scratchy. What I like is that it leaves you feeling squeaky clean with no soap film.</li>
    <li> This soap is soft on skin and is of a good quality.  I have bought this a few times and have been satisfied with the quality.</li>
    <li> The scrubbing part feels great it leaves your skin soft and refreshed. The 8-pack last about 6 months with normal use and is a good value. The smell is very nice and lasts for a while.</li>
    <li> I started using Dove for men products and must say that I feel the difference. I&#x27;ve been using this and another Dove Men&#x27;s soap for about 3 months now and I will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I get really dried skin in the winter and have decided to stop purchasing \\&quot;Pre de Provence\\&quot; soaps to cut cost and try this brand.  The soap smells good but produces little to no lather making it difficult to use.  The bar also does not last at all and leaves your skin drier than it was before using.  Going back to \\&quot;Pre de Provence\\&quot; as the Dove soap has dried out my skin so bad that it wakes me up at night.</li>
    <li> This soap is great.  It smells very nice and the grit/microbeads or whatever you want to call it makes you feel really clean after using it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the same kind of residue that I&#x27;m used to feeling after using normal Dove soap, but it doesn&#x27;t dry you out like I feel the yellow Dial bars do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall?  I seem to go through it quickly.  I think that maybe with the moisturizers and the little microbeads in it, it may break apart and dissolve faster.  I also get frustrated by the soap dish in my shower, as it holds a bit of water and I tend to find a small puddle of soap under the bar the next time I get in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - good product.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the feel.  I just started using this for my face too, and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or anything.  I am not a &amp;#34;metrosexual&amp;#34; or anything like that, but my wife likes when I smell more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  It seems to keep my skin less itchy in the winter, so that&#x27;s good.  I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels around my junk.  oh well.</li>
    <li> this clean has a scent but its not a pretty scent like roses or lavender its a CLEAN smell that a Man would be comfortable with buy a bar and see for yourself. :)</li>
    <li> Make no mistake, this is NOT your typical, lotion-y Dove product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there&#x27;s the Dove lotion ingredient, but you&#x27;re not overwhelmed by the amount of oily residue that sometimes happen when you use Dove&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is, of course, that you face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out. That&#x27;s especially true here. My face feels clean but it also feels somewhat smooth, but not dirty or sweaty smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product and the fragrance is very mild, yet masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar in Deep clean has a very neutral odor best described as simply soapy with no noticeable perfume except for maybe the slightest hint of sandalwood so it is not so much masculine as definitely not feminine. It cleans quite well but has moisturizers so it doesn&#x27;t leave the face feeling dry but rather soft and smooth. There are some visible small black \\&quot;purifying grains\\&quot; in the ivory-colored bar but perhaps also something else that provides a very gentle exfoliation. This bar is ideal for both men and for women who don&#x27;t like strongly-perfumed soaps.</li>
    <li> I have used soaps before tht have inclusions to remove dead skin cells, but this bar actually feels like it has metal shavings embedded in it and I&#x27;m not sure why they had to make it this way.  The scent is like a weak knock off Axe products and really doesnt last outside of the shower</li>
    <li> 8 bars for around $9 isn&#x27;t a bad deal at all. This soap smells pretty good, it&#x27;s a masculine smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind or that \\&quot;dry\\&quot; feeling. I used to use Irish Spring but am tempted to switch over to this after trying it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not Brad Pitt or any kind of celebrity, so I&#x27;m quite easy when it comes to skin care products. I madly love the smell of this soap. It&#x27;s pleasant and manly. I use this to wash my hands and the scent still lingers even after a 2 mile run. None of the hand soaps I used before has smell lasts this long. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For years I have been using a liquid body wash and began to really dislike the residue buildup on my skin and that fact I had to use the funny looking sponge. Getting back to basics with a bar of soap was a welcomed change. The bar works well and is a nice alternative.</li>
    <li> Wish they had it at Costco or something but not by me.  It smells great and has the little granules for those that like to feel they are getting clean.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this soap. (I love the manly smell!) This and the green one are the only things he&#x27;ll use, but he prefers the red. I would like for Dove to release more than just the two scents in bar form.</li>
    <li> I was overall happy with the soap on the first day, however this soap disintegrates and dissolves very fast, hardly lasts a week. The last 25-35% of soap is almost unusable, have to throw it off every time.</li>
    <li> Delivered fast and with the quality as buying from a store. Great product that moisturizers your skin and gives off a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This soap works great, love the small beads in the product, but the smell is a bit over powering.  If you are going to an Italian disco in the 80&#x27;s you would fit right in.  I can&#x27;t even walk into our bathroom without being overpowered.  I will look around for a different sent, or perhaps no scent??  who wants to smell like their soap all day?</li>
    <li> Great soap, I especially like the grains in it. It just feels like you get a good scrub. Don&#x27;t worry about the grains scratching you as I have soft skin and have never had an issue. It also smells great and masculine which I&#x27;ve  found to be rare for soap</li>
    <li> I use both the Deep Clean and the Fresh, either one will work.  I shave in the shower which I have found gives you the best shave as the steam from the shower and hot water really soften up your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for kicks I lathered up my face with the Dove Deep Clean Bar Soap and worked it into my beard.  Did NOT rinse it off and left it on my face, then applied my shaving gel. I found out I don&#x27;t need as much shaving gel when doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most incredible shave I ever got with a blade that was used, not a new blade. Close and comfortable with no pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, when finished my face was as soft as a baby&#x27;s you know what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try if you shave in the shower like me.</li>
    <li> The best smelling!  Dove is always a good soap.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the scent of these and the scrubbing beads within the soap. However, every now and then it leaves my skin very dry. If I use it a couple time a week for a quick shower and use body wash the rest of the time this ratio works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Even though my husband prefers body wash/face wash over bar soap, I convinced him to try these.  And to his surprise, he liked them!  He said they lather really well, and do give an exfoliating, deep clean.  They don&#x27;t dry his skin out like some soaps do, and they have a really nice fragrance, like most of the Dove for Men product line does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love (and I&#x27;m sure he does as well) that these are for face and body.  He doesn&#x27;t like having lots of \\&quot;lotions and potions\\&quot; as he calls it for basic hygiene, so it&#x27;s really nice that these are for all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We continue to buy Dove Men + Care products for him, and this great product is another reason why!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of soaps over the years as brands have created and dropped soaps (no pun intended) and I&#x27;ve been using this one for about a year now hoping the don&#x27;t drop this soap as I like it so much. Has a good scent and I like the beads that do a decent job at exfoliating.</li>
    <li> These are not as sudsy as regular dove soap and my wife thinks the smell is too strong. I&#x27;m gonna go back to girly soap.</li>
    <li> This soap smells very good.  It leaves my skin feeling very clean and not dry like I&#x27;ve had happen with some of the liquid soaps.  If your skin is really sensitive then the purifying grains may be to much for you but it should feel good to an average skinned person.  Love this soap and will be buying more as I go through this eight pack.</li>
    <li> Dove was right on the mark when they developed this soap.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and love it.</li>
    <li> Great product and does not leave a dry skin feeling on the skin after use.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I feel like hygiene products for men are an excuse to dump awful products.  Go ahead and buy this if you&#x27;re okay scraping the soap scum off yourself with a towel and having a bar deteriorates rapidly from being around water.</li>
    <li> I buy manly smelling soap for my hubby.  He smells really good when he gets out of the shower at night.</li>
    <li> The Dove Company has a long reputation with soaps that speaks for its self.  I found this product to be a very good bar soap for men.  There are many people with allergies to additives to soap products and also those who just do not like some of the perfumes used in the industry.  I am not familiar with the formula used in this product but for men who do not like many of the strong smelling soaps this one just may work for you.  It does have a smell but it is just about right.</li>
    <li> Horrible old man/Old Spice scent. You&#x27;ve been warned. Have no idea why this product has such high reviews.</li>
    <li> works well...smells fine, but I&#x27;ve read that the plastic scrub particles never dissolve...won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Great Soap, doesn&#x27;t totally dissolve in the shower like some generics, doesn&#x27;t require much to sudd up and gives a fairly neutral smell (as in your girl friend could use it without complaining)</li>
    <li> Soap has grit and suds. Good stuff. What is not to like. Well, the bars don&#x27;t last a long time, however, I don&#x27;t except them to. I have them set up on Sub and Save and let the reorder come to me, so I like them a lot!</li>
    <li> This soap has some power to it and some grain in it to help exfoliate and clean the skin, but it&#x27;s got a strong musky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you consider most laundry detergents have smells, soaps, have smells, deodorants have smells, colognes have smells by the end of the day you smell like the Bath and Body Shop at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give us a great soap for men that cleans, exfoliates, and leaves no residue and no smell.</li>
    <li> I usually buy exotic soap from Spain, Italy, France, Syria and the like. I have also made a few batches from the cold process. I try and stick with natural soaps as they agree with my body chemistry, and I like how they lather and smell. I tried this Dove soap and really, really like it. It smells great all day long, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the micro cleansers actually feel good. I put this on my subscribe and save with Amazon, that&#x27;s how much I like it. Guys, you will love the smell, and girls, you will too. Give it a try, it&#x27;s not too expensive, and works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I liked the price of this soap, and it smells great.  I also think it gets me as clean as any other soap.  I like it alot, and I will buy it again, if it goes on sale.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good and the smell lasts fairly long for being soap (about 4-6 hours) and has okay projection. Unfortunately though, it did not clean very well and dried my skin on my hands and face significantly. Especially seeing how I only use it in the shower one to two times max daily. It&#x27;s also possible that i am allergic to this soap because I developed a red rash/hives near the outside edges of my eyes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why there are so many 5-star reviews. The little abrasive bits in it are supposed to make it more manly, maybe? They don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s more like discovering that there&#x27;s some sand on your soap, but not much. It&#x27;s not even abrasive, it&#x27;s just scratchy and not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely don&#x27;t hate it, but it&#x27;s just soap (or not soap, if you want to get picky about terms).</li>
    <li> There are several versions of the Dove Men + Care soap. This one is the most abrasive, with little pieces in the soap that help to exfoliate. I love the feeling. The scent is my favorite of the line, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to say one negative thing, I would say it melts easily in the water. I keep mine in it&#x27;s box, just outside the shower door, so it doesn&#x27;t melt away when my kids take their baths/showers from water hitting it.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. This stuff is perfect for men that like to work out and sweat! My wife loves the smell and the micro-beads provide excellent exfoliation during showers. I will surely continue to purchase. I typically get 1 week per bar.</li>
    <li> This soap has a nice light fresh scent. It has tiny pieces of something to exfoliate and does a fairly good job of it. What I found that I wanted was more suds...or lather. Otherwise it is very nice.</li>
    <li> I got these cheap off a slick deal and being a long-time dove user, I can say these are not bad.  The &#x27;deep clean&#x27; isn&#x27;t really that deep.  I noticed little to no actual exfoliation from the little beads in the soap.  Next time I need to re-stock soap, I&#x27;ll base my decision on which is cheaper per unit.  This or regular dove.</li>
    <li> He loves this stuff and I keep getting him to try the liquid but he keeps hanging on to the bars.</li>
    <li> Great bargain.  Soap is fine, but if you have hard water in your area, maybe it is not for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Deep Clean version of this soap for approximately 2 years as of writing. It&#x27;s _the_ best bar soap that I have ever come across. The exfoliating quality along with the scent gets the job done without any residue that I&#x27;ve noticed with the aloe line that Dove also makes. However, the last two packages that I have purchased from Amazon seems to have a reduced amount of abrasives on each bar, and the scent has taken on more of a \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell that I usually notice on unscented hand lotions (Vaseline&#x27;s Unscented Intensive Care line comes to mind). While it is not an unbearable smell, it is definitely not the scent that I remember. I am more irked that the exfoliating quality takes a hit, as it was the primary reason that I loved this soap. I&#x27;ll likely try one more pack in the hope that it \\&quot;returns\\&quot; to the bar that I have been accustomed to.</li>
    <li> This soap has a nice masculine &#x27;warm&#x27; smell to it (the other Dove Men+Care soaps have lighter fresher scents).  I like them all so I usually grab whatever one is cheapest at the time.  The deep clean has a bit more roughness to it so act as a very mild scrubber too.  Amazon&#x27;s price is usually about 50 cents less a box than I can find in the local stores.</li>
    <li> Dove Men and Care Body and Face Bar, 8 Count (4 Oz bars)&lt;br /&gt;by Dove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove is the Best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove gets me Clean but never Dry or itchy...</li>
    <li> I like this scent over the &amp;#34;Extra Fresh&amp;#34; Dove Men+ Care scent.  This is also great for exfoliating as it has little grains of sand or other particles that feel like they are really scrubbing the dirt out.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of Mens Dove Soap.it leaves your skin feeling clean&lt;br /&gt;and the soap smells great this was a good buy.</li>
    <li> They have little beads which feel great. I&#x27;ve been using this bar for 1 week and it dissolves quickly, otherwise I like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> This soap seems to work well and provides a boost for the mornings. Has a nice smell also. The beads can be felt, but not sure how much additional deep cleaning they actually provide.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I previously used Olay ultra, but it didn&#x27;t seem to clean very well.  This is the best of both worlds.  Cleanses and moisturizes.</li>
    <li> Contains a talc or fine sand that helps clean but is not irritating. I also like the smaller size of the bars which fit exacly into the palm of your hand and aren&#x27;t bulky.  Leaves no film.  You leave the shower feeling better than the man that went it.  We guys need some things that are made especially for us</li>
    <li> I do not use this soap for my face since I have very sensitive skin and need fragrance free cleansers, but for an all-over body cleanse, I&#x27;m literally SHOCKED by how great this soap is from Dove. It leaves your skin feeling moist and clean, with a subtle but fresh scent. Usually my body feels very taut and dry after using bar-soaps, but not with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the soap is best compared to the few \\&quot;organic\\&quot; soaps I&#x27;ve tried, which I love. The \\&quot;micro-grains\\&quot; are a nice added touch. They probably don&#x27;t do anything--in theory they &#x27;exfoliate&#x27; and &#x27;remove dead skin cells&#x27;--but most importantly I like the way it feels. The soap lasts a long time too and doesn&#x27;t shrink the second it gets wet (like most mainstream bars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: I would not recommend this for your face (even if you don&#x27;t have normally sensitive skin) because I think it would be too harsh, but for the rest of your body - prepare to be amazed! This is a gentle bar soap that won&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry, smells great, and will keep you clean. I&#x27;ve tried bar soaps off and on, mostly off because I&#x27;ve been so disappointed by them, but this actually made me want to start using them again. Very impressed, Dove! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar is a deep cleaning soap bar. I have used two of the other Dove Men + Care bars and like this one too. Does what its supposed to without drying my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it on my face but I suppose it&#x27;s fine for that too. The bar lasts a long time as long as you keep it on a soap saver.</li>
    <li> feel good after showering with this soap.</li>
    <li> excellent product and quality.  Securely packed and well priced.. . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Beginning 2012, I used to buy generic white Dove bars a while ago but for some reason I went back to other regular soaps. But in November (2 months ago) I started noticing my skin was losing softness, mainly in my feet and my hands. I decided to give the Dove Men a try and the results came almost instantly! All soft again :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews say it melts too quickly but from my experience that&#x27;s not my opinion at all: I started using the first bar on Christmas and I changed 3 days ago (01/19) which is about two weeks. And I take about two showers a day + hand and face washing throughout the day. I think you just need to take care of the bar and not leave it in a pool of water.&lt;br /&gt;About the odor complaints, it just smells great! Classic scent. No complaints at all from me.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the November rain-ish color, the micro-grains and the distinctive shape makes it very original and enjoyable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I don&#x27;t think I had a better soap in a while and I&#x27;m most likely sticking to Dove Men.</li>
    <li> This soap is just absolutely amazing. It is my skins life support. I was using Zest soap and my skin was drying up like crazy and now it is back to feeling normal and my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t feel as if she&#x27;s caressing a reptile anymore. Awesome!</li>
    <li> As far as a soap its ok. Will stick to regular type/brand next time. Only bought this on sale to try it out. Expected to see improvement over time but skin condition (non medical) is still the same with no improvement.</li>
    <li> Used these for stocking stuffers, and I think if you can get a good deal on a pack of these, they&#x27;re great giveaway add-ons.</li>
    <li> Has scrubbing beads and has a manly fragrance. I used regular Dove before, but these just smell damn good.&lt;br /&gt;Simply awesome</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this soap in the winter, it is expensive but I can completely tell the difference using it compared to a cheap soap. My skin gets very dry during the winters (knuckles crack and bleed!) so I will spring for this brand in the winter and revert to my cheap irish spring or old spice in the summers!</li>
    <li> I like this product , it&#x27;s get tough dirt grime oil&#x27;s out of my hands and leaves them soft !</li>
    <li> This is my preferred soap for washing. A little bit of grit to get extra clean!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this soap bar.  Although it says Dove Men but my wife uses it too. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Good soap, great bargain.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I bought cases!</li>
    <li> Has a pleasant &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; but not over-powering scent. Seems to help moisturize the skin particularly during the dry winter monthes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to say soap is soap, but as a man living with a wife and two daughters it&#x27;s nice to have a soap that is a little more masculine in feel and scent.  Definitely worth the price and convenience of ordering through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I recently saw this product in the store.  Seems it has been around for a while and I had missed it somehow.  I confess that in the past I have washed with my wifes Dove bar.  I loved the scent and the luxury of it.  But it was a little too strong and slippery for me, and it didn&#x27;t do too well when I was really dirty.  This mens Dove has a great spicy masculine scent and really does a great job of deep cleaning.  I have used both the fresh and the deep cleaning and prefer the deep cleaning.  The extra fresh I would recommend for those that really need a deodorant soap.  In either case however, one thing I really love about this soap is its ability really get you clean, and at the same time moisturize your skin.  Dry skin is a real problem for many here in New England in winter when the air is so bone dry.  Washing down with this really has helped, and, unlike the ladies Dove, you really feel clean in spite of the moisturizing ability.  Trust me guys, a cake of this stuff will spoil you.  It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can say that I don&#x27;t like about this soap is that it gets used up very quickly.  In no time it seems the bar is down and its time to crack open another one.  Gets a little expensive in an area that most of us don&#x27;t consider a budget to be much of a factor.  But for what it is and does, this Mens Dove is well worth the expense, and is an excellent soap that I highly recommend... : )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin for the regular guy soaps. The regular soaps always dry out my skin. This one however moisturize it. I like how it is body and face.</li>
    <li> I will probably never change soaps again. Smells great, washes off easily, and has the little grains inside that scrub. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent product- buying extra to have on hand . great for feeling  clean and has a men&#x27;s attitude for every man in the house.</li>
    <li> After years of using Irish Spring and having dry skin issues, I switched to this soap (the deep clean version). The dry skin problems have almost entirely gone away after a few weeks of using this. Sure it is slightly more expensive than other soaps but the extra small expense is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great man&#x27;s soap. Fragrance is very faint and does not linger. This is good if you wear a cologne daily like I do. It has bits of pumice like material which help for scrubbing, but can be rough on your face. When I wash my face I just lather my hand and use my hand to avoid this. This soap does not dry out my skin when I forget to put on lotion in the morning. I&#x27;ve yet to find a soap that can match it for the price, and I keep it on hand in bulk.</li>
    <li> This soap has the \\&quot;micro-beads\\&quot; similar to exfoliating face washes, etc.  When used with a washcloth, you won&#x27;t notice them all that much, but used straight on the skin, you&#x27;ll definitely get a good scrubbing from it.  It does have a lot of moisturizers in it, too, which I can seem to tell a difference given that it&#x27;s the winter and we have really hard water.  My skin feels good afterward and doesn&#x27;t have the dry itch from lesser normal soaps.</li>
    <li> Having gone through much of the Dove Men +Care Face and Body Bar, the specific attribute I can distinguish this soap by is its ability to make my showered skin feel as slick as a freshly waxed car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This incredible, moisturizing bar soap has scrubby bits inside. My skin feels completely free of any residue after I wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the fresh, manly scent and the clean, fresh feeling I get from using this bar soap; it is like no other.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap. It has a subtle, but masculine scent, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like say Irish Spring does. It also has a little pumice in it, so it&#x27;ll gently exfoliate too. I got the red and the green colors and they both smell and work well. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry and sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using various Dove products for decades. This new scent is very good. I like the smell and the bar helps my dry skin. My sole criticism is that I&#x27;m not a big fan of \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; granules in my soaps. I prefer them smooth.</li>
    <li> All in all, this is a pretty good soap.  It&#x27;s got some moisturizing lotion but not too much, it lathers up well, and it has scrubbing fibers that leave you feeling exfoliated and extra clean.  The relatively small four ounce size feels good and works well.  It has a strong fragrance when lathered - like a woody, musky cologne - and leaves a slight fragrance on the skin when you&#x27;re done showering.  The only caveat is that if you share your shower with someone who doesn&#x27;t like that masculine of a scent, you will need his and hers bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I thought it was pretty good.  It cleans well and smells good, and I&#x27;m not sure what else I can reasonably expect from soap.</li>
    <li> This Dove Deep clean soap works well; it has the typical &#x60;manly&#x27; scent - sort of spicy. It does have gritty particles in it, so those who wash themselves with the bar of soap rather than using a wash cloth or some such item might find it slightly rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious, since the package does not list ingredients what these gritty particles were. I found on the Dove site the following list: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate or Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine or Sodium C14-C16 Olefin Sulfonate, Sodium Cocoate or Sodium Palm Kernelate, Fragrance, Microcrystalline Wax, Sodium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Green 5, Iron Oxides, Red 30 Lake, Titanium Dioxide, Yellow 5 Lake, Yellow 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems the gritty particles are microcrystalline wax. Don&#x27;t let the steric acid scare you - it&#x27; a fatty acid occurring naturally in plants and it&#x27;s the ingredient that lets shaving creams, cosmetics and skin cleansers work...it just doesn&#x27;t sound good to have in something you are putting on your skin. Maybe that&#x27;s why the list of ingredients isn&#x27;t on the soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In total this is a nice bar of soap, it works, but I noticed that after using it twice; its size had shrunk to way less than the irish spring that had been used several more times than this. That makes me question its value.</li>
    <li> This is not the Dove soap I am used to. The regular Dove was fine, cleaned well, but did not last very long. This has a completely different fragrance that I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like or not....I&#x27;m still not sure. I think I like it. It&#x27;s a different scent, clean, but subtle, and a little medical. Still, I think I will like it. It lathers well and I feel clean after showering. I don&#x27;t know that the little rough piecesmake a difference in cleaning. There is not enough to make it really exfolliate, so I don&#x27;t see the reason for it. It also rinses off well. I  like it, and will probably continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This has a stronger scent than I would expect from a Dove product but it lessened once I used it with water and washed up. It feels nice and does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned the scent is strong but lessens when you use the soap. It is hard to describe the scent. It is not a perfume or cologne scent but more of a clean soap smell. I can smell it on my hands after using the soap and it smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is slightly rounded and shaped so it is easy to hold and easy to use on my body. The color is not the clean white you get in some Dove soaps but a darker color that I would expect in a product that has \\&quot;purifying grains.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels great on my skin and leaves a clean smell after use. I really like this.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Dove Men line! They are his favorite products to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is his opinion, not mine. Although, I always like the way he smells after using the various Dove products, too! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells manly, but not overwhelming. He likes the way his skin feels after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, he recommends this product, along with most all of the Dove Men products.</li>
    <li> (This review is for the Deep Clean) Although we use Dove soap regularly, my main complaint is that it takes so many rinses to remove it from my skin. I also like the classic smell. My wife loves Dove soap though and doesn&#x27;t have the same problem even I mentioned it to her. The new Dove soap for men is easy to rinse, no doubt about it. It also has some pumice like texture on it. I would say this is an interesting twist for the franchise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Ability to clean - 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;Grease removal - 3 stars (leave this job to Lava, etal)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to rinse - 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance - 2 stars</li>
    <li> This Dove bar has a wonderful clean scent, cleans well and rinses well. What else can you say about soap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it smells great on my husband - a definite plus, for him! It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out his skin and since we have softened water, it is sometimes difficult to feel like you have rinsed all the soap off. This is good and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a residue.</li>
    <li> I like the grit they mix into the bar.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this bar soap., The exfoliating beads really deep-clean my skin and it has masculine scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering. Unless you want to go with the online purchase of the more upscale (more expensive) bar soaps, this is THE BEST shelf-bought bar soap out there...hands down.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t sold in many stores in my area so I purchase this product from here. Clean smelling soap that works very well and leaves the skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> There are little beads in the soap that are coarse and scratch at my skin as I use it.  I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Cleans well with the little scrubs. Smells clean and fresh. I don&#x27;t use it for my face, I have acne medication for that.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this lightly scented, slightly exfoliating soap bar from Dove. I used it on my face for the first couple of weeks and it did not cause any adverse reactions, which is saying something because I my skin can be sensitive to certain products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked great as a body bar. I would recommend this for sure.</li>
    <li> Scrubs good. I like this and Defense Bar Soap. Try em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: has exfoliant which feels good</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It has some grit to it which, as a guy, I love. Sloughs off dead skin on my body. I was very much an Irish Spring kind of guy for a long time, been using this soap for about 4 years and I don&#x27;t want to use another soap. Also, it makes your bathroom smell manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the moisturizer? It makes my skin feel better.</li>
    <li> My wife bought me some custom &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; soap a year ago and I really liked the abrasive nature of it but I didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;custom&amp;#34; price.  After doing a lot more research than one should probably do on soap for showering I decided to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like it.  I wish it had a big more and/or bigger abrasive pieces; if there was a version like that I&#x27;d give it 5 stars no problem.  Even still, it feels nice, has a good smell, and seems to work :-)  At least my wife doesn&#x27;t run away from me...</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned at first because Dove is well known as a woman&#x27;s product line. But after seeing Shaq as the spokesperson for their new mens line I figured I should give it a try. I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the soap smells great! A nice clean masculine smell but not overwhelming or to strong like some mens products can be. This will not conflict with your cologne nor will it make you smell like you took a bath in cologne (I&#x27;m talking to you Axe, lol). The best part is the grains. Yeah, this soap has tiny grains that act like pumice or as I like to say, sandpaper. I&#x27;ve never felt so clean as I do after using this stuff. No, it doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything, just feels like you&#x27;ve really scrubbed the gunk off. It takes off old deodorant, grease, dead skin, dirt from outside etc.  It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin afterwards like regular soap does which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying a few bars I ordered the multi-pack on \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; as it is half the price of the grocery store. Now I&#x27;m hoping they come out with a shampoo that works as well as the soap!</li>
    <li> Courtesy of my 14 yo, \\&quot;This is the very best soap in the world for my face. It even cleans better than those little scrubby pads.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Dear Amazon Customer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to be honest when I say that there&#x27;s not much I can tell you about this product that you don&#x27;t already know; it&#x27;s soap.  In fact, it&#x27;s expensive soap, but it can indeed be a value proposition.  Let me tell you why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - It cleanses your face.  Leave the expensive facial cleansers at Sephora where they belong; this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - It&#x27;s anti-perspirant soap.  While I recommend using deodorant, you can at least save yourself the double-dose of Titanium-Dioxide by letting this soap do the anti-perspirant work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - It has Titanium-Dioxide, which has been linked to adverse health outcomes.  I plan to discontinue using it due to the inclusion of this ingredient, as well as the inclusion of potentially carcinogenic dyes, in the soap&#x27;s composition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - The \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; granules contained within the soap are gritty and may be unpleasant depending upon your skin type.  I don&#x27;t notice that they work any magic on my skin, but I AM clean when I get out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - It&#x27;s pricey.  At over a dollar a bar, there is a wide range of cheaper alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, there just isn&#x27;t anything to tell.  It&#x27;s soap and it works.  It&#x27;s not the best soap for you, and it&#x27;s pricier than most soap, but if it fits your needs, go for it.</li>
    <li> this soap is simply, the greatest of all time!! it has beads to scrub, and leaves the man hide soft and moist. you don&#x27;t need lotion ever!! dove is the best, or g.o.a.t. thank you dove</li>
    <li> This soap is like a loofa and soap bar in 1.  Made for a man and has the great smell and great cleaning ability.  I&#x27;m giving these away as gifts to my buddies!</li>
    <li> I used the liquid form of this soap and it&#x27;s outstanding, the bars are great, especially if your traveling.  Has a great smell and get&#x27;s you clean !</li>
    <li> A decent soap that unfotunatly makes me break out. Has a slight amount of pumice in the soap that helps scrub off dirt.</li>

Skin feels clean and moisturized.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There ya have it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar, Deep Clean, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013</li>
    <li> Well, knock me over.  Here&#x27;s a men&#x27;s bar that I really like for myself.  First the scent is wonderful.  Fresh without being overly perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of how scented it is, we received some of the Dove [[ASIN:B009VGNYFM Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash--Clean Defense]] and while I liked it on my man, there&#x27;s no way I would personally use it.  The scent was just over-powering in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I like how it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It&#x27;s Winter and my skins a dry mess right now, but this bar doesn&#x27;t appear to be making the situation worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re still using garbage like Irish Spring, you need to up your game to real men&#x27;s soap. First off, this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like other soap for guys, so you will look better. Also, a woman told me that when a male uses potent soap like Irish Spring, his skin taste bad (if you know what I mean). This soap doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as the garbage soaps, but what it lacks in longevity it makes up for in quality.</li>
    <li> I have sometimes used the regular Dove body bar, especially during the winter months, and thought that it was an OK product but not one to buy as it did not stand out in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular Dove product in entirely a different story. It gently cleans, exfoliates, and feels awesome on your body while you are soaping up. I will certainly buy this product as I have never had the great experience of bying a soap that leaves my skin feeling so good. Def. above the best.</li>
