<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my teeth with this!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> This product was sent to me to test and review. I was very skeptical when I signed up for the MaxxGel Teeth Whitening Pen 2 pack. But I must say , I honestly love it! Every application you choose to keep it on your teeth for 10 to 30 minutes. It is simple to use with the brush applicator . And it works! I&#x27;m a coffee drinker and a smoker but I really don&#x27;t think anyone can tell now that I am using this amazing product! Thanks MaxxGel!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karma&#x27;s Review&#x27;s</li>
    <li> not as full as it looks when you get it, you have to twist it to get it started by that point it looks as if you already used half of it. Reminds of a bag of chips that are full of air, and when you open it you only have half a bag.</li>
    <li> It does work well, but for me &amp; my mouth... it sure did burn my gums &amp; tongue something awful!</li>
    <li> works great going to have to buy more for my granddaughter . The price compared to department stores who want almost 2 x your price .</li>
    <li> This is a super easy to use teeth whitening system. My husband uses these because he is a coffee drinker and a smoker and ove rthe years both have affected the color and care of his teeth. This pack comes with2 and he uses it a couple of times a week. He says the taste is pretty good considering and the effectiveness will def take some time. He says he can tell the difference ever so slightly and would hope it makes more of a difference in the long run.</li>
    <li> This product whitens pretty well. I use these types of products to touch up. You do need to be careful to try and not get this on your gums, because the gel will irritate your gums.</li>
    <li> I received this during a product launch, and I have used them for about a week.  The taste, is not great, but much better than some others I&#x27;ve tried.  This product is easy to use, has clear instructions, and you just brush it on your teeth, then sit there and smile until it dries.  Who doesn&#x27;t like to smile?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one week I have noticed a difference.  I don&#x27;t smoke, but I do drink coffee and tea, and we all know what that can do to your teeth.</li>
    <li> These simply did not work well. I used the one pen every single day for and left it on for around 15-20 minutes. It made my teeth one shade lighter at best and the effects did not last. It would be one shade lighter the rest of the day and by the time I woke up the following day, my teeth were back to the color they were prior to using. You&#x27;re better off paying for the Crest white strips or something of more quality. I also don&#x27;t like that if you google this company/product/brand, nothing besides the amazon page and some sketchy other websites come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I hate that these came with absolutely no instructions and I had to look through the reviews to figure out how long to keep this on for.</li>
    <li> I did not like this pen.  I did not find it to be that effective.</li>
    <li> Throw it in your cart as an add on to save on shipping- these are great to throw in your handbag or backpack for a quick treatment on the go-- not a bad product for the price. I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used a whitener before, the strips, and they worked really well, so i was wondering if this get pen stuff was going to be the same. the results weren&#x27;t as quick, but they were there. i don&#x27;t know if shining white teeth like in the picture is going to happen, but they&#x27;ve certainly lightened up a bit. they don&#x27;t work on fake teeth or caps, but if you have those, you should already know that they aren&#x27;t going to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;it was easy to use. smear the stuff on your teeth, and stand there grinning like an idiot until they&#x27;ve worked their magic. i have sensitive teeth, so i was quite happy to find that they didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth at all, which is what whiteners used to do, when they first started putting them on the market. they would strip the enamel. i only gave five stars because it&#x27;s hard to find the time to look goofy for so long; i certainly didn&#x27;t want to wear it during the early morning commute. otherwise, it&#x27;s a really good product.&lt;br /&gt;sample was provided for free for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I got these because I drink coffee and from time to time I need to maintain white teeth.I have used whitening strips,whitening kits with the tray, &amp; whitening toothpaste.I needed something fast and easy to apply.Well technically the directions are stated on the gel pen label to apply to your teeth leave on for about 10-30minutes per use expectorate and do not rinse.So in actuality you are still saving time because you can leave the house and when its time to expectorate I am sure you can go the bathroom or somewhere nearby to do that.So I like how convenient and quick it is to do.I do not have to sit and be home to do it like the whitening trays and strips.They also give you 2 gel pens in this pack one to keep in my purse and one to keep at home.It definitely helps when you need a quick whitening session just pull out this neat pen and apply with the brush tip they have.It covers your teeth well too.To apply you just twist the bottom and the product comes up through the brush tip.I am very happy with this set it does not taste bad,quick to apply,you get 2 pens, does a pretty good job whitening my teeth, &amp; compact to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided at discount for my honest feedback whether it be positive or negative.All opinions stated are solely my own experiences with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 12% Hydrogen Peroxide, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Carbomer, Peppermint Oil, Trolamine.</li>
    <li> This little pen is brilliant. Love how quickly it brightens my teeth. Will be buying back ups. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received 2 tubes at a discounted price! I was really nervous at first because I&#x27;ve tried other whiteners and the taste is so gross you can even finish the whole treatment but, not maxx teeth whitening pen. The taste was not bad at all. Not the best but it was manageable! It is one of the easiet whiteners to use. All you do is twist the bottom until the gel comes out make sure teeth are dry and then rub right on the teeth. Allow a few secs to pass before closing your mouth. I didn&#x27;t need very much at all so these two tubes will last be a while. What i love most is you do need to rinse it leaves no residue. I just spit a little and that was it. In just one application I noticed the difference immediately.. I love that as its whitening your teeth its also strengthening them at the same time.  Lots of other whiteners actually break down and strip your teeth of its enamel making them weak and prone to chips and breaks. I know this because I worked in a dental office. Finally a whitener that whitens and protects no mess no fuss!! Love it</li>
    <li> I was excited to try these! I have tried different whitening methods and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I followed the directions and applied to clean and dry teeth. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy they are to use and the minty taste it leaves in your mouth. I drink a lot of coffee and my teeth were in need of a freshening and whitening. This was perfect and did the trick! I love the 2 pack and will share the other pen with my husband.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for an easy way to brighten and whiten your teeth without a lot of fuss or muss! I&#x27;m very happy I received a discount on this item to try it!</li>
    <li> MaxxGel is one of best whitener products that I have tried! The majority of them taste bad and don&#x27;t seem work very well. With Maxxgel, you just brush on to dry teeth leave on for 30 seconds and go about your day. No rinsing required. It has a nice fresh mint taste flavor, not gritty or chalky like most whitening products. I am happy to recieve these to review. Im really pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> Although I have always wanted to try a whitening gel, I have to be honest and admit that I was nervous about using it on my teeth. So, I just sucked it up and tried it anyway. Per the instructions, I had to make sure my teeth were dry. I applied the gel on and spit out the extra that touched my tongue, and waited a few seconds to let the gel dry before I closed my mouth. It didn&#x27;t taste too bad and it could have been much worse. I was shocked at how I could tell a difference from before. Even though, I received this at a good price and I am glad that I tried it out.</li>
    <li> The MaxxGel Teeth Whitening pen was very easy to use. My daughter used one and I used the other for reviewing purposes, the reason why we got them. She is really glad we did too. I do see her teeth have made an improvement in their color since she started using it. I am not positive about mine, I believe it is more subtle on mine than on hers. I can see it on hers, but hard to on mine. I will keep using the pen until gone as will my daughter. It sort of reminds me of white out, the way it is applied, but not the color, tastes, or anything awful like that. It is a clear get that sort of slightly foams up, but just a bit. It is comfortable to leave on my teeth. I would apply after brushing my teeth about 10 minutes or so later and not drink anything for awhile after.</li>
    <li> Good Ilike very suppress</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a coffee drinker, 2 cups a day, and a red wine sipper, both of those are known to stain the teeth.  When I was given the opportunity to try MaxxGel Teeth Whitening Pens with 12% Hydrogen Peroxide for free, I was more than willing to give them a try!  The directions are easily found on the side of the pen and are super easy to follow, twist the end of the pen clockwise until gel appears on the brush and then apply to your teeth and allow the gel to sit on your teeth for 10-30 minutes.  That&#x27;s it!  It really is that easy to use!  The brush allows you to get in each between each tooth ensuring that you are applying the gel to your entire tooth surface.  I have tried whitening strips and gels before that have a bad taste or leave a burning sensation in your mouth and gum area.  I did not experience that with the MaxxGel Pens, the gel has a light minty taste.  It took about 3 applications before I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, I left the gel on for about 15 mins each time.  I like that this is a product you do not have to rinse off, so you can actually use it anywhere.  I also like that you get 2 MaxxGel pens with your order, this allows you to keep one at home and one in your purse or one at work.  It is really quick to do the application and I did not find it messy or difficult at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MaxxGel Teeth Whitening Pen provided for free by MaxxGel.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee every morning for like 3 hours just sipping it throughout my morning hours. So as you can imagine, my teeth are pretty stained. So when MaxxGel was offering their Teeth Whitening Pens for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered. I had heard great results from their product, so I was  extremely excited to see how well it would work. So they arrived and I read the directions  and applied a layer on my teeth. I waited about 20 minutes and brushed my teeth. I am so impressed with how fast I got results! I am definitely going to be ready for the wedding and birthday weekend that is coming next month! I definitely recommend this MaxxGel Teeth Whitening Pen.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to the taste like I am, it takes a bit of getting used to. Regular whitening products make me want to vomit and I can&#x27;t have on for more than a few minutes. The taste of these is bad... But bearable...</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use. My teeth were brighter after about a week.  Great product! Am thinking about giving as gifts for the upcoming season.</li>
    <li> I will never use those annoying white strips again. Grandma always told me peroxide would whiten my teeth but I couldn&#x27;t fathum putting that nasty liquid in my mouth. I was lucky enough to come across this great alternative. After 4 applications im already seeing a difference and so is my husband. I can&#x27;t wait for 2 weeks to see more results. Grandma I guess you were right! I love the added benefits of reducing sensitivity and germ killing power. These pens are defiantly worth a try!</li>
    <li> I got to try these MaxxGel whitening pens at a discounted price for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many many different teeth whitening gels, pens, washes, rinses, pastes, you name it. Most of them leave a nasty peroxide or bleach like taste in my mouth and I end up spitting them out before the time allotted.&lt;br /&gt;These MaxxGel pens tastes decent...I won&#x27;t say they taste great, but they are not gross and making me want to spit them out before they can start working.&lt;br /&gt;The Whitening pen is pretty simple to use too. Twist the bottom, the gel comes out the top, brush the gel onto dry teeth and let it sit.  There is enough in one MaxxGel pen to use multiple times. These pens are very similar to the stuff you put in a mouth piece and place in your mouth like at the dentist office, but not as bad tasting and there is no fuss with a mouth piece or anything so its simple and nice and seems to be working really well.&lt;br /&gt;I do not smoke but am a big time coffee drinker. My smile isn&#x27;t terrible but its not as white as I would like for it to be. I am seeing results with these MaxxGel pens and will purchase them when these 2 pens run out.</li>
    <li> I received these and very excited to see the longer term results.  So far these are good flavor and easy to use</li>
    <li> These are very easy to use and convenient!  They come two to an order, so I keep one in my purse and one in the bathroom cabinet. They last a long time, because it&#x27;s not something I do everyday, MaxxGel works quickly on those stains, making me feel more confident when I smile.  I also love buying product made in the USA, so I highly recommend this product.  I received a discount on my product for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> These pens are very easy to use and they really really work! I was lucky enough to receive a chance to review these teeth whitening gel pens as part of the promotion! I drink lots of coffee and I hate going to the dentist even if it is just for a cleaning and whitening treatmentthis works 100% so simple easy-to-use my daughter wanted to help me with it and she had fun she said it was like painting my teeth. I do not recommend letting children play with this by any means she is at that helping stage so I instructed her on what to do and it made her day helping me . I&#x27;m actually deducting one star because mine did not come with directions but I google searched and I easily found them. I keep one in my toothbrush holder so I remember to use it it&#x27;s about the size of a toothbrush handle anyway.</li>
    <li> I have used this MaxxGel whitening pen for about a week now and it works great!  Does what it promises to, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and also has a nice (peppermint) taste to it.  It is very convenient because you only need to leave it on for 10-30 minutes and then can just spit it out.  You don&#x27;t have the messiness and uncomfortable feeling of strips in your mouth or whitening trays.  I also like that it has simple ingredients and is made in the U.S.  This is definitely my new preferred method for teeth whitening and so helpful since I drink a lot of coffee and tea!</li>
    <li> When i got them initially i was  nervous because I&#x27;ve tried other whiteners and the taste is so gross you can even finish the whole treatment but, not maxx teeth whitening pen. The taste was not bad at all. Allow a few secs to pass before closing your mouth. I didn&#x27;t need very much at all so these two tubes will last be a while.It is one of the easiet whiteners to use. All you do is twist the bottom until the gel comes out make sure teeth are dry and then rub right on the teeth. n just one application I noticed the difference immediately.The applicator is a brush-on type and the gel is pushed through from the opposite end by gently twisting until the desired amount of gel has come out.. I love that as its whitening your teeth its also strengthening them at the same time. Lots of other whiteners actually break down and strip your teeth of its enamel making them weak and prone to chips and breaks. Finally a whitener that whitens and protects no mess no fuss!! MaxxGel Teeth Whitening pens are very simple to use. Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product in exchange to provide unbiased revie</li>
    <li> I am a very smiley person, I take so much pride of my teeth and have always struggled with my coffee and tea drinking because they stain teeth. When I was offered to try this product at a great deal and give my honest opinion I was happy to give it a try. I have to say that I am impressed with this product. There is no flavor to it but yet a refreshing feeling to my mouth. there is no trays needed which makes it perfect to take it anywhere. there was no stinging or anything else, and gradual results with use. Very discreet small packaging that you can just put in your necessaries or purse. Very happy and will be buying more replacement when this one is gone!</li>
