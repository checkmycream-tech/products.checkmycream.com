      <li>Nice unit.</li>

      <li>The adjustable guard is really nice.</li>
      <li>The smoothed edges on the trimming blades is a nice touch.  </li>
      <li>Nice tool for hair and beard.</li>
      <li>The pivot head is a unique and welcome design for ergonomic comfort.  </li>
      <li>but things are very good, my wife liked it, I will continue to focus on and buying, thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>The metal attachments are very comfortable, the motor is very powerful, and it works great.  </li>
      <li>They are very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t so adventurous to consider using clippers to do my own haircut, but Philips changed that.</li>
      <li>so you can achieve a very smooth neck without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of course, do not ask me, for this product is also satisfied.</li>
      <li>My husband is in love with this.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Maybe if there is another longer attachment would be more  versatile.</li>
      <li>Love the way it angles.</li>
      <li>i fund it is able for rust!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This gets the job done love that it rotates, we are by no means professionals, but feel confident using this and his haircut if you want to call it that comes out</li>
      <li>IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE CLIPPERS CUT A BIT LONGER.</li>
      <li>After using it about 20 times the (cheap!)</li>
      <li>and I think this is a better option for the beginner.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the results.urning</li>
      <li>third cutter and the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love these clippers.  </li>
      <li>Who knows maybe he will want more in home hair cuts.</li>
      <li>Personally I am glad that I have both.</li>
      <li>When I called Philips/Norelco to see about buying a replacement they said that the (cheap!)</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was especially delighted to find that this clipper is quiet!</li>
      <li>I initially thought it would be an awesome idea</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better and cheaper than going to Supercuts.  </li>
      <li>Overall the best cutter I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i love philips products, i have the philips body groomer and philips beard styler</li>
      <li>he had very short hair, this would have been perfect.</li>
      <li>but as for cordless hair clipping  ,the cordless panasonic did a better and faster work for clipping my hair .</li>
      <li>It works best for the sides and in the back of the head.</li>
      <li>My husband and I decided to try to cut or better yet mantain his hair</li>
      <li>So yes you will have to use scissors if you want anything longer than 5/5\\&quot; on top.</li>
      <li>Although I would consider a shaver something that would benefit from that more so than a hair trimmer unless you were planning on going away for some time.</li>
      <li>You just snap off the hair guard &amp; top razor and using the enclosed brush make sure all the hair &amp; dust is removed.</li>
      <li>(There is another hair clipper in this Do-It-Yourself line that might be more appropriate for me.)</li>
      <li>I LOVE the way it works.</li>
      <li>Personally I am glad that I have both.</li>
      <li>Remington is also washable which is a nice way to get it thoroughly clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its so bad to use this trimmer while the cable is moving in ur face i prefer one with battery</li>
    <li> The plastic tips are super super comfy and now giving myself a shaved head feels better at home than the barber&#x27;s place. HOWEVER, I took off a star because I think it&#x27;s absolutely idiotic of them to put the controls to shave the length of the shave AND the rotator of the clipper at practically the same location. If I&#x27;m not careful when I&#x27;m rotating the clipper for the other side of my head, I could end up with a short patch.</li>
    <li> Not as easy to use as I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> Works well for shaving my head. Love the way it angles.</li>
    <li> I use it to trim the sides and back of head. It&#x27;s a wonderful device, you can adjust the size of its comb easily. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Tell a must for repair flathead users. If the length of stay fat rich experience will be better.Batteries, hoping to improve the look, because the charging wire winding process, especially for pruning inconvenient. Of course, do not ask me, for this product is also satisfied.</li>
    <li> I used philips self clipper for 4 years. This is the second one I got. The first one I got has an option for longer locking length. However I dont&#x27;t why they don&#x27;t produce that anymore.  For this one the longest locking length is still  short.</li>
    <li> It cuts just as well as the bulky one I had before. The adjustable comb is an interesting idea but doesn&#x27;t work as well as the interchangeable ones on other clippers.</li>
    <li> Scored this clipper on prime day for a great price. Working great. No rechargeable battery to hassle with charging just for it to run out half way through a cut-works by power cord only!</li>
    <li> Good one, but im afraid the haircut is too short even with the longest settings. Maybe if there is another longer attachment would be more  versatile.</li>
    <li> This thing paid for itself in one haircut. I was a little worried that I would have trouble cutting my own hair but it turned out great. High and Tight!</li>
    <li> I started out using the Remington Short Cut and I think this is a better option for the beginner. The Remington is easy to use but broke in less than a year. I then bought this Philips and found it easy enough to use and with more options for length and trimming edges. It lasted a couple years before I broke one of the plastic guards, but the actual mechanism of the clipper still worked. The cost of replacing the guard was almost as high as getting a completely new clipper so I went with the latter option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other version of this clipper that has a battery lasts long enough on a full charge for a quick trim, but not enough for someone like me who likes to take his time with the details. I ended up always leaving the clipper plugged in anyway, so I would recommend this plug in version to the one with the battery. Compared with the Remington, the battery powered version lasted much longer and the Remington could not be used while it was plugged in (meaning if the battery died, you had to wait for the cord to charge the battery up before using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I thought longevity was good compared to the Remington, from what I&#x27;ve read, it seems like even the most basic of proper clippers will last longer. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase, but I think once you get the hang of cutting your own hair, you&#x27;ll want to  get some real clippers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good hair clipper. it can work at five length settings from 5mm to 15mm and the clipper can rotate 90 degrees for cutting hair by yourself very conveniently. I used it to cut my baby the hair as a trial when I received it, It works!&lt;br /&gt;but if it can be driven by battery will be more appreciated!</li>
    <li> Thought is a cordless work, I was wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others are very good</li>
    <li> Best hair clippers weh</li>
    <li> It is doing its job perfectly</li>
    <li> There is this holder that spose to hold the high of the trim&lt;br /&gt;So you can cut the hair to the high you like&lt;br /&gt;But it wont stay in place...</li>
    <li> Love it! A nice close shave without the guard. Perfect for shaving your head without the razor.</li>
    <li> Have not used，triying to cut my hair when i leave my country. Hope it will get me pretty style. and i think it may be more perfect if it have its own battery.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price plastic</li>
    <li> Great! Very nice product! I love it ,it works very well.I&#x27;m is very satisfied with the product, recommend to buy.</li>
    <li> It Works in both in 110-220V. Great for the price. Recommended for travel and outside the United States Of America.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago to keep my hair trimmed. I have thinning hair and like to keep my hair short, high and tight.  I first went to my barber and got my hair cut to my specifications and since then just used my handy little Norelco to trim it weekly and haven&#x27;t been back to the barber since.  Very easy to use and has since paid for itself several times over.  The best part is no more trips to the barber or waiting in line for a haircut from now on.</li>
    <li> I am using Hair Clipper for the first time and I am liking it. This is lightweight and easy to use. You can cut hair without taking help from anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is this doesn&#x27;t have battery and is not washable.</li>
    <li> Nice tool for hair and beard.</li>
    <li> i have had 2 combs break on me in the middle of a cut. Horrible quality plastic. The trimmer is decent. I have two of them with 2 broken combs. So they are useless as the combs are not available. Won&#x27;t buy again even though the trimmer is decent.</li>
    <li> When we moved away from my husband&#x27;s sister--the hairdresser, Ll of a sudden he expected *me* to cut his hair. Gamely I got some professional scissors &amp; got out my trusty Oster clipper kit my sister gave me when her son grew out his hair. So I could now buzz my son&#x27;s hair myself &amp; save $$. But that was 15 years ago &amp; those clippers are dull, pull out hair and deafen all with their clatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened upon a Flash sale on Amazon &amp; saw these clever clippers for a good price. I love that they don&#x27;t have multiple sizes of hair guards, my set has been missing the 1/2&amp;#34; guard since I&#x27;ve had the kit. Now all I have to do to change the length is twist the dial &amp;#34;et voil&amp;aacute;&amp;#34;, I can go shorter around the ears &amp; collar while keeping a little length on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating head makes it very easy for me to get into corners close to his ears, follow his hair growth pattern all without having to put my arthritic wrists at awkward (&amp; painful) angles. I cut his hair in record time &amp; cleanup was a snap--literally. You just snap off the hair guard &amp; top razor and using the enclosed brush make sure all the hair &amp; dust is removed. Wipe &amp; dry those pieces not attached to the corded razor (for that you clean with the small brush &amp; dry wipe. The best part? No oil, as far as I could tell reading the manual. The only thing that held me back from that final.star is the odd little &amp;#34;plough lines&amp;#34; the tines of the hair guide leave in the hair. My son likes his hair *very* short in the summer. He&#x27;s also blond &amp; when it&#x27;s that short it all shows. He looks like the outfield at Busch Stadium: faint, short stripes. Maybe it&#x27;s just the new. If it goes away (or I learn a technique around it) ill gladly add the 5th star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This claims to be a do-it-yourself trimmer. I&#x27;d like to see someone do that! But it won&#x27;t be my boys; they like the service I give. Maybe I should put out a Tip Jar.</li>
    <li> CUTS HAIR VERY CLOSE. IF YOU LIKE A SHORT HAIRCUT THIS IS A NICE CLIPPER. EASY TO USE. IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE CLIPPERS CUT A BIT LONGER.</li>
    <li> My only qualm with this product is that you can shorten the length by pressing down too hard instead of twisting the length selector. So if your like me and get a little aggressive with buzzing your head, its possible to change the length selection to a shorter length on accident. And then you have start all over to even it out and end up with hair shorter than you originally wanted. But other than that it cuts well and I would recommend this for anyone who needs a new buzzer.</li>
    <li> The only problem is that the cord plug is loose and disconnects again and again!</li>
    <li> Was hoping it came with more than one guide so that I could choose how long to cut my hair. But I like it short, so no biggie. Wife is getting used to the shorter cut. Works great and I like how the guide keeps the clippings away from the blade and doesn&#x27;t just dump them on the floor. That way, I have less cleanup, since I can turn the clipper upside down over the bathroom trash can and all the clippings end up in there instead of on the shower floor.</li>
    <li> Because in China, through a friend brought over, so the receipt slower but things are very good, my wife liked it, I will continue to focus on and buying, thanks to Amazon</li>
    <li> corded use only, bad design</li>
    <li> not too bad. i love philips products, i have the philips body groomer and philips beard styler and they r fantastic , but as for cordless hair clipping  ,the cordless panasonic did a better and faster work for clipping my hair .</li>
    <li> Good for shaving your head, not your balls.</li>
    <li> My husband and I decided to try to cut or better yet mantain his hair so he isnt spending $25.00 every 2 weeks or so to do it. This gets the job done love that it rotates, we are by no means professionals, but feel confident using this and his haircut if you want to call it that comes out pretty \\&quot;ok\\&quot;...more importantly it saves us money. Its a good price, good weight to it-give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 12 years now, and over all, I think this clipper is pretty good.  I have thinning hair that I cut about 3/8\\&quot; long, and this clipper cuts my hair nearly as well as my [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster Classic 76]] at a fraction of the cost, and cuts about the same as my older Wahl clipper set that cost less and came with more accessories.  The advantage over the Wahl set is that this unit doesn&#x27;t require you to store an assortment of attachments, and the plastic attachment is more comfortable (IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at the current price of $40 for this unit, it&#x27;s a good clipper and alternative to the Oster if you don&#x27;t want to spend over $100 on a clipper, but it might not be any better than the $25 clipper sets that you can buy.  One drawback to this being a new product is that there isn&#x27;t any data out there about longevity, where other units have been around long enough for you to know if they&#x27;ll hold up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Basis for Comparison&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;For about a decade, I used a clipper set that I bought at Target for about $25.  It came with the clippers, several length attachments, scissors, combs, brush, plastic tarp, instructional video, and other accessories.  You can still get similar packages from Wahl for near that price here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years ago, I switched to an Oster Classic 76 with metal attachments.  IMO, it&#x27;s the (or one of the) Rolls-Royce&#x27;s of hair clippers.  It costs about $130 for the clipper and two short attachments plus another ~$20-$30 for each additional metal attachment that you want.  The metal attachments are very comfortable, the motor is very powerful, and it works great.  It is a bit heavier than other clippers and can get warm after a while of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;The design is much cooler than I had expected it to be.  Being able to pivot the cutting head doesn&#x27;t really do much for me, but being able to adjust the cutting length by turning a dial is pretty cool!  There is a single attachment that moves up and down to adjust the length, and that attachment can be removed to expose the trimming blades for close cutting.  The smoothed edges on the trimming blades is a nice touch.  Also, the plastic tines on the attachment are much more comfortable to me than the plastic attachments that came with my older clippers or the ones that I bought for the Oster (before I got all the metal attachments that I wanted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the unit did make it awkward to use the trimmer on the back of my neck.  I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll get used to it, but the angle is different than the other two clippers that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleasantly surprised at how quickly and effectively this cut my hair.  I thought that this might be another gimmicky attempt to stand out from other clippers, but it really does work well.  The plastic attachment felt comfortable and didn&#x27;t ever cut into my scalp, and the motor didn&#x27;t bind up on me at any point.  It also never felt warm, even after about 20 minutes.  I was pleased with the results.urning a dial is pretty cool!

    <li> My husband is in love with this. He can use it to shave his head with one hand. The shaver swivels to allow for the perfect angle for shaving.  You turn the dial to adjust the length. You can use it to shave or trim.  This shaver allows him to shave his head with just this trimmer, in a quarter of the time of the old trimmer. It really cuts down close. If he really wants to be baby -but smooth, he finishes with a razor.  Ever since he got this, though, he really only uses the trimmer. Recommend! !</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace some aging clippers that I&#x27;ve had for a few years. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the low price I paid but I am more than happy with them. The guard is very comfortable on my scalp and the rotating head makes cutting the back of my head very easy. i highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Either I have the worst luck, or Philips Norelco is taking short cuts in their quality control department. I usually do not like to write product reviews, but liked the features of this hair clipper. I should&#x27;ve picked another brand, never had so many problems with a simple hair clipper. The first one I ordered refused to turn on or charge, the second one I ordered would only turn on when plugged in! Returned them to Amazon and may never buy a Philips Norelco shaver again.</li>
    <li> Works as intended. The angle adjuster is pretty nice if you having to do all the cutting / grooming yourself. The adjustable guard is really nice. Great to not have to hunt after lost individual guard parts that get lost over the years.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers.  best clippers, in fact i bought two to have a spare.  Rotating head makes it easy to get into places, and love the adjustable heads.</li>
    <li> I use it for less than 4 months&lt;br /&gt;And i fund it is able for rust!&lt;br /&gt;only god knows what kind of disease will you get for you.</li>
    <li> It do not have a battery inside.So I have to charge it into a pluge so that it can work ,But ,as you know,it is really uncomfortable for me to do so</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair every several weeks. Now I can do everything but the neckline by just standing in front of a mirror. So I can maintain the same look by trimming every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubted the description of the length settings so I measured my hair before and after. On the maximum setting your hair will be ½\\&quot; long. You can decrease down to skin line by turning the dial. The 90 degree rotation to either side allows you to use either hand. The long comb base keeps you from accidentally putting divots in you hair. This is a virtually foolproof system. The unit fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
    <li> This definitely seems a good idea for those of us who like to occasionally trim our own hair. I may have lost some of the initial enthusiasm when I saw this product, as now I understand some of its limitations. If you decide to use it, be prepared to cut the hair short. It works best for the sides and in the back of the head. Of all the haircuts I&#x27;ve given with this machine, my most successful one was for my 9-year old. I found wetting the hair before trimming is likely to be advantageous, since you want the hair to stand as straight as possible. The transparent plastic distance adjuster seems cheap, yet works ok. Do not give up the scissors, as you might need them in areas where you leave the hair longer than the maximum for this machine. A nice big hand-held mirror is very useful when trimming your own hair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t so adventurous to consider using clippers to do my own haircut, but Philips changed that. It comes down to time and money for me. Why book a meeting, drive cross town, wait in line, get a haircut that costs $50 and still doesn&#x27;t come remotely to what you wanted, drive cross town again to get home and repeat the same exercise in 4 weeks? That&#x27;s 12 times a year (and some times more often) x $50 each time for a total of $600. We cut our own nails, why not our hair? I also have a Norelco shaver so this product is of the same quality. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I no longer have to help my husband shave his head, he can reach behind his ears and his neck without any trouble. It does a great job and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any stray hairs.</li>
    <li> I have four boys and a husband to give haircuts to, and so far this seems to be a decent hair cutter. Hopefully it lasts.</li>
    <li> My previous hair trimmer was a Conair Model HC225T.  This model is smaller, lighter-weight and the pivot head makes it much easier to handle.  The power cord is also smaller and lighter (and somewhat less industrial strength) but it doesn&#x27;t present a problem.  Being able to change length settings without having to search for another attachment is very, very nice.  I like that there are interim settings in addition to the typical #1, #2, #3,... standards (for instance, between #1 and #2 and also between #3 and #4).  This allows me to keep a more consistent hair length on a more regular basis.  One shortcoming is that the settings numbers are very small and may be difficult for some people to see.  Really, though, the only thing that would make this trimmer more impressive would be if it was cordless with an internal rechargeable battery. But taken as a whole it&#x27;s a great product that works well, is easy to use and is reasonably priced.  I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this model.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair.  I have for years.  It&#x27;s better and cheaper than going to Supercuts.  My hair is curly, and I have no hairline, so using an electric trimmer is easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sold on this model.  For one, it cuts too short, even on it&#x27;s longest setting.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the plastic part that is used to seperate your hair from the cutting blades is flimsy, so if you put too much pressure on the thing while cutting your hair, it will cut shorter than you had intended.&lt;br /&gt;Third, the rotating head is confusing.  I initially thought it would be an awesome idea but when you quickly switch back and forth between sides of your head, you forget which way is which.  I just ended up leaving it facing straight up, so no matter what hand it was in I always knew where it was pointing.&lt;br /&gt;It is really lightweight, which is nice.  And it&#x27;s easy to clean - the whole head comes apart.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m not a fan.  It just cuts too short for my taste.</li>
    <li> I have the model QC 5330, which according to the support person at Philips is almost identical to this cutter. I owned it for about two years before it broke.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Much easier to use than my Wahl hair cutter. This is cordless, which is a big step forward, plus this is much lighter and more maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change the length for your hair. It just takes a slight turn. No need to search for the right length adjuster (like I had to do with my Wahl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Not very durable. The first one I bought from Amazon did not work when it arrived. Philips was fabulous and replaced it immediately. Great customer service at that time.&lt;br /&gt;Not very durable! Yes, that needs to be said twice. After using it about 20 times the (cheap!) plastic blade guide broke. It broke while I was gently using it on my head. I&#x27;m not some teenager and was not abusing it. When I called Philips/Norelco to see about buying a replacement they said that the (cheap!) plastic attachment would cost $19. The new hair cutter is selling for almost that price on Amazon! Come on Philips. You know this is a problem, but rather than selling the replacement at a reasonable price ($10 or so) you decide to sell it for almost the same price as a new hair cutter? Very disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this hair cutter is a great idea. I LOVE the way it works. But I am not happy with its durability. My Wahl has been working for years and year and I have never had a problem with it. So now I am not sure what to do.</li>
    <li> I use this every time for my kids haircut. it is very handy and works as described.</li>
    <li> I was hoping my husband could use the Philips Norelco Do-It-Yourself Hair Clipper to trim back and sides of his hair between haircuts. He attempted to use it but decided against it because his hair is \\&quot;too long\\&quot;. Mind you, he has regular \\&quot;office hair\\&quot;, but this  trimmer cuts quite short only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should have read the settings more carefully before I purchased it: 8 locking length settings from 15/32 inch to 19/32 inch. If I&#x27;d taken out my ruler, I would have known it would be too short. We regularly use a Wahl clipper which has many settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he had very short hair, this would have been perfect.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers with guides for trimming boys&#x27; hair. I have another set of clippers and prefer these because they&#x27;re lightweight and easier to maneuver.  The head of these clippers swivel, so I found the bent position a bit awkward to use since I&#x27;m used to the non-swivel models. Of course, anyone can use them in the normal position so it&#x27;s not much of an issue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s hair for years with just barber scissors. I had no experience using electric clippers, but I was interested to try this one. I was surprised at how easy it was to use and made the haircut so much faster than with scissors. I was careful to lift up the hair with the teeth before going over them with the blade because I didn&#x27;t want it to be TOO short, and it worked great. I&#x27;m not sure my husband would want to try the do-it-yourself approach, but it could probably be done by those who like their hair really short.</li>
    <li> I should have gotten the cordless. Just did not check out the fine details.</li>
    <li> my friend told me this one is very good, and I purchased it. but it just not what I expected......</li>
    <li> i can trim my hair by myself now, easy to use</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a woman, so this product is probably not the best for me. I like the the sides and back of my head to have that little-boy butch-cut look, but I want more on the top than the longest setting of this clipper is capable of. (There is another hair clipper in this Do-It-Yourself line that might be more appropriate for me.) Still, on my first try, I managed to get a decent cut by doing the sides and back per the instructions, using the longest setting, and then kind of floating the clipper through the top of my hair held aloft with a comb. As long as I was careful to hold the clipper guard flat against my head, the cut is uniform and professional. The pivoting head makes it very easy to do this, even in the back. I didn&#x27;t even have to get DH to trim my neckline! I could even see a man using this clipper to neaten a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup was easy. You are cautioned to use the clipper only on clean, DRY hair. This means you&#x27;ll have no dirt or oils to clog up the blades, and then it&#x27;s just a matter of brushing them off with the included brush or rinsing them off. The instructions are in very tiny type, which is hard for old eyes to read, so just know you&#x27;re not supposed to store this around moisture, like in a bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is just the most fantastic idea. It works.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for about 20 years, and have been using the same Remington clippers for about ten years. What a welcome surprise these clippers are! Easy to hold, sharp blades (although I am comparing them to 10 year old clippers) and the swivel head is a great addition.&lt;br /&gt;I was through in about 10 minutes and was very pleased with the close shave I got on my head. I did not use the attachment and it seems this might be the weak spot as it could easily move out of adjustment. The clippers are so light, so I wonder about their longevity, but after two cuts, I haven&#x27;t noticed any decrease in quality.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would absolutely recommend these clippers to anyone who shaves their head on a regular basis</li>
    <li> This Phillips Norelco QC5560 is a lightweight easy to use hair trimmer. It is a corded only shaver so it is not designed to be a shaver that is to be accessible to children. With a 110 volt line running to the shaver you wouldn&#x27;t want to inadvertently drop this into a sink filled with water. People have been using corded shavers in bathrooms for a long time but it is something to consider. The stated cutting lengths of hair are different all over the place. Between the listing lengths stated and the ones on the box, all I know is that this hair clipper is designed for extremely short hair. I like it for doing trimming along sideburns, mustache, neck line etc, its super light weight, and swivel head make it an ideal tool for that. It also is incredibly quiet much quieter than the Remington although I wouldn&#x27;t consider that one to be loud by any means. The lengths of hair adjust between 8 locking positions. ON THE BOX they state that you can use it from 1/32\\&quot; to 5/8\\&quot; which is way shorter than I cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok onto the Remington Model HC-5550. The Remington currently is about ten dollars cheaper, it is a larger unit, and a little heavier but that is due in part to the fact that it has a rechargeable battery. That alone is a powerful benefit. So you have the option of working the trimmer plugged in, or charge it in another room, and use it entirely as a cordless. This also enables you to take it with you on trips that may not have easily accessible power outlets. Although I would consider a shaver something that would benefit from that more so than a hair trimmer unless you were planning on going away for some time. The Remington has several snap on plastic heads with it that enable you to cut your hair longer than the Phillips. Without getting out the micrometer you can easily see just by looking at it that it cuts lengths almost twice as long as the Phillips. The Remington does not state actual lengths, but rather advertises 15 different length settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington is also washable which is a nice way to get it thoroughly clean. Once again the Phillips as a plug in only model doesn&#x27;t advertise using water to clean it. The Phillips has a detachable head but with chambered sections I wouldn&#x27;t want to trap water in there. The Remington has two buttons one on each side of the head which enables the cutting mechanism to extend out and with the word wash on the release button I am assuming running that section under water is what they mean. The blade width is exactly the same on both of them. I would like to say it is great to have both because the Phillips is lighter, and smaller with a body that is only 2/3rds the size of the Remington but since the Remington does everything the Phillips does I would have to wonder if that is good advice. Personally I am glad that I have both. I would like to keep the Phillips at the ready for frequent beard, moustache, or sideburn trimming, and only break out the Remington for general haircut use which is what I will be doing. So if you are an adult, and know better than to dip your hands into a washbowl that a corded appliance, like a hair dryer etc has just fallen in, the Phillips is a great unit. I just trimmed my hair as in a haircut and I had the Remington plugged in even though it has a built in rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they are both great hair trimmers, and do haircuts, but if you have very short hair and want a lightweight unit, and don&#x27;t mind the corded only option, then get the Phillips. If you have slightly longer hair and want the rechargeable battery option, and the slightly lower price then get the Remington.

    <li> Cuts well.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I pretty much gave myself a full haircut by looking in the mirror. I just needed the back of my neck cleaned up a little. I needed it to be faded because I can&#x27;t pull off the almost shaved head look, but it came out really well. Definitely better than a lot of haircuts I&#x27;ve paid for in the past.</li>
    <li> I used it maybe a dozen times, like once a month over a year or so and then it started switching off with loud noises.  Bought Wahl brand which was on sale for $15 instead of $40.</li>
    <li> Nice unit. Def makes it easier to cut your hair. Strong settings that don&#x27;t mess up with to much pressure.</li>
    <li> it is good ,but the electronic line is not very convenient , maybe i will buy one with  no charging line</li>
    <li> worked well....cord does not stay plugged in as well as i would like.</li>
    <li> My daughter has one of the weird hair cuts - - she keeps the right side of her head partially shaved. She was thrilled when I got her these clipper so that she could keep it touched up without bugging me to take her to the salon every other week.  The handle is ergonimic, and makes buzzing the side of her head easy.  However, I can&#x27;t imagine that even the ergonomic handle with be helpful in cutting the back of your head...you can&#x27;t see back there.  I wouldn&#x27;t try it, even with these.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and can save you a lot of money by not going to the barber for trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to maintain the sideburns, or the fuzz look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;180 degree flexibility make it convenient for going behind the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multi level adjustment for depth of cut, but choose the shortest trim until you get used to it.</li>
    <li> My sons are determined to keep their hair cut very close to the scalp because of the heat here in Texas. They normally use clippers like the kind you see in barber shops. They work fine, but they are loud and hard to manipulate when cutting the back of your head. This Philips Norelco Headgroom is a huge improvement for anyone wanting to cut hair clipper-style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most unique feature is that the clipper head rotates 180 degrees which allows you to hold it in a comfortable position while cutting the sides and back of your head. This works brilliantly and makes it very easy to get an even cut without missing strips when you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way you adjust the hair length is unique, too. It has a single, plastic clipper guard that fits down around the pivoting clipper head. (No more rummaging through clipper guards, trying to find the length you want.) To adjust the hair length, you simply pull up on the guard however many \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; you want to get the desired length. There are 8 length settings ranging from 1/32\\&quot; to 5/8\\&quot;. The guard also comes completely off for cleaning up and squaring off the back of the neck, trimming around the ears and trimming the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp and cut cleanly. Norelco also rounded off the individual teeth of the blades so that even when cleaning up the back of the neck, there is no scratching or irritation of the skin. This is great so you can achieve a very smooth neck without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean the cutting blades, you simply take off the plastic guard and squeeze the sides of the head to pop it off. You can rinse the head under running water, but not the unit itself. It comes with a little brush for cleaning the rest of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is corded only - it is not rechargeable. Fortunately, the power cord is a generous 95\\&quot; long so it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was especially delighted to find that this clipper is quiet! I remember when my boys were toddlers, the sound of the clippers was scary to them when getting haircuts. Moms who clip their young child&#x27;s hair will appreciate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that there is not a tapered guard included. Without a taper guard, it&#x27;s difficult to make a smooth, rounded curve. You CAN trim around your ears without the guard on, but it&#x27;s tricky and probably best done by another person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test it, I had 3 of my sons and my husband try it and they all gave it a big thumbs up.

    <li> As someone who has cut my own hair for almost all my adult life, I can say that finding a pair of trimmers that fit your style, comfort and wallet can be a tricky proposition.  The Phillips Norelco QC5560 really do make the job easier.  The pivot head is a unique and welcome design for ergonomic comfort.  It allows for better grip and handling especially if you are a self-groomer.  In other words, it really makes it easier to reach the back of your head without having to manipulate the entire device in your hands.  I found the trimmer power to be on par with other brands I have used in the past.  It is worth mentioning, that I like to keep my hair trimmed very short, so I have no real review for how the trimmers behave in thicker hair.  I can only assume that, especially with the attachable combs, that they move through thicker hair just as well.  After all, it is blade sharpness and routine oiling that keeps your blades cutting smoother longer.  Overall a great set of trimmers and you cannot go wrong for the price!</li>
    <li> This product is great! It was exactly as described. Compact I used it for an in between hair appointment visit for my husband. 2 weeks later it still looks great. Who knows maybe he will want more in home hair cuts.</li>
    <li> Deceptive advertising.  Nowhere in the images or text related to the product does it show or state that this is a corded product that can&#x27;t be recharged to use without the cord.  The cord is detachable, which also adds to the deception that it can be charged and used without the cord.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that this ad wasn&#x27;t intentionally designed to deceive the consumer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hissss and thumbs down to whoever designed and approved of this advertisement, irrespective of whether it was intention or incompetence that drove the bus.  Shame on them!</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco QC5560&lt;br /&gt;My third cutter and the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;I have had two other products (Wahl I believe) in the past which included various length snap on combs. They also had a giant screw on a side which you had to adjust for cutting vs just making noise. This adjustment was always tricky. And did I mention the noise? It was loud and heavy. This Norelco is featherweight by comparison. There is only one (snaps of when needed for shaving) com, which unlike the specs above, has much more adjustability. It moves with a nice rotary dial from 1/32\\&quot; to 5/8\\&quot; cut. In barber terms this is from less than #1 cut to all the way to #5 cut. Most short cuts start with #1 or #2 on a side and taper off to about 1.5\\&quot; on top. So yes you will have to use scissors if you want anything longer than 5/5\\&quot; on top. You can use the fingers to hold the hair and use the cutter in the shave mode (no comb) as well. The 8 ft cord is somewhat stiff like as if it was solid core, but its still flexible. The head rotates in five steps over 180 degrees, and this makes it very easy for a person to do their own cuts on back, left and right (It is a bear with a straight on only razor). My only concern is that the adjustable comb flexes a bit when fully extended and may break off if snagged on something. Overall the best cutter I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/6/13 Edit. The cord for the plug in power supply is terrible. It is very stiff and you cannot coil it to put it back in its box or a drawer. It is so springy that it uncoils all over the place before you can stuff it anywhere. I never had a springy cord before, but its only a minor annoyance. This thing is amazing quiet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for the last 15 years and have been using an old Wahl clipper set the entire time.  I found the PHILIPS NORELCO QC5560 and its design quite intriguing and decided to give it a try.  Unfortunately, the clippers did not meet some basic expectations and I believe improvements could/should be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sport a \\&quot;military style\\&quot; haircut and prefer to keep my hair at a specific length ... so I cut it weekly.  Having thick hair ensures that my hair grows up and out if I let it go for more than a week and it looks rather \\&quot;uneven\\&quot;.  The Wahl clippers have handled the task quite well and have proven to be both durable and reliable.  With that being said, I am open to new ideas and kind of liked the multiple angles the QC5560 offered and the unit&#x27;s tapered, grip design.  But the minute I first handled the QC5560, I was disappointed and that disappointment stayed with me after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive aspects of the QC5560:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The size is nice and its tapered design allows the clipper to fit securely in either hand ... this addresses the biggest detriment of most traditional clippers:  the awkward, heavy, block design that makes self-use a little more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The rotating clipper head really does make a difference ... the product is geared at making the do-it-yourself haircut more comfortably.  I really like this concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The adjustable comb built into the clippers is another nice idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative aspects of the QC5560:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- While the clipper size is fine, it is offset by the flimsy weight of the QC5560 ... it simply feels cheap and delicate.  I cannot see these clippers lasting half as long as the Wahl (which has been dropped and banged-up quite a few times over the years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The power cord:  while most power cords are annoyingly bulky and obtrusive, Philips Norelco&#x27;s desire to micro-size the hair-clipper includes offering a thin, detachable plastic power cord.  Unfortunately, the plastic quality of the cord makes it retain its bent packaging form and act like a Slinky the entire time the clippers are used.  Making matters works, the accordion-like pull of the power-cord was strong enough to occasionally detach itself from the clipper unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The adjustable comb (and the rotating clipper-head for that matter) could really use a locking mechanism to ensure the comb length isn&#x27;t accidently adjusted.  I found that simply rotating the clipper-head without thought could result in an inadvertent clipper length adjustment ... not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The comb length is not short enough for some hair-styles.  The lowest comb setting is about the same length of a week&#x27;s growth of hair for me, meaning I would have to cut my hair daily just to keep it at the length that triggers me to cut my hair in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The blades are not heavy duty and the motor is weak.  I tried to remove the comb and use the exposed blade to eliminate sideburns and it wasn&#x27;t up to the task ... the motor was too weak for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the QC5560 is more suited to lighter duty (touch-ups and thinner hair) as it didn&#x27;t have the bulk and power to even remotely challenge my old Wahl.  I believe this product has potential, but the issues I listed above proved to be a deal-breaker for me.  Smaller and lighter is not necessarily better.Unfortunately, the plastic quality of the cord makes it retain its bent packaging form and act like a Slinky the entire time the clippers are used.

    <li> The rotating clipper head is a great concept.  At first, it was a bit awkward to use, but after some trial and error, it is one of our favorite clippers.  It does cut very short, however.  Apparently it is supposed to come with an adapter to allow a longer cut, but it was missing from our box.  We contacted the manufacturer who said it was on backorder.  We will update the review once it arrives.  Overall, a good clipper!</li>
    <li> These hair clippers work very well.  They are very easy to use.  Gives a  clean cut every time. I would recommend.</li>
