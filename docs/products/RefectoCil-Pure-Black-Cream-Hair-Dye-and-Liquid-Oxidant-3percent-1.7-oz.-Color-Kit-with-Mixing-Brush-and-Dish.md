      <li>It comes out very quickly.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is quite easy to do yourself, so don&#x27;t be intimidated.  </li>
      <li>and it wiped away easily because of the vaseline.</li>
      <li>It  was easy to use....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s relatively easy to apply myself because I do one eye at a time.</li>
      <li>Three weeks in and the color is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>and everything was fine.</li>
      <li>But they are still the light brown color...</li>
      <li>The brush included with the set is good for mixing the dye with the oxidant, but it&#x27;s muh too big for application.  </li>
      <li>Good but only lasts two weeks.</li>
      <li>what my salon used to use, when i was working full time.  </li>
      <li>First time user, and it was easy to use.</li>
      <li>So overall, I was very pleased with this item.</li>
      <li>This kit lasted me over a year before I needed to buy more dye, which I&#x27;m expecting to last even longer now that I&#x27;ve got a better grasp on how much to use.  </li>
      <li>not afraid of it dripping into my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Used it right away</li>
      <li>gave just the right amount of color without being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
      <li>Could never get the application to go right.</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time today.</li>
      <li>first time I tried it  - it stung my eyes just a bit -</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff to dye my blonde eye lashes.  </li>
      <li>The first time I did it, I was conservative.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t use the cup, I mixed it on a magnifying mirror, it gives me more control in adjusting how much product is on the applicator.  </li>
      <li>I tried it again a few days later with great success.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I think I had too much oxidant, which made it too runny.  </li>
      <li>Just like getting it done at the spa, but MUCH cheaper.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, when I got the item the box clearly states</li>
      <li>If you are steady handed and careful you will love the results</li>
      <li>I then brushed the mixture onto a clean mascara brush with the mixing brush.  </li>
      <li>It absolutely tinted my new longer lashes.</li>
      <li>, I got a little over confident while applying, and poked myself in the eye and smudge the dye on one eye.</li>
      <li>That was a little tricky, but I think I&#x27;ll get better with time.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Being that I am a licensed Esthetician in New York, I could not risk my license with the use of this on my clients.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I ordered this product, usually I&#x27;ve been tinting my eyelashes in hair salon, but the results were never what I wanted - to light, no visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>both the box and the tube itself clearly states NOT for eyelashes or eyebrows, and may cause blindness !  </li>
      <li>The last lady that dyed my lashes, used this exact product.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I would recommend using an old mascara wand to apply instead of the brush that comes with the kit...and don&#x27;t forget the vaseline.</li>
      <li>I have had my lashes dyed professionally for 20 years.  </li>
      <li>I used an old cleaned off mascara wand to apply and waited about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>refectocil came in a complete set with oxidant, brush, and mixing dish.</li>
      <li>I used the wand from a dead tube of mascara (wash the mascara off first!)  </li>
      <li>when used as directed, i need to leave on for extra time, but doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my sensitive eyes (even while wearing my contact lens)</li>
      <li>With a little investment up front, I am going to save at least $300 to $500 a year doing it all on my own.  </li>
      <li>I like it, first day it leaves eyebrows very dark which I want</li>
      <li>I used the thin end of the white stick to apply it to the top side of my upper lashes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product and even better supplier!</li>
    <li> nice combination of product in one kit.  great product, been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I have saved a lot of money doing this at home vs. at the Benefit store. This is the same product they use. It&#x27;s relatively easy to apply myself because I do one eye at a time. I use this on my lashes and on my brows. I would recommend using an old mascara wand to apply instead of the brush that comes with the kit...and don&#x27;t forget the vaseline.</li>
    <li> good color. good quality. love this company. ordered black . and it work good on my lashes and eyebrows</li>
    <li> I bought this to tint my eyelashes because it&#x27;s what came up on my amazon search for eyelash tint and other reviewers said they used it for that. But when I opened the package and directions said &amp;#34;Do not use on eyes, may cause blindness&amp;#34;. The product description on Amazon didn&#x27;t say anything like that. What a waste of my money! Now I&#x27;m going to have to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Not what it was posted as, the item was sold as an eyelash tint, but both the box and the tube itself clearly states NOT for eyelashes or eyebrows, and may cause blindness !  Yep, I was not happy !</li>
    <li> the color it truly black</li>
    <li> I have used refectocil for years and love it</li>
    <li> great product. I used an old cleaned off mascara wand to apply and waited about 20 minutes. saves a lot of money rather than going to a salon. just take your time and be careful. I think if you can apply mascara then you can do this. used to have the salon technician get the product into my eyes sometimes but when I do it I never had that problem.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, just follow the directions! Lasts at least a month. Perfect for my very blond eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I like it, first day it leaves eyebrows very dark which I want but throughout the days fades away. It will not last if you&#x27;re like me, I wash my face before I go to bed and every morning I kinda have to go around my eyebrows which is frustrating.</li>
    <li> I have very blonde lashes, this darkened them up a little. Nothing dramatic. However, as a pharmacist, I have to warn that even a 3% peroxide solution can cause caustic burns to the eyes. I, being careful, couldn&#x27;t keep it 100% out of my eye. It seems a bit too dangerous for such a limited result. I&#x27;m sticking to boring mascara. Boo.</li>
    <li> Good quality.Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> what my salon used to use, when i was working full time.  good product when used as directed, i need to leave on for extra time, but doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my sensitive eyes (even while wearing my contact lens)</li>
    <li> First time user, and it was easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t fade. Last a long time. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good but only lasts two weeks.</li>
    <li> Used it right away and it worked way better than another brand I had tried.  Three weeks in and the color is still going strong.  Plenty of product to use it multiple times.  I recommend it.  One caution, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  It will sting.  It&#x27;s completely doable though if you just apply carefully.  I didn&#x27;t use the cup, I mixed it on a magnifying mirror, it gives me more control in adjusting how much product is on the applicator.  I recommend watching a few how-to videos on YouTube.  That gave me a few helpful hints on how to apply it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to tint my eyelashes.  It had great reviews.  BUT...when I read the side of the box it say not to use this product on eyelashes because if you get it in your eyes you will go BLIND.  I prefer not to go blind and haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time today. Works great!  Just like getting it done at the spa, but MUCH cheaper. The written instructions included are terrible. A few tips:  Do not squeeze the drops from the bottle.  It comes out very quickly.  Just slightly tip the bottle and let it drip out.  I used the shallow end of the glass cup and the brush to mix it. I then brushed the mixture onto a clean mascara brush with the mixing brush.  It was very easy to put on that way.  I used the thin end of the white stick to apply it to the top side of my upper lashes.  That was a little tricky, but I think I&#x27;ll get better with time.  Before I started, I applied a thin coat of Vaseline on my upper and lower lids using a Q tip to get as close to my lashes as possible without actually getting on them.  During the 10 minutes, I periodically checked to see if any of the solution got on my lids due to blinking.  When it did, I just carefully wiped it off with a dry Q tip.  This is very easy to use with good results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  I have had my lashes dyed professionally for 20 years.  It&#x27;s getting harder and harder (and more expensive) to find a cosmetologist / facialist that does this service.  I&#x27;ve always wondered if I could do it myself - but it seemed too hard to do so, given the seemingly big ritual the facialist goes through when she / he applies the color to my closed eyes.  The most un-nerving part was when the product was removed.  The last lady that dyed my lashes, used this exact product.  I watched her squirt a blob of dye into the glass cup, count 10 drops of the oxidant in the same cup and mixed it around.  She applied it on my lashes just like mascara and told me to remove it  in 4-6 hours, with a warm wash cloth.  Gheez - that was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it  - it stung my eyes just a bit - so I removed it after a couple minutes.  I think I had too much oxidant, which made it too runny.  I tried it again a few days later with great success. Easy, easy, easy.  It is a great solution, which I will use going forward.</li>
    <li> The results werent as dramatic as I had expected but it definitely worked as it was supposed to. I wanted them to be jet black and they were definitely darker but not as black as they could have been</li>
    <li> It  was easy to use....gave just the right amount of color without being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;Was not afraid of it dripping into my eyes.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Be careful to not get in eyes.  If you are steady handed and careful you will love the results</li>
    <li> Could never get the application to go right. Stung like crazy. Harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I ordered this product, usually I&#x27;ve been tinting my eyelashes in hair salon, but the results were never what I wanted - to light, no visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;This dye works! Finally I have dark eyelashes and do not have to use mascara. Will see yet how long it will last.</li>
    <li> great quality, timely delivery! definitely advise to use the product! refectocil came in a complete set with oxidant, brush, and mixing dish. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to mix up, and the mixing bowl they send is NOT the one shown (the one shown is heavy glass, yet small, very nice; the one they sent is a little plastic cup).  But it dyes nicely, and I didn&#x27;t have to buy everything separately.  It also comes with a little mixing stick they don&#x27;t show.</li>
    <li> Wow!  No really WOW!  This stuff is really good.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I was getting my lashes dyed at a salon for $20 a visit, plus tip.  This kit lasted me over a year before I needed to buy more dye, which I&#x27;m expecting to last even longer now that I&#x27;ve got a better grasp on how much to use.  The oxidant shows no sign of running out anytime soon!</li>
    <li> I hate this color kit. There are no instructions on the proportions that I should be using to mix it. It also washes away by the next day your brows are back to looking the same.</li>
    <li> I used to pay a salon to wax my face, dye my eye lashes and brows.  With a little investment up front, I am going to save at least $300 to $500 a year doing it all on my own.  Practice makes perfect so be patient.  Don&#x27;t forget you need the liquid oxidant to activate the dye.  I only wish I started doing this two years ago!</li>
    <li> MADE IN AUSTRIA - has to be good :)</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff to dye my blonde eye lashes.  Just be careful around the eye itself</li>
    <li> Really good stuff for eyebrows</li>
    <li> I noticed lately that my eyelashes have gotten sparse. So instead of paying a crapload of money for eyelash serums, I saw that Vaseline does the same thing. So every evening before bed, I applied the Vaseline to my eyelashes and VOILA....longer lashes. But they are still the light brown color...hmmm what to do? TINT! I would love to stop using mascara. So I found Refectocil. I watched a few videos to get the nerve to try this. What I learned in these videos is to put vaseline on your upper lid and under your lower lashes. I tried putting a pad or tissue under the eye to catch any misplaced dye, but it was awkward. So I kept Q-tips handy and it wiped away easily because of the vaseline. I mixed the dye and applied it with a disposable mascara brush. (I bought a pack of 25). The first time I did it, I was conservative. It absolutely tinted my new longer lashes. But it wasn&#x27;t enough. So I did it again the next day. Much better once I got the hang of it. I have to admit, I got a little over confident while applying, and poked myself in the eye and smudge the dye on one eye. It burned a little and I had horrible visions of going blind for a quick second, but I just removed the excess dye with a Q-tip and everything was fine. So, NO RUSHING! I will probably do this every 2-3 weeks if my eyelashes continue to grow with the vaseline routine. So overall, I was very pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> Great eyebrow color-easy to apply- color lasts and covers stray grey hairs perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have very thin and light color eyebrows naturally and have always struggle with this. I used this product and saw a drastic change. I have visible eyebrows now and it made them look fuller</li>
    <li> I used to get my eyelashes dyed every few weeks at a salon.  It was only about $20/session, but that definitely adds up after a while.  I also had a really hard time with the stinging of the dye in my eyes when I had it done at the salon.  Now I know that was lazy/careless aestheticians - doing it myself, I had only a slight sting while washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite easy to do yourself, so don&#x27;t be intimidated.  If you can put on mascara, you can dye your lashes.  The brush included with the set is good for mixing the dye with the oxidant, but it&#x27;s muh too big for application.  I used the wand from a dead tube of mascara (wash the mascara off first!)  I did use a q-tip to apply vaseline to my eyelids right at the base of my lashes, which made it easier to wipe off any dye that got on my skin.  But you could probably do it without that.  Just apply the dye with the wand and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, this one tube will probably last for years.  You only need a TEENY amount of dye (less than pea-sized) and a couple of drops of oxidant.</li>
    <li> It should be only used if you know how. I use this product now for 25 years and just love it. My eye lashes and brows stay dark for 3-4 weeks, but you have to be very, very careful to avoid eye contact.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this kit to add the service of \\&quot;eyelash and brow tint\\&quot; to my space, I even watched a demo/tutorial from this company on youtube.com.  I did find it odd that the ingredients were chemically based, knowing it was going near the eye (tear duct) etc. but took a risk and ordered it. Sure enough, when I got the item the box clearly states \\&quot;THIS PRODUCT MUST NOT BE USED FOR DYEING THE EYELASHES OR EYEBROWS; TO DO SO MAY CAUSE BLINDNESS.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that I am a licensed Esthetician in New York, I could not risk my license with the use of this on my clients.  I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please use caution if you choose to use this product for your eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
