      <li>This stuff is surprisingly amazing.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews for this one (nice smell, non sticky, etc)</li>
      <li>Very good hair creme, smells pretty nice, and its as its name says, understated.</li>
      <li>and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.  </li>
      <li>But, after using gel, mouse, hairspray, spray gel and god knows what else, this is far and away the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s wizard magic.</li>
      <li>and I like to be able to run my hand through my hair and many products don&#x27;t allow this.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried most gels.</li>
      <li>my boys favorite hair care product.</li>
      <li>Excellent product would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
      <li>It is better than a sticky gel.  </li>
      <li>but it is way more sticky than the axe</li>
      <li>The ladies love it.</li>
      <li>This product is so much better than any gel I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is pretty good too, though not a reason to buy one over another.</li>
      <li>It really smells like tea!!...which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>Not as strong and greasy as others.</li>
      <li>I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The smell was pleasant and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was dipping my fingers into old, sticky Crisco.</li>
      <li>this is only ok, it smells good and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>This is way stickier than the clean cut pomade.  </li>
      <li>Very natural and smells nice.  </li>
      <li>Great product...better than I expected it to be...</li>
      <li>I like the smell of it also - light and fresh.</li>
      <li>The creamy consistency doesn&#x27;t really hold if you have strong hair; if you have very soft hair it should work nicely.</li>
      <li>Product works great - keeps my hair from flailing all over the place and doesn&#x27;t give that greasy feel that some other products give.</li>
      <li>The texture is more like a soft face cream.</li>
      <li>Gives you a nice hold without the wet seal look.  </li>
      <li>In fairness I must say this is the first hair cream product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
      <li>The Natural Axe styling cream is perfect for my type of hair and I highly recommend it for anyone who has curly hair and wants to avoid the slick look or as someone at work</li>
      <li>This creme feels natural, goes on easy, easy to style my hair (part to the left), and i don&#x27;t notice that its in my hair.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and does it very well.  </li>
      <li>I decided to bite the bullet and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, turns out the smell is the exact same as the clean cut pomade.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really understand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really mind because I like the smell</li>
      <li>A really well made product.</li>
      <li>I have to say I was absolutely blown away.</li>
      <li>I use this as my main hair cream.  </li>
      <li>I normally like the smell of their products.</li>
      <li>Going back to the more expensive but much more reliable product Aveda Pure Formance Grooming Cream.</li>
      <li>It gives a very natural look and feel.</li>
      <li>Very natural my gelled hair seems to be.</li>
      <li>I have the most stubborn callick ever, and this is the only thing that keeps it down without having to look like John Travolta from Grease.</li>
      <li>This is a hard to find hair product, I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>Gives a natural look not stiff.</li>
      <li>This hair gel smells nicer, feels nicer, and makes my hair feel soft.  </li>
      <li>You put a layer of this in, style it how you want and when it dries it leaves it extremely natural feeling and looking.</li>
      <li>Would reccommend it to anyone seeking the natural look.</li>
      <li>Truely natural</li>
      <li>and it provides a remarkably natural look that stays in place even for my uncooperative hair.</li>
      <li>I bet you&#x27;ll be surprised, too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking to my old stuff.</li>
      <li>I have looked around for products similar to this one as well and have found nothing that really fits its niche, don&#x27;t be turned off by the axe branding</li>
      <li>only good thing I have to say is that since it&#x27;s a cream rather than a pomade it works when your hair is dry, so you can use it if you have bed-head and are too lazy to take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I probably have $200 worth of half used and abandoned hair products ranging from Chi all the way up to Bumble &amp; Bumble Sumotech.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to refresh and a little does go a long way</li>
      <li>At the end of the day, I can wet my hands and run my fingers through my hair to rejuvenate it and this stuff still holds like new, but it does not feel like concrete.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon is the only place I can find Axe Natural anymore.  </li>
      <li>I used this glop one time and the Sumotech went right into the drawer of dead hair-products.</li>
      <li>I usually apply the cream an hour before I go out to damp hair and comb it to the side, then right before I go out the door</li>
      <li>It leaves no flakes from the gel drying out, it leaves it soft and manageable and can be fixed with just a little water on your hands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is only ok, it smells good and that&#x27;s about it. The creamy consistency doesn&#x27;t really hold if you have strong hair; if you have very soft hair it should work nicely.</li>
    <li> I use this cream because I hate the feeling of gel and hair spray. This creme feels natural, goes on easy, easy to style my hair (part to the left), and i don&#x27;t notice that its in my hair. My wife lights the scent and that helps also. It&#x27;s hard for me to find in stores so I order it here.</li>
    <li> Product works great - keeps my hair from flailing all over the place and doesn&#x27;t give that greasy feel that some other products give. The smell is pretty good too, though not a reason to buy one over another. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use this as my main hair cream.  It is better than a sticky gel.  At the end of the day, I can wet my hands and run my fingers through my hair to rejuvenate it and this stuff still holds like new, but it does not feel like concrete.  Very natural and smells nice.  A really well made product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a dozen different sculpting goos, gels, pomades, etc. over the years. I probably have $200 worth of half used and abandoned hair products ranging from Chi all the way up to Bumble &amp; Bumble Sumotech. I was at Walmart the other day and they had it for $6 so I grabbed one for the heck of it. I have to say I was absolutely blown away. I had already decided that it would be the standard store-junk thinking that anything non-salon was terrible. I used this glop one time and the Sumotech went right into the drawer of dead hair-products. I couldn&#x27;t believe how refined this product was! The smell was pleasant and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was dipping my fingers into old, sticky Crisco. The texture is more like a soft face cream. I ride my bike to work every day in the Florida heat and when I get there my hair is still intact with no sticky crud running into my eyes. It&#x27;s also non sticky to the touch so you don&#x27;t feel like you need to run to wash your hands every time you touch your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this stuff a shot. What do you have to lose besides $6? I bet you&#x27;ll be surprised, too.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says.  Gives you a nice hold without the wet seal look.  The fragrance smells really good. The ladies love it.</li>
    <li> This product is so much better than any gel I have ever used. It leaves no flakes from the gel drying out, it leaves it soft and manageable and can be fixed with just a little water on your hands. also it only takes a small amount to get the look your are looking for. No crispy, over done, jersy shore wanna be look to fear from this.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and does it very well.  It gives a very natural look and feel. You can put it on wet hair and get a bit of a \\&quot;slicker\\&quot; look, but you don&#x27;t your hair won&#x27;t get dry and crusty.  It&#x27;s easy to refresh and a little does go a long way so it has very good value.  In fairness I must say this is the first hair cream product I&#x27;ve used.  But, after using gel, mouse, hairspray, spray gel and god knows what else, this is far and away the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I bought this online because it was less than buying at the store. My husband uses this and it keeps his hair in place without it being stuck in place. I like the smell of it also - light and fresh.</li>
    <li> The Natural Axe styling cream is perfect for my type of hair and I highly recommend it for anyone who has curly hair and wants to avoid the slick look or as someone at work told me the &amp;#34;Glen Campbell perfect hair look&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The gel keeps my hair in shape without having the wet seal look. Very natural my gelled hair seems to be. I recommend this to you. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I prefer styling cream as opposed to gels and it&#x27;s harder and harder to find these products in stores. The Axe cream has minimal smell, includes tea tree oils, and will dissipate in your hair after working it in. I then use a brush to finish it off and I have the control I need without the hard looking and feeling hair one usually gets from men&#x27;s hair products.</li>
    <li> Great product...better than I expected it to be...and I&#x27;ve tried most gels. Great for medium length gentleman&#x27;s hair style and it smells good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is surprisingly amazing. I hate &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; my hair, but I need it to look professional for work. You put a layer of this in, style it how you want and when it dries it leaves it extremely natural feeling and looking. Yet for some reason it keeps? I don&#x27;t really understand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wizard magic.</li>
    <li> For me it is OK at best. No flaking long term but it&#x27;s oily and leaves a white residue when you apply it initially. Going back to the more expensive but much more reliable product Aveda Pure Formance Grooming Cream.</li>
    <li> Great product and am completely satisfied. No issues whatsoever. Will recommend to anyone interested in this product. Will do business again with.</li>
    <li> Great gel I use it all the time. Not as strong and greasy as others.</li>
    <li> I have the most stubborn callick ever, and this is the only thing that keeps it down without having to look like John Travolta from Grease. Fair price too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big hair product person but I like this because it lets me give the front of my hair a bit of lift without looking like I just stepped off the grease train.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> good product.smells nice.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. I have longer hair and I like to be able to run my hand through my hair and many products don&#x27;t allow this.  This stuff holds your hair where you want it but it doesn&#x27;t look like you have stuff in your hair which i like.</li>
    <li> The smell is weird for an Axe product. I normally like the smell of their products. This one is odd but it works well as a molding cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about every type of male hair product out there and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.  It does not harden or flake.  I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for longer hair but this is the best. I have looked around for products similar to this one as well and have found nothing that really fits its niche, don&#x27;t be turned off by the axe branding, it&#x27;s really good stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find hair product, I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it. As always a great price too. With Prime offered I got it in a day.</li>
    <li> Works great. Happy with it</li>
    <li> I was using a different hair gel that made my hair crisp and hard.  This hair gel smells nicer, feels nicer, and makes my hair feel soft.  Excellent product would definitely recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Very good hair creme, smells pretty nice, and its as its name says, understated. You wont look like you just placed a can of crisco on your hair.</li>
    <li> I usually use [[ASIN:B001FSK8SA Axe Refined Clean-cut Look Pomade, 2.64-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)]] for my hair.  After reading the reviews for this one (nice smell, non sticky, etc) I decided to bite the bullet and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, turns out the smell is the exact same as the clean cut pomade.  I don&#x27;t really mind because I like the smell but I was expecting something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reviewers that said it&#x27;s not sticky have no idea what they were talking about.  This is way stickier than the clean cut pomade.  I have to wash my hands after using it and it still doesn&#x27;t come off.  The pomade I can just rub off my hands with my towel and I&#x27;m good to go. Of course this cream is not as sticky as gel or mousse but it is way more sticky than the axe pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I have to say is that since it&#x27;s a cream rather than a pomade it works when your hair is dry, so you can use it if you have bed-head and are too lazy to take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not impressed.  I&#x27;m sticking to my old stuff.</li>
    <li> my boys favorite hair care product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. It really smells like tea!!...which is a good thing. great for silky smooth hair look. Buy Lots!</li>
    <li> I usually apply the cream an hour before I go out to damp hair and comb it to the side, then right before I go out the door I comb it again after it is dry and it provides a remarkably natural look that stays in place even for my uncooperative hair. The two jars usually last me about two months (one month apiece) Just know what you want before buying it.</li>
    <li> I have hard to style hair and this product makes my hair heavy and flat. It does not lift it up or give any volume so it just gives me the two-days-with-no-shower look.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found.  Holds it in place and you could still run your hands though it.  Truely natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the only place I can find Axe Natural anymore.  None of the stores anywhere around here sell it.</li>
    <li> Gives a natural look not stiff. Hair looks like there is nothing on. Would reccommend it to anyone seeking the natural look.</li>
