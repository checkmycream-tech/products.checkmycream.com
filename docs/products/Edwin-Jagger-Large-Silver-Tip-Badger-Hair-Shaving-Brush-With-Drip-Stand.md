      <li>this is  a best shaving brush i have ever used.  </li>
      <li>it feels wonderful on my face,  </li>
      <li>Best I ever had.</li>
      <li>got this brush for Christmas from my wife and is one of the best gifts that i have gotten.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an awesome brush, and I recommend it completely.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Excellent brush,</li>
      <li>probably best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>this brush is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Really happy with this product!</li>
      <li>Great quality.</li>
      <li>This is a great brush.</li>
      <li>It worked great in all settings.</li>
      <li>Fantastic Brush!!!</li>
      <li>Works great, good quality and a pleasure to use.</li>
      <li>Makes a good lather with my proraso shave soap.</li>
      <li>if you are looking to upgrade to a quality shaving brush this is the one to go for it has a nice stand</li>
      <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t smell out of the box, which was nice.</li>
      <li>this brush is super smooth and feels wonderful on my skin when paired with some Taylor &amp; Bond Street cream.</li>
      <li>Very soft and provides excellent lather</li>
      <li>However it feels like an angel making love to your face.</li>
      <li>I thought twice (actually more) before I bought it and even had some buyer&#x27;s remorse after the item was already shipped and on its way to my home.  </li>
      <li>Would have preferred they gave a travel tube instead, if that&#x27;s all the better the stand is going to work.</li>
      <li>Great brush, very soft but gets the job done well.</li>
      <li>Oh and then when your applying it, it&#x27;s the most comfortable thing in the world, it&#x27;s like lathering your face with a cloud or something</li>
      <li>This is my first experience with silver tip badger brushes, and I have to say this thing is great, the lather it creates is nice and smooth and it creates it extremely fast.</li>
      <li>handle has quite the girth, but the detailing makes it easy to handle.</li>
      <li>A good quality brush, with very soft hair.</li>
      <li>Price does make a huge difference .</li>
      <li>simple disign but a great value.</li>
      <li>This was the first time I had ordered the product, the badger hair are fine but the brush handle is so short that one has to hold the end of the brush to be able to apply the lather to one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;However, no issue with the quality of the brush, hence the three stars.</li>
      <li>First off, it&#x27;s packed super densely.</li>
      <li>I only like my Parker Silver Tip better because the Parker has a longer handle.</li>
      <li>I only wish the handle shape was a bit more accommodating.</li>
      <li>i have a pure badger brush and there is no comparison.</li>
      <li>So soft, so well made and so much lather!  </li>
      <li>For the price, it has a decent size knot.</li>
      <li>This brush is the main component of my shaving arsenal.</li>
      <li>Issard super badger brush, and it&#x27;s definitely a step up.  </li>
      <li>Still I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Some others may offer bigger, but they cost upwards of twice to three times as much, and I probably couldn&#x27;t fit a bigger brush into my mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>Silvertip is worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to get a decent lather within a minute of working the brush, even using wool-fat soap in the infamously hard water we have down in Texas (we&#x27;re on top of massive limestone</li>
      <li>though the pack is dense enough to give it a certain stiffness, the bristles are buttery soft at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just like the old school feel of&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels a little cheap, but it does the job (and has a double-sided sticky on the back in case you want to mount it on a vertical surface).  </li>
      <li>The prongs don&#x27;t even stick out far enough to hang the brush without the bristles getting all mushed up in the back.</li>
      <li>In fact, I think I prefer the large circumference to the smaller handles I&#x27;ve had on brushes of less grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As such, it sucks up a ton of water and lathers super efficiently.</li>
      <li>just bite the bullet and pay a little extra for what you really want.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for the past 4 months or so. Great quality. Makes a good lather with my proraso shave soap.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I had ordered the product, the badger hair are fine but the brush handle is so short that one has to hold the end of the brush to be able to apply the lather to one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;However, no issue with the quality of the brush, hence the three stars.</li>
    <li> this is  a best shaving brush i have ever used.  it feels wonderful on my face,  i have a pure badger brush and there is no comparison. got this brush for Christmas from my wife and is one of the best gifts that i have gotten.  this feels like  mink on my face when i shave in the morning.  if you are looking to upgrade to a quality shaving brush this is the one to go for it has a nice stand and you cant beet the price  for a silver tip.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, probably best I&#x27;ve ever owned. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the price. Still I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought twice (actually more) before I bought it and even had some buyer&#x27;s remorse after the item was already shipped and on its way to my home.  After I used it though, I had no more regrets ... this brush is super smooth and feels wonderful on my skin when paired with some Taylor &amp; Bond Street cream.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this product! Works great, good quality and a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> Just like the old school feel of&lt;br /&gt;a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;As described and delivered on time</li>
    <li> Very soft and provides excellent lather</li>
    <li> A good quality brush, with very soft hair. I only wish the handle shape was a bit more accommodating.</li>
    <li> I only like my Parker Silver Tip better because the Parker has a longer handle.</li>
    <li> I got this as an upgrade from my Thiers-Issard super badger brush, and it&#x27;s definitely a step up.  I&#x27;m able to get a decent lather within a minute of working the brush, even using wool-fat soap in the infamously hard water we have down in Texas (we&#x27;re on top of massive limestone deposits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is...OK.  It feels a little cheap, but it does the job (and has a double-sided sticky on the back in case you want to mount it on a vertical surface).  I would have liked having the bottom of the stand molded into a shallow well to catch any drips from a hanging brush, but hardly anyone does that for some reason.</li>
    <li> very expensive.very disappointing.No lather.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected but oooooh so soft. Silvertip is worth the extra money. Includes sticky back to keep stand in place. No hairs lost, used for a month.</li>
    <li> Great shaving brush!  So soft, so well made and so much lather!  It pampers one&#x27;s face!  Price does make a huge difference .</li>
    <li> Best brush I have found.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Brush!!! Best I ever had. Use with Proraso Cream. Luxurious!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. First off, it&#x27;s packed super densely. In fact, its so dense, it seems almost as stiff as the old EJ \\&quot;Best\\&quot; brush I&#x27;m replacing. As such, it sucks up a ton of water and lathers super efficiently. For the price, it has a decent size knot. Some others may offer bigger, but they cost upwards of twice to three times as much, and I probably couldn&#x27;t fit a bigger brush into my mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the pack is dense enough to give it a certain stiffness, the bristles are buttery soft at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this with soap and cream, and both face and bowl lathers. It worked great in all settings. Soaps are going to take some extra vigor, though. If you&#x27;re a soap person, you might want to stick to \\&quot;Super\\&quot; rather than silvertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t smell out of the box, which was nice. Also, it didn&#x27;t have the usual break-in shedding period I&#x27;ve gone through with other brushes where I spend the first few weeks picking badger hairs off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has quite the girth, but the detailing makes it easy to handle. In fact, I think I prefer the large circumference to the smaller handles I&#x27;ve had on brushes of less grade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome brush, and I recommend it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand, however, is pretty sorry. The prongs don&#x27;t even stick out far enough to hang the brush without the bristles getting all mushed up in the back. Would have preferred they gave a travel tube instead, if that&#x27;s all the better the stand is going to work.</li>
    <li> this brush is wonderful. dont start off with a cheaper brush and work your way up.  just bite the bullet and pay a little extra for what you really want. simple disign but a great value. got mine two weeks ago</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with silver tip badger brushes, and I have to say this thing is great, the lather it creates is nice and smooth and it creates it extremely fast. Oh and then when your applying it, it&#x27;s the most comfortable thing in the world, it&#x27;s like lathering your face with a cloud or something</li>
    <li> This brush is the main component of my shaving arsenal. I must clarify a brush this expensive isn&#x27;t necessary. However it feels like an angel making love to your face. Water retention is perfect. I have bad basic brushes and there is no comparison. This brush should last me a life time with proper care. If your even thinking about it just buy one.</li>
    <li> Great brush, very soft but gets the job done well.</li>
