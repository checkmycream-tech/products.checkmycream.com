<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hope this really do good things to your hair because it stinks really bad it smells like sour vagina &#x27;this smells really bad but I hope it does the things it say</li>
    <li> It was good, but it made my hair feel coated.</li>
    <li> Noticed difference in my hair- much smoother.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my hairdresser uses it and my hair always looks and feels good after he does my hair.  My hairdresser is very good and has been in the business many years.  When I use it myself, I can&#x27;t blow dry my hair as good as my hairdresser but my hair does feel softer.  I damaged my hair when straightening it and I think this helps repair it some because of the keratin.  I also use keratin shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Lovely conditioner. Not greasy, but my hair is very dry.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product worked that well for the price. I gave my away thinking maybe it is just my hair...</li>
    <li> Fabulous product really helps hair that is chemically treated and dried out from blow drying.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle. Love this product!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!  I have fine hair and most leave ins make my  hair greasy but this is a wonder cream for me!  It makes my hair soft, manageable, shiny and healthy!  I don&#x27;t go a day without it!  The price was AWESOME as I am used to spending $19-22 at Target - such a steal!  I bought two!</li>
    <li> I have never been sensitive to scents.  However, this conditioner made my eyes burn.  I thought the first time was just a fluke, but it happened the second time I used it.  Also, the conditioner is too thick to go through the straw that&#x27;s attached to the spray top.  I tried to clear the straw with water first and then put it back into the bottle.  After the water worked it&#x27;s way through,  the conditioner clogged it up.  It&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> Soooo bummed!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the leave in condish without keratin but this made my hair tacky and yuck feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the shampo (kinda watery) the conditioner (nothing great) but the spray leave in is AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;So going to return this and get my tried and true leave with NO keratin.</li>
    <li> It did everything it said it would. Did not weigh my hair down at all and kept it looking straighter with harrdly any frizz. I didnt have to use any straightning iron afterwards as it was really straight just from blow drying it. I will definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is so strong I couldn&#x27;t use more than a few times, the couple of times that I did use it I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my hair. I was hoping the keratin in this product would help strengthen my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this once or twice a week . it&#x27;s great! If I use it everyday it weighs my hair down somewhat. All in all it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> GREAT LEAVE-IN  A LITTLE HEAVY IF YOUR HAIR IS FINE. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. I USE THE DEEP CONDITIONER AND FOLLOW WITH THIS ON MY ENDS ONLY.</li>
    <li> I am testing this product because a friend recommended it to me.. so far so good.</li>
    <li> This product is the best product I ever used!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair just loves it! I use it every day!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a miracle!!!!</li>
    <li> Lets say this my hair has been so dyed out blonde that its such a mess..this product by far has been the best I ever used..it seriously helps if your hair is so dry and breaking its like HEAVEN in a bottle please try this if your at ur wits end with dry brittle hair</li>
    <li> This is a must have product for anyone trying to tame frizzy hair.  It has also strengthened my hair.  Great product</li>
    <li> This smells great and leaves my hair conditioned for days after I use it. I have pretty fine hair, and as long as I don&#x27;t spray it on my roots it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am again of several of the It&#x27;s a 10 products and this is no exception. I have noticed a difference in my hair and my daughters hair as well since we started using the product.</li>
    <li> After a month use, this product detangles, defrizzes and adds shine to my hair. It is great as long as you spray it on your hair however, as treatment , i wish to see that it treats my hair softer and healthier eventually.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft this product leaves my hair.  After struggling to find a good product to help the dryness of my white hair, this was recommended to me by a hairdresser in Florida.  Works great.&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry my hair and use a flat iron.  A+++</li>
    <li> Product really works it takes the fridge out of your hair</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and OMG is it amazing!  I abuse my hair.  It&#x27;s colored and highlighted, I blow dry and flat iron my hair everyday.  This product keeps my hair so touchable and soft when it should be fried with all the stuff I do to it! For me, the only drawback is the scent, which seems strong at first, but it does eventually dissipate.  You NEED this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the origional It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in for a while and decided to try this one with the keratin. It&#x27;s hard to believe it works even better. Great buy!</li>
    <li> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do yourself (and your hair) a favor and buy this product!!!!  I&#x27;m 100% serious when I say this is the best item I have ever bought for my hair (and I have tried SEVERAL!!!).  My hair is...for lack of a better word...\\&quot;complicated.\\&quot;  All of my life it has never known if it was curly or straight.  I hated wearing it curly because every day it looked different, and the curling type was never consistent throughout my whole head of hair, and I hated the feel of \\&quot;product\\&quot; in my hair.  And when I straightened it, I would blow dry it first and it looked very scary before I straightened it with a flat iron and then if it was humid (I live in the south), it was poofy within a matter of minutes.  I have been using this product for about four months now and it not something that does your hair good that one time, it has been seriously \\&quot;treating\\&quot; my hair.  Now when I blow it dry, it&#x27;s basically straight and I have cut my straightening time from 40+ minutes to less than 15.  I have thick hair, so I have to straighten it in sections, so that&#x27;s why it always took longer.  I had always been so frustrated with my hair type and how I have never been able to wash and go...and I can now!  I swear that I am just a southern plain Jane and this is my honest opinion of a fabulous product that I hope to never have to go without!</li>
    <li> wife swears by this hair product and uses it for regular maintenance. no one carries this product locally so had to order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> It really is a Ten, it leaves you hair incredible without the greasy feeling, and it controls your style  without making it flat.</li>
    <li> Bought this twice. Works best in partially dry/partially wet hair. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I would always feel like I washed out all of my conditioner in the shower. This allows my to reapply conditioner on the top of my hair and the ends, where I need it most. It is also really great for restoration after highlights! I love the It&#x27;s a 10 brand! I have never ran accross anything that works so well for me!</li>
    <li> There is nothing special in this product. I bought this from amazon so unfortunatly i couldnot return it. if you want to try it buy from local store so you can return it. I am sure you will return it. I like Lorial and Garnier live-in conditioner much better then this product. so save your $$$</li>
    <li> OMG! I wish I had known about this product much earlier. I have been suffering from super dry hair for a while and tried every product recommended with little success. This product left visible results from the first use. Smooth, shine.. Amazing!</li>
    <li> I started out using &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; about two years ago (before the new Keratin) and I instantly loved it. It makes my hair a thousand times softer, shinier, less frizz, and more controllable. I now use this product religiously after taking a shower. All it takes is a few sprays! The newer keratin version is even better, I love the effect it has on my hair. I cannot speak more highly of this product: It is a must have!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, I got it from my cousin&#x27;s beauty salon. It&#x27;s good for your hair. Will keep getting it. Also when bottle has about&lt;br /&gt;1/2 ounce left add water shake. Got another 1/2 bottle out of it.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell, and great spray, but leaves my hear dull and sticky. Probably not for my hair type</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time regardless of all the snow and overall I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products on the market! Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used to use It&#x27;s A 10 Leave-in Condition and thought I&#x27;d give the one that includes keratin a try and it&#x27;s great. The scent isn&#x27;t over powering and it definitely does it&#x27;s job, my ends don&#x27;t look over processed/dry when I use it!</li>
    <li> All of the It&#x27;s a 10 products i have used i love.  This product is now a must have for me.</li>
    <li> Buy this!!! You don&#x27;t have to ever brush your hair again... For those of us who lose hair every time we brush. Ultimate tangle remover. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a little expensive product, but very effective.  It softens and detangles hair very well.  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after a hair stylist used it after a color appointment.  I didn&#x27;t think it was any different at the time, but being the product-addict that I am I went searching for it on Amazon.  I have used it several times (3-4 times a week) since I bought it and now am telling everyone about it.  I have color treated hair and it is very long (mid back) so keeping it looking healthy and feeling healthy is a job.  I spray this in after I towel dry and comb through.  It has really just been making my hair more manageable, softer, and just healthier overall.  I have tons of products and hardly ever use a whole bottle of anything before I move on to something else, but this will definitely be something I use for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was a different and unexpected experience.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even use Mousse on my hair anymore, after my showers I just spray this in &amp; I&#x27;m good to go!! Feels GOOD on my hair. Wish it smelled as good as the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In without Keratin...</li>
    <li> This is worth the $$$$!!!! Not oily or greasy. It is like a spray \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; conditioner. Does everything it claims &amp; more.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My stylist recommended it to me, and then when I came back to see her, she showed me that they had come out with another product that has the keratin in it. :) Awesome for us gym buffs who are always in the shower right after the gym.</li>
    <li> This product does add softness and body to dry hair, but it smells so bad it is unusable unless you want to go around smelling like a cheap whore with your eyes watering and throat closing up.  It has a powerful chemicals-masked-by-flowers smell.  Why can&#x27;t manufacturers just leave out the bad perfume?</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair everyday. Ever since using it my hair has felt so much softer. I would highly recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I love It&#x27;s A 10 products.  My hair was so damaged and now it&#x27;s so soft.  I tried all kinds of products and this is the only one to help my hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down but gives it great condition! Its a must have if you have color treated, damaged or curly hair.</li>
    <li> I live in a very humid climate and my hair would get wavy or frizzy as soon as I walked outside. My niece let me try her It&#x27;s a Ten and I loved it. I used it while in Florida at Disney World and it kept my hair looking great! When we got back I ordered four bottles. I spray in my hair wet and then blow it dry. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this.</li>
    <li> First of all, a brief background why I ended up spending so much money on such a small bottle of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 6-year-old daughter and I started taking swimming lessons this year.&lt;br /&gt;She is a much better swimmer than I and she enjoys staying in pool for hours, go under the water and do her thing.&lt;br /&gt;While I am more like a stay-above-the-water, but my hair do get wet after every lesson and practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got her the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Kids 2-in-1 Extra Gentle Swim &amp; Sport Shampoo as soon as she started the first class.&lt;br /&gt;I myself bought the Paul Mitchell Shampoo three.&lt;br /&gt;But after 3 months, 3 to 4 times per week of 1-hour session for each pool visit, my daughter&#x27;s hair condition become worse day by day (think Halloween hair... ), it&#x27;s painful to comb, and heartache to touch and tough on nose. L&#x27;Oreal obviously can&#x27;t handle the problem, not only the hair condition, also the smell of Chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;Paul Mitchell Shampoo three, while can handle my very long hair, but my hair condition is not maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the fellow students, parents and coaches, I am told to search and employ the \\&quot;UltraSwim Chlorine-Removal Shampoo\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not easy to find UltraSwim Chlorine-Removal Shampoo in every drugstore locally, only one store have it in stock with \\&quot;reasonable price\\&quot;, while some even asks for $8.99 per bottle !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UltraSwim definitely can handle the Chlorine smell problem, but another 3 months pass, UltraSwim is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both our hair condition gets worse week by week, just in a slower pace than the first 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Something has to be done - condition, heavy condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the Pantane, the Beautiful Length line, the Breakage to Strength line, been there, done that, doesn&#x27;t help much.&lt;br /&gt;Increase the amount, the frequency of applying treatment mask, cream, not a single difference and it&#x27;s heck of a long operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I remember the Paul Mitchell Super Charged Moisturizer, that saved my hair after a heat damage several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite pricey, but if you buy big size package with coupons, it&#x27;s about the same as Pantane and I know it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was in the professional salon shopping, the hair dresser also examined our hair condition and pointed out - UltraSwim only able to remove a good percentage of Chlorine and the chemical in the pool, but not all of them. To allow the Paul Mitchell stuff works better, the built-up has to go first, hence, the Neutrogena Shampoo Anti-Residue Formula Hair Shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;No need to use the Neutrogena after every swim, but better use it once or twice per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Mitchell stuff works well in our condition, but not yet great. It&#x27;s like the ER service, need something that can \\&quot;heal\\&quot; and \\&quot;maintain\\&quot; our hair condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the hairdresser let me tried her \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; Miracle Levee In\\&quot;. She has been telling me this one will work, but the price tag just a bit too much for me to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;But after I tried it, just the first time, I am sold. It completes what Paul Mitchell Super Charged Moisturizer can&#x27;t do, my daughter&#x27;s hair condition is much much improved.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after continuous apply for 5 days (5 washes), her hair condition is even better than before the pre-swim-learning days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our current hair care routine now is UltraSwim after every pool visit, then It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In.&lt;br /&gt;At home, Neutrogena Anti Residue Formula, then Paul Mitchell Super Charged Moisturizer, then again the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;On the day of no pool visit, we also use my Shampoo Three, instead of Neutrogena Anti Residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought both versions of leave in - the with and without Keratin.&lt;br /&gt;The one with Keratin seems to make hair \\&quot;shine\\&quot; and a bit \\&quot;softer\\&quot; than the one without.&lt;br /&gt;Even the one without Keratin works super.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, I am relieved, no more the fuzzy Halloween hair.&lt;br /&gt;Our hair looks and feels healthy, easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is fuzzy, dry, damaged by various chemical treatments, etc. This one will definitely help, but I do believe this is the \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; piece, after you clean the hair completely first.etely first.</li>
    <li> I use this on  my 5-year old grandsons hair to detangle.  His hair is a little long and he hates getting it combed if it is tangled.  This makes coming through his hair bearable for him and easy for me and it also gives his hair a nice shine.</li>
    <li> This product is Amazing. I sprayed on my hair before blow drying &amp; the results is a 10+ my hair is so straight &amp; soft. I will be using for life. Salon Results, bouncy &amp; behaving.</li>
    <li> From Greg&#x27;s wife:&lt;br /&gt;I have used the original version for over a year because I was TOLD that it was good for my hair.  With this new product I can actually SEE how good it is.  After much highlighting my hair got very dry and damaged. I tried a lot of different products but nothing has helped like this has.  My hair is soft, smooth and fuller now.  I am thankful for the upgrade. It really is a 10 now!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have greasy hair and even after already having conditioned in the shower after shampooing, I can put this in my hair and not have to worry about it making my hair extra greasy. It isn&#x27;t heavy and won&#x27;t weigh your hair down either.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking it would help my curly (biracial) hair. My hair is looseish curls but definately not wavy or afro. After i wash my hair its perfect but when it dries it gets really poofy and frizzy, especially the top. This product smells really good but is very small. To make matters worse when i used this it made my hair turn into a big puff. I don&#x27;t know why,  maybe it was the keratin. Tried the product many times and it still didn&#x27;t work. I eventually gave it to my friend who flat irons her hair all the time. Will try the original leave in,  but I&#x27;m very dissapointed that i wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have thick, dark hair. It gets very frizzy, especially in summer. I&#x27;ve used Redken Align, Argan oil, Biosilk, all the drug store stuff; and none come close to working as well as this does. My hair stylist recommended this and it&#x27;s a godsend. My hair is shiny, silky, and healthy. I like that it&#x27;s in a spray because I don&#x27;t need that much product, and it allows even application. I will not use anything else!</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that you will run out and buy once you realize it&#x27;s getting low. It makes such a dramatic difference in how my hair looks and feels that it&#x27;s become an essential part of my daily routine. I blow dry and straighten my hair daily, and this product keeps my hair soft, healthy and shiny. I haven&#x27;t had a single split end since I started using it. I put it on right after I shower and let it set in while I moisturize my body and face. The only drawback is the price. Fortunately, not much is needed. The bottle lasts me eight weeks.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product and decided to give it a try. My Keratin treatment was growing out and I purchased this to get me through two weeks before my next appointment.  It really works!  Great to use before flat ironing--really speeds up the process.  I spent a rainy week on vacation, and even all the moisture in the air didn&#x27;t frizz or curl my hair after I used this.  My daughter tried it on her curly hair, which she doesn&#x27;t flat iron, and it&#x27;s the best product for keeping the curls smoothe--no frizz!  I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it.  It works!</li>
    <li> Smells SO good! I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> All It&#x27;s A 10 products are wonderful, but this one is an exception.  I love it!  Leaves hair soft and shiny, without being heavy.</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> I first learned about this at my salon by my stylist. I have been using this product for a year now and my hair has started repairing itself and feels so much more healthy than before.</li>
    <li> I will not leave home without it.  I have treated hair.  But my hair does not feel it or look it, because when I shampoo, I always use this little Miracle, which is easy to use.  Spray in a tiny bit.  Leave it in and comb it ,or whatever else you plan to do.  No rinse needed.  No other conditioner needed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Plus Keratin is an excellent product that helps make your hair stronger with each use.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Okay, so imagine if Christ himself was a hair stylist. Now imagine that he could use his God/Christ-powers to turn water into leave-in conditioner. Not just any leave-in conditioner, though, it&#x27;s a leave-in that would&#x27;ve allowed Samson to have the destructive power of a nuclear bomb if he had put it in his hair. That about sums up what this product is like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many detanglers in my time (straight, fine hair is just ridiculous about tangling), and none, except possibly the L&#x27;Oreal Kid&#x27;s detangler quite compares to this stuff. Granted, I have also stopped using heat on my hair, and have a really awesome regular conditioner as well, so that may account for this fact, but since I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve been seeing less split-ends, feeling less tangles in the shower, and my hair just generally feels more amazing after this product, and holds a lovely shine. Oh yeah, and I get less tangles THROUGHOUT THE DAY now that I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only word of caution I have to offer is to try to mind how much of this you use (that&#x27;ll depend of course on the length and general amount/thickness of your hair), and try not to get too much of it near the scalp. This can lead to a slight greasy feeling, but it doesn&#x27;t always last all day, and that&#x27;s about the same effect as having used too much regular conditioner, anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get yourself some Leave-in of the Lord, so that it may enact the passion and salvation on your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Kerastase leave-in forever and love it but decided to start cutting back on what I spend on hair care products.  I like this leave-in just as much, if not more, than the Kerastase.  My hair loves it ;o)</li>
    <li> Good hair product...it has strenghtened my hair after several weeks of use!</li>
    <li> I will never use this crap again! It SMELLS like cheap strong perfume.......I had to leave the bottle open overnight just to get the stuff anywhere near my head, but I still wanted to try it. After drying my hair, it felt weird. Thicker yes, but sort of odd and gummy. Next morning it seemed better, so I fixed it as usual and went out. AFter 5 minutes outside, my hair curled and frizzed and I looked like a banshee!!!! I have color damaged hair, fine, and like to wear it straight which usually isn&#x27;t a huge problem. HATE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> Makes hair nice and soft. Great product.</li>
    <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to rate this with 1 star, but it&#x27;s not right at 5 stars.  Make sure you know your hair! If it&#x27;s thick, curly and coarse (naturally), this isn&#x27;t a great product.  It ended up leaving my hair feeling like I put gum in it and I didn&#x27;t spray in a ton.  I&#x27;d spray it in my wet hair, comb it through and blow dry it, prepping it for flat-ironing (when I used to do it a lot).  It felt like I put in hairspray! Possibly if you have fine, straight hair, this might be better but for those of us with the curls, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleasing smell though!</li>
    <li> I cannot say if this product works or not. I am yet another customer who got a bottle with a broken sprayer. Returning for a refund.</li>
    <li> So far good! It definitely works better if you blow dry your hair after! I have color treated curly hair and it nourishes my hair completely! It&#x27;s very lightweight! I just wish it for it to be more economical! But worth it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, it leaves my hair feeling wonderful! Super pricey though, so I can&#x27;t really justify buying it all the time. A great splurge for once in a while, though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know exactly what it was for but my mom had given it to me because the smell was too strong for her. After finishing the whole bottle my hair actually grew about 2 to 3 inches this is great stuff, after every use it left my hair soft and flat ironing is much easier.</li>
    <li> This stuff is life changing. I have very, tangled, and oily hair. Didn&#x27;t exactly win the genetic lottery here on hair. After years and years of ripping my hair out after showering, and having showing being the most traumatic part of my day, a couple of friends of mine referred me to this. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but after my first use, I was convinced. The first time I used this my hair was below my waist, and it cut the brush time from 5 minutes to two. A week or two later I cut 10 inches off, and it look me less than a minute to brush. It helps with tangles and it leaves my hair super soft!!! As for oil, I don&#x27;t find it making my hair more oily, as my hair gets oily within 6 hours of washing it anyway. I only need a few spritz of it, so it lasts quite a while. I love this spray, and will never shower without it again.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. I have natural hair and  it makes my hair feels silkly and the smell is just wonderful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3+ years and can&#x27;t imagine living without it! I won&#x27;t even attempt to brush my damp hair without this stuff...it&#x27;s THAT amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as I have been using the regular leave in for a few years and when this one came out, I figured I would give it a shot as I was told it was amazing. I have used it several times now, and each time I use it, it turns my hair into a birds nest and I cannot brush it, and it is totally unmanagable. It does not make my hair soft, nor does it condition it.In fact, it does the opposite. I am not sure what is going on with this product. But I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> after making the mistake of box dying my hair i got a life chaining recommendation on this product. I use this after the shower or with wet hair, spray then brush through. the distribution of spray if flawless and it is a light weight formula. Helps detsngle and restore the natural protein in my hair which i had lost! With an product that has keratin in it you must be careful about using too much! i havent tried this product without the keratin but once im back to normal i will be using the alternative! its a 10 seems to be a great product line, i cant wait to start testing more out!</li>
    <li> great product, works wonders for tired hair and conditioning is fantastic. I would recommend to people with conditioning needs on hair.</li>
    <li> I had tried another leave-in product f theirs and liked  it but this doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  Could be it is outdated.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far to control my thin curly hair.  It detangles after shampooing and requires very little product (I only spray about 3 times in different sections of my hair) to help straighten my hair and leaves it healthy looking and feeling wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the original It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In but I wanted to try the Keratin because I&#x27;ve heard so many good things. I love the smell, it&#x27;s much different than the original. It leaves your hair silky smooth! The only complaint I have it that I&#x27;ve sprayed it closer to the root to detangle but find my hair getting much more oily quicker.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff . I have damaged  colored  treated  hair. This  treatment  is the  only one that works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that my hair is greatly improved from using this, but I do notice a difference. My hair is softer and curls better. I just pump it into my hands and run through my hair after I shower. It is possible to use too much, so remember that a little can go a long way. If I ran out, would I buy it again? Yes!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product!! The shipping time was great too!!</li>
    <li> I use this product in-between keratin hair treatments.  So far, my hair has been much more manageable than in the past.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 10 leaves my hair soft and manageable and has helped with winter dryness. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is so frizzy but with this product I feel very confident and no more bad hair days!!</li>
    <li> I have wiry hair and have not used it yet but I am hoping that it works great. it seems easy to apply and hopefully I will get good results</li>
    <li> great leave in! i have the conditioner too and plan on buying the shampoo now. i like their regular products and decided to try the keratin ones. I have dark thick hair that is hard to keep from poofing out and this works great! i love the smell which other keratin products i&#x27;ve tried have stunk pretty bad if they worked and if they didn&#x27;t smell they didn&#x27;t work.  great product again by its a 10! definitely works on keeping hair soft and flat with no frizz or poofiness.</li>
    <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair, drives us nuts! This is one product she LOVES and she is very picky... so far so good!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long curly hair that tangles with every movement. This leave-in conditioner works better than any leave-in or detangler on the market! Truly the best. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money looking any further.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it has saved my hair</li>
    <li> It just made my hair feel so heavy and with a wax-like coating.  I even tried to water the solution down a bit and tried that.  Definitely was lighter but didn&#x27;t make my hair softer, less frizzy or more manageable.</li>
    <li> I got a pink bottle with the \\&quot; It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; label on it, but nothing about Keratin. I have no idea what this is?</li>
    <li> It keeps the hair from frizzing but it does not do a great job in straightening your hair.</li>
    <li> Works great, deff would recommend</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever. Just went on vacation and salt water destroyed my hair. This stuff was absolutely a life saver.</li>
    <li> I did enjoy this product. It did make my hair seem shinier and stronger, but it is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> This works amazing I wish I would of bought this again and well I went with another product this time n now I&#x27;m broke but u just wait when I have the money I am def investing in this product again very impressed at how well it stopped my hair from breaking off just to give u and idea of how damaged my hair is I have naturally wavy curly hair and I tried to chemically relax it and have dyed it almost every other week at the longest every other month for years dying my hair is like therapy and well ha I&#x27;m like addicted to dying my hair :):):) but I have to make sure I buy the right products or it really shows this is the only thing I have found that stopped the breakage other than One other salon product that I can&#x27;t seem to remember the name of at the moment ugh anywyz that was verrry expensive and I couldn&#x27;t afford it thats when I went into my salon and tried to find a cheaper just as good version and they recommended this I didint think much of it until I tried it being that na much really fixes or helps my hair becuz it&#x27;s so damaged it Litrally acts and imitates African amercan hair sumtimes but at the least is ethnic hair and I am not African american so it&#x27;s annoying That I have those same problems an idk how to deal with them anywyz :) this product saved my hair buy it u won&#x27;t regret it ! k I&#x27;ma shut up now:) later</li>
    <li> I discovered this at my hair salon.  I have super thick, curly hair so brushing it can be a pain.  This stuff makes it so much easier!!  Great detangler.</li>
    <li> absolutely love these products.  is magic for your hair! smells great i just wish the price was cheaper.  i have alot of hair and use it fairly quickly</li>
    <li> This really helps me comb through my wet thin hair, major detangler and smells so good leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I like the original formula much better. This is just more expensive and doesn&#x27;t smell as good. Do not see any improvement with the Keratin. Will go back to the original formula next time I buy it.</li>
    <li> ...rub your hands together, then apply to your hair for less build-up. Works perfectly for me if I just use it sparingly. Two shots in my hand is all it takes!  Then l use the blow dryer, followed by the flat iron that I use to curl my hair or to add some body.</li>
    <li> I personally love this product. It truly works with tangles and I have tried other products.  It&#x27;s a 10 is the best.  And the service, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product! I have very fine thin hair that i feel is weighted down by absolutely anything i put in my hair. This product didn&#x27;t do that and I am so relieved! It leaves my hair so shiny and soft and smells delicious. My hair stylist used it on my hair the last time I went in and i loved it. I usually buy the products my hair stylist uses on my hair if she says she really likes it, but i&#x27;ve never really been all that gung-ho about the products once I buy them. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t know how to use them properly or not, but this product is absolutely amazing. I gather my hair in a pony tail and spray seven sprays of it down to the ends. I rub it into the ends of my hair and kind of distribute it evenly throughout my hair. The only area I avoid putting it on is my roots; i feel this would make my hair feel greasy. There is definitely a &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; with this product, but it is different for everyone. I would start off with a small amount and work your way up to the amount that is best suited for your hair. I would definitely recommend this product over any other leave in product!</li>
    <li> My hair is frizzy, damaged, and color treated.  This spray makes my hair soft and is also a heat protectant spray.  I was previously using 2 separate products but this spray has everything i need in one!</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be better but it leaves my hair kind of stiff and just doesnt work for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I figured this would be a generic leave in conditioner with a fancy name and a lot of hype, but bought it anyway to see how well it did. I love it! It&#x27;s great for straightening my hair without heat when it gets frizzy, and it adds amazing shine. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy though which is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was a bottle with a defective pump.  The product is good though.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s always a 10!</li>
    <li> great product, makes hair shiny and beautiful. I am never without this leave in and recommend to all. Very good.</li>
    <li> works well and even better than the regular one, which works well too.  Makes my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> Love it, it smells good asnd leaves your hair tangle free, you can get out of the shower, spray and brush, does not break your hair..I love it, i only wish it was cheaper though...</li>
    <li> I love this product....it conditions and repairs damaged hair with out flattening. I have fine hair and still get lots of body after using It&#x27;s a Ten Plus Keratin. Highly recommend this product !</li>
    <li> Really nice product for damaged hair or to just give your hair a lift.  Can be found at local drug stores as well as Amazon.</li>
    <li> Smells so pretty and works to detangle my god awful salty sandy hair.</li>
    <li> An absolute must !  Use this after the Keratin shampoo &amp; conditioner - you will see &amp; feel a big difference.  It&#x27;s a must if you use hot rollers, curling iron or any hot tool on your hair. My hair is getting healthy again!!</li>
    <li> It is kind if oily.  It has great shine, but it makes my hair stiff.</li>
    <li> Love,love,love it!, like no other leave-in conditioner. My ends are much fuller and no split ends! Love it!!</li>
    <li> This product is a must have for anyone with unruly, curly hair that tends to frizz.  I paired this with a new CHI flat iron and had salon straight results.  Very impressive for my hair which is very difficult to straighten and look smooth/silky.  My hair dresser used it on my one time and I had to have it.  Works wonders.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair (half black/asian) and I was looking for a good product. After reading reviews on this one, I decided to try it out. Straight to the point, it works. You can really tell the difference when I straighten my hair. It usually looks dry and brittle, but this time around it was very healthy looking and soft to the touch. Also has a good smell :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this product off Amazon; I received a small bottle from my mom as a gift and I liked it so much she got me the super huge-ass bottle for Christmas as well as the huge-ass bottles of the moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Anyway, I use this when I&#x27;m feeling lazy and don&#x27;t want to condition my hair in the shower, it&#x27;s basically Perfect 10 moisturizing conditioner that&#x27;s been thinned out. If you spray on even a little too much your hair will end up a greasy-nasty mess. Why? Imagine not thoroughly rinsing out your in-shower conditioner and then letting your hair dry (either naturally or mechanically), it&#x27;s not going to feel good or look good. You&#x27;re going to look like a hot mess with your hair all stuck to your scalp and feeling heavy. I gave the product 4 stars because there&#x27;s a learning curve and because it&#x27;s in-shower conditioner that&#x27;s been thinned out a little and repackaged. I love it for what it is and that it can get me out of the shower faster when I&#x27;m in a rush, like between work and school.  Oh, and I haven&#x27;t found this to be any kinda miracle product, I use hair dryers, flat irons, bleach and hairdye so using this product and not changing the way care for my hair is like taking diet pills and not exercising and eating right, lol.</li>
    <li> I have platinum blonde, high lift bleached hair - from naturally dark brown - so you know my hair is highly damaged, weak, and rough.  This stuff is a life saver.  I use it every time I wash my hair then comb it through and it leaves my hair soft, silky, and manageable.  Without it, running my fingers through my hair would be difficult, no joke!  This is a staple in my bathroom, luggage, etc.  I don&#x27;t even travel without it!</li>
    <li> I have thin, baby fine hair and I keep this stuff.  It gives a little body.  I typically use it alone without mousse, gels or other products which in combination would weigh down my hair.  I have used this brand for many years.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair unless I also used another leave in product. The combination of frequent coloring and hard well water is difficult to overcome. This product isn&#x27;t the answer for me.</li>
    <li> i have had very curly, poofy, and unmanageable hair all my life. This product worked wonders. It makes it very easy to do my hair and makes it very smooth. My hair looked 10 times better after 3 days of using it. Highly reccomened.</li>
    <li> I gave this a shot, but it doesn&#x27;t seem all that great (like the ads).  Tried it a few times and maybe It added some moisture, but my hair was just as frizzy and horrible looking an hour or two later after blow drying.  I have thick very long dry hair that gets frizzy, and not only did it get frizzy but it sort of &amp;#34;blew up&amp;#34; and got BIG too.  The opposite of what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Not good, left my hair fluffy and frizzy</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Use it with It&#x27;s a 10 miracle shine spray...it&#x27;s really work. It&#x27;s a 10 miracle hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;Great results. Hair looks really shiny and healthy. I love my hair with this product now!</li>
    <li> Words cannot describe how much I loved this product! It came much earlier than the expected date. I apply it after I shower and it does an amazing job detangling my hair :) Love this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  Makes my 4C hair manageable, soft, and keeps the frizz down to a minimum.  The detangling potential is good and the fragrance is really nice.  The cost is in line with what the product delivers.  I am pleased with the results, texture of the product, consistency, smell.</li>
    <li> was hesitant to try this since my hair is straight and thin but it makes my hair soft and shiny all the time. I love it, definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Awesome for my hair and so much cheaper than through the store!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve bought it twice and will keep buying it</li>
    <li> Works great!! Love it❤️</li>
    <li> I have very curly blonde long hair. Its naturally blonde, but 2 or 3 times a year I get it highlighted. I&#x27;m trying to grow it out so I&#x27;m skipping trims (which I know I shouldn&#x27;t do) and I&#x27;ve got split ends. I also used to straighten my hair like crazy, but have stopped, so I&#x27;ve got healthy roots, but super dry and damaged ends that break and split. Not to mention I had a new hairdresser who over processes my hair and made is straw-like in my top layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I figured with the stellar reviews and great things I&#x27;ve heard about its a 10, it could be close to a miracle leave in conditioner. Well... It didn&#x27;t really help.. I&#x27;m so disappointed. It smells insanely good, but it just didn&#x27;t help my dry hair. It&#x27;s kind of heavy and makes my hair feel like I&#x27;ve got wax in it almost. I&#x27;m not sure how else to describe that. I&#x27;m not using too much or too little since I&#x27;ve experimented and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually feel like when I do heat treat my hair, that&#x27;s when it makes my hair feel soft and healthy. So I use this to either scent my hair or when I straight it or curl it. For the money though, I&#x27;d rather spend my money in something else that&#x27;s just as good or better. For example, I love bed head and I feel they do a better job for less money and a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner works great for my dry frizzy hair. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just plain amazing. This, plus their miracle shampoo plus keratin &#x3D; perfect hair.</li>
    <li> I have ugly natural curls that my make my hair very frizzy - in all weathers, whether dry or humid. Recently, I got a digital perm hoping my frizzy hair woudl calm down a bit, but the curls from the perm actually made it worse. So, i bought few &amp;#34;anti frizz&amp;#34; hair products, and none of them really worked. Thus, I had to try to this product since it received so many 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I received the product, I washed my hair and sprayed all over my hair after towel dry. At first, my hair felt nice and it was also bringing out my curls from the perm. I didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair since I wanted to see how my hair would react as it was drying naturally. Well... I&#x27;m not sure if I sprayed too much, but as my hair was drying, I couldn&#x27;t even stroke through my hair with my fingers. It didn&#x27;t look gross but felt gross as if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the spray did calmed the frizziness, and it was the best one out of all the products I tried. However, as aforementioned, it did&#x27;t leave my shinny nor soft. Maybe I&#x27;ll spray less next time and see if that&#x27;ll make any difference.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product</li>
    <li> Great stuff but cannot be used every day.  Hair feels silky soft but will have little body.  I use once in awhile when my hair feels very dry an brittle.</li>
    <li> this was recommended to me and i read and saw so many reviews on it but it just didn&#x27;t work for me, and i&#x27;ve gone through more than half the bottle. it smells amazing! but I felt as if it dried out my hair. way to expensive for such a little product</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner detangles my hair and that&#x27;s what I bought it for.  I was at a point where I could hardly get a brush through my hair when it was wet.  This product has been super helpful and makes my hair feel and look healthier, softer.</li>
    <li> My hair no longer falls out and I can see less of hair on the bathroom floor. Highly highly recommended</li>
    <li> For the price you are paying, this product is really worth the money. I read many reviews about this product elsewhere and this is one of the top products to keep your hair moisturized. I had a problem with static in my hair and decided to get this about two months ago, surprisingly it works very well and I rarely ever have static in my hair. The leave-in conditioner does not clump or look greasy in your hair if you spray it in wet hair. I never really spray it in my dry hair. As for the scent, it just kind of smells like hair product, but it&#x27;s definitely not an unpleasant scent. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a leave-in condition, especially at the value and price offered. However, I would prefer to get a larger size since it does run out in a reasonable amount of time, maybe 1-2 months. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> i really liked the body that it gave my hair,but I would have liked a little more shine.Iwould definite use the product again&lt;br /&gt;just for all the body it gave it.</li>
    <li> My children have long thick hair and use this product daily with a chi iron to help it be more manageable and shiny. They love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, it&#x27;s a 10 Leave-In Conditioner Plus Keratin. I have ordered this before and it gives my hair a lot of body and curls. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> one of the best hair products I have used in a long time.  A little goes a long way. It actually makes my hair soft and shiny - no frizz</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not a 10, makes my hair flat</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with the It&#x27;s a 10 conditioner and shampoo.  These products do wonders for my very dry, frizzy, curly hair. They tame the curls, give it shine, and hydrate my hair.</li>
    <li> Its a 10...this should be nicknamed hair crack cuz im totally addicted and i simply cannot do with out it...cuz its makes my hair feel sooo good!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Use it with It&#x27;s a 10 miracle shine spray with noni oil and It&#x27;s a 10 miracle hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;Great results. Hair looks really shiny and healthy. Will cut your drying time in half.</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner spray.  I use them daily. They work wonderfully for my long hair, which I have colored regularly.  I would certainly recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair product! it goes on lightly and evenly, leaving my thick brittle course hair feeling soft and silky. i have never used another product that has shown results as quickly as this one :) i absolutely love it and will uses nothing else</li>
    <li> I use this after using the 10 minute miracle shampoo.  It seems to protect hair and the more I use it, it seems to improve the texture of my hair.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works very well and easy to use-looking forward to using other products made in this line. My hair looks better</li>
    <li> My hair is colored treated, wavy, frizzy and fried. I straighten my hair daily to make it more manageable. I have been using this product for 3 weeks. My hair is absolutely silky, shiny and healthy. I live in Florida and with the humidity at 300000000000% my hair maintains it&#x27;s style. I have shoulder length hair and apply 4 spritz into the palm of my hands and massage throughout and dry as usual. Then I will apply a little to the ends just before straightening. This product has also cut my styling time almost in half. Gotta love that!</li>
    <li> Please with product ..</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for four years at this point. I love it and it is a staple item in my haircare routine. I do notice that if I am using a keratin builder as a treatment, I prefer to use an oil over this it&#x27;s a 10 because too much keratin makes hair feel dry and stiff. just a tip ;)</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me as an alternative to what I had previously been using.  I decided to try it and am so glad I did!  I would definitely recommend it to someone wanting to make their hair more manageable after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff and is great for shaving lotion or shampoo - the new thing is to use conditioner for shampoo - to keep your hair its healthiest - I wash with this for 4 or 5 days and then use a non-sulfate shampoo.  This is working super and I have oily hair and very thin hair - my hair is more lively and shinier - and this is still cheaper here by the ounce than at the local Walmart hair salons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the regular &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave in Product&#x27; but I was recently shopping on Amazon for it and I noticed the &#x27;Plus Keratin&#x27;. At the beauty supply stores and hair salons these are very epensive, so I was hoping to find it for at least a little bit less on Amazon. &#x27;Keratin Plus&#x27; Miracle Leave in Product is great!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair and lots of it although each strand is on the thin side (not coarse) and it&#x27;s a pain to brush out the tangles usually after the shower, but with this product I get so many things! First I spray it a couple times on each side of my wet hair and it makes it a lot easier to brush out the little tangles with a comb. Second, following a blowdry it leaves my hair beautiful, not frizzy and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down! It smells great. Important: no need to overspray with this because a little goes a long way as long as you comb it well and distribute it throughout your hair. Also, I dln&#x27;t use this on the top of my head where my roots are because I don&#x27;t need it there - I imagine if I did iy would look too shiny or moist and might give off the appearance of unfresh hair - maybe this is only true for my type of hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this Product. I&#x27;ve been using it for sometime now. It works really well on my fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is great for damaged hair. I have played so many games and have done so many bad things to my hair. It&#x27;s a ten is sold in Walmart hair salon and it&#x27;s rather pricey. Amazon has a good price for the same quality product.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product because it&#x27;s really nice. I started using this after my hairdresser used it in the salon and I really love how it makes my hair feel. After shampooing, you just spray on your hair and comb it through. Then you blow dry and your hair feels really good and smooth. It&#x27;s a 10 is just one of those products that helps in the daily maintenance of your hair, especially if you blow dry and use a flat iron all the time like I do. I&#x27;ll keep using it and suggest you give it a try too.</li>
    <li> smells great and leaves the hair soft</li>
    <li> Makes my hair wonderfully soft.</li>
    <li> I love this! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like there is heavy product. I&#x27;ll buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> I actually wear a full lace human hair wig for medical reasons. In between regular keratin treatments I&#x27;ve been using this to keep my hair shiny and friz free. Plus I love the smell. Good product.</li>
    <li> I use this after every time I wash my hair. It smells great and works great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively thin/fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl ever-for reference. I was noticing that as it is growing out, it&#x27;s not as healthy as it was when I was younger. This is a great addition to my beauty routine and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair. The hair I DO have is moderately frizzy...no fun.  All of the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle products with Keratin work so well on my hair and DO NOT weigh it down.  This is seriously great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Wow . Two sprays on your hands after shampooing, rub them together then thru your hair,  let it dry and your hair will be so soft , silky and shiny. It is a Superb product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE It&#x27;s A 10 Leave In Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought It&#x27;s A 10 Leave-In Conditioner because I had actually ran out and could not afford to spend the $20ish that it would cost at my local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly and thick hair and it&#x27;s almost impossible to brush without this leave in conditioner. I also love that it&#x27;s not just a leave in conditioner but it&#x27;s also heat resistant since I straighten my hair on a pretty regular basis. This is one of those leave in conditioners that I CANNOT live without!</li>
    <li> I would give this product one thousand stars if I could. My hair WAS fine, oily, thin and and had dry ends. I cannot believe how it looks now. I have been using the shampoo and leave -in for a little over two months. I used all these expensive brands sold in high end salons and this is the best EVER.</li>
    <li> In the past year I have gone through a \\&quot;re-inventing myself\\&quot; phase...I guess I missed the bus when I was 15, and at 26 I just wanted to give myself a totally new crazy look. I naturally have very dark thick wavy hair. I chopped it all off, then bleached it to platinum. I LOVED how I looked, very old school hollywood glam, but the maintenance on my hair was ridiculous and I was moving out of the states and didnt want to deal with bleaching my roots every few weeks so I dyed it BACK to dark brunette. Needless to say my hair is one hot mess. It&#x27;s sad...I had such incredible hair and I didnt realize it...I&#x27;ll get back to that point one day, but as for now I am working at a job where I am in the hot Bahama sun all day and in salt water. My hair has reached its limit and I feel so bad for it. One of my friends back in the states sent me a bottle of this stuff, and holy cow!!!!!!!!!! With ONE use I can actually run my fingers through my hair after drying it. I am blown away.I cannot wait to see how using this product continuously will effect my hair for the better! I dont have poofy dry clown hair, it is smooth, straight, and touchable for the first time in almost 5 months. SO HAPPY WITH IT&#x27;S A 10 with Keratin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (and people are complaining about the smell...I rather enjoy it! If you want a nasty smell on your hair use Elnet hairspray...eck)</li>
    <li> I thought that this product would help my curly dry hair but I didn&#x27;t feel that it did much for me. I have very difficult hair and I can&#x27;t use most products. This one did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I hate to use a lot of product in my hair, especially hair spray.  But I have trouble with out-of-control &amp;#34;cowlicks&amp;#34; and this seems to keep them in place without being sticky or stiff.  I also love the shine!</li>
    <li> Great product to tame my hair. My hair has highlights and after every color touch up, it gets rough and dry. My sister uses this product and told me about it. I found it here on Amazon so I bought it. It works great.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.  SHIPMENT WAS FAST, BUT PRODUCT DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS.</li>
    <li> Great for tangles on sensitive heads!  My daughter has hard to comb out tangles.  It&#x27;s a 10 leaves it shiny and smells good too!</li>
    <li> I have dry brittle hair and was looking for a good leave in conditioner, heard this product was rated number one, so I purchased based on the positive reviews. I sprayed, and sprayed, and sprayed, no changes,  when will I have results? Very disappointed. Will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> Heard about it from Hoda Kotbe on TV.  I have over processed, distressed, blonde hair.  This conditioner smells &amp; feels wonderful. It left my hair feeling tamed, nourished &amp; feeling like silk.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner in the winter, and it completely gets rid of static, which is a problem for me.  I also have hair that tangles easily and Miracle 10 makes my hair MUCH easier to comb.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Awesome! It leaves your hair soft an tangle free. I can&#x27;t wait to try the shampoo too!</li>
    <li> How am i supposed to spray this if it is a cream?? is this an original product??&lt;br /&gt;Anyway i applied the spray or cream or whatever it is supposed to be, and same frizz..&lt;br /&gt;Gonna give it more tries to see if it is a long-term thing.</li>
    <li> I usually order the original product and this is the first time I order it with keratin.  It works and smells great.  Will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  been using It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner for several months now and have experienced growth in the length of my hair that I wasn&#x27;t able to get before. My hair is naturally curly and the ends have a tendency to break, but because of this my ends are stronger and do not break like before. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this product, I suggest buying it. Your hair will love you for it!</li>
    <li> Since I love It&#x27;s a 10 volumizer, I decided to try Its a 10 Miracle leave-In plus Keratin. I like the other product much better for my hair. If you have thick to normal hair - which my daughter has, then it may be for you. If you have thin and fine hair, this product weighs it down and it gets greasy after one day - give It&#x27;s a 10 volumizer a try first.</li>
    <li> This, is seriously a miracle in a bottle. I got the 4oz bottle which isn&#x27;t as big as my other leave in conditioners, but it certainly lasts. It smells just like my salon does and it makes my hair super nice. I got this delivered November 7th and instantly used it, The fourth day of using it I certainly noticed a difference. My hair was easier to comb and it wasn&#x27;t as frayed looking. The second week of using it my hair felt like I had never turned it from black to blonde which was a HARSH experience for both my hair and myself. My hair has improved dramatically. Before it was so dry I couldn&#x27;t even put it in a regular pony tail in fear my hair would snap, now when I put it up to wash my face the hair tie slides right out of my hair. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone bleaching or stripping their hair to restore it. I still had to trim my split ends, but i still use this everyday. I love it</li>
    <li> This product is for anyone with stubborn hair that is hard to brush. It smells great and left my hair shiny and fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have used many hair products on my extensions, this one works pretty good  . I still use some type of an oil product along with it  Otherwise I have to reapply at night and day or at least every morning.  Probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> My purchase came with a free sample of the shampoo which I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out.  This is an awesome leave in.  Makes my hair smooth but not greasy.</li>
    <li> Product works almost instantly detangling hair</li>
    <li> This is my go to product for reviving my hair. I&#x27;d consider my hair type to be thick, with some curl, dry, and damaged from previously being a blonde. This is one of the only products that I&#x27;ve considered a &amp;#34;miracle worker&amp;#34; out of the many hair products I&#x27;ve tried throughout the years. It takes away any sign of frizz, and gives hair a healthy shine. It only requires a small amount per a use or otherwise your hair could look greasy like any other leave in hair product. I find this great because a bottle lasts a very long time. I&#x27;ve even managed to get my mom hooked on this stuff! I also use it in my daughters hair who have more coarse curly hair than I do and it works wonders. I know it sometimes doesn&#x27;t work well for people with thin hair as it weighs it down, but I&#x27;ve never had that problem given my hair type.</li>
    <li> I like the regular It&#x27;s a 10, but this with the Keratin, I did not like.  Made my hair feel greasy. I threw it away and went back to the regular It&#x27;s A 10</li>
    <li> I was not impressed at all! After hearing and reading so many rave reviews about this product I thought I would try it. I was expecting something fabulous to happen to my hair. I used the entire bottle just to give it a fair chance, but the results were minimal. It actually made my hair more dull. It was almost like there was a film on my hair. It also made my hair impossible to straighten and it took forever to dry. I really feel like it dried my hair out and left it looking and feeling more damaged. Previously to using this I had been a faithful user of Ojon products. I have since went back to Ojon and will never switch again.</li>
    <li> I found out about It&#x27;s a 10 at my hair salon.  Purchased the original and absolutely love it.  My hair is shiny, soft, silky smooth with BODY.  However, I recently tried the Plus Keratin conditioner.  I love it except FOR THE HORRID PERFUMY SCENT.  It makes my nose burn.  It&#x27;s is very strong and smells like cheap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product but I cannot use it until they release an unscented version.  I&#x27;m very upset about this because It&#x27;s a 10 is not cheap.</li>
    <li> good product,  not sure if you&#x27;re suppose to leave this in after regular conditioner or not, as in using both, but I did and found it to keep my hair moist and not dried out....</li>
    <li> Oh. MY. Goodness. This product is like magic. I just used it after using the matching deep conditioner over night and its transformed my hair. I never had the need to right a review until now. I press my hair regularly so my hair does&#x27;t revert back to natural anymore, its kinda like i got a relaxer. With this, my hair breaks easily so i need to take super good care of it. Recently i stared swimming again and i needed to find good products for my hair so i found this on amazon and then found it at a store and bought it there because i didn&#x27;t have time to wait for it to be deliver. When i put it in my hair it and left it there for a while in plats and then took one out, my hair wasn&#x27;t breaking a little bit and it was bouncy and it looked like i had just  flat ironed it then curled it! This is the stuff! I will be buying it over and over again!</li>
    <li> I have peruvian 26&#x27;&#x27; weave and its very puffy and wavy i Used this and flat ironed my hair and my hair is gorgeous and very straight I was extremely shocked I love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s A 10 Leave-In Conditioner like all other It&#x27;s A 10 products I use does all it claims to do.  How refreshing!</li>
    <li> It does make your hair more manageable. But it a have very strong smell ( not a bad one ) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for ppl who have allargies But a good thing is that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily.</li>
    <li> this thing is really amazing, i have a really oily hair, when i do curling my hair its gose down very quiq, but when i used the product it protect my hair also the smell is amazing, and the curls looks very natural and shiny in very beautiful healthy way. i&#x27;ll for sure buy it again.</li>
    <li> It works great and leaves your hair feeling nice and soft. I would use it with another conditioner if your hair is really try.</li>
    <li> I really do love this product and really glad that I found it for such a good price, will be buying again from amazon. It makes my hair feel so soft and look shiny its a must have!</li>
    <li> same one in the salon, makes my hair smoth, and managable and it has karatin in it it and half th price</li>
    <li> I have long,dry, curly hair and it gets all knotted up. It is slowly beginning to dread. Tried this product and it didn&#x27;t help detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff!!! Made my nappy curly and unruly hair so sleek and soft. Perfect for detangling and conditioning hair!</li>
    <li> I purchased It&#x27;s A Ten Conditioner Plus Keratin from My Beauty Center. Thanks for the fast delivery. I accidently ordered this size, 4 Ounce by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I normally order the 10 ounce size.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s very pricey for what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I do like this product for my hair as it&#x27;s a great hair product.&lt;br /&gt;Having thick long hair, I would advise to purchase the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon too.&lt;br /&gt;If this helps you, please like my comment. ☺</li>
    <li> I use this stuff all the time now!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never felt my hair feel so healthy and soft until I used this.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on tv recently. I color my own hair and it was very dry and damaged. I went to the stylist and made an appointment to have her color it from now on but needed something to fix my hair so I did not have to cut it. This product made my hair like silk again. I am so happy. It is easy to use and the results are miraculous. It takes very little and works so great. If your hair is dry or dull or colored, get it!  It is great.</li>
    <li> I got this for my curly hair!!!  It is an amazing product that my stylist used on my dry hair before she straightened it.. it isn&#x27;t greasy nor does it weigh the hair down.. so you have no frizz curl.. or nice smooth and straight locks.. I have recommended it to several family members and friends</li>
    <li> I have non colored dirty-blonde normal hair with my hair varying day to day from a little dry and frizzy to a little oily. I started using this product about three weeks ago and my hair has become much more predictable! My hair is not dry at all and doesn&#x27;t get oily as easily. I have noticed I am getting much more compliments on my hair too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start by washing my hair and conditioning like normal. I squeeze any extra water out of my hair when stepping out of the shower and instead of physically towel drying my hair I just wrap it up in a towel as I&#x27;m getting dressed. Then I&#x27;ll simply spray the It&#x27;s a 10 all over my hair and brush it through and let my hair air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes it so easy to comb through and works great as a detangler. After my hair is dry it looks great and full of life! It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and feels like it&#x27;s helping my hair grow as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product. This might sound like something off of an infomercial but don&#x27;t assume that. This product is &amp;#34;right out of the salon&amp;#34; good and even though it is a bit expensive I think it is truly worth it if one of your top priorities is beautiful long and healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Best thing every has done wonders for my hair</li>
    <li> no big difference for my damage hair</li>
    <li> Works wonders and its so inexpensive! I was so surprised because the packaging and price led me to believe it would be sub par but in fact it is excellent!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I noticed an immediate difference the first time I applied it. My hair is very frizzy and can get quite dry because of the climate I live in.  This tamed down the frizz, made my hair softer, and made it appear shinier without weighing it down or making it feel greasy. I was a little hesitant about this because of the price but after using it I already plan to get the bigger size once I run out.</li>
    <li> Because I love this conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it for several years and am sold on it. A definite 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this spray! I have thin hair that can become oily easily and have to wash it everyday. I was concerned this would make my hair more oily and weigh it down, but it didn&#x27;t at all! My hair feels softer and is much more manageable. Definitely protecting my hair from heat and my ends are looking great much longer after a trim. The scent is pleasant, but what is great is that it does not linger, as I can be sensitive if something is too fragrant. I am already on my second bottle and turned my mother in law into a fan as well. Recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product except it needs to be diluted a bit.  When the bottle was half empty I poured water to fill and mix it up and it working better.  I cannot say that it provides the shine it says it does.  It is a good product and it smells really nice</li>
    <li> I have very thick coarse hair and It&#x27;s a 10 works wonders on it! I love it and will probably always use it. It works great right after I shower and before I comb my hair. I feel like it has made it softer and much easier to manage.</li>
    <li> I like it. Its very good. I apply it after washing my hair. Hair becomes soft and its very easy to comb it. I have been using it for 1 week only, but I am really satisfied.</li>
    <li> I asked her how she liked it and she said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10!&amp;#34;  Her hair has slight frizziness to it and this calms it down and makes it smell FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> I got this after my hairdresser used it when styling my hair after a highlight.  I have fine thin hair and also color my hair.  So my hair dries out from the coloring along with blowdrying and some flat ironing and/or curling a couple times a week.  It&#x27;s been hard to find the right combo that will make my hair feeling soft, look healthy, and yet not weigh down my fine hair.  This leave-in is perfect.  I spray on the ends after I wash my hair (I use pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner).  Then I comb through the hair, let air dry a bit, and then I&#x27;ll spray a volumizer on the roots before styling.</li>
    <li> Best Leave in conditioner and great price</li>
    <li> I Love this product. It&#x27;s great FOR your hair. It always leaves my hair feeling silky smooth, but don&#x27;t put TOO much or you will just have greasy hair by the end of blow drying it. just a few sprays and your good. TRUST ME.</li>
    <li> I usually use the Extreme Snap from Redken and use this one for a change.  I prefer the Redken, makes my hair softer.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a good product, but I have very fine hair with no body; so this product seemed to weigh my hair down enough that I had even less body. It would be good for thicker, damaged hair. I&#x27;ve tried it using just small amounts (I think I used too much the first times), but it still doesn&#x27;t help with volume and body.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it&#x27;s around $25.00 in the stores, more than I like to pay. It works great for me, I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
    <li> As a hair dresser this product is superior. In the past I used PPT by Redkin leave in  then Redkin decided to discontinue it.  I searched and searched and couldn&#x27;t locate a product leave in with Keratin and luckily this product 10 became  available and I&#x27;m convinced it leaves the hair lustrous healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your pro-active research in this product development!</li>
    <li> this product was highly recommended by my beautician for reconstructive damaged hair.  Price was far better than her salon offered.</li>
    <li> I had long wanted to try this product, widely used in salons, This small size, reasonably priced, gave me the chance to do it. Just a small amount applied after shampooing leaves my hair much more manageable and easy to style. I have already recommended the product to several friends.</li>
    <li> I love the product and I will order some more I like the smell and it works my hair is growing</li>
    <li> Whether I let my hair stay curly, or style it straight, it always helps either way. I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I think I like the original better than the keratin. Still a great product none the less.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair soft and shiny. I used it every day I blow dry my hair and use a flat iron. I have a small bottle for travel and a big one for home.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair so I go through this faster then I would like - but it leaves my hair sooo soft. People ask me what I put in my hair to make it so shiny, I kept this my little secret. :)</li>
    <li> after spraying this in my hair and combing it through while still wet i used a blow dryer to dry my hair...i noticed my bangs where sticky for a little while after drying them, but that stickiness went away...i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because i did a very good job of drying out my hair or because i have a good finishing brush...i read a previous review that said this product left the the hair sticky so i just wanted to let everyone know my experience with it</li>
    <li> Cheaper than buying in a store.  I love this product for getting out tangles before combing my wet hair. My sister in law uses it on my 2 YO niece too.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I will probably order this again when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> 2nd bottle! great product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally a bit dry, My hair does look and feel softer and shinny when applied.</li>
    <li> Why is it when we cone here forsomething cheap we get dissapointed no one wants to be upset we come here for cheap not oh I wasted my money</li>
    <li> ...but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it on a regular basis; too expensive.  So, if curls are looking raggedy at the ends, I&#x27;ll spritz some on them to calm them down...less wild look, but no where near the taming I was hoping for the price.  Perhaps the heavy duty, timed conditioner would give a better result.</li>
    <li> It softens my hair instantly. Sometimes I like to try to extend my relaxer so my hair can get nappy. I used this and was able to comb through my hair. I blow dried it and did not have to flat iron my hair. It is not sticky nor did my hair feel weighed down.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews, but I&#x27;m seeing some great results after 2 weeks of use with this product. I&#x27;ve been having a problem with my hair falling out due to a thyroid problem and I haven&#x27;t found anything that has come close to relieving this problem. After 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a thicker feel to my hair, it&#x27;s softer and I&#x27;ve noticed less hair coming out. If this continues I may just recover some of my hair and also keep from losing anymore. Very grateful for this great product!</li>
    <li> It seems like water. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t work for me. Nevertheless it has some many good reviews, that maybe it&#x27;s my hair.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner has never let me down. I really like it and the fact that it has a bit of keratin leaves your hair looking a bit more healthier. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I have never been a fan of the price but the quality is pretty good. Recently I have started using CHI leave in conditioner also infused with Keratin and I have come to like it a bit more that this product. Especially since CHI although a similar price has more ounces and the end results are great. Just like this product it eliminates frizz and it leaves your hair really soft.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product from my hairdresser in response to a problem I was having with dry, flyaway hair, and I think it has really helped solve my problem. I also began using a hair oil, as well. It&#x27;s been an unbeatable combination!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but the spray bottle did not work! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have to open the bottle take out the stuff n apply to hair..such a hassle.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle I buy, the hair is soft, manageable and easy to comb. Problems whit end dry disappears. Give a bottle to my sister and she loves it. I recommend it widely.</li>
    <li> This is such a small container. But I really iike this product. My daughter has crazy hair in the morning and this has helped to tame it.I think next time i will get a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I really hate the smell and sometimes it makes my hair feel sticky after applying it. But i&#x27;ve recently had my hair ombre&#x27;d and its keeping my hair looking healthy. DO NOT USE ON VIRGIN HAIR!!! I used to have virgin hair before getting it done and the product gave me MORE split ends. If you have never done anything to your hair and you rarely every style it, but the It&#x27;s a 10 WITHOUT keratin. Too much keratin for your hair is a bad thing, trust me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a 10. I like it.</li>
    <li> This products is awesome. I love the smell....</li>
    <li> I believe the Keratin contribute to the dry feeling of my hair.  I will have to try the one without keratin.  I am natural (3c/4a).</li>
    <li> My hair dresser suggested this product, and I waited a while before I bought it. I sure wish I didn&#x27;t. It has made a huge difference in the health and strength in my hair. It no longer feels like it is all breaking off when I run my hands through it, which is nice ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Brings life to dull damaged hair. Smells great.</li>
    <li> This is the best product although a little pricy! It makes my hair sooo soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy! I prefer the keratin to the regular but have used both and they are great! They smell great too.</li>
    <li> leave hair a bit crunchy</li>
    <li> My hairstylist turned me on to this.  It protects my hair from styling tools &amp; makes it feel thicker.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best detangler ever!  love the curl shine and softness.  Cant tell the diff between keratin or non.  But both are great products</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel. My hair is thick, brittle, and frizzy, and this product makes it feel so much more manageable and smooth. I love the peace of mind that my hair is also being protected from heat styling tools. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> This lives in my gym bag for before and after swimming and for after all workouts to bridge the gap until I can get home and shower.  It gives my hair some extra help when it&#x27;s at its worst.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this to anyone. Smells amazing, husband loves smelling my hair when I put this on after a wash. Can be used everyday but I think it gets to sudsy if overused. Does not require a lot, a small amount goes a long way. I want the entire line!</li>
    <li> The Keritin leave in conditioner detangles and smooths my course curly frizzy hair.  I really feel like Im getting a great product with this purchase.  I&#x27;ve purchased a few extra to take to the beach so I can comb thru my hair while its sandy and salty.  Im sure it will work for that too.  Very impressed with this line.  First time buyer and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> My hair looks great after I use this leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this since a year, no complains so far regarding hair fall or frizziness.</li>
    <li> I expected a lot more given all the hype.  This stuff made my hair feel like I had fabric softener in it.  I didn&#x27;t care for the heavy feeling.  ...I ended up going back to Amazon to find another product because my hair was so fried and nothing helped to remoisturize it.  I ended up finding an amazing line called &amp;#34;Cowboy Magic&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s mainly used for show dogs lol, but man oh man is this stuff amazing. Buy the whole line--and if you are on a budget, at least get the detangler (and ideally the conditioner).  This stuff will change your hair!</li>
    <li> She has fine black hair so over washing tends to make it dry and brittle. This leave in conditioner was instantly noticeable, however we did want to note that this was a BRAND NEW product and it came broken. The spout doesn&#x27;t work so in order to use it she has to take the lid off and pour. This would have been a 4 star review but minus one for the defective container. Otherwise, pretty good product</li>
    <li> I have long, thick color treated hair so dry hair happens (but not at my scalp). This lovely potion keeps my hair soft and nourished without being oily and weighing my hair down. It smells good and a little goes a long way!! I have used this product for about 4 months and am just finishing up my first 4oz. bottle.</li>
    <li> The conditioner works I just was not very please with the scent. It also feels like more product is necessary to achieve any intended smooth and shininess.</li>
    <li> Very good so far I love it, I will definitely buy this product again and recomend it to my friends .</li>
    <li> I love this because I get perms in my hair and my hair gets very dry, I love it because it moisturizes my hair before my next perm and this price is great !</li>
    <li> It smells so good. Unlike the shampoo and conditioner you only need to use a small amount so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and makes your hair so soft, but 4 stars as it goes really quick. You can probably find an equally good product that will give more bang for your buck. It is really nice though</li>
    <li> Marrakesh is better, but this was good</li>
    <li> Kind disappointed - it made my hair too soft and i had trouble styling it. Maybe i misunderstood what it does - i was looking for less frizz and more volume. Less frizz, but it was more smooth than anything! I like body in my hair!</li>
    <li> fragrance too strong-make a fragrance free variety</li>
    <li> great product for hair!!!</li>
    <li> the best my sister loved it</li>
    <li> keeps hair strong and soft</li>
    <li> Smells great! I love this product because it makes my tangly hair so soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner when I use this product.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I&#x27;ve used this before and this is a lot cheaper than the salon price.</li>
    <li> the only effect this seemed to have on my hair was to make it more greasy looking.  Other than that, my hair was just as dry and frizzy as always.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do wonders for MY hair. ( black, thin, curly )</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this and it really is good for your hair but tends to be expensive.  Fast shipping , but amazon is always efficient</li>
    <li> Just started using this product last week.  I am very skeptical about leave-in conditioners because I have naturally oily hair.  However, my hair is colored and needs all the extra conditioning it can get.  This stuff is amazing!  My hair feels so soft and shiny, but also weightless.  I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Bought this because of the reviews, but it didn&#x27;t really do anything for my particular hair type.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work on my hair.  I hate the way it made my hair feel.  I actually started using tresemme keratin infused shampoo and conditioner and love it...along with the heat protection infused with keratin.</li>
    <li> Such a great product, helps to manage your hair and prevents split hair. Nice travel size and to carry in your make up bag.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, It makes my hair shiny and healthy, and protect it from the heat, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought the product with keratin instead of the regular stuff which is awesome.  This is meant for african american hair that&#x27;s been straightened with salon keratin treatments, and NOT for middle aged women with long fine-textured hair that&#x27;s been color treated.  It actually made my hair hard or &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; and my stylist asked me what I was using and I got a &amp;#34;NO! no no no no!&amp;#34; lecture.  So I guess this is less of a review of the product as it is a warning to be sure and buy the correct product for your hair.</li>
    <li> I have a long curly thick hair color treated hair  . It doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair after shower (aveeno leave in conditioner does). It&#x27; feels like ths is just a regulAr water .  I have been  using this for a month now and didn&#x27;t see any results . My hair looks like a big bulky frizzy head .</li>
    <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair.  It smells really nice and it has been leaving my hair EXTRA soft!  I&#x27;m a big fan of &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products and used the regular one as well, but when I saw they had one with keratin, I had to try it!  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love the smell!  &amp; the product is do light doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. For this price it&#x27;s worth it. I have very long thick frizzy hair and it&#x27;s the first product that worked on it.... Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and I have seen much improvement with my hair.  It can be a little pricey but its worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this leave-in conditioner as it makes my hair very feel very silky! This is perfect when you&#x27;re using a iron straightener as it makes your hair easier to manage and smoother.</li>
    <li> I use the product not sure if I can see the benefits yet, but it might take a while. I know 10 hair care is a good product. I will continue to use the product and I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Amazing! Love the smell as well!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair (which is a bit dry, and sometimes gets split ends). It made the hair easy to comb, and after drying left it feeling smooth and soft. The smell was good, too. I got a bottle to use at home, and so far got great results- the hair feels stronger and healthier. But don&#x27;t use too much, because that can make your hair feel sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leave-in works well if it is layered over other products, as well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the results I was hoping for with this product. I have really fine, natural wavy hair that I color and flat iron. Needless to say it takes a toll on how healthy hair will be. Although the product has helped some, I have not experienced the transformation I thought I&#x27;d get from reading some of the reviews before purchasing this product. Perhaps in my situation, my hair is too damaged to receive great results form this \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; .</li>
    <li> It is too creamy to spritz out of the pump. I had to remove the pump and dump it out onto the palm of my hand to apply. I used a third of the bottle to cover my thick, wavy, shoulder length hair. It doesn&#x27;t work any better than less expensive leave-in conditioning products.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, IT&#x27;S NOT WORKING FOR ME,WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS PRODUCT..VERY DISAPPOINTED...WOULD LOVE MY MONEY BACK..THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This one is a little too heavy feeling for my fine hair.  It would probably be better for those who have thicker, coarser hair. The one that works best for me doesn&#x27;t have the Keratin in it (pink cap).</li>
    <li> I want to wax lyrical about this product for a minute.  I have long, frizzy and wavy hair.  When I wash it, it turns into one big knot.  Since I started using this product, it untangles easily after washing it. I just spray this miracle stuff in, let it sit 30 seconds then brush right through my hair.  Where has this product been my whole life?</li>
    <li> Way too small of a container for a product that goes this fast. Little does not go a long way. I will continue to use as part of my rotation but not on the daily.</li>
    <li> Not a miracle but a pretty good product. Moisturizes without heaviness of product build up. I&#x27;d buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is way too heavy for my fine hair.  By the end of the day, I need to wash it to get some body.  If it worked for me, I would def buy it here though bec I have seen it at the store and hair salon for twice the price.</li>
    <li> My hair felt so much healthier.  This really works and smells good.  I am amazed that with one application you can feel and see the difference.</li>
    <li> Amazing - dont know how I lived without it! Great at detangling my long hair.</li>
    <li> i love this product. It&#x27;s great on dry or wet hair. I&#x27;ll put it in before blow drying and helps my hair look silky. I&#x27;ll also use a little on my dry hair to help with the fly aways. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this product now!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;m glad I was able to return.</li>
    <li> Great as a conditioner and detangler.  Worth the price.  Makes hair smooth .</li>
    <li> I honestly do not feel this does anything for my hair. I&#x27;ve used other products from this brand and am not easily convinced. It&#x27;s surprising that it has so many positive reviews. My next product would be the leave in conditioner mask. Hopefully this is better than their other products</li>
    <li> I bought this because so many people on youtube talk about it. I dont think its amazing. It leaves a weird feeling in the hands after you &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; it into the hair. Its not sticky, it doesnt feel smooth (on the hand) but a tiny bit tacky? I&#x27;ve only used it as a leave in treatment though.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this product.  It performs as quoted and it looks like we&#x27;ll be regular customers of it.</li>
    <li> This spray makes damaged, dried out hair feel silky and moisturized. I love using it after heat styling to make it feel touchable instead of fried again. Makes hair smooth and shiny. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have Hashimoto&#x27;s and my hair looks fried constantly even though I use no heating elements.  This really smooths out the texture and leaves my hair silky.</li>
    <li> I feel bad giving this a bad review because I am sure it really helps certain hair types. So I&#x27;ll give it a 4. I have like a wavy curl thing going on, and I just wanted to use this as sort of like a relaxer and shiner. It just made it lose my [borderline] fun wave sitch. Sadly that didn&#x27;t happen, but I think that&#x27;s just a cross I have to bear with my hair. So if you have unpredictably wave-y hair like me, then I don&#x27;t believe this little bottle is for you (but what do I know - I&#x27;m just a girl who takes joy in sporadically leaving reviews).</li>
    <li> Love this product. Does wonders for my hair. It arrived promptly. My hair feels fanatic after I use it! Love!</li>
    <li> Worth every dime!! I have shoulder length, thick, dry hair.  I spray this product on my hair when it&#x27;s damp and let it dry naturally!! I have never had such SOFT HAIR! BUY IT!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> First off, because its a spray its very prone to getting on things it shouldnt be on.  Prime among them your face.  While going through this bottle I noticed a pronounced increase in breakouts on my forehead and face. Yes, this could be a coincidence but I think not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this tends to leave a residue in your hair throughout the day.  This may not bother you, but I like my hair to feel natural with no weight or stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, both of these issues could be overlooked if it did what it was supposed to do. Unfortunately I was unable to see any improvement in my hair over the entire bottle.  Should I go through more than one bottle for results? Maybe, but im not willing to buy another because of the two major flaws mentioned.</li>
    <li> If your hair is dry and lifeless, this stuff is great. It really mended my split ends and made my hair look much healthier. I will continue to use this product and I will continue to buy from Amazon because their price is much better than in stores.</li>
    <li> I have long dark brown fine hair and it&#x27;s hard to find products that aren&#x27;t to heavy for my hair or leave it oily / sticky!  This product was perfect!!  I&#x27;m a stay at home mom of 2 young boys and don&#x27;t have time to give my hair the attention it sometimes needs.  With this product it looks healthier and most days all I have to do is blow dry it after using this product and do not even have to flat iron my hair.  I bought the 4oz just to try the product, but I will be ordering more and in the larger size b/c it is WORTH IT!!  I have already bought some for my mother-in-law who finished Chemo about 6 months ago and she is very pleased with how well it is working on her hair as well.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel very soft and smooth! I will order this again! My hair feels like it is a lot more healthy when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Really helps to strengthen my fine color-treated hair and does a great job at detangling too.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for my hair. I went on vacation recently and didn&#x27;t bring it (it&#x27;s 4oz, and I didn&#x27;t want to check a bag just for this product) and I could tell the first morning I didn&#x27;t use it! I have fine/thin hair and it gives me volume. Love this product! SMELLS AMAZING too!</li>
    <li> This item is great for your hair, I use it after I wash my hair and apply it to wet hair before I dry it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now. It makes my hair so soft. I have curly hair that I have chemically straigthened (CHI) I alternate this with the Chi Keratin and Biosilk Therapy 17 leave in Conditioner. The Biosilk makes it softer, so I switch them up.</li>
    <li> After all the reviews I had no doubt this would be a miracle! It didnt even occur to me it wouldnt work. Ive been using it for a week or two now. I dont think it conditions. It doesnt smell like anything. It doesnt soften or detange. I honstly feel like I got a bottle of WATER.</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever! Gets rid of all knots in hair, leaves hair silky smooth and hair smelling so good.</li>
    <li> One of the best leave-in conditioners I have used, this product makes my hair feel so silky and easy to comb through my crazy curly hair! Plus it smells sooo good. Will definitely be purchasing more and try out some other Its a 10 products! Also, great shipping :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. Fast shipping,  Thanks</li>
    <li> My hair in the past has always been very unmanageable because its frizzy, and curly, there has never been a product that worked for me until I purchased this one! I will be a forever customer :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! If you haven&#x27;t tried It&#x27;s a 10 you should give it a try. It makes your dry hair feel silky soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Its A 10 for years - and recently switched to the type with Keratin in it.  I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore.  3 sprays of this on my hand is enough to make my hair soft and healthy. And due to the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use much it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes your hair feel soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, and it smells so good. It has kind of a honeysuckle scent. After I bleached my hair it was so dry it was scary. After about six weeks of using this, it&#x27;s back to silky soft again.</li>
    <li> I have really dry damaged highlights. It&#x27;s really hard to get a comb through them, even after using a heavy conditioner. This is the only way I can brush my hair. Leaves my hair soft and smelling good. Doesn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
    <li> After the first time i used this i noticed significant results. I have damaged, dry/brittle hair thats hard to manage and this made my hair very soft and sleek. I did notice the stickyness alot of people talk about but i just silmply straightened through my hair a little and that made it not sticky anymore</li>
    <li> I love this product! It keeps the ends of my hair hydrated and my hair smelling great!</li>
    <li> Best Product!  Cheapest price I could find.</li>
    <li> Good product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> works pretty well but nothing special</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair stylist uses this on me and I kept asking her to pick me up one and I would pay her, but she kept forgetting. Finally I got some here and I&#x27;m so happy! This makes your hair feel so amazingly soft and gets rid of tangles fast! Plus it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Not a miracle conditioner but a great product. I recently started bleaching my hair, and after one mistake too many I did fry it a little (nothing serious but definitely left it dryer than normal for me) so I started using this. It smells great in my opinion but other members of my family have found the smell to be too strong if I spray it before they use the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;As far as functionality it does have a noticeable affect on my hair, it makes it lay smoother and feel softer after using it. Using too much can leave it greasy looking however so do be careful, and make sure to find your own sweet spot in how much to use.&lt;br /&gt;I once forgot to condition while in the shower after a really long day, and when I got my hair felt stiff, and squeaky.  I used this instead of hopping back in and it worked great - left my hair feeling just as good as the normal conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I use it every time I wash my hair.  Leaves it smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Too perfumy for me. Shipped to me quickly but didn&#x27;t care for this particular make of It&#x27;s a 10.  I prefer the one with the pink top.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser first told me about it. I was sceptical at first thinking they just want me to buy some expensive hair product. That was not the case, this stuff works! I can see a big difference on the days I forget to use it, which is very rare. My hair knots no matter what conditioner I use but with this stuff the brush goes right through.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice huge difference after I use it.  It&#x27;s possible that my expectation was a bit high after seeing all the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but i think I&#x27;m using too much of it and it leaves my hair stiff and hard to comb through, I used very little last time and my hair feels really soft and manageable, use sparingly</li>
    <li> I have been using these 10 Leave in conditioner for about three years. My hair is coarse, black, and hard to manage if I don&#x27;t apply this product after washing my hair. This is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever bought. I am very happy I can find it in Amazon for a better price.</li>
    <li> If you like soft silky hair buy this product. We&#x27;ve had a rough winter in N.Y., leaving the hair dry. My daughter, son and myself used this. Boy it changed our hair from a frizzy bomb to soft and manageable thanks.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but this is one of few products that will tame my thin, frizzy hair. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it&#x27;s tolerable and not too strong.</li>
    <li> I am a returning customer and I enjoy ordering from Deal Seekers. Shipments arrive always fast and they carefully wrap all items. Great service! The \\&quot;it&#x27;s a ten\\&quot; miracle leave in product (with or without keratin) has become my must-have hair product: it makes my hair softer and more manageable and it has stopped my hair from breaking. I can highly recommend this great product!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! Will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> So, having colored hair that is constantly being flat ironed over and over again, you could say it should be very damaged looking. Correct? Well NOT anymore!! I gave this stuff a go, along with its matching deep conditioning conditioner and shampoo (all plus Keratin) and WALA! Magic. I shampoo my hair every other day, it hardly ever gets greasy. I have thick and frizzy, EMBARRASSING hair. It looks good straightened, but doesn&#x27;t do well fresh out of the shower. I color it every 2 months, maybe 3, depending on the season. Flat iron everyday, blow dry on occasion. -This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;I use maybe a pump or two of the shampoo, ring my hair out with my hands, apply the conditioner, let it sit.. rinse out with cooler water.. Towel dry it and spray a few spritz on the ends and brush through. NEVER seen my hair looking better. Completely fixed my split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICEY, but... WORTH IT!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product  and the price is very reasonable compared to Ulta.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair became extremely dry, and brittle, with the winter weather. It helped not only moisturize my hair within the first use, but also my scalp. Worth the price tag, I&#x27;ll be continuing to buy this product a long with the shampoo, and conditioner set as well.</li>
    <li> favorite product...it&#x27;s the BEST</li>
    <li> I think it is really good and yes I would buy it a gen. thanks Linda</li>
    <li> This is helping to strengthen and improve my hair!</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner! My hair is recovering quicker that without the conditioner.</li>
    <li> My mom is a stylist and suggested this. Works great and great price!</li>
    <li> Good product, but not for my hair</li>
    <li> This is my favorite leave-in. It does everything it says. With this, you can achieve perfect, soft hair.</li>
    <li> I have chemically permed hair and this product was recommended to me by a hair dresser. It&#x27;s really amazing stuff. I just spray some on after I let my hair air dry for a few mins, and my locks are silky and smooth and frizz free! It&#x27;s pricey, but a little does go a long way. I&#x27;ve been on the search for a leave in treatment, and I think I&#x27;ll be using this one for a long time!</li>
    <li> The reason why I say \\&quot;amazing product\\&quot; but only give it a 4 is because it does help a lot to smooth and soften your hair but the smell goes off way too fast.&lt;br /&gt;I can really feel the amazing state of super soft and light of my hair after spraying this product, but the smell goes off after 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I would definitely recommend this leave-in conditioner to people but I would also hope the producer improves its fragrance time.</li>
    <li> It works really well. It does have a \\&quot;perm\\&quot; kinda smell at first, but it goes away pretty fast. I love it!</li>
    <li> I woke up one day around 12, 13 years old with what I affectionately call \\&quot;White girl fro\\&quot; hair. You&#x27;ve all seen one; a girl with huge, fluffy, often wavy, uncontrollable hair. Somewhere during the process of puberty my hair decided it was going to turn curly. Having always had soft, thick, straight hair I could not figure out why all of the sudden my blow dryer was my worst enemy; the harder I tried to tame the beast, the larger and more ferocious it grew. One day, my best friends mother, a curly hair victim herself, added some Redken gel to my wet hair, finger combed it and put it up in a towel. She told me not to even think about touching my hair dryer. An hour went by and when I took the towel off curls cascaded down my face. My &#x27;Ah-HA!&#x27; moment; I was trying to blow dry very fine textured, thick in quantity, frizz prone curly hair straight with no tools to do the job properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have tried EVERYthing under the sun. First the grocery store brands- Pantene Pro-V, Herbal Essences (can you say horrible RASH?), John Frieda Frizz Ease. Nothing worked to get my hair sleek and smooth. Then came cheaper salon brands: Bed-Head, Catwalk, Regis, Joico. Then came the really pricey stuff: K-Pak, Wen, Biolage. All were &#x27;okay&#x27; and helped my hair to look healthier, but still not smooth and controlled. I gave up, I was a chronic victim of Ponytail headaches, trapped in a world left without style and unable to partake in fun, new hairstyles. I bought a great flat iron, a step above Chi, even. That helped some but killed the one thing my hair had going for it- healthy looking and soft. Two kids and a broken thyroid later and it was now limp, thinning and dull as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter in It&#x27;s a 10. A friend of mine who is a stylist gave me the deep treatment conditioner and shampoo, as well as the Miracle leave in. It changed my hair. I no longer have to choose between crunchy, heavily gelled curls or broken, frizzy straightened hair. I can do either and my hair, with regular trims look gorgeous and smells even MORE gorgeous either way. Nothing can repair broken hair, hair is dead but this product keeps freshly trimmed locks healthy and prevents breakage and split ends unlike any other. I&#x27;ve even used Wen because I have such dry hair but even that pales in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen includes the following; Wash with Keratin shampoo, condition with Daily Keratin conditioner. I suggest the Keratin for people who colour or straighten their hair because it will improve elasticity and prevent styling breakage. Otherwise, the normal daily products work great. I then mist with the Keratin Miracle leave in. I do this every OTHER day. Before I style, on damp or dry hair I add THREE drops of the Miracle Argon Oil to my long, mid back length hair and work in well. If I am going curly I add it to wet hair, scrunch, two more sprays leave in and up in a towel. Soft, smooth curls will await you. If there&#x27;s some frizz a little more of each the oil and spray will tame that. On straight days I do the same routine, letting my hair towel dry as long as possible before blow drying with my fingers (again, less breakage and frizzing) and then flat iron adding extra oil as I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do NOT NEED TO SHAMPOO EVERY DAY. People with &#x27;oily&#x27; hair have oily hair because they&#x27;re over washing. It will take two weeks of letting it go three days or more without using shampoo but your scalp will adjust and stop over producing oil trying to overcompensate for over washing. Shampoo every 2-3 days and on non shampoo days simply \\&quot;wash\\&quot; your hair with the Daily conditioner. Work it through your hair thoroughly, rubbing the scalp. Rinse well for five minutes in COOL water. A little leave in at the length, not the scalp and your hair will thank you. Trust me, this WILL work after a few attempts. I know it feels weird and gross the first few times but that&#x27;s your scalp adjusting to not needing to make so much extra oil. The daily conditioner is gentle and light enough to be the perfect cleansing conditioner, just like Wen but BETTER! Deep condition once a week with one of your shampoo days and in a month you will have all new hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it can save mine, it WILL save yours! My thin spots are even growing new hair again because, well...my thyroid is now under control, but also because my scalp and it&#x27;s PH and hair follicles are all healthier. It&#x27;s worth the cost and easy to afford on Amazon, plus you need so little of everything. A full order of everything is about 80.00 and that last&#x27;s me 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product line EVER for ALL hair types!ntle and light enough to be the perfect cleansing conditioner, just like Wen but BETTER!

    <li> This product really does what it says.  My fly away hair has finally been tamed.  And it doesn&#x27;t take much product to do the job.</li>
    <li> Shipping: The shipping was good. I ordered this product on March 16th and got it on March 22nd. No damage to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product: This is $20 bucks down the drain. The reason why I got this leave in conditioner is because I am having huge problems with chlorine in my hair and this was highly recommended for that kind of problem. I spray it as directed and I think it makes it worse. It clumps my hair and leaves it dry with this nasty texture. I don&#x27;t recommend this, it&#x27;s overpriced and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I am really loving this product!</li>
    <li> Its Ok product. Argan oil works much better for any hair type though.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I have used it twice already and both time it made my hair feel softer and stronger!&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is that I didn&#x27;t receive it on time. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I explained it in another review on the It&#x27;s A 10 Shine Spray. I was not impressed with either product at all. It left my hair really dry and awful feeling.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Not too heavy.</li>
    <li> This is my new staple hair product. I have never had a leave in that left my relaxed hair feeling so amazing. I have coarse hair and my hair loves this stuff. Makes detangling, after washing, a breeze. When I air dry it&#x27;s not as frizzy. I love it. I also think this has helped with my hair breakage. Does everything it says it does on the back.</li>
    <li> my hair was DAMAGED so bad in october 2010...so i started using these products all the time. its been almost a year &amp; my hair is sooo healthy. i dont like to buy high priced beauty products but these are so worth it. if your hair needs help, buy these products &amp; have some patience &amp; your hair will be on the road to recovery within 6 months.</li>
    <li> Smell great.  So light and keeps my hair in great shape. I definitely want to try the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Really great product that leaves my hair feeling healthy and shiny. Also smells great. Will be stocking up on this and telling all of my friends about it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It really makes a difference in my hair and I LOVE IT!  Makes my hair feel much healthier!!</li>
    <li> Was recommend this item and gave it a try. really like this Leave in Keratin - Pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> Having read all the positive reviews, I was so excited to purchase this item.  However, this product made my hair extremely frizzy.  Perhaps it only works for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Cant get a better price anywhere my hairsylist reccomended it to me and I will never go a day without it. Leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> been useing for years really great for colored hair stops breakageusually buy in beauty shop cheaper  at amazonlast a long time.</li>
    <li> This little baby has been with me for 4 months, I use it daily, and I still have most of the bottle left. I have fine, wavy hair that loves to tangle. I have never had a product that works as well as this one and smells so great! You will not regret adding this product to your hair regiment. I use it as a leave in, a detangler, and also before I blow dry or straightener my hair. It really is a miracle product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first - I&#x27;ve used a lot of expensive products in the past from my salon - nothing that I thought worked enough to warrant the price I paid for the product.  So I purchased this thinking what the heck-it&#x27;s less then what I&#x27;ve paid for other products.  I shampooed and conditioned with my regular line I use (nothing fancy, tired of expensive stuff) and sprayed this on and OMG!! this is fabulous! My hair is gorgeous - feels soft, shiny and bouncy.  Really manageable.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! My hair feels much more healthy, shiny, and elastic (less breakage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the smell when initially used... however it really does go away almost immediately (as the product is absorbed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom ho has frizzy hair also tried it but wasn&#x27;t really a fan of it. Based on the reviews, it appears that it is a must for thin hair. I will not leave home without this! Thanks all for the reviews and convincing me to give this a try! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product but not as much as my hair does! Delivery was speedy received days before it was schedule to arrive. My hair would do the happy dance if it could.</li>
    <li> I have dry, relaxed hair and find it can be difficult to smooth out my hair even when it is straight. My hair is past my shoulders and has a slightly coarse texture, yet it tangles pretty easily whether I have a recent relaxer or not. I bought this because the stylist at the hair salon used it on my hair and it turned out amazing. I like that it is a heat protectant and has UV protection. I&#x27;ll admit, I liked this product and every time I washed my hair.  After a couple of months, it started feeling no better than any other leave-in I&#x27;ve used. It still smoothed my hair, but it just didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me like I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about this is the price; it&#x27;s too expensive in my opinion, especially considering the size of the bottle and the results weren&#x27;t that special. When it ran out, I decided not to repurchase it. I&#x27;m going to buy something less expensive and in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I had read other reviews stating the fragrance was strong and they were correct. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of hair and body products and never had a problem with any scents before. The odd thing about this product is that smells like a perfume you would spray on your body. It is very floral. I think the fragrance is designed to cover up an underlying chemical smell. The perfume is very strong and doesn&#x27;t dissipate for 4-6 hours. It felt like I&#x27;d gone to the perfume counter at Macys and sprayed a bunch of floral perfumes into my hair. Personally I prefer more subtle scents for hair products. This doesn&#x27;t make sense. I don&#x27;t think I can keep using it and would not recommend it to anyone who is sensitive to perfumes.</li>
    <li> The best leave-in treatment so far! Changed my hair routine drastically. I barely need to put anything else in my hair. Can&#x27;t wait to try other products by this company</li>
    <li> Love it, great product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two years now. I purchased it after a hair stylist used it on my hair while getting a cut. Even after shampooing and conditioning just before a cut, they have a hard time combing through it. It&#x27;s painful and it pulls out hair which is not good when it&#x27;s fine to begin with. The stylist sprayed just a few squirts and the comb went through like butter. My hair is fine, tangles very easy, and was dried and damaged from coloring and highlights. Even before coloring, when I was a child, it was impossible to comb through. My mother wouldn&#x27;t let me grow it out because she couldn&#x27;t comb it without me crying in pain. All my life, I&#x27;d pull out so much hair just trying to get the knots out. Now after I shower, I spray two to three squirts and what was impossible to comb through is knot free immediately. I am amazed by how great this stuff works!! And I love the smell. I can&#x27;t imagine how it could have any bad reviews. I know everyone is different, but for me I swear by it!! Some say it&#x27;s a little expensive, but you don&#x27;t need to shower in it. Just a few squirts is all I need and the bottle lasts forever. As I mentioned, it has been about two years of using this and only had to purchase two bottles so far. It really lasts a long time. As far as I am concerned, it&#x27;s a GREAT deal!!  I highly recommend this for anyone who has tangly hair or has children that do. I know I won&#x27;t live without it again!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! it smells great, it lasts a long time. I spray a few squirts on my hair after getting out of the shower and it makes my hair so smooth adn easy to get the tangles out of my thin hair. I wish I had known about this product sooner! It does wonders, and I am so happy I found it.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair silky and smooth. My hair is straight and fine and it does not get greasy with this spray.</li>
    <li> Meh. For close to $20, this conditioner was crap. It made my hair poufy, not sleek. I have course, wavy hair. I had heard this product would work to smooth it out bc of the keratin. I was really disappointed. Chi silk works so much better on my hair.</li>
    <li> WOW!  I love this stuff!  Most keratin products leaves my hair dry and weird feeling, but this stuff feeds my hair the protein it needs yet leaves my hair so soft and touchable.  I only use every other week and already I can tell my hair is not breaking off like before.  I still got it cheaper here than the beauty stores.  This is the only product from the Its A 10 line I will use.  Please continue to offer this for everyone who uses it!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff, and has a very pleasant fragrance. My hair feels great and more under control (less frizz) .</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair look like I came out from the Salon. It&#x27;s feel so soft. Love it, love it....&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a100%</li>
    <li> best hair product in 15 years of shopping</li>
    <li> No other leave-in conditioner leaves me hair as soft! It&#x27;s good for those who have gotten the keratin treatment in their hair to maintain it. I absolutely love it and will get the bigger bottle next time.</li>
    <li> Was not able to use this product because my hair rejects the extra proteins and makes my hair brittle. I don&#x27;t think it was the manufacturer&#x27;s fault, but I was not satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product... 1-2 sprays and it helps to reduce frizzy hair - especially good for fine, straight hair. Silky smooth volume. Great service too.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner it help make your hair healther.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My hair was always knotted and nappy, but with a few sprays of this, it&#x27;s easy to tame, and so shiny!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Price i worth it.</li>
    <li> Good value.  I bought this exact same bottle, same number of ounces, etc. at Target for twice the money.  Target just lost a customer when it comes to my hair products from this point on.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so soft and bouncy after use!!! I was so amazed when I used it the first time. I have relaxed hair. I also use semi permanent hair color and I could never get my hair to attain the softness I desired. This product has changed that for me. I haven&#x27;t tried the original without keratin, my hair absolutely loves this one. Some say that they have to dilute. I don&#x27;t. I need to purchase a larger size!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best leave-in conditioner I have every used, even though it is not for blondes. The store did not carry the blonde leave-in, so I used this as a substitute. It still works really well - great price, and arrived as described. I will order again unless I find the product for blondes.</li>
    <li> To me, after using the shampoo and deep conditioner, this product is simply an extra boost of healthy.</li>
    <li> From the very first day I ever used this product a noticed a huge difference int he texture of my hair. Definitely a holy grail product for me. I use the original formula and decided to try this one out. I see pretty much the same results. If you have course, thick, frizzy hair this stuff is for you!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It makes my hair easier to comb and it makes my hair feel healthy when it is on (have not noticed a permanent change though). It is just TOO, TOO EXPENSIVE to use as much as I need with long curly hair!!!</li>
    <li> ITEM OF EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT PRODUCT, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, ITEM REALLY WORKS GOOD, LOVE THE PRODUCT, ITEM LEAVES HAIR SOFT. A++++++</li>
    <li> I bought this spray for a little over 20$ after someone reccomended it for me. I have long hair down to my waist and it was dry and always so tangled i could not brush it at all. I do not have thick hair at all but any time i tried combing it my hair would just get pulled out. So after i used my awesome new organix keratin oil shampoo and conditioner and towell dried my hair i sprayed this product all over and for the first time in a long time i was able to comb my hair with out a problem. After my hair dried it was verrryyyy soft but not as silky as i hoped it would be. So i am going to look into buying the organix anti breakage serum that goes with the shampoo and conditioner and hopefully i will get the shiny silky hair i want. But i do recommend the its a 10 w/ keratin spray for those who have thick unmanagable hair. My hair is also very wavy and the spray alone made it pretty straight and it doesnt look weighed down at all it still has some volume to it.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do much for my difficult curly hair.  My hair is frizzy and fine, I have tried many products to make curls out of the frizz.  I had high hopes for this, and will continue to try different amounts and layering it with other products.  Maybe it just takes time?</li>
    <li> Felt a difference the very first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was brittle before, but this product fixed it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t notice much changes to my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave hair heavy or greasy which is very nice. Other than that, I don&#x27;t have much to say</li>
    <li> I glad I decided to purchase the leave-in plus Keratin conditioner. I had tried the shampoo and hair spray shine and liked both. This was the icing on the cake. I have been using all the products for a month and already see a difference in the health and beauty of my hair. I plan to take it to my salon for them to use on my hair. These products don&#x27;t strip the color out of your hair and that&#x27;s an added bonus.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was great as it detangles nicely.  But I noticed that my hair started to itch, my scalp too.  When I washed my hair the itch went away, so I can only assume it was the product that was causing the itch.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff. I used it and liked it too. Smells good. I was afraid it was going to be like a leave in conditioner and weigh hair down but its more like a frizz control shine spray</li>
    <li> This little bottle is great for on the go.  I pack it in my gym bag or when I need to travel.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I still prefer the original.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and super cheap compared to stores. The only thing is that this is only good for straightening hair and blow drying. You can not curl with this in your hair it will weight it down. Over all I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  It&#x27;s just like getting a keratin treatment without the unbelieveably high pricetag!  Wonderfully taming frizzy, wirey, unmanageable hair without the heaviness of an oily product that makes your hair look as though its full of grease or weighing it down.  Just a few quick sprits untangles and tames your hair.  Wonderful with a high temperature straightener and/or curling iron!  My overall FAVORITE hair care product EVER!!!  Lasts a long time, too!  TRY IT!</li>
    <li> This product is great as a leave in conditioner. I use it on my daughters hair as well as mine. I recommend this for anyone with african american hair.</li>
    <li> I think this work in a dry weather, but I lived in Panama and here the moist level are huge ! I try this product in the USA in a dry weather the result  is totally different the hair look pretty good ! So have this consideration before you buy this !</li>
    <li> This special hair product arrived via Amazon ordering quite quickly, and absolutely&lt;br /&gt;love what it does for my hair....  exactly as advertised and highly recommend this product...&lt;br /&gt;I love the product and I love Amazon..</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I do my own color and change it often..I put my hair threw HELL! I mean bleach ..heat..color...u name it I do it. Before I got \\&quot;its a 10 \\&quot; I was deep conditioning 5 days a week to have smooth hair (I&#x27;m naturally curly) and flat iron daily. One week of using this after I wash..my hair is so much better..when u bleach then wash n ur hair feels slimmy after a week or so using its a 10 after u wash ur hair gets so much better..healthier. dunno what I&#x27;d do without it. Not to mention it replaced alot of other products I been using. All around must have.and to those pansy&#x27;s that whine about its smell..they really must have super smell! It has a light scent to me...n I love the smell. I mean NO ONE loves the smell of hair dye but they use it cuz it works! So smell or no smell..I font k.ow what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
    <li> How do i apply this on my hair?? It is after shower or before?</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AWESOME. Makes my hair super silky! I have highly-processed blonde hair, so it is always in need of a little TLC. This does the job!!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product. Received it quickly.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference for my hair and has a chemically smell to it.  Bummer!</li>
    <li> I use this every day. It moisturizes my hair without leaving it greasy. I have fine hair but this is not too heavy. I&#x27;ve also noticed fewer split ends since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. Best Leave in Conditioner I have ever used. Been searching for the right leave in hair conditioner and have tried various brands. But this one is the best. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I used this product many times and have found it does nothing to make my hair smoother, shinier or softer!</li>
    <li> I tryed a sample of this product and fell in love with it instantly and then bought more. It made my hair so soft and silky ( i have straight hair, and use a flat iron) and it really enhances the shine and sleek-look i like.  It is worth the price, for it lasts a looonnnggg time.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is a miracle in a bottle!! I don&#x27;t normally say that about hair products.  I use it after shampooing, spray it in (a little goes a long way)  It takes out all the frizz and your hair feels silky and smooth!!</li>
    <li> What I like about this product, is it&#x27;s not greasy, although I use it more than once a day. If it seems fizzy, I spray a little on &amp; brush it. It doesn&#x27;t take the volume out.</li>
    <li> An excellent product.i am impressed.</li>
    <li> The product is fabulous.  Really nourished my hair after a perm.  Love also, that I received the conditioner so quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product. Just seems if I use it after every time I wash my hair seems to be too sticky that&#x27;s why I personally trying to use it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOOVE this!!  I got a 4oz bottle of the original It&#x27;s a 10 as a free sample at a local hair store.  I loved the smell and light feeling.  I thought I would try the keratin version.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this one.  I liked the smell of the original a lot, and this has a fainter smell.  I kept using it because I&#x27;d bought it, and I&#x27;m sure glad I did.  It keeps my hair soft and bouncy.  I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair past my shoulders.  I&#x27;ve seen more hair growth with the keratin version than with the original.  I use it as a daily leave in on dry hair.  A couple of light mists at night before wrapping and in the morning before styling work wonders!  If you spray enough to make your dry hair wet, you&#x27;ve used too much.  I will definitely buy the larger size next time!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! My daughter&#x27;s hair is so thick and is usually really rough feeling even after deep conditioning under the dryer. This product made her hair so soft and manageable, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!!!!! Flat ironing it was a breeze!!! The only thing it didn&#x27;t do was give it shine. I will be using this product forever on her hair!!!! Seriously thinking about trying the whole line now!!!</li>
    <li> this product alone really did a lot for my curly hair. The leave-in makes it totally back to its normal curly hair. Feels like there is no damage to my hair now :)</li>
    <li> This is positively the most awesome product for unruly hair.  I have been using it for about four months now, and it really does the job for taming frizzies, making hair manageable and in control.  Words can&#x27;t describe - you have to try it.</li>
    <li> its a 10 miracle leave in plus keratin- i bought this because of all the good reviews but it just didnt work for me. i have long thick hair and it made it feel like straw. it worked well in my daughters hair,her hair is the complete opposite of mine hers is pretty thin. it was very soft and shiny so i guess i would say that if you have very thick hair it may not be the best thing for your hair, i am now using the chi silk infusion serum and it is the miracle i have been needing! i would give it 1 star for myself but using it on my daughters hair it worked well so i will would give it 3 stars</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s prone to frizziness, so heat styling is a mess! A friend read about this product and said I should try it and I&#x27;m glad I did. I have used this with my flat iron, with just a standard heat dry and with a rotating brush styler and it really keeps the frizz away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  I have short naturally wavy hair that is getting longer because I am growing it longer.  I have not used the Miracle 10 Leave-In Plus Keratin.  What is a good kind of straightening shampoo and straightening conditioner that would be the best to use before applying the Miracle 10 Leave-In Plus Keraitin?  I would love to have bone straight hair so I&#x27;m wondering what would be the best kind of straightening shampoo and straightening conditioner to use before applying this product?</li>
    <li> great product best I found so far, my hair is really tangles and this made my hair so soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this leave in conditioner for ease of use and excellent results.  My hair has never de-tangled so easily after a shower and dried so soft.  Sadly I have acne prone skin and after about a month of using it i began to see a series of small breakouts that cleared up after stopping using it.  So although it is a great product overall, those with acne prone skin beware you may find you have an adverse reaction.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff, speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I have super limp hair and this product did not help at ll. It made my hair look oily right after washing t. Not recommended for those with thin/fine hair</li>
    <li> Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
    <li> love this stuff for my girls. A little goes a long way!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have a lot of fine hair and I really like this product. I use it after I shower! Detangles my hair and makes it feel great.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It makes my hair softer and even helps cut back the drying time.  I have naturally curly hair and use to always have a kink in the back of my hair that was hard to get out when straighting.  It would take forever to iron it out with a straightener.  Now just by blow drying I have no kink!  I still use a straightner but not as much as I had to before.</li>
    <li> I was questioning this product with all the mixed reviews but figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I love it! I noticed a difference in the first use. It acts like detangler when first applied then I noticed how soft my hair was when it dried. Because I dye my hair and use a straightner, I have a lot of fly aways and breakage and I noticed that after using this product a couple of times its helped smooth my hair out and looks way better. I also feel it makes my hair color more vibrant.</li>
    <li> great leave in conditioner with keratin added in! i use it after I shower with wet hair...perfect with the keratin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year now and I love it. Helps if you have split ends and protects hair if you use any heat styling. And it also smells great!!</li>
    <li> Seems to help the dry ends of my hair from flat ironing everyday. Has a good smell to it also. Price wise, could be a little cheaper for the size of the bottle that you get.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product and I definitely will purchase again.  It leaves the hair silky, shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have difficulty blowing my hair out fairly smoothly, and this product,along with others,  is helpful in maintaining a polished finish.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and was starting to notice some damage on the ends. I use wen shampoo as a leave in conditioner but needed more.  I started using this conditioner and saw a big change. It leaves my hair feeling amazing, soft, smooth. The damage I was noticing is gone. Plus, it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This has a strong fecal odor to it.  I am sure it is the perfume scent chosen for it&#x27;s indolic properties.  But this is bad it definitely needs to be counterbalanced with something else!  If it worked perhaps I could overlook smelling like feces(perhaps), but it is filmy, waxy, frizzy and I cannot wait for my next shampoo - every time I use it.  I waited until the bottom of the bottle to write this review I should have taken it back.  I was coerced into purchasing it with my haircut; must stay on top of things next time.</li>
    <li> I had heard so many amazing things about this product for so long so I decided to purchase it because I am sick of my frizzy, tangled hair. To elaborate, I have thick, long curly hair that frizzes very easily. I decided to try it out on its own (meaning without the use of other hair products) to see any changes it would make and I saw absolutely none. I was very generous with the amount I would put in my hair and I even looked up the best way to use this product since I thought I was somehow using it wrong. Then I began using it with my other normal products and I was getting the same results as I was getting before I even got this, so I haven&#x27;t used it for about a month since it literally does nothing to my hair. It didn&#x27;t make it shinier, it certainly did not detangle or defrizz, or any of the other things it claims to do. I am extremely disappointed since I see it works wonders on so many other people from everywhere and it&#x27;s sad to say that I don&#x27;t like this product at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!!!I have used this product for awhile now and I love how smooth and soft my hair is.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this keratin treatment for my damaged hair and I love it! It has helped rebuild my damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I seriously adore this stuff. I have wavy frizzy hair, and my air-dried look is terrible - the roots are limp and sad, the baby hairs at the hairline and all the ends are frizzy freak outs, and I get weird and unattractive kinks and waves. I&#x27;ve struggled for a long time to find the right products, and since using [[ASIN:B005SPETGS Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo, 12.6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] I&#x27;ve had much better hair, but blow-drying was still tricky, since the hairline and ends were often still fuzzy, ugly and unmanageable. So, I added keratin leave in treatments to my routine, but with unsatisfactory results. (Yes, I&#x27;m a bit of a hair addict...if it&#x27;s not quite perfect, I&#x27;m moving on to the next miracle treatment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Plus Keratin really is a miracle. I&#x27;m so thrilled with how soft and manageable my hair is with just a little bit of this stuff in it. The frizz is gone, the coarseness is gone, the waxy too-much-product look that I often encountered is no longer an issue, since I don&#x27;t need anything but this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does still layer well with other products...I put the Leave-In on first, then any extra ends treatment (lately I use just a dab of jojoba oil) and occasionally I use some texture or volume mousse on the roots after. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s much MUCH easier to spray into your hand, and then apply to your hair. This stuff is SLICK, and when I was trying to actually spray this all over my hair, even a tiny bit on the bathroom tile was too slippery after a shower, so it&#x27;s easier to properly distribute, and safer, to spray into your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never leaving this product. In fact, I&#x27;m so addicted, I&#x27;m going to try the same brand shampoo and conditioner too, even though I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the Suave Keratin...if the Shampoo is half as good as this leave-in is, I may no longer need to be addicted to finding hair products! And for the rare day I just air-dry...I look WAY better. My waves actually look like intentional waves, and the overall look is soft rather than &#x27;fro-y.ctually look like intentional waves, and the overall look is soft rather than &#x27;fro-y.</li>
    <li> i have extra long fine hair .This product is a GOD send  for removing tangles and protecting my hair during styling</li>
    <li> i have only used it once and I see the difference in my hair. buy it tired to try all kinds of hair products. sure I start to use the whole line It&#x27;s a 10 miracle plus keratin.  Thank god</li>
    <li> I just spent three times the amount on a different product because it had 100% five stars...MISTAKE!...This product works just as we&#x27;ll at 1/3 of the cost...I did see some reviews about the smell...Mine really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything...In fact my hairdresser always tells me my hair smells good when I come in to see her...I love this product and will be buying this again...My hair is about four inches below my shoulders and as of right now it is reddish, brownish, and blond!...I love coloring my hair and this product is wonderful to keep the damage under control...</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry hair.  It is ultra thick so it only takes a couple of sprays on the hair while it is wet... a little goes a long way.  The fragrance smells wonderful.  Amazon got this out to me quickly and it was cheaper than buying in a salon.</li>
    <li> So this product made my hair shiny and healthier but I don&#x27;t like the smell and it leaves a heaviness to my hair. I just use a couple of sprays and brush it through but ti still leaves a texture that resembles a thick leave in or hair spray. I do think it helps but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it on a daily basis. Maybe the It&#x27;s a 10 without the keratin won&#x27;t smell the same. Overall I would recommend this to friends with thicker hair but not for people with thin hair.</li>
    <li> Love it &amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl; Really leave my hair beautiful</li>
    <li> Not really worth the beacoup bucks.Sooo expensive for nothing.</li>
    <li> I have used this for many years and am always pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Easy and quick for those of us with fast-paced life</li>
    <li> So far so good. It makes my hair feel silky and not as dead. Let&#x27;s see how it works after a long length of time.</li>
    <li> I really liked the original formula, used it up so I got this w/ Keratin.  The scent is noticeably stronger than the original one (heavy scented already), which is way too strong!  But since I bought it, I used it but won&#x27;t be repurchasing because over time, it really didn&#x27;t do as well as the original one did.</li>
    <li> All of the 10 products are great.  I especially like the miracle silk conditioner and the conditioner with keratin.  I use the miracle silk conditioner on the top of my head and the conditioner with keratin on the ends.  The keratin is heavier and could weigh your hair down on top more than the silk conditioner.  I use the keratin on the ends because they usually need more conditioning (dead ends).  Works awesome!</li>
    <li> Got the product in an average amount of time and good conditions. It&#x27;s not the first time i buy this product so i know how it works and i frigging love it it&#x27;s like magic to my hair &amp; it does not seem to be watered down or anything good buy for a really good price as well. Will definitely buy again if they stock up again for the same price!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING on coarse, frizzy hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this product! My hair gets so soft and controlled (lol) and it smells soooo good!</li>
    <li> Works great. (Hence the high price) I&#x27;d say its wprth it for sure. I jave thick wavy hair that frizzes on top. This worked to smooth the frizz and leave me curly and natural</li>
    <li> I got his when I ran out of the \\&quot;10\\&quot; leave in for blondes. I am however not as pleased with this one as I was with the blonde one. And it smells bad! Now it does ookay....but I wk t be buying again. Honestly the ONLY okay thing about it is, I helps detangle my crazy hair. (Thick, red, curly frizzy, highlighted). But hey, you never know Til you try, right?</li>
    <li> I love the conditioner and shampoo so I figured I would try this...it is okay, seemed like it made my hair feel less silky...I doubt I will buy again...</li>
    <li> excellent product fast delivery!!</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite hair care products and the price is so much better here than at the salons thats what keeps brining me back</li>
    <li> Holy cow did I want this to work! But it did not. It didn&#x27;t really do anything at all. A 2 dollar bottle of suave leave-in keratin conditioner works a million times better and it was cheaper. I&#x27;m Puerto Rican with frizzy curly 3a hair.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair and do not get Keratin treatments.  However, I am aware that products containing keratin is good for our hair.  I sprayed this in my hair and combing through my hair was an absolute breeze.  My hair was not at all tangled.  When my hair dryed...I was thinking, well ok...but when I flat ironed it, my hair looked amazing!!!  It has that dominican blowout look and is so shiny and bouncy.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has kinky curly hair who wants to have a good detangler.  I look forward to my next wash to see how my hair turns out with a roller set.  My money was well spent!!</li>
    <li> I used my friends after a day at the pool and knew right away that I was hooked. When I saw there was one with Keratin, I knew I found a beauty gem. My hair is usually on the unruly side and I have NEVER been able to let it air dry. With the help of some keratin shampoo and conditioner plus this \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; I can actually walk out of the house without having to blow dry and flat iron. This is a definite must have product in your beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Ten is the best product I have used for managing my uncontrollable frizzy hair.  My hair is now silky and easy to style,  You don&#x27;t need to use much of the product for it to work so it goes a long way and I only use conditioner once a week now.  I highly recommend It&#x27;s a Ten</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this because It was used at me at a salon. I loved the smell and the benefits of it. I have thick dry hair that&#x27;s long. This stuff is amazing it smooths and it protects against my flat iron! This was also the cheapest one I found! Right now I use it with Aussie smoothing shampoo and Aussie repair conditiner. It works amazing together. I also use Paul Mitchell super skinny serum. Trust me give this a try you won&#x27;t regret it !</li>
    <li> Saw it recommended by HODA on the AM TV show.....does great work controlling my curly, thinning hair..A great Product !!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect  for every use. Make hair supper soft. I go camping and always bring this and my hair always looks great when I use it. The price good too.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff. She says that it&#x27;s worth every penny. I suspect she would buy it by the gallon of she could.</li>
    <li> THIS IS JUST A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  I USE IT ALL THE TIME.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CONDITIONER TO ANYONE WHO WOULD USE IT.</li>
    <li> Great stuff wow; fast delivery.  Very happy with results.  I have dry hair thats color treated and I finally found something that works!</li>
    <li> I got a free small sample bottle of this when I made another purchase and I absolutely loved it. Just a few spritzes worked through your hair before blow drying will tame the frizzies! It helps straighten your hair and the smell is really nice. I continue to order this from Amazon as its way cheaper than my salon.</li>
    <li> My friend got me a sample of this and I liked what it did to my hair, so I bought me a bottle.  This does wonders to dry, brittle hair!  Now I have smooth and shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for yourself, friend, and family members!!!</li>
    <li> not cheap - but great stuff ! would give it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the cost - very much recommend</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get any of the product out of the bottle. So it is kind of hard for me to write a review.. but i&#x27;m hoping that it will be good once I get it to work!</li>
    <li> I normally have very dry hair and was hoping this woulod help, but it didnt. I wasnt expecting a miracle, but maybe just a little help on the dryness. If anything my hair looked and felt worse.</li>
    <li> Really controls curl and frizz.  Wonderful for when I use the flatiron to make my hair straight.  This doesn&#x27;t work, nor does anything else, in high humidity or rain.</li>
    <li> I like this.  Not too oily.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner has made my hair look and feel so much better. I no longer have dried ends and frizz.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product because of all the hype about it.  I was pretty dissapointed as it actually made my hair frizzy - just the opposite of it&#x27;s claims.  Apparently it works differently, depending on your hair type.  Gave it away to a friend who loves the product.</li>
    <li> I have very damaged hair from bleaching and get my hair done like clockwork. A friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic change in my hair. My hair looks healthier and I&#x27;m starting to notice less split ends. Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with the product, it doesn&#x27;t do any good to my hair! Don&#x27;t waist your money, look for something else. Te service is good, no problem.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This is very expensive in the stores so this was a great price on Amazon.  This products takes the frizz out and smells really great. I still use Prell along with a frizz control shampoo and they changed the Prell formula years ago. I would get many compliments on the way my hair smelled.  Now I get them again because of the very clean and pleasant fragrance in this formula.</li>
    <li> Great for shiny silky hair</li>
    <li> Love It.  At Ulta it was about $20 more.  Thank you Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product makes your hair feel like silk.</li>
    <li> Woah! I have STRAIGHT, medium/long blonde hair, and I haven&#x27;t gotten a haircut in about a year due to time constraints and just plain laziness. I noticed the ends of my hair were not calming down (split ends...) even when I flat ironed them and used the CHI keratin mist spray. One use of this magic stuff, and my hair is so shiny! I may even go another six months without a haircut, because this stuff does such a great job of calming down those split ends, frayed ends, frizzies, and all those other annoying little quirks.</li>
    <li> Love it, no more dry, &amp;#34;DEAD&amp;#34; ends. Love my silky hair that does not need  to be tream every month. Take me less time to straight my hair. Not too happy with packaging, the bottle was wrapped with a wide tape in order to secure the cap. It took me a while to clean up the sticky bottle.</li>
    <li> First time that I have ever wished that I could rate a product with zero stars! In short, a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Ok so I just received this product a couple hours ago and was so excited to try it out. When I sprayed it onto my hair and brushed it out my hair felt 1 MILLION times softer and healthier (and looked healthier also!) I cant believe how well this works!! I feel like I just stepped out of a salon. ( BTW, I first heard about this product at a salon!) So impressed! I love it! ( Not to mention the smell!!! It smells like a salon! ) Best smelling product I have EVER smelled! And not to strong either!!! I would definetly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this leave-in conditioner. I have black hair - the toughest kind, but a couple of sprays and my hair feels very soft. The difference is noticeable, I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the positive change in my hair since using this product. I never used to be able to wear my hair down to let it air dry - I have thin curly hair that tends to flyaway like baby hair, and it was thinning. It is also just down to my shoulders and I have been trying to grow it out, but it keeps breaking off on the top layer from wearing it back so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately saw a change in my hair after the first application of It&#x27;s a 10. It sprays on creamy, and feels a bit like conditioner left in your hair, so might not be the best product for those with hair that tends to get greasy or is thin and straight. But for me, after going through almost a whole bottle, my hair has grown more than an inch; even my hairdresser was impressed with how quickly it grew and how healthy it was. Best of all, I can let it air dry and my hair makes soft curls that stay put, and my hair looks full and healthy. It is amazing. I bought another bottle already so that I don&#x27;t have to go a day without it! I have also tried the Redken Extreme Anti-Snap before this, but it left my hair crunchy and hard, and I couldn&#x27;t let it air-dry or really noticed any difference. This product is much better. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and  the best keratin product I&#x27;ve tried. It controls my frizzy hair, makes it soft, and blends the waves without making it greasy.</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged due to color and over processing. This product is great - in addition to repairing my damaged hair, it makes my hair super soft and shiny. I spray it on after towel drying my hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair feel - too heavy - does not condition well. I was using a leave in conditioner for a while and someone recommended this to me so I tried it but for my hair it&#x27;s just too heavy and made my hair look/feel dry.</li>
    <li> Must have for healthy looking hair.  My split ends are drastically reduced to almost nothing.  You will love this product.  It also works well for my 5 year old that hates to have her hair combed.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Wish it would provide silkyness as well. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> The service was excellent.  The product, however, left my hair a little greasy looking and was sticky despite the fact that I didn&#x27;t use very much of the product at one time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on accident! It was a surprise purchase that is totally amazing for dry hair. However, too many squirts can make your hair look greasy.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works and smells good! Good for detangling hair</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Not thrilled with the packaging it came it and I got lucky everything was ok.  But other than that.....great deal!</li>
    <li> I have tried many - this is the best conditioner I have found for my hair!  It works great for flat ironed, color treated hair!</li>
    <li> I have been tortured by unmanageable hair my whole adult life.  My hair is long, with large waves and a lot of frizz.  Nothing has ever helped.  I have tried more products than I can count.  I&#x27;ve tried straightening it, blow drying, air dying, chopping it off- I have tried it all.  I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair pulled back into a bun for years now, just so that my hair isn&#x27;t going everywhere.  I read the reviews for this product, and figured I might as well give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a 10 with Keratin has done what no other product has accomplished.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now.  The first two days, I was very disappointed, because I noticed no change in my hair.  On day 3, I noticed some smoothness that wasn&#x27;t there before.  And now?  My hair is amazing!  It&#x27;s so smooth and soft now.  I actually wore my hair loose yesterday, and it looked fabulous.  I have NEVER seen my hair look this good before, not even after trips to the salon.  I&#x27;ve been towel drying my hair, spraying this in my hair, and then letting it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some reviewers say that this product straightened their hair some.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that yet- my large waves are still here.  But they look so good now that I&#x27;m not complaining.  :)  This product is a little pricey for the size of the bottle, but I&#x27;ve spent much more on products that don&#x27;t work.  I wish that I had found this stuff years ago...would have saved me a lot of trouble.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I came across it here on Amazon randomly and read all the reviews so I just had to buy it. It leaves my hair so so so SO soft and smooth. Not greasy at all. You don&#x27;t need that much of it for it to be effective. It also does a good job of repairing split ends which is essential for my long hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair softer and more manageable. I know that sounds like a commercial, but in this case, for once, it&#x27;s really true! And, it has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now its amazing my hair looks great I deferentially recommend this great  product</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. Definitely detangles and leaves my hair feeling soft (long, thick, colored hair).</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have curly, dry hair that is damaged from heat.  After I wash my hair I spray this through my hair focusing on my ends and it instantly brings my hair back to life! It makes my hair soft, shiny and manageable not to mention it looks and feels healthy again! And it smells really, really good, its not too overpoweringly floral but kind of reminds me of a DKNY perfume. Overall great product!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this by my hair stylist and I love it.  Found it cheaper on Amazon, henceforth I&#x27;m purchasing it on line versus the salon.  I love how it makes my hair real silky!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product I have purchased this before in the past, it leaves your hair so silky and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;BUT I do not recommend you buying it from beauty-stand. They have HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer service. I filed a claim and put negative feedback and they will not refund my money until I remove my feedback and the claim. Wow! They are the worst sellers don&#x27;t even bother with them. I ordered it from someone else on Amazon and I received great customer service and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I first bought this in Walgreens since it was on sale. I use this for myself and my son, we have very brittle and dry hair. After the first use, our hair is moisturized, not that dry anymore, feels soft,feels, and looks healthy. Will definitely buy this for many more times to come.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! First time using this one with Keratin but have used the origninal leave in conditioner for years. I don&#x27;t care for the light version as it has a VERY strong scent which I didn&#x27;t care for. Since using this product with Keratin I have notices my hair is silky smooth, easy to comb through post shower, seems to also have more body without feeling greasy or weighed down. 👍👍</li>
    <li> This product is as a amazing for your hair! Heat protector, helps damaged hair and your hair is so soft. However the packaging I got the spray part was broken.</li>
    <li> I use this with the It&#x27;s a 10 plus keratin shampoo, I skip their conditioner because the reviews for it were not outstanding.  To be honest, I don&#x27;t miss the extra step.  This stuff works well and smells amazing.  Great detangler.  I have long hair and only put it on the bottom half, which is the only part that gets tangled anyway.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner.  Use lightly if you have fine hair or it will weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is a 10!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s great or just good, because I use other keratin products, and they all do keep my hair healthy. I like this product because it is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of hair products, but this has to be one of my favorites. The product makes my hair easy to comb through when wet. It has a great fragrance and makes my hair so manageable and nice when blowed out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AHHHHMAZZZIIINNGGG!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would give it a bad review! Someone wrote that it made their hair feel sticky, they used too much product!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair that&#x27;s normal texture but it&#x27;s pretty thick. I don&#x27;t cut my hair a lot, so this stuff does a great job smoothing my ends. It doesnt stink, the smell is actually very light! I spray from about half shaft down to my ends, only two sprays on each side. Then I comb through it and blow dry. When it&#x27;s dry I spray two squirts in my hand and then smooth over the ends on one side, and repeat that on the other side, then I either curl my hair in loose waves or straighten it. I am a product JUNKIE, a goo HOARDER, I have tried everything and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells horrible, like cheap perfume that gives headaches, and does not seem to do anything different to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have mixed african american-filipino hair. Needless to say before being introduced to \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; I experimented with many, many, many products. Some of which worked as advertised for a few weeks, while others did not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair went from unmanageable, kinky, and dry to smooth, healthy, and less split ends.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Been using it for years. Makes my hair really shiney, smooth and healthy looking.. It smells pretty good too..</li>
    <li> I love this product, and the delivery was prompt and perfect. I&#x27;ll be glad to order again, and more of the It&#x27;s a 10 products as well!</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely curly and the only time I comb it is when I get out of the shower.  This product is great for helping detangle and smooth my hair while combing it.</li>
    <li> I dyed most of my hair platinum a year and a half ago and my hair is very dull and gets tangled easily. This product detangles my hair and makes it shiny and look healthier. Haven&#x27;t found another leave in product like it. Definitely recommend it. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have medium thickness of hair but with this product I have full on head turning fullness!! Love this stuff! Can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
    <li> Works great in conjuction with your flat iron for great smooth shiny hair.. I ve been using for awhile and nothing gets my hair straighter than this product and I&#x27;ve tried a few.</li>
    <li> Its a 10 Miracle Leave-In Plus Keratin is magically fantastic. Once i sprayed it in my over-processed bleached blonde breaking hair, My hair became soft, manageable, silky, detangled, shiny, healthy, and the best condition its ever been in ever!!!! My hair was breaking off. My hair is thick, dry, brittle, crunchy, hard, and unmanageable. I used the Its a 10 Miracle with Keratin shampoo, the Its a 10 with Keratin deep conditioner, and Its a 10 Miracle Leave-In Plus Keratin, and the Its a 10 Miracle with Keratin Oil. My hair has transformed in to silky, soft, strong, long beautiful hair. I have been using these products for over 2-months. I can strongly recommend these products to anyone who have damaged hair and tried tons of products that did not work. This product will change your life. Its a 10 is a Miracle.</li>
    <li> This product literally has no effect on my hair. It&#x27;s like water. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because my hair type is Indian, but that should not make much a difference.</li>
    <li> During some research online for the top rated hair replenish I found this. It is a 10! With getting older and the coloring of my hair it was getting dry. This has been working great! Makes my hair softer and shiny. Seems to make it healthier looking.</li>
    <li> At first the price of this bottle seemed rather high for the amount you get.  But that is oh to the contrary.  My hair is bobbed, just above the shoulders, super fine, limp and color treated (highs and lows).  I started by spraying it in to my hair, but after a week found better for me just two sprays in my hands, rub together and work through my  hair.  For me it adds texture, softness and strengthens every shaft of my hair.  I first found out about this product because I noticed a coworker&#x27;s hair all full and shiney (she has long color treated hair).  Definite results!</li>
    <li> I use this product as instructed and I still have dry ends and breakage. It makes my hair stiff until I brush it out.</li>
    <li> I tried the original It&#x27;s a 10 first, and fell in love! I ordered this one to give it a try, since Kertain has established such a good reputation, and absolutely hate it. It made my hair feel greasy and stringy right away (I have very fine hair). I can&#x27;t believe what a difference there is between the two! I&#x27;d definitely recommend sticking to the original (without Keratin).</li>
    <li> Keeps hair soft, manageable and helps so much with split ends. The price was excellent as well. Only problem is the sprayer. Conditioner leaks out when you spray it. The product itself is great.</li>
    <li> I use this when I&amp;#34;m at the pool to help condition my hair. Works about the same as any other one I&#x27;ve bought</li>
    <li> Thank you it&#x27;s amazing item</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work at all for my hair. I have coarse hair that&#x27;s graying so it&#x27;s even coarser. The seller was really unhelpful. They keep changing names which is deceptive.</li>
    <li> So, I have really long hair, and it would be nice looking if it wasn&#x27;t so kinky and frizzed out all the time. It&#x27;s not even DRY, so adding oils doesn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s just a head of &amp;#34;good potential&amp;#34; with no self actualization. Anyway, usually I use a straightening iron on my hair just to keep the flyaways and random fuzz balls at bay, but it&#x27;s always messed up again by a few days and I just wear it in buns because I&#x27;m lazy and ain&#x27;t nobody got time fo dat. I have tried a ton of different hair products and they are all just added oils that seem to do nothing but make my hair look greasy. So I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair feel a little... rough(?), which might be an odd sounding thing to say, but that&#x27;s the closest I can think of. It doesn&#x27;t feel bad though, just different than what you might expect. Despite not feeling like the silk or a baby&#x27;s bottom or whatever other metaphors you&#x27;d prefer, it made my hair look pretty fantastic. It was straight, no kinks, no frizz, no flyaways. I put it into my wet hair 2 days ago then straightened it dry, and my hair still looks really good, ESPECIALLY since it&#x27;s fall/winter in Oregon and has been raining non stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re at your wits end and thinking about trying this, just do it. It feels fundamentally different than other types of hair products, so if all you need is more oil/mosture, just go buy a tub of coconut oil because you might not like that this product doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel like it&#x27;s being imbued with the moisturizing kiss of Poseidon. That said, it&#x27;s worth it to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THERE IS HOPE.</li>
    <li> best product ever! highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and came on time, I&#x27;ll be ordering another one. It makes your hair ultra soft and really does detangle. It also adds shine for a healthier, lustrous look.</li>
    <li> This is a fair price and it arrived promptly. My friends and I love it.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> My amazonian hair is tamed with this. Love how easy it is to comb through and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Would have loved to try it&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in plus keratin but it has parabens. Hopefully, the company will follow others and take out the parabens.</li>
    <li> It a good leave in conditioner, but don&#x27;t use too much. It leaves hair soft and manageable. It&#x27;s has a strong perfume smell.</li>
    <li> Great product especially if your flat iron your hair on a regular basis! Helps keep my hair moisturized and keeps from breaking on the ends.</li>
    <li> Broken sprayer so not sure if it works or not, gotta deal with stupid return process... such crap!</li>
    <li> I received this product as a free sample from Ulta and I gave it a shot. I have fine, long, highlighted hair that is difficult to brush through when damp, even after using conditioner.  This product WORKS.  I use 3 pumps and work it from the ends to the mid-shaft of my hair and then rub what&#x27;s left through the top of my hair and bangs.  It makes my hair easy to comb through, dries soft and looks healthier than ever.  At my last haircut, my stylist said my hair is in terrific condition and I am pretty sure it is because of It&#x27;s A 10 Leave In.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good product. I use it prior to using heat controlled appliances on my hair. It makes your hair soft and I believe it controls frizz.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this as I had read the amazing reviews and my hair stylist said it would be okay for hair that has been colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, am I disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my fine, curly hair flat and frizzy. No body, limp curls, frizz - disaster! There can&#x27;t be much keratin in it to leave this much frizz. And I live in a dry climate so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m dealing with humidity. The scent is also much stronger than I prefer (I want people to smell my perfume, not my conditioner) and kind of cheap, like something out of a drug store. Two stars because it did leave my hair feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My favorite conditioner by Bumble + Bumble has been discontinued which is why I&#x27;m trying new leave-ins. If anyone here knows of something comparable to Bumble + Bumble &amp;#34;Leave In, Rinse Out&amp;#34; please let me know!!!</li>
    <li> some good stuff for your hair. It works on the frizzes!</li>
    <li> I got this stuff because I was looking for anything with keratin to help take some of the bristle out of my beard, and this stuff has really done the trick. I brush in 4-5 pumps every day (spray it on your hands and rub it in, don&#x27;t spray yourself in the face!) and after about 2 months, my beard has gone from &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; to smooth and decent looking - even at the slightly fuller length I&#x27;m wearing these days. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell (that I can detect) and what little it does have seems to vanish as soon as the stuff dries.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get all the great reviews on here. I don&#x27;t see how I can be using this product incorrectly since its a &amp;#34;Spray On Leave in Conditioner&amp;#34; which equals NO BRAINER! This leaves my hair looking dirty and weighs it down no matter how littler I use. I have many and I mean MANY products and this falls in line with some of the worst results. I have Normal, wavy hair. Is this for a specific hair type? Perhaps? Well I strongly DO NOT recommend. Btw, I research everything before I buy and I purchased this because the reviews were beyond the skies... Well, maybe I&#x27;m in the minority but it didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> I love this product and wouldn&#x27;t be without it! My hair is naturally curly and processed so breakage is a problem, and this product is amazing for strengthening. I went without it for week when I ran out and will never do that again! It does have a strong perfume smell (not bad) just strong. I will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I can not figure out why this is so popular.  I used this and the non keratin one.  I works ok, nothing spectacular.  My hair seems to have a coating on it after I use it.  It does not make it shine, it does not make it silky.  Not sure what everyone is raving about!</li>
    <li> It works quite well, unfortunately it has a strange smell to it.  The shape of the bottle is a little clumsy to spray.</li>
    <li> Got the product super fast and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> This product is good to use with your flat iron or just to keep your hair silk and smooth, either straight or curly.</li>
    <li> Anyone that says that this product is horrible or they dont like it, they are crazy. I am in a country where they don&#x27;t have proper water. We take showers in &amp;#34;treated&amp;#34; water. About a month of taking showers in this water my hair was dry and breaking easy. There was another female in the bathroom one night after I got out of the shower and she had this product with her, she told me to try it. I did and was instantly hooked. I ordered some and have been using it for about 2 weeks. There is a noticeable difference in my hair. I highly recommend this for anyone with any type of hair.</li>
    <li> My bottle was cracked at the top and spilled inside the box.  Perhaps this product would have been good, but I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommend this product to help protect my hair from the blow dryer and flat iron. Works well, I love it!</li>
    <li> this is amazing stuff. to buy it in the salon is $20. delivery was as expected. it only takes a tiny bit to detangle and add body to hair, so don&#x27;t waste it!</li>
    <li> Love this spray. I can&#x27;t live without it. Works amazing on my curly frizzy hair. Been using it for over a year now. Their miracle mask is one of my favorites too!</li>
    <li> Best Product ever! Love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely a great leave-in conditioner! My girlfriend and I both use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair tries, it is noticeably softer and easier to control, especially if I use a little hair oil as well.</li>
    <li> Since using this product and some other It&#x27;s a 10 products my hair looks so fabulous. My hair is soft, healthy, not frizzy, and I do not have any split ends.</li>
    <li> Love the It&#x27;s a 10 Leave in Conditioner. I tried some from a friend and absolutely loved it.  This is a must have product. My hair is wavy/curly, thick and has a mind of it&#x27;s own most days.  This leave in conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I am usually skeptical when buying something like this, but it really has made a difference to my hair! It is so soft and the ends don&#x27;t look as ragged as they did! One thing, I wish the bottle was larger. Other than that I really love it! Buy it now!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first-timer to this stuff and I love it! It&#x27;s lighter than Moroccan Oil and doesn&#x27;t make your hair as greasy!</li>
    <li> Not ideal for me ... but my daughter had wonderful results. She&#x27;s 12 with a full head of wonderful healthy hair that gets scorched from improper drying practices. Me, however, I get a thick, gritty feeling when using this. My hair tangles more too .. I have professional dyed hair, hypothyroid and hair on the thicker side.</li>
    <li> I have really dry hair and blow dry my hair twice a month and this product saves me from the scrunchies, love it.</li>
    <li> Love this leave in conditioner, keeps hair soft and manageable not sticky! Great for sets or blowouts!</li>
    <li> I tried this Leave-In Conditioner for the first time -- and I am hooked on it!  It makes your hair so soft and shiny, without any greasiness or heavy feeling!  I used to use another brand of leave-in conditioner.  But now I am only using this!</li>
    <li> Seriously, where has this product been all my life?!?! Why am I just NOW discovering the miracles it does for my hair!? I was born lucky, growing up I had all the girls asking about my hair. Until I started playing around with boxed dye in high school, is when damage introduced itself. I&#x27;ve been blonde, red, and back to brown for the past 10 years. I first tried this product today and I must say it literally is a miracle! I feel like my hair is back to normal. I have &amp;#34;butt-length&amp;#34; hair, and I am trying my best to restore it to it&#x27;s natural health, when in reality there&#x27;s scientifically no way to permanently restore your grown hair. Along with trimming my hair every 3 months, and using organic coconut oil.. I can now use his product to top it all off! This product is worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> Ive used for years and love this product!</li>
    <li> Its not working so far, but hope it works on more uses.</li>
    <li> Love love love it. Makes my hair feel super conditioned and soft one of the best leave it conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I am a die hard Pureology girl so when I heard about this I was skeptical. now I wish I had ordered it six month ago when I first thought about it. This Stuff is amazing ! End of story ! Smells great and works even better.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> I like this 10. I read reviews where some did not like it. It says right on the bottle. &amp;#34;Maintenance of Keratin Treatments.&amp;#34; It works WITH. No as.&lt;br /&gt; I had a Keratin treatment done professionaly.  At a salon. With the hot iron. Waited 3 days to wash my hair with a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. Then washed as needed another 3 more times till I received this from Amazon. So I used this today. And I love it. I washed. Brushed my hair. Sprayed a medium amount of 10 on my hair. Brushed. Let sit while I put my makeup on. Then blow dried. And wow. I have nice thick straight hair. With body. Not the thin bone straight look I can achieve with a  iron after an hour. I have body. I have thick, color treated Italian long hair. I recommend this for after you have had a keratin treatment. To help maintain the keratin treatment. I live in the Boston area. And recieved this within 4 days. Happy with this seller also.</li>
    <li> I have had this product used on me in the salon for a year, it is worth every penny. I have fine hair but LOTS of it, with alot of wave, with 3 sprays of this product and a hairdryer and brush or flat iron stays flat for 3 days!!! and I live in the South !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 years, since my daughter introduced me to it.  I use this on damp hair after having shampooed and conditioned.  It provides extra softness and smoothness.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome item.  I love it.  Now I need more words to fill in this silly review of the item.</li>
    <li> I have bad water and long hair so I use this to help keep it somewhat healthy. Works enough that I need it every day, but not magically that my hair is super shiney/soft/not breaking.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it with the keratin, it changed the product and affect on my hair. It&#x27;s not the same with just 10 Miracle w/o Keratin.</li>
    <li> I have tried three different versions of this leave-in and this one with keratin is the best.  My thick hair feels soft, smooth and smells amazing.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> If you tend to have flyaway hair, this conditioner will take care of it.  It&#x27;s a little too pricey, though.</li>
    <li> Really expected great things from this. Tried it on dry hair, on wet hair, using a little, using alot...either way it made my hair just seem dirty. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Totally makes a difference in hair.</li>
    <li> very good deal online, works best if you blow dry and style your hair directly after using.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my order. Received it on schedule.</li>
    <li> Does a great job on my curly hair.  I love both products - with or without Keratin - I apply it to already towel dried conditioned hair for extra manageability.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Expensive but worth it. I have very dry hair, this makes it feel soft and silky. And takes away a lot of frizz that naturally comes with curly hair.</li>
    <li> Right product however pump did not work so cannot use. Will have to see of water bottle will work</li>
    <li> I felt like it made my hair dry when I first started using it but I kept using it and it&#x27;s made my hair so easy to manage - I love it.  When I straighten it, it looks amazing and when I wear it curly it&#x27;s not so out of control!</li>
    <li> This makes your hair easy to manage. You don&#x27;t need to put that much on a few squirts it you can feel the difference when you do put it on.</li>
    <li> I cant say it enough.  I LOVE THIS SPRAY! It is a must for someone who uses a lot of heat products on their hair.  Such a good value on Amazon!</li>
    <li> love this product; good price. caution with over using; will build up fast</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It does moisturize upon application and improves the hair texture, but it doesn&#x27;t impart a sheen or shine to the hair.  When it dries, it leaves the hair dry.  I&#x27;m African American and we naturally have dry hair.  I was hoping that even after the product dries, it would still leave the hair soft and supple. That was not the case.  I liked my hair when I first applied the product and even the condtion of my hair later.  But the lack of moisture-retention and the lack of shine were not a plus.  That is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Will help even the most damaged hair! I get compliments on my hair all the time and it hasn&#x27;t been cut in a year!</li>
    <li> i started using this product about 5 years ago, and now it has eratine in it... so really helps keep the curls under control... it looks great!</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of soften and shine products. This is easy to use and has the best results of all I tried. Now that I color my hair (grey hair was inevitable but I resent purposely damaging my hair), this product does reverse the courseness I feel in my hair after coloring those greys. It is also not slowing me down with a lengthy rinse since it is a leave in product. It does increase the time I dry my hair by a minute or maybe less than a minute. I never timed it truthfully. My hair does not ever feel greasy or oily unless I went a majorly crazy spraying it on. I even bought a travel size one for traveling since I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This product not only works great but also smells great! It helpd restore my hair and lived up to my expctations. I would definately buy it again!</li>
    <li> i have thick curly hair. it claims to make hair soft without any frizz. lies!!!! would never use it or purchase again.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser sent me the original It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner and the hair mask when I moved to a very remote town.  I could not stop raving....until I bought this product with the keratin!!  On the first use, my boyfriend asked me what was different about my hair because it looks awesome!!  I then told him to feel it, and he couldn&#x27;t believe how silky smooth and soft it is!!  I find myself constantly rubbing my fingers through my hair because I absolutely love how it feels.  I&#x27;m amazed at the difference by using just a few pumps of It&#x27;s a 10 with Keratin Leave in Conditioner!  Your hair will totally thank you when you use this product!!</li>
    <li> and leaves your hair soft &amp; manageable.  Beware the 10 oz bottle - it&#x27;s too big for my hands to actually spray - but the 4 oz is just right and this is easy to apply, leaves your hair shiny &amp; easy to style.  BUY!</li>
    <li> This product does not do what I thought it would - smooth and tame my hair but it does work well as a detangler. My hair is fine but I have a ton of it so maybe that&#x27;s why I am not getting quite the benefit I would have hoped for. It is definitely worth the price and provides some relief to my hair woes.</li>
    <li> I love this and even use it as a grooming product on my dogs</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
    <li> I bought this for my toddler who wakes up with horrible bedhead every single morning. She has a rats nest in the back of her head everytime she sleeps.  Because of it, she gets split ends in the back, keeping her hair from growing well back there.  I&#x27;ve used this after her baths - before bed - to help prevent that.  Her hair has gotten silkier and smoother, and the rats nests are so much less!  I dare say it &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; the problem.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that it also works as a bit of a relaxer.  She has adorable, natural curls, and this started to relax them into waves.  I think she would have grown out of her curls anyway because of the type they are, but I wasn&#x27;t ready to let them go so I stopped using it (as a result, her hair is nappy again!)</li>
    <li> Love this product and it smells great.  Hair looks so healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I used to use regular it&#x27;s a 10 before I started treating my hair with Keratin.  She said I had to use \\&quot;special products\\&quot; to preserve the keratin.  I played along since I was happy with the results of the treatments.  One day I was in the beauty supply store and saw the keratin version of it&#x27;s a 10.  I was sold.  My hair looks and feels great.  Plus, the keratin is holding up better so I am able to extend the time between session.  Saving $ and looking great...  Thank you It&#x27;s a 10!</li>
    <li> The only thing I do to my hair is highlights/lowlights 2-3 times a year to battle the grey. I seldom blow dry it or flat iron it.  After my most recent color I couldn&#x27;t get a large tooth comb through my hair after my shower.  My hair is long, very long.  Almost to my waist. Usually when I get a color it&#x27;s a bit dry for a day, maybe two but after a month I knew something was wrong. A good friend who lives out of state who is a stylist suggested I buy this. She said it was a bit pricy but its better than cutting off all my hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe A. It&#x27;s 1/2 price on Amazon and B. it literally saved my hair!  I shower every day and I don&#x27;t need to use this every day. Maybe 4-5 times a week depending on how I wore my hair the day before and it smells fabulous. I purchased a 4oz bottles 6 weeks ago and I&#x27;m just about 1/2 way through it so its a great value compared to other product claiming to do the same things for your hair considering I use substantially more than the average user because of my hair length and hair situation/condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished off the bottle exactly 3 months after I received it so it&#x27;s a great value in my opinion.  At this point my hair is now down to my waist.  I wonder if the product is making my hair grow faster?  I do have faster than normal growing hair but I find this out of the ordinary even for me after reading my initial review from just 3 months ago.  I also find that my hair seems to feel healthier now than it did 3 months ago.  I know the damage that was done can not be reversed, I&#x27;m just waiting for my sister&#x27;s highly reccomended sylist to come off maternity leave to cut it all off! I will continue to use it after I get my hair fixed to battle the natural frizz I got from my mom and the odd curl/wave thing I got from my mom.  All in all for $12.99 every 3 month again, I say it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Maybe this isn&#x27;t the product for my hair, but I&#x27;m not noticing the wonders and benefits that others seem to after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;No shine, no &#x27;healthy feel&#x27;, no nothing--plus it smells pretty weird, like something I wouldn&#x27;t want to have someone smell in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing I don&#x27;t reap the awesome benefits because I rarely straighten my hair and keep it in it&#x27;s natural curly-coily state.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Not feeling it, but don&#x27;t let that discourage you from buying it! What may not work for others may work for you...</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I love it! Makes my hair shiny and smooth.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but It&#x27;s A 10 works best. Thinking of trying other products by this company.</li>
    <li> Heard about this hair care product on the Steve Harvey radio show....tried it and found out that it really works.  Now this is part of my hair conditioning and will always make it part of daily routine.</li>
    <li> LOVE how this makes my hair feel.  Very soft. Recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
    <li> I am cursed with the most static-y hair ever.  Nothing I have ever tried, and I have tried it all, has made a dent in the problem.  To make matters worse, I live in the rocky mountains and spend half of my life in dry heated rooms and nylon jackets.  I have long straight hair that typically clings to my face and stands straight on end.  All winter long it has to be tied up and I never let it down.  But not anymore.  This product is truly incredible and it leaves my hair looking shiny and fantastic.  Because my hair is so straight, I was worried that it might make it look greasy or heavy but honestly, my hair looks great and you would not know there is product on it.  Do yourself a favor and get this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product w/o the Keratin and the Keratin makes a world of difference.  My  hair is smooth, manageable and with body.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair super healthy and strong with consistent use. Love it. I will be ordering again. Only thing is it makes your hair a little sticky.</li>
    <li> It is great, what an awesome product. However, they charged me for 2, 4oz bottles, but shipped 2, 2oz bottles. Not sure if this is a trick or just a mistake.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I use it on my dry, bleached hair in between more intense conditioning treatments, and it works immediate miracles.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot--just make one or two spritzes into your head, then gently work it into your hair.  It makes the dry ends of my hair feel so much softer!</li>
    <li> keeps hair soft and super shiny, but not greasy. Really helps if you use a straightening iron!</li>
    <li> Awesome Product works very well for natural hair</li>
    <li> I had I expectations for the product but it just seems OK. I really can&#x27;t tell a difference. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> My daughter has super curly hair and it is ok for that hair type.</li>
    <li> This product is helping my hair that has been damaged by to much hard water</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and my daughter in law they both asked for it for Christmas. They love it.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. In fact, go google &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and do some research on how shampoo and conditioner and all these products are really just stressing our hair out. I had very frizzy hair that would not do anything and I stopped putting products in it cold turkey. It looked pretty bad for a while and I wore lots of pony tails, but it was the best thing I could have done. Now all I use for my hair is a little bit of baby shampoo to wash it at the most once a week. It is no longer the frizz ball that it was -- it actually will let me straighten it and it will stay very well. So stop giving away your money to these hair product companies. Don&#x27;t worry, they won&#x27;t go out of business, but you can save yourself some money and frustration.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying this product and I can honestly say I don&#x27;t need anything else. It&#x27;s the only hair product I&#x27;ve actually been blown away by. And it smells great.</li>
    <li> Yes, I agree with the other positive reviews.  This is a very good product!  I have long thick hair and this product makes my hair soft and manageable. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Miracle product! Great for long hair &amp; ppl on the go! Leaves your hair tangle free &amp; air drys to perfection! Same price as salons worth the price</li>
    <li> No softness, still get frizzy, not really nice smell. It only detangles my hair well. I have thin, long, damaged, dry baby hair. I really hope it works for my hair since it&#x27;s too expensive for a hair product. It only works the same as soy tri wheat leave in conditioner. The soy tri wheat leave in conditioner is even cheaper and smelt better.</li>
    <li> The product leave my hair very heavy and greasy, and I don&#x27;t use a lot of it! I will stay using the regular Leave-In.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve always loved this line of product and needed something that could strengthen my hair.  this did the trick and i love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I love the price. Best price available. So i would suggest it. great great</li>
    <li> This is another Holy grail for me. I have thin hair and its not greasy if you dont put too much.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and instead of putting stiff mousse or hairspray, I use this to keep the frizz at bay.  Of course, I also use when blow drying and styling too!</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty fine so I was scared to put leave in conditioner it but this stuff is great.  My hair feels smoother and it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> My hair is very damaged and fine. This product made my hair feel so shiny and soft. Great Seller. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Too heavy for fine/thin hair</li>
    <li> This product is okay, I thought it would be more miraculous :)  I get the Brazilian blowout twice a year and this is good for in between treatments.</li>
    <li> This product works great for de-tangeling after shampooing.  I would highly recommend this product if you are having issues with de-tangling.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much! perfect!</li>
