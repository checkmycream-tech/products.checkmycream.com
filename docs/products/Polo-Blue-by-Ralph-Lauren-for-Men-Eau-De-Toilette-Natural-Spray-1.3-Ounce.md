      <li>My grandson loved the smell of Polo and wears it everyday.  </li>
      <li>Only downside would be the projection in the 1st hour might be too strong for some.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>While it smells almost completely different from the kind I got, it still has some of the same ideas.</li>
      <li>Designed for an older woman.</li>
      <li>I like the general woodsy notes, and the longevity.(Easily 5-6 hours.)</li>

    <li> Got this for my dad on Father&#x27;s day and he absolutely loved it! This perfume smells amazing! The packaging was great too!</li>
    <li> Great cologne!  It has a pleasant smell thats not overpowering.  My wife loves when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I smelled this cologne at saphora it smelled good but somehow this one didn&#x27;t! It had an expired more like a perfume that was made in the 1920s! Designed for an older woman.,again people from experience never order a cologne based on hyped reviews. Take into account that there&#x27;s different smells that people tolerate on them.</li>
    <li> Service good, arrive on time like the website said, great price, i will do business again with this company, i recommended</li>

    <li> I have been using this for the last year or so. Love the smell! Definately recomment it anyone looking for a nice perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a great perfume for men, my boyfriend likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> I would award 4.5 stars if I could. I like the general woodsy notes, and the longevity.(Easily 5-6 hours.) Only downside would be the projection in the 1st hour might be too strong for some. I find the 1.3 and 2.5 oz. sizes to be very useful for carry ons, the shape is easy to grab (and keep) a hold on. Yet I could see someone liking this enough for signature scent being happy with 4.2, even 6.7 sizes. This product is on my repeat order list.</li>
    <li> Excellent, just as described, fast shipping.</li>

    <li> Product size was larger than expected</li>
    <li> Smells wonderfully! I bought as a gift for my husband. It&#x27;s one of his favorites.</li>
