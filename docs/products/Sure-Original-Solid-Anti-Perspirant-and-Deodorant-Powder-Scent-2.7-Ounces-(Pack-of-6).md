      <li>this seems to be the version when they changed from Powder Fresh to just Powder scent.  </li>
      <li>Sure original powder scent is the only product that works for me.</li>

      <li>In my opinion the new smell is much stronger and yet much more feminine.</li>

      <li>Sure solid powder fresh deodorant is the only kind I&#x27;ve ever used,now the stores only carry Sure powder fresh invisible deodorant,which I tried once,but will never buy again,so I&#x27;m glad I can purchase the Solid powder fresh on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love this product, don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not readily available in most stores.</li>
      <li>And I had to resort to ordering it online for the first time after I could no longer find it at any of the stores.</li>
      <li>I have used this same antiperspirant for more than 5 years but no longer.  </li>

      <li>when in fact when I normally buy stuff on line for the first time I will buy just 1</li>
      <li>In particular the powder scent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to have to hunt for a new antiperspirant now.</li>
      <li>Maybe they found a warehouse of some old stuff.  </li>
      <li>As this product has nearly disappeared from shelves, I gave this one a shot.  </li>
      <li>At least they are currently available online for now.  </li>
      <li>It is a delicate and clean scent.  </li>
      <li>that the company brought back the powder scent as she had a hard time looking for it in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, stays on and really works on her sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Can buy it locally so it&#x27;s perfect purchasing it online :)</li>
    <li> I have always used this product because I consider it very good quality. Has hitherto remained the same, so that seguire while using the same quality percamezca</li>
    <li> I have been using this kind (powder fresh) for years. And I had to resort to ordering it online for the first time after I could no longer find it at any of the stores. Well it just smells funny. It don&#x27;t smell like the one I use to buy in the store. And unfortunatly, I had to buy 6 of them...when in fact when I normally buy stuff on line for the first time I will buy just 1 so I don&#x27;t know why I did that. But anyway, after I use these up I will just have to go on a hunt again to find a deodorant that works. But no I will not buy this online anymore.</li>
    <li> This is my standard.  Especially like to delicate powder fragrance.  It is one deodorant that does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product several times. Because my friends recommended I feel good and like it.Thank you for the fast shipment. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this deodorant for my husband and I received a women&#x27;s deodorant. The picture of the product is a men&#x27;s deodorant and the one I recived is a very different product,</li>
    <li> Has Sure stopped selling this as all of my grocery stores have stopped carrying this Powder Scent version. I was very happy to find these online. I may have to stock up if they have indeed stopped selling them.  At least they are currently available online for now.  This pack of six came in perfect condition with no issues. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> The smell has changed recently.  They must have changed the formula.  I have used this same antiperspirant for more than 5 years but no longer.  In my opinion the new smell is much stronger and yet much more feminine. As a guy it&#x27;s an overpowering smell - much different than my last order.  I am still going to use Sure but it will be the unscented variety.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and a big guy who works around the office all day. I use SURE ONCE in the morning and I do not stink or sweat..all day..I smell great and SURE keeps my shirts from not smelling as well...PS I have used this since 2001</li>
    <li> I love sure in every way,it&#x27;s not in stores where I live.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see this product as it has been discontinued in the big box stores like Walmart. I had been looking for this item for a long time to no avail. product was delivered fast and the price was good. overall loved my purchase</li>
    <li> I love this deoderant because I got it at a great deal and it works all day and now I have more friends.</li>
    <li> The original Powder Scent/Powder Fresh original solid scent was great. It smelled just like baby powder and wasn&#x27;t too strong a smell. They changed the scent and now it smells like the original Sure scent, not the Powder scent! It also smells very strong and not as feminine. I found it impossible to find powder scent in stores near me, except in the invisible version which I hate. I&#x27;m going to have to hunt for a new antiperspirant now. Please Sure, change it back to what it was before and make sure all the drugstores, grocery stores and big box stores carry it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in any of the stores anymore and I am allergic to most of the fragrances of the products out there, so I was happy to find this. I hope that they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations after reading all the other reviews.  The scent was Baby Powder scented as it used to be buying it off the shelf.  I bought 6 of them as I recall and am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Sure original powder scent is the only product that works for me. Others itch or burn.  I&#x27;m done going from store to store hunting now that I can get a &amp;#34;six pack&amp;#34; of these right on Amazon</li>
    <li> As this product has nearly disappeared from shelves, I gave this one a shot.  For those of you who have used this for many years, you&#x27;ll be glad to know this seems to be the version when they changed from Powder Fresh to just Powder scent.  Maybe they found a warehouse of some old stuff.  It&#x27;s good as new as has almost no smell.  I&#x27;m very happy.  You better order soon before I order all of it!  LOL</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s all time favorite.  Impossible to find in local stores.  Packaging has evolved since the picture, but the labels &amp;#34;original solid&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;powder&lt;br /&gt;scent&amp;#34; are the same.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has been using this product and scent for sometime.&lt;br /&gt;Glad that the company brought back the powder scent as she had a hard time looking for it in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, stays on and really works on her sensitive skin. She loves the powder scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Price , the seller packed it well &amp; received. the items on time.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Makes me smell smooth, thanks</li>
    <li> Love this product, don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not readily available in most stores.</li>
    <li> Sure solid powder fresh deodorant is the only kind I&#x27;ve ever used,now the stores only carry Sure powder fresh invisible deodorant,which I tried once,but will never buy again,so I&#x27;m glad I can purchase the Solid powder fresh on Amazon.</li>
    <li> We have been using this anti perspirant for many years and so glad that the original solid is still available.  This is a great price for an item that we have depended on in the past and can still depend on now.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT SMELL LIKE IT USE TO</li>
    <li> This is my deodorant of choice and I am glad it is available on Amazon since I have found few retailers that sell it in stores.</li>
    <li> This has always been my deodorant of choice.  In particular the powder scent.  It is a delicate and clean scent.  I have to be careful about the deodorants that I use, because I have had a bad experience with another brand, but no adverse reactions with this brand and fragrance.</li>
