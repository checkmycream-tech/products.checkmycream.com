      <li>All I have to say is that I&#x27;m in love with the Nova LED light!  </li>
      <li>I love my Nova light, I had been looking into getting an LED light because doing my gel manicures were taking forever!  </li>
      <li>In addition,  the thumbs have to be done separately as the light is from the top, I figured.  </li>
      <li>I tried this Nova LED nail light to see if it produced better result than the cheaper models available.  </li>
      <li>The build quality is great and I absolutely love the pearl white sheen it has to it.  </li>
      <li>Makes at home manicures easy.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing and works super fast!!  </li>
      <li>I bought NOVA LED Nail light and also the smaller travel size based on the great reviews.  </li>
      <li>led light or ,Gelish 18G lamp.</li>
      <li>The Gelish just would not cure under the NOVA light --</li>
      <li>My manicures feel bulletproof after curing with this light.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy using gelish polish and this light cures faster than UV.  </li>
      <li>We have had 3 nail techs try this LED nail light</li>
      <li>This light works</li>
      <li>After learning about Nova LED nail light in an industry nail magazine, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
      <li>The lamp do not have the light on the side.</li>
      <li>My wife is a nail technician, so I purchased this light for her</li>
      <li>I try it because the price is cheap compare with those lamp</li>
      <li>It should have the light on the side like Opi</li>
      <li>I already own a small LED lamp, the one that came wit the sensational starter set, and while it is pretty good, the NOVA LED is just AMAZING, fast and cures so well.  </li>
      <li>This thing is fast!!!  </li>
      <li>WOW!!!!!!  </li>
      <li>Hope the review was helpful, and if you purchase this item you love it as much as I do!</li>
      <li>I originally purchased it for the use of my cnd shellac</li>
      <li>The first time I used this product I fell head over heels in LOVE.</li>
      <li>My girlfriends and I are now excited about our Gelish manicure parties.  </li>
      <li>That in itself makes the light worth the money.</li>
      <li>This cures my gelish at home manicures quickly.</li>
      <li>I also have the Red Carpet Manicure Professional LED nail light, it cost about $50 and works just a good as this one.  </li>
      <li>The colors came right off when I put on the topcoat.</li>
      <li>I kept getting excuses that it was stuck on a boat in the harbor (San Pedro, CA) and they would get it mailed out right away when they got it, took me 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>I cannot return the product right now since I did not use the product and discover the problem before I went traveling.  </li>
      <li>As a frequent competitor of nail art competitions and a salon owner, it is important for me and my nail technicians to use equipment that is speedy and durable.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for my OPI Gelcolor nails, because the UV lamps get so hot.</li>
      <li>All in all it&#x27;s an amazing product, but it&#x27;s not for someone who isn&#x27;t experienced, because like I said, the polish needs to be thin or it won&#x27;t cure properly.</li>
      <li>Some clients will put their hand in and after the first 30 seconds</li>
      <li>I love this lamp, my nails dry in 30 seconds, it is great, one tip, watch the thumb, sometimes if it does not see the light, the side facing down will not completely cure.</li>
      <li>The rest of my staff will be purchasing this light and it will be our new standard light here at our salon.</li>
      <li>Much faster than my old UV light.  </li>
      <li>I currently use the Thermal Spa UV lamp, which worked fine initially, but has gotten more tempermental as time as elapsed.  </li>
      <li>it will automatically go back on which is great for me while I&#x27;m working on the other hand.  </li>
      <li>I envy everyone who has the light worked for them quickly (10sec, 20sec, 30 sec.).  </li>
      <li>I recommend the cheaper light by Red Carpet Manicure.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it for anyone who wants to cure gel nails at home.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very well made</li>
      <li>Built well and much faster than the Thermal Spa 36 Watt UV nail dryer.</li>
      <li>The built in presets really help.</li>
      <li>, however had to return the light because it was not curing properly.  </li>
      <li>Thanks,</li>
      <li>She really loves it.</li>
      <li>Felt like it wasn&#x27;t very strong,and it didn&#x27;t work when I use it.</li>
      <li>and we love how our clients don&#x27;t need to cure their thumbs separately as they do with other LED lights on the market.  </li>
      <li>Ok so I usually never get manicures because I guess I&#x27;m rough on my hands.  </li>
      <li>With this NOVA light,  I never knew when the nails would dry or whether the cleaning alcohol would take it off.  </li>
      <li>I ALWAYS have my nails done now, and once you get the hang of it, they really do look professionally done.  </li>
      <li>It really beats the purpose if it takes 2 minutes for each layer and additional time for thumbs  -- my old UV lamp takes 2 minutes for each lay for BOTH hands (all 10 fingers).  </li>
      <li>Sent it back and the fun began.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be better because you can dry all 5 nails at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I am new to doing gel nails at home.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a nail technician for 15 years and caught on very early on gel polish.  </li>
      <li>After returning the light I purchased a small Red Carpet light and it works fine at less than half the cost of this light.</li>
      <li>As a Professional Nail Technician, I APPROVE!</li>
      <li>, this made it so much faster with barely any waiting.</li>
      <li>I actually apply sunblock to my hands &amp; fingers first.</li>
      <li>but at least it gives me beautifully shining nails and its performance is predictable.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone NOT to waste your money on this LED light.</li>
      <li>Gel color run down to the side and get wrinkle because the light is not enough power.</li>
      <li>The automatic timer is fabulous, however you do have to trigger the sensor, but it&#x27;s not difficult because of its placement, but if you move awkwardly it will turn on after the first cure time.</li>
      <li>I got home from my travels and used this light three times in the past month.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Very solid build quality and such a pretty Pearl White color.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> works on both shellac and gelish</li>
    <li> I am new to doing gel nails at home. I am not a professional. This light works well if you know what you are doing. I have been playing around with it and realize if you follow the instructions properly with your gel polish it will work perfect. I have noticed when I do my thumbs I tend to apply the polish a little thicker for some reason and cause them not to dry properly. Just take your time and apply the gel thinly in each step. The gelish works perfect. As one reviewer said dark colors take a little longer. I did try theSchellac  by cnd and it did not work to well, however, when I tried it some of the nails dried hard and some did not. So, it may just take some playing around. I may try it again and let you know how it goes. Just remember to follow the instructions ad they are different from the Gellish. The light is great. No replacing bulbs. That in itself makes the light worth the money. All five fingers will cure at the same time Just spread the fingers. The seller got the product to me in the time stated when I ordered. would order from them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail technician for 15 years and caught on very early on gel polish.  As a frequent competitor of nail art competitions and a salon owner, it is important for me and my nail technicians to use equipment that is speedy and durable.  After learning about Nova LED nail light in an industry nail magazine, I decided to give it a shot.  I found it for a great price on Amazon and am happy to say that it is our new workhorse at the salon.  This thing is fast!!!  It&#x27;s very well made and we love how our clients don&#x27;t need to cure their thumbs separately as they do with other LED lights on the market.

    <li> I tried this Nova LED nail light to see if it produced better result than the cheaper models available.  I thought it would be better because you can dry all 5 nails at the same time.  However, I found that it does not do a good job at drying the thumb nail.  Perhaps this is because the lights are all on the top, and not on the sides, and doesn&#x27;t make good contact with the side of the thumbnail.  I also have the Red Carpet Manicure Professional LED nail light, it cost about $50 and works just a good as this one.  You do have to dry your thumbs separately, but at least they get cured, and with this product, no, unless you dry your thumbs separately, which defeats the purpose of it!  I recommend the cheaper light by Red Carpet Manicure.  You get the same results for much less money.  I will be returning this and saving $150.  However, the company does charge a 15% restocking fee for returns.</li>
    <li> I love my Nova light, I had been looking into getting an LED light because doing my gel manicures were taking forever!  I found several that we&#x27;re less expensive, however the item description was unhelpful, the reviews were terrible, and none of them came with a warranty. The first time I used this product I fell head over heels in LOVE. Prior to purchasing this light my manicures were taking at least an hour, as I do prints on my nails, this made it so much faster with barely any waiting. The automatic timer is fabulous, however you do have to trigger the sensor, but it&#x27;s not difficult because of its placement, but if you move awkwardly it will turn on after the first cure time. I read a review that said it didn&#x27;t cure the thumb properly and I have never had troubles, I think the key is thin polish and spreading your fingers apart. All in all it&#x27;s an amazing product, but it&#x27;s not for someone who isn&#x27;t experienced, because like I said, the polish needs to be thin or it won&#x27;t cure properly. Hope the review was helpful, and if you purchase this item you love it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nova for curing gel nail polish and it works great. The automatic ON sensor works like a charm and I even get my thumbs cured at the same time.  Very solid build quality and such a pretty Pearl White color.  As a Professional Nail Technician, I APPROVE!</li>
    <li> Solid LED nail lamp.  Nice and even gel manicures every time I have used it. The built in presets really help.</li>
    <li> Built well and much faster than the Thermal Spa 36 Watt UV nail dryer. I use this specifically on Gelish and it works wonders. I got tired of having to replace the UV bulbs in my Thermal Spa. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This cures my gelish at home manicures quickly. Its very easy to use and the automatic on sensor is a neat feature.</li>
    <li> This item arrives in a box surrounded with foam and neatly packaged, however no instructions.  There are several switches on the machine so you have to wing it to figure out how to operate.</li>
    <li> This lamp does cure well. Although, I like to limit my use of UV lamps. I actually apply sunblock to my hands &amp; fingers first. The lamp is great though!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and works super fast!!  I love the way that the product is shaped in a \\&quot;U\\&quot; so it accomidates all five fingers.</li>
    <li> I just received it today, and I have tried on two different people a Shellac manicure.  It would not cure it.  I even tried curing for two minutes, and nothing at all.  This is not for people looking to add to there Shellac services.  I am looking at the Ikonna or the actual CND lamp.  I currently use the Thermal Spa UV lamp, which worked fine initially, but has gotten more tempermental as time as elapsed.  This lamp I&#x27;ve had for almost two years.  As I write this, I am going to order the CND lamp.</li>
    <li> We have had 3 nail techs try this LED nail light and this product does not cure gel nails. We have tried every way and time possible and it still does not do what described. I would recommend to anyone NOT to waste your money on this LED light. Spend a few extra dollars on something that works!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is that I&#x27;m in love with the Nova LED light!  It couldn&#x27;t be easier to use and so much cheaper than all the other competing lights!  The build quality is great and I absolutely love the pearl white sheen it has to it.  My girlfriends and I are now excited about our Gelish manicure parties.  We&#x27;re all collecting and sharing colors J     This is truly one SPEEDY light!  I can&#x27;t believe how long my manicures last now.  My manicures feel bulletproof after curing with this light.  Needless to say, I urge everyone to choose Nova LED lights over Gelish!</li>
    <li> Ok so I usually never get manicures because I guess I&#x27;m rough on my hands.  After 2 days its chipped, scratched, and dull.  I was at the salon and the lady that does my pedi said I had to try Gel nail polish and that they promised it would stay on without any chips and shinny for at least 2 weeks.  So I gave it a try, and WOW!!!!!!  One problem, it expensive to get your nails done every 2 weeks with this polish.  I decided to buy the things needed to do my nails my self.  I was not sure if I was willing to pay $50 for the UV dryer let alone $200 for the LED.  After leaving it in my cart for a couple weeks I decided to go for it.  I have used it about ten times now and I am Sooooooo glad I got this one.  30 seconds  to 1 minute and my gel nails are totally dry!!  The dryer at my salon is UV so you have to put your nails in for several minutes for each layer of gel polish.  This doesn&#x27;t seam bad, but when your doing your own nails its totally different.  You can paint your other hand while the other is in the dryer like at the salon because you only have two hands, not 4.  Also I considered getting the dryer that had room for 2 hands, but now after using this one, I realize that would have been a total waste.  You risk smudging your other hand and why do that when it only takes 30 seconds to dry them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who is debating this, get it!!  I pulled my hands out of the dryer the other day then went straight to gardening with garden gloves on and my nails looked perfect when I was done.</li>
    <li> Felt like it wasn&#x27;t very strong,and it didn&#x27;t work when I use it. The colors came right off when I put on the topcoat.</li>
    <li> I love this lamp, my nails dry in 30 seconds, it is great, one tip, watch the thumb, sometimes if it does not see the light, the side facing down will not completely cure.</li>
    <li> This lamp is just amazing, I got today and could not wait to use it.  I already own a small LED lamp, the one that came wit the sensational starter set, and while it is pretty good, the NOVA LED is just AMAZING, fast and cures so well.  I used it with the gelish nail polish and my nails were done in under 5 minutes both hands.  My lamp came packed well and had the user manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty happy with that purchase</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Enjoy using gelish polish and this light cures faster than UV.  Like the preset time intervals of 10, 20 and 30 sec.  Work with the times set for gelish polish (foundation, polish and topcoat).  Happy User!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.  Very easy to use and I love how there&#x27;s no need to replace the bulbs.  Much faster than my old UV light.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants to cure gel nails at home.  Because every color is different, you just have to learn to play around with different curing times depending on the color shade and whether or not it is a metallic color.  No all formulas of gel are the same!</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this LED lamp for my birthday.  A few months ago, I purchased a UV lamp on Amazon for around $50.  It worked great, but with doing usually 3 color coats, plus a base coat and top coat, it was taking a long time.  This lamp is awesome because it only takes 20 seconds for the base coat and lighter colors, and 30 seconds for dark colors.  Plus it turns on automatically when you place your hands inside it.  I ALWAYS have my nails done now, and once you get the hang of it, they really do look professionally done.  I have been using the Gelish base and top coat, and either Gelish polish or Red Carpet Manicure from Ulta.  I am so glad I got the LED lamp to replace the UV one!!</li>
    <li> This NOVA light design is very nice and I love the fact that I can cure five finger at once, however had to return the light because it was not curing properly.  I had problems with the gel shrinking and/or not curing.  After returning the light I purchased a small Red Carpet light and it works fine at less than half the cost of this light.</li>
    <li> Nice sleek size for my station but a little disappointed that the light function doesn&#x27;t work the same each time.  Some clients will put their hand in and after the first 30 seconds it will automatically go back on which is great for me while I&#x27;m working on the other hand.  Other times it just doesn&#x27;t and I have to stop and manually put it back on.  Wish it had a 1 and 2 minute setting too.  I originally purchased it for the use of my cnd shellac but it doesn&#x27;t cure that in 30 seconds so I have to put the clients hand in 4 times.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my OPI Gelcolor nails, because the UV lamps get so hot. I had this and tried it a couple times and it just did not cure well at all. Sent it back and the fun began. I had a hard time getting the lamp to begin with. I kept getting excuses that it was stuck on a boat in the harbor (San Pedro, CA) and they would get it mailed out right away when they got it, took me 3 weeks. When I had to send it back, because it was faulty, they would not accept delivery and USPS had to leave them the pink slip, about the delivery. I then had to file a claim with Amazon (thank GOD for Amazon), I&#x27;m not waiting to get my money back, will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> My wife is a nail technician, so I purchased this light for her and it has worked out perfect. She really loves it. Thanks,</li>
    <li> I using UV lights for 2 years ,it work so well .I want to replace to led lights for the best services to client .But this led lamp is so poor quality. The thumb nail doesn&#x27;t dry. Gel color run down to the side and get wrinkle because the light is not enough power. The lamp do not have the light on the side.It should have the light on the side like Opi led light or ,Gelish 18G lamp.I try it because the price is cheap compare with those lamp but it do not work.Wasting my time . Two clients were not happy with the thumb problem, I have to fix by using my uv light ,...I have to pay $12 for return shipping .</li>
    <li> I bought NOVA LED Nail light and also the smaller travel size based on the great reviews.  I was traveling and used the small one for 4 months  -- it takes a long time to cure but I think because it was smaller so less power.  I got home from my travels and used this light three times in the past month.  I am so disappointed and upset that I spent $200 for nothing.  The Gelish just would not cure under the NOVA light -- it&#x27;s wet after 1 minute - 2 minutes and the alcohol would take it partially off when doing the final cleaning. (Horrible! I have to redo...)  I decide to go for 2 minutes for each layer and after the final cleaning, it still would not be as shining as using the UV lamp.  In addition,  the thumbs have to be done separately as the light is from the top, I figured.  It really beats the purpose if it takes 2 minutes for each layer and additional time for thumbs  -- my old UV lamp takes 2 minutes for each lay for BOTH hands (all 10 fingers).  I cannot return the product right now since I did not use the product and discover the problem before I went traveling.  The small one ($89) took about 2 minutes for each layer but it&#x27;s compact enough for traveling.  I have to go back to use my old UV lamp but at least it gives me beautifully shining nails and its performance is predictable.  With this NOVA light,  I never knew when the nails would dry or whether the cleaning alcohol would take it off.  I envy everyone who has the light worked for them quickly (10sec, 20sec, 30 sec.).  I have experimented several ways but the results were the same disappointing.</li>
    <li> Works great to cure Gelish product and no lights to replace. Makes at home manicures easy. My girls and I love it!</li>
