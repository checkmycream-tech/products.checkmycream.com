      <li>A great find!</li>

      <li>I thought this product by Curel would be an excellent am alternative.  </li>
      <li>Nothing but a very good Dove soap made even the slightest difference.</li>
      <li>Great moisturizer for the winter season.</li>
      <li>It provides great moisture for people who suffer from kp or psoriasis</li>
      <li>/&gt;Curel helps us at our home look and feel happy every</li>
      <li>I tried this product and it felt great.</li>
      <li>This one is the happy medium that I prefer.</li>
      <li>This lotion feels great on my skin.</li>
      <li>Very nice.  </li>
      <li>it is fairly odorless, which is good if one does aromatherapy</li>
      <li>and I am on my feet a good part of that time.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;watered-down&amp;#34; so it stays on the skin for a while, which is good.</li>
      <li>One of the best featutes is that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like some moisturizers can.  </li>
      <li>No scent, which is nice.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s probably best to use it in the morning and at night There isn&#x27;t much scent to it either, which I prefer.</li>
      <li>i am always searching for a good skin lotion that is rich and nourishing and lends a sheen to my skin after i apply it.</li>
      <li>I find that it does keep me moisturized throughout most of the day.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>My hands feel so much better.</li>
      <li>I like alphahydroxy lotions a lot - my skin seems to do better when I use them.</li>
      <li>I also find that it tends to sit on top of the skin more than absorbs into it --</li>
      <li>The pump works well and dispenses an appropriate amount with  just one pump.  </li>
      <li>I think it is working as I don&#x27;t have so many bumps</li>
      <li>This is a better brand for the budget.</li>
      <li>However, I feel that I got better results from CeraVe&#x27;s SA renewing cream, which transformed my skin but was too sticky to wear during the day time.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work better at healing than softening.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that it is any better than a comparable quality lotion</li>
      <li>I love this lotion.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>Curel has consistently been a good brand name for us.  </li>
      <li>It is great to use on your hands after frequent washing.  </li>
      <li>This is a good lotion at a reasonable price from Curel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is for treating those symptoms, but it works great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>Has a nice, non-greasy texture that absorbs right away.</li>
      <li>Even though this product is not the best rough skin treatment I have used, it is very economical and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I have used better.  </li>
      <li>; We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is excellent if we frequently wash our hands, and that I do, in particular when at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paper can sometimes stick to one another</li>
      <li>The scent is fine.  </li>
      <li>To my surprise, it worked better than any foot cream I had ever used, healing the cracks quickly and softening the skin.  </li>
      <li>This Curel lotion feels light and breathable.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t think this lotion is really that amazing to justify its price.</li>
      <li>i smooth this on then</li>
      <li>This is a heavy, scentless cream, excellent for flaky areas like lower legs where you need heavy-duty moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>This is not the super-thick kind like a hand/feet lotion/cream, but a very spreadable lotion.</li>
      <li>Such a welcome relief.</li>
      <li>(too many don&#x27;t) and dispenses just the right amount of lotion.  </li>
      <li>the best way to combat this is to use just a small amount of lotion, rub it in, wait 5-10 minutes, then do it again.</li>
      <li>handy easy pump dispenser locks closed too :)</li>
      <li>Works great on very dry skin.</li>
      <li>Great for those rough patches one can get-</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell sweet.  </li>
      <li>It soaks quickly into the skin and there is not a feeling of having a layer of grease on the skin.  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time, has a very light scent, and feels refreshing.</li>
      <li>Curel Rough Skin Rescue is good lotion.  </li>
      <li>It is nice to have a moisturizer that stays with me all day long from the time I apply it in the morning.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>Again, CeraVe still provides more impressive results in a day&#x27;s time, but this is okay as a less expensive alternative.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the waxy feel this left on the skin whenever I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;There are probably many situations where it would be beneficial, but would not be my choice for an all around lotion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>exactly sure what Curel&#x27;s description of &amp;#34;rough skin&amp;#34; is, but I think it may not be quite the same as my description.  </li>
      <li>but it is on the higher end and does work as advertised</li>
      <li>I use it on my legs mostly because they have been pretty dry with the summer heat.</li>
      <li>It does however work FAR better and lasts longer than a great many other drugstore lotions, including other versions of Curel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a soft light-feeling lotion that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, smells very light and fresh and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has no discernible scent and it goes on nice and thick and absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>The Rough Skin Rescue version has that typical &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; kind of smell that all super strong lotions have, which I&#x27;m not fond of.</li>
      <li>I also garden and my hands dry out even more than the rest of my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I personally need additional, thick lotion/cream for my hands/cuticles and feet, but this is a very good all-over lotion.</li>
      <li>I try to remember to put some on every morning when I am getting ready, but sometimes I do forget.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do so great on my really rough, dry feet, but for someone who has only mild roughness on their soles, this might be just strong enough.</li>
      <li>, this works really well.</li>
      <li>It is much softer and smoother.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nothing has gotten worse, but I suspect I&#x27;ll need a longer period of time to see if things improve, let alone greatly.</li>
      <li>I have always used another product that is made for rough skin and have been pleased with it</li>
      <li>It has a nice light feel, but heavy enough to keep the dry winter skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>but when I use this lotion, my hands are able to separate the most difficult of stacks.</li>
      <li>Also the high price discourages me from using it.</li>
      <li>A little sticky but my hands look immensely better.</li>
      <li>This cream works very well and makes my skin soft and moist.</li>
      <li>This lotion feels nice on the hands but it stays greasy so you have to at least wipe it off of your palms with a tissue.  </li>
      <li>Recommended, if you don&#x27;t live in a high sunlight area and if you like &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
      <li>The Curel Rough Ski Rescue is a nice product that does help moisturize my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>That being said, Curel Rough Skin Rescue is less expensive than some of the more effective formulas that I have tried and it also has a more convenient delivery system.  </li>
      <li>Their lotions typically rub in easily, without any residue.</li>
      <li>This is a rather thick and rich lotion that takes a while to get absorbed.</li>
      <li>Hence, it is better for rough dry parts of your body (elbows, knees, feet and hands) rather than for the face.  </li>
      <li>Because I wash my hands frequently with antibacterial soap and my fingers are often exposed to alcohol (I teach health care),</li>
      <li>and it is not heavy.  </li>
      <li>The 13 ounce container offers a generous supply of lotion.</li>
      <li>No matter what I do, I can&#x27;t manage to keep them soft.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this product does as advertised.  </li>
      <li>It truly does a nice job on keeping rough skin under control without a heavy greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>I have used many lotions that are either too runny or too thick.</li>
      <li>you work all day long with reports, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Really moisturizes and helps to exfoliate rough skin.</li>
      <li>It worked OK, but no better than any other cream.</li>
      <li>Curel instantly quenches dryness and absorbs quickly into skin, leaving it very soft and comfortable, but unfortunately the effects don&#x27;t last nearly as long as other moisturizing lotions I’ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I only use this on my hands and feet just before bed, which are dry especially around my cuticles, and so this is part of my normal routine, and then I do my nightly book reading.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but I have used better.  The product does what it claims.  It provides great moisture for people who suffer from kp or psoriasis (the latter I suffer from).  However, I feel that I got better results from CeraVe&#x27;s SA renewing cream, which transformed my skin but was too sticky to wear during the day time.  I thought this product by Curel would be an excellent am alternative.  It is great to use on your hands after frequent washing.  However, when I tried to apply this lotion all over, the smell made me want to gag.  It is probably the lactic acid because Amlactin and Gold Bond&#x27;s Rough and Bumpy cream both reek of this spoiled milk odor.  It is a smell I just cannot cope with, so I just use it for spot treatment- elbows, knees, heels/feet, hands, etc.  Again, CeraVe still provides more impressive results in a day&#x27;s time, but this is okay as a less expensive alternative.  Oh and don&#x27;t forget to wear sunscreen because alpha hydroxy acids sensitize your to the sun making the potential for sunburn increase.</li>
    <li> A little sticky but my hands look immensely better.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for the winter season. It has a nice light feel, but heavy enough to keep the dry winter skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a heavy, scentless cream, excellent for flaky areas like lower legs where you need heavy-duty moisturizing.  A little goes a long way, too.</li>
    <li> I used to get this by prescription for one of my sons who has very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now all you have to do is order it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;If you have severely dry skin, start here!&lt;br /&gt;Try Curel Rough Skin Rescue.&lt;br /&gt;See if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that it always works painlessly and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is never out of reach at my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel helps us at our home look and feel happy every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  handy easy pump dispenser locks closed too :)</li>
    <li> Very nice.  I chose this product because I have the worst hands!  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks, and I like the way it sinks in and doesn&#x27;t leave me slimy handed.  I also appreciate the pump, which works (too many don&#x27;t) and dispenses just the right amount of lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t smell sweet.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s &#x27;rescued&#x27; my rough hands, but I intend to find out.  The 13 ounce container offers a generous supply of lotion.</li>
    <li> This product review of the Curel Rough Skin Rescue, 13 ounce is part of my obligation to Amazon for accepting to be a member of the Vine program, a club of selected customers that provide opinions about &amp;#34;new and pre-released items.&amp;#34; We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is excellent if we frequently wash our hands, and that I do, in particular when at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paper can sometimes stick to one another but when I use this lotion, my hands are able to separate the most difficult of stacks. The hands have improved because of the essential hydration that results after using this product, It contains oil that soothes and softens the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you work all day long with reports, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great on very dry skin. I live in a very low humidity climate and my hands and body get very dried and rough. This cream works very well and makes my skin soft and moist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jergens Ultra Healing lotion for YEARS.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and leaves my skin soft.  I like this lotion too.  It takes a bit longer to dry on my skin but I think it may even leave it softer.  The scent is fine.  I ride a metro bus every day and work closely with people.  I don&#x27;t need a perfumey scent to bother others.  I would buy this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually disappointed with the texture of heavy-duty lotions. I often feel like my skin can&#x27;t breathe after applying them. This Curel lotion feels light and breathable. Such a welcome relief. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about a month now on my elbows and legs where my skin tends to get rough and flakey. It&#x27;s noticeably smoother and silkier than when I started.</li>
    <li> Keeps my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion at a reasonable price from Curel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin, my husband is perpetually ashy, and our son has eczema, so we demand a lot from our lotion brands.  Curel has consistently been a good brand name for us.  Their lotions typically rub in easily, without any residue. And they relieve itchiness, and my skin stays hydrated throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I recently discuvered Cerave&#x27;s baby lotion, and that is the gold star of lotion brands.  It rubs in smoother than anything I&#x27;ve had from Curel.  However, it is also more expensive (compare the prices per ounce).  This is a better brand for the budget.</li>
    <li> I can be a little picky about my lotions, but I really like this one because it does not have a fragrance and it is not heavy.  It is definitely a lotion I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It has the perfect consistency. I have used many lotions that are either too runny or too thick. This one is the happy medium that I prefer. I use it on my legs mostly because they have been pretty dry with the summer heat. I notice that my legs are not looking as dry as they did previously, even when I do not use the lotion on a regular basis. I try to remember to put some on every morning when I am getting ready, but sometimes I do forget. When I run out of this lotion I will definitely be purchasing another bottle of it.</li>
    <li> Lotions have gotten so expensive, it&#x27;s difficult to know which ones to trust. Curel is a brand that&#x27;s been around for awhile and I needed some rough skin rescued, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My elbows have been a sore subject all my life. No matter what I do, I can&#x27;t manage to keep them soft. They stay rough even if I baby them. At one point, I was applying (regular) lotion 3x a day, with elbow covers to lock in the moisture, hoping that would help. Nothing but a very good Dove soap made even the slightest difference. It became so time-consuming, at one point, I just gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing the ad for this Curel, though, I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve now been using this lotion for about two weeks (only once a day) and have seen a dramatic improvement on my elbows and my skin. Although I bought it for my elbows, it&#x27;s also helped moisturize my legs, arms, and feet. I&#x27;m starting to feel like my skin is younger and less old-looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son also has dry skin issues with his feet, and we&#x27;ve been using this to stop the dry skin pockets on the bottom. It hasn&#x27;t completely got rid of the dry skin on his feet, but it seems to have decreased the number of blisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is not in my comfort zone, but I suppose I will pay that little extra for the dry skin rescuing I received. I will be looking for sales though, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this if I didn&#x27;t have dry skin issues.</li>
    <li> Curel Rough Skin Rescue is good lotion.  And if you apply it fairly regularly it will help rough skin.  I can&#x27;t say that it is any better than a comparable quality lotion but it is on the higher end and does work as advertised so that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> No scent, which is nice. There was no sting when I applied it to areas with bug bites that had been scratched a little. Has a nice, non-greasy texture that absorbs right away. This is not the super-thick kind like a hand/feet lotion/cream, but a very spreadable lotion. Seems to work well on elbows. I personally need additional, thick lotion/cream for my hands/cuticles and feet, but this is a very good all-over lotion.</li>
    <li> This works for me. I like that it helps make my elbows and knees feel smoother by helping remove flakes of dead skin. It lasts a long time, has a very light scent, and feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> Only been using about two weeks, and mostly on my horribly abused heels.  Miracle Foot Cream didn&#x27;t really seem to help in the long run, but at least Curel is keeping things in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing has gotten worse, but I suspect I&#x27;ll need a longer period of time to see if things improve, let alone greatly. But it seems to maintain where I am and considering it&#x27;s summer and I am being tough on the feet, that is saying something.</li>
    <li> We used this product for 2 weeks and it did help with the dryness and roughness. It is a bit pricey, so I would recommend it for users who have moderate to severe dryness.</li>
    <li> Curel instantly quenches dryness and absorbs quickly into skin, leaving it very soft and comfortable, but unfortunately the effects don&#x27;t last nearly as long as other moisturizing lotions I’ve tried.  It does however work FAR better and lasts longer than a great many other drugstore lotions, including other versions of Curel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a soft light-feeling lotion that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy, smells very light and fresh and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The Curel Rough Ski Rescue is a nice product that does help moisturize my dry skin.  I&#x27;m not sure exactly sure what Curel&#x27;s description of &amp;#34;rough skin&amp;#34; is, but I think it may not be quite the same as my description.  Because I wash my hands frequently with antibacterial soap and my fingers are often exposed to alcohol (I teach health care), the skin on my hands and around my fingernails is extremely dry and &amp;#34;crusty.&amp;#34;  I have tried several different types of lotion and cream designed to treat rough skin.  Curel Rough Skin Rescue worked well, but I have found that other products (especially cream type formulas) do work a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;  That being said, Curel Rough Skin Rescue is less expensive than some of the more effective formulas that I have tried and it also has a more convenient delivery system.  The pump works well and dispenses an appropriate amount with  just one pump.  If the Curel lotion had a creamier texture, I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;  Even though this product is not the best rough skin treatment I have used, it is very economical and easy to use.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and will recommend it to others with similar skin issues</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the waxy feel this left on the skin whenever I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;There are probably many situations where it would be beneficial, but would not be my choice for an all around lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early sixties so my skin is getting fairly dry.  I also garden and my hands dry out even more than the rest of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m always applying lotion to my hands and often to my arms, this isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d choose to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work well for overnight moisturizing of the feet or hands if you wore socks or gloves, but there are many less expensive products that can be used for that type of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like the waxy, slightly tacky feeling it creates whenever it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> Great for those rough patches one can get- I have mine on my elbows. Really moisturizes and helps to exfoliate rough skin.</li>
    <li> I got this for my very dry feet that also itch towards the end of the day. My days can be up 14-16 hours long and I am on my feet a good part of that time. It is nice to have a moisturizer that stays with me all day long from the time I apply it in the morning. It was only a couple of days when I noticed the difference in my skin. It is much softer and smoother. A great find!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, so I tried this on my hands and arms. It worked OK, but no better than any other cream. What really impressed me, though, was when I tried it on my feet, which had cracks on the heels. To my surprise, it worked better than any foot cream I had ever used, healing the cracks quickly and softening the skin.  It seems to work better at healing than softening. I&#x27;m definitely buying this when my sample is finished.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this product does as advertised.  I have always used another product that is made for rough skin and have been pleased with it so Curel had to do something to make me change.  It did.  It truly does a nice job on keeping rough skin under control without a heavy greasy feeling.  That is the key in my recommending this product.  It soaks quickly into the skin and there is not a feeling of having a layer of grease on the skin.  Recommend trying.</li>
    <li> The CUREL ROUGH SKIN RESCUE LOTION works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no discernible scent and it goes on nice and thick and absorbs pretty quickly. Although it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after feel, it does leave my skin with a tacky feeling for a bit after applying. I only use this on my hands and feet just before bed, which are dry especially around my cuticles, and so this is part of my normal routine, and then I do my nightly book reading. It is during this time that I feel that tacky feeling on my skin, but it goes away after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was a little concerned that this product would further dry out my skin because of the label&#x27;s description about speeding up the skin&#x27;s exfoliation process that removes dry, flaky skin, but it didn&#x27;t do that at all. That must be happening on a cellular level because you don&#x27;t see any dry skin flaking off or shedding away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have psoriasis so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is for treating those symptoms, but it works great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a rather thick and rich lotion that takes a while to get absorbed. Hence, it is better for rough dry parts of your body (elbows, knees, feet and hands) rather than for the face.  I find that it does keep me moisturized throughout most of the day. it&#x27;s probably best to use it in the morning and at night There isn&#x27;t much scent to it either, which I prefer. But I don&#x27;t think this lotion is really that amazing to justify its price. Twenty five bucks is just not worth it.</li>
    <li> This lotion feels nice on the hands but it stays greasy so you have to at least wipe it off of your palms with a tissue.  Since it is for rough skin, I have been trying it on my elbows - I think it is working as I don&#x27;t have so many bumps or they are smoother now.  It takes a while for things to work and I have only had this for few weeks (less than a month).  The plastic bottle and the pump handle are thick and sturdy.</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris (sometimes called chicken skin) on my upper arms.  I have tried virtually every moisterizer on the market for it.  I did find one other one that worked, but it cost almost thirty dollars for a small tube, so that was not an option for someone on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finding this one works if I apply it twice daily (the other was once daily).  One of the best featutes is that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like some moisturizers can.  This will be a regular purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I like alphahydroxy lotions a lot - my skin seems to do better when I use them. However, I am torn about this lotion. Yes, it has alphahydroxy in it. It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;watered-down&amp;#34; so it stays on the skin for a while, which is good. However, I do live in a desert with lots of sun, so the high probability of getting a bad sunburn while using this product (and for a week afterwards!) makes me not want to use it after all. Also the high price discourages me from using it. Recommended, if you don&#x27;t live in a high sunlight area and if you like &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular user of Curel Ultra Healing and was curious to see how this one would compare. I have rough skin on the ends of my fingers and this lotion helps control that. The Rough Skin Rescue version has that typical &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; kind of smell that all super strong lotions have, which I&#x27;m not fond of. I also find that it tends to sit on top of the skin more than absorbs into it -- the best way to combat this is to use just a small amount of lotion, rub it in, wait 5-10 minutes, then do it again. If you don&#x27;t do that, the next time you wash your hands the lotion completely disappears and your hands are as dry as they were before. However, on skin I don&#x27;t wash several times a day, like elbows and legs, this works really well. It didn&#x27;t do so great on my really rough, dry feet, but for someone who has only mild roughness on their soles, this might be just strong enough.</li>
    <li> i am always searching for a good skin lotion that is rich and nourishing and lends a sheen to my skin after i apply it. and i have been looking vainly for one since nivea discontinued their skin oil. maybe nivea will bring their oil back. in the mean time while i wait, this lotion is a worthy substitute. it is fairly odorless, which is good if one does aromatherapy (and i do) but i wouldn&#x27;t put the oil in the lotion. i smooth this on then i apply a few drops of oil over it. heaven!</li>
    <li> This lotion feels great on my skin. My hands were so dry from constant washing my hands at work. I tried this product and it felt great. Soaked into my skin after a few minutes. My hands feel so much better.</li>
