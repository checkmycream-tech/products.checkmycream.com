    <li> This product works very nicely on my natural curly hair.</li>
    <li> Ok so I got to say I&#x27;m actually Hispanic, long straight hair and I loooooove this stuff. It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll use on my hair. I use to be in the military and had to have a neat bun. I have short hair in the back of my point tail that looks nappy, I hate gels because it leaves that white residu and I don&#x27;t like washing my hair everyday, that&#x27;s one is the reasons I keep it really healthy. I found this at Walmart one day and decided to try it, I also read a person left a review to use a brush, so I did. Man, my hair looks neat, it doesn&#x27;t come apart, when I don&#x27;t wash it, it does get a little hard, but no white stuff!!! I notice Walmart is always out of it, so I but mine here in packs... One will last me about a month. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m a believer, I love this stuff, and highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my pictures I have a before and after. I just put some creme on a small patch so you can see the difference. It&#x27;s really not the greatest picture but it puts away all the freeze hairs and adds a natural shine</li>
    <li> got it cause my sister recommended it Love it</li>
    <li> I have 100% virgin black hair and I love this product. I use it to make my fly-aways stay in place, as well as for my edges. I use it on my daughters as well. It is less greasy than a lot of products on the market and it does not flake.</li>
    <li> Was melted when I got it spilled or something in the bag was not so happy wish I can get a replacement</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product. I used several edge control product, but this is my choice.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, or heavy and its perfect for the perfect pony tail.</li>

    <li> Great Shipping ! I have really curly hair and wanted to try this product and it doesn&#x27;t hold my edges. I&#x27;ll stick with Olive Oil edge control.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love it! Being an African America female, edges can sometimes be a struggle! It holds my edges ALL day! I love this one soo much better than olive oil. All you need is a little bit and it goes along way. Will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
