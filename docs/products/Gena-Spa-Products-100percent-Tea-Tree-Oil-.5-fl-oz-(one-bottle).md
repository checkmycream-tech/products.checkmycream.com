### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!!</li>
      <li>This is the BEST tea tree oil on the market.</li>
      <li>The best Tea Tree oil out there.  </li>

      <li>Good product!</li>
      <li>Great for cuts, acne and insect bites.</li>
      <li>Great for nail fungus</li>
      <li>I have been using it with good results on my hands, where an allergy to nickel causes everlasting, itchy dermatitis, and makes me scratch and scratch; there&#x27;s been some infection too, as a result.  </li>
      <li>Can stay good for years.</li>
      <li>I am also finding good results on my toes, where I&#x27;ve had athlete&#x27;s foot for perhaps 15 years.  </li>
      <li>Works great for keeping toenails nice.</li>
      <li>Good item, good price, good service.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for acne and many skin problems.</li>
      <li>I love that it has a brush for application.</li>
      <li>Pleased with this.</li>
      <li>:) Avnet been able to tree fell any difference.</li>
      <li>Powerful and healing!</li>
      <li>Gena isn&#x27;t the best tea tree oil I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job (just takes a few more days than high quality brands).</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This did not dry my skin out in fact, it made it look better, brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never be without it!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t come with a dropplet easy to spill and pour too much</li>
      <li>Gena Tea Tree Oil is one handy little product that comes to us from Australia, and has many beauty uses.  </li>
      <li>its amazing, totally reccomend</li>
      <li>Never any success.  </li>
      <li>Product is great but should come with a dropper, so you don&#x27;t waste your product when trying to use it!</li>
      <li>and I will definitely be purchasing more tree tea oil soon</li>
      <li>Oz is, of course, known for many unique animals, such as kangaroo and koala bear, but it&#x27;s also home to many unique forms of plant life, one of the rarer being the Australian Tea tree that&#x27;s found only in New South Wales.</li>
      <li>It is a gentle antiseptic cleanser for the face.  </li>
      <li>Arrived fast.</li>
      <li>High recommend from this seller!</li>
      <li>Also really food for stimulating the scalp &amp; promoting hair growth.</li>
      <li>and so many other uses.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>If you want to use something natural that heals very well---this is it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and even opted for the nice big bottle @ walmart---but it did nothing.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, it&#x27;s a powerful organic solvent, and can actually penetrate into skin layers and beneath fingernails.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a mild local anesthetic, and as such, will soothe cuts and burns.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this tea tree oil for a rash I developed on my legs.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that I&#x27;m not disappointed with the results only been using for about less then a week</li>
      <li>It is a natural antiseptic and fungus fighter, and has been used by Aussies since the turn of the 20th century.  </li>
      <li>Straight from the label:  &amp;#34;WARNING:  This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve never known what&#x27;s so bad about athlete&#x27;s foot, but if I can actually clear it up, have to think that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>

    <li> This is my second time buying Tea Tree oil and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I use it tropically on my skin to combat acne. A pimple disappears in four days! High recommend from this seller!</li>
    <li> It is a gentle antiseptic cleanser for the face.  I use it with Vitamin E oil.  Good product!</li>
    <li> Gena Tea Tree Oil is one handy little product that comes to us from Australia, and has many beauty uses.  Oz is, of course, known for many unique animals, such as kangaroo and koala bear, but it&#x27;s also home to many unique forms of plant life, one of the rarer being the Australian Tea tree that&#x27;s found only in New South Wales. It is a natural antiseptic and fungus fighter, and has been used by Aussies since the turn of the 20th century.  It&#x27;s also a mild local anesthetic, and as such, will soothe cuts and burns.  Furthermore, it&#x27;s a powerful organic solvent, and can actually penetrate into skin layers and beneath fingernails.  Its folk remedy claims have been proven by medical science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended for itchy scalp, minor cuts and abrasions, rashes, dry skin and dermatitis, nail infection and athlete&#x27;s foot, also for foot odor, minor burns, and after shaving and/or leg waxing.  I have been using it with good results on my hands, where an allergy to nickel causes everlasting, itchy dermatitis, and makes me scratch and scratch; there&#x27;s been some infection too, as a result.  I am also finding good results on my toes, where I&#x27;ve had athlete&#x27;s foot for perhaps 15 years.  I&#x27;ve tried prescriptions from dermatologists and podiatrists, over the counter preparations from every health food store in the land, and from various nail salons, half-an-hour&#x27;s soaking morning and night with a 4/1 water/vinegar solution, and what a pain that is.  Never any success.  Doctors have told me that only 15% of these infections are ever curable by topical means.  But, I recently began morning and night treatment with the tea tree oil, and I do now notice some improvement in my toes.  Mind you, I&#x27;ve never known what&#x27;s so bad about athlete&#x27;s foot, but if I can actually clear it up, have to think that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tea tree oil for a rash I developed on my legs.  On the advice of my physician I applied it twice a day and it really helped to clear up the itching and painful irritation.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with a dropplet easy to spill and pour too much</li>
    <li> This is about the same as the Tea Tree Oil I buy at Wal-Mart . It&#x27;s just two times the price.  I :) Avnet been able to tree fell any difference.</li>
    <li> its amazing, totally reccomend</li>
    <li> Originally purchased to remove skin tags as (falsely) advertised, followed directions and was disappointed that the product was ineffective as well as EXTREMELY foul-smelling!</li>
    <li> Good item, good price, good service.</li>
    <li> The best Tea Tree oil out there.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I found out that all tea tree oil is not created equal. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and even opted for the nice big bottle @ walmart---but it did nothing. Couldn&#x27;t understand the hype about an oil that totally didn&#x27;t work for me. Until I tried Gena Tea tree oil.  Stumbled across it at walgreens and bought some, with the recommendation from one of the sales reps.  This is the BEST tea tree oil on the market. Powerful and healing! A little bit is all you need. The scent of tea tree oil can be rather harsh, but it&#x27;s benefits outweigh it. A tad pricey when all you get is 1/2 an ounce---but a dab will do ya and it lasts a long time. Keep it in the fridge and it won&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s potency. Can stay good for years. It&#x27;s great for acne and many skin problems. Anti-fungal/anti-bacterial. If you have itchy scalp put some in your shampoo or add to a vinegar rinse. Great for nail fungus and so many other uses. A bottle stays in my house at all times. If you want to use something natural that heals very well---this is it.</li>
    <li> I use it for pimple spot treatment, very good. Works for me. And I like that applicator which simplifies the process</li>
    <li> Gena isn&#x27;t the best tea tree oil I&#x27;ve used, but it does the job (just takes a few more days than high quality brands).</li>
    <li> Product is great but should come with a dropper, so you don&#x27;t waste your product when trying to use it!</li>
    <li> This did not dry my skin out in fact, it made it look better, brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never be without it! I also put it in my shampoo.</li>
    <li> Straight from the label:  &amp;#34;WARNING:  This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just as I remember. Great for cuts, acne and insect bites.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. I love that it has a brush for application. Works great for keeping toenails nice.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m not disappointed with the results only been using for about less then a week and I will definitely be purchasing more tree tea oil soon</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product now for a little over a year. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Pleased with this.</li>
    <li> I use it to get rid of pimples, which if I apply at night, the next day they&#x27;re gone. Also really food for stimulating the scalp &amp; promoting hair growth. I suggest you use your fingers if applying to hair and then use the wand for your face, or either buy two bottles. I wouldn&#x27;t use the wand for both hair &amp; skin.</li>
