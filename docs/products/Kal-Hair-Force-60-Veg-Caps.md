      <li>&#x3D;) would recommend!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Amazing product.    </li>
      <li>It would be nice if one bottle had a 30 day supply since you are taking 3 a day.  </li>
      <li>and I thought I would never see a beautiful head full of hair again.</li>
      <li>Now this is the honest truth:</li>
      <li>However, I think MSM, Silica, and Biotin on their own are more potent and productive for hair growth.  </li>
      <li>I stopped using it and went back to Hair Revive which is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>love this product :)</li>
      <li>I have been using KAL Hair Force for more than 15 years.  </li>
      <li>I had better results with another brand that had lots of MSM.</li>
      <li>I will say that I feel that this contributed, but since I ran out and have just been taking the MSM and Silica on their own, I&#x27;ve seen a significant amount of growth.  </li>
      <li>I am really very happy with the product and have thrown away all the other products I had been using.</li>
      <li>This vitamin improved my hair greatly, I had less hair loss and it made my hair feel like it was more strongly attached to my head if that makes any sense!</li>
      <li>I just finished my first bottle, and am bit sure if the results.</li>
      <li>I just purchased another bottle because i want my hair to grow longer :) I absolutely love this product and it works im 20 years old and will keep buying this until I dont want my hair to grow it also helped my finger nails grow.</li>
      <li>Overall, I liked this product, but won&#x27;t go so far to say that I loved it.  </li>
      <li>Good product doesn&#x27;t take long to see results</li>
      <li>If you drink water and take pills as directed makes your hair grow fast and strong.</li>
      <li>Its a fantastic product at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s all that worth it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any problem if I eat something right after I take them.</li>
      <li>Very fast and prompt delivery.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken these pills for years and what you supply is the exact thing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Purchased for my sons and I saw a difference in the first two weeks of use.</li>
      <li>ITs a GREAT PRODUCT i cant stress enough to everyone who is skeptical of this product that my hair was short right below my shoulders, and it grew about 3 inches and maybe longer love love</li>
      <li>the pills are large</li>
      <li>Longer not thicker and much healthier hair than without them.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind hair grows out fast EVERYWHERE.</li>
      <li>I can really see and feel the difference when I use another brand.  </li>
      <li>Have used it for 4 months and my hair is getting much healthier and growing.</li>
      <li>KAL has the right formula for my hair -- leaves it soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be working pretty well so far.</li>
      <li>At 52 years old, my hair was becoming so thin you could see my scalp in the sunlight on top of my head with the sunroof open.  </li>
      <li>I took Hair Force religiously for 20 days straight 3 pills a day.</li>
      <li>young and Hair Force works.</li>
      <li>I have used them now for about a year and my hair has grown long so fast.</li>
      <li>I was disappointed since these had great reviews and results.</li>

<li> By way of history, I&#x27;m a Guyanese-American (black) woman and my hair really grows at an average rate for the typical African-American.  </li>
<li> My hair is past the middle of my back and is headed toward my waist.  </li>
<li> I now where weaves and cant keep them in past a month and a half due to my hair growing out so fast.</li>
<li> I bought this product because my mom came out of the care center after 4 months.  </li>
<li> I went down to one a day for three months, and eventually my hair started thinning back down.  </li>
<li> and I have not found any other product that includes them all.</li>
<li> I actually saw small growth of hair</li>
<li> She was loosing hair due to her medications.</li>
<li> Even my family doctor, that I had asked for guidance to thinning hair, noticed my thick hair during my physical.  </li>
<li> This works extremely well!</li>
<li> I used this for a few weeks and my hair began to fall out.</li>
<li> Age 27, trouble with hair growing for years.</li>
<li> After 3 months, I too now have small little hairs growing.</li>
<li> Excessive shedding has stopped.</li>
<li> Not sure if it helps with hair loss</li>
<li> I had tried all sorts of things before but either they did not help or were impossible to use (like spraying a liquid on your head twice a day - totally impractical, for me anyway).</li>
<li> Years ago I had a bad perm that made my hair start to fall out and left me with thin/bald spots.</li>
<li> Although taste is disgusting though well worth it.</li>
<li> The aftertaste is not pleasant.  </li>
<li> After a year, it was THICK!  </li>
<li> They work and should not be confused with cheaper brands.</li>
<li> I must have been severely deficient in these vitamins.</li>
<li> In Jan I had a horrible hair cut and was trying to get my length back ASAP.</li>
<li> , sorry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am African American and I use these along with Viviscal. Viviscal makes my hair thicker and these pills make it longer.  I can tell the difference because I used Viviscal for 2 years before adding these pills back in.  I used them maybe 10 years ago without viviscal and my hair grew long but I stopped for financial reasons.  They were about $40 back then.  I have used them now for about a year and my hair has grown long so fast. My hair is past the middle of my back and is headed toward my waist.  I take good care of my ends as well.  The price is great at $12.  It would be nice if one bottle had a 30 day supply since you are taking 3 a day.  The aftertaste is not pleasant.  I don&#x27;t have any problem if I eat something right after I take them.</li>
    <li> I used this for a few weeks and my hair began to fall out. I stopped using it and went back to Hair Revive which is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I took Hair Force religiously for 20 days straight 3 pills a day. My hair refused to grow after i cut it in 8th grade I am now graduated from highschool but after taking these pills my hair actually grew and not only could i tell but all my friends were astonished to see my hair half way down my back finally! I just purchased another bottle because i want my hair to grow longer :) I absolutely love this product and it works im 20 years old and will keep buying this until I dont want my hair to grow it also helped my finger nails grow. ITs a GREAT PRODUCT i cant stress enough to everyone who is skeptical of this product that my hair was short right below my shoulders, and it grew about 3 inches and maybe longer love love love this product :)</li>
    <li> I trust Kal for non harmful ingredients and I&#x27;m very satisfied with Hair Force. Have used it for 4 months and my hair is getting much healthier and growing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my mom came out of the care center after 4 months.  Her hair was falling out everywhere.  After about 3 weeks I noticed her hair stopped falling out.  Now after taking it for almost a year she has a beautiful head of hair.  She is 87 yrs. young and Hair Force works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff. It seems to be working pretty well so far. My nails have definitely gotten harder. The only complaint I might have about this bottle is that it finishes too fast. comes with 60 pills but you need to take 3 daily. Soo I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s all that worth it. I&#x27;ll see how I feel after this bottle.</li>
    <li> This works extremely well! I have been taking it for months b/c my hair is finally growing!    Amazing product.    Age 27, trouble with hair growing for years. Finally growing again. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed since these had great reviews and results. It seemed that I was taking a placebo. Nothing and the bottle is almost gone. I won&#x27;t be re-ordering this, sorry. I had better results with another brand that had lots of MSM. I took 3 a day for 2 months and gave up.</li>
    <li> this is a great product to anyone who needs to grow out their hair. Not sure if it helps with hair loss but it does help to grow out your hair! &#x3D;) would recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of hair vitamins and this is at the top of my list! The only reason I switch is if amazon is out of stock. This vitamin improved my hair greatly, I had less hair loss and it made my hair feel like it was more strongly attached to my head if that makes any sense!</li>
    <li> I bought these pills, but was taking them in conjunction with MSM tablets and Silica tablets by Solar.  I will say that I feel that this contributed, but since I ran out and have just been taking the MSM and Silica on their own, I&#x27;ve seen a significant amount of growth.  By way of history, I&#x27;m a Guyanese-American (black) woman and my hair really grows at an average rate for the typical African-American.  When I was taking these pills, I noticed an increase by maybe a 1/4 inch (1/2 inch with the MSM and Silica alone).  Overall, I liked this product, but won&#x27;t go so far to say that I loved it.  Recommend it if you want a product with multi-ingredients.  However, I think MSM, Silica, and Biotin on their own are more potent and productive for hair growth.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Product is excellent! Saw an immediate difference in my hair. Starting to grow. Excessive shedding has stopped. My hair feels and looks like it use to. I am 47 and I thought I would never see a beautiful head full of hair again. I do feel the vitamins that are in this product are critical for our hair. I must have been severely deficient in these vitamins. Thank you Kal!</li>
    <li> I have been using KAL Hair Force for more than 15 years.  I can really see and feel the difference when I use another brand.  KAL has the right formula for my hair -- leaves it soft and manageable.  I cannot do without it!</li>
    <li> After years of suffering from hair loss (especially when I washed my hair, not so much on an everyday basis)and the anxiety that I would end up a bald old woman one day,(I am 54), I found this product and gave it a try. I had tried all sorts of things before but either they did not help or were impossible to use (like spraying a liquid on your head twice a day - totally impractical, for me anyway). Now this is the honest truth: After just one month of taking the capsules twice a day I noticed that I lost noticably fewer hairs during a shampoo! I am really very happy with the product and have thrown away all the other products I had been using. I think it is the combination of l-cystein, biotin and zinc that does the trick and I have not found any other product that includes them all. Give it a try!!!!</li>
    <li> I just finished my first bottle, and am bit sure if the results. In Jan I had a horrible hair cut and was trying to get my length back ASAP. The pills are kind of large and leave a nasty after taste an I don&#x27;t like that the recommended use is 3 pills at a time. The jury is still out on if they&#x27;ve helped or not. I&#x27;ll be looking for another/ similar product with smaller pills and smaller serving size. I initially got it based on a recommendation from a friend who swears by it</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Was dissapointed when GNC stopped selling this product. If you drink water and take pills as directed makes your hair grow fast and strong. Years ago I had a bad perm that made my hair start to fall out and left me with thin/bald spots. I started taking these pills and my hairdresser noticed my hair growing twice as fast and twice as thick. I now where weaves and cant keep them in past a month and a half due to my hair growing out so fast. Keep in mind hair grows out fast EVERYWHERE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve taken these pills for years and what you supply is the exact thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna Jaster</li>
    <li> awesome product ! makes my hair grow every time! definitely recommend it if you have thinning hair. Very fast and prompt delivery.Although taste is disgusting though well worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent vitamin source.  Purchased for my sons and I saw a difference in the first two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> They work and should not be confused with cheaper brands. I had results in a couple of months. Longer not thicker and much healthier hair than without them. Best price around.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hair Force for about two years now.  At 52 years old, my hair was becoming so thin you could see my scalp in the sunlight on top of my head with the sunroof open.  I was freaked out.  After reading reviews, I committed to try this for six months.  After four months my hair was definitely thickening.  After a year, it was THICK!  Even my family doctor, that I had asked for guidance to thinning hair, noticed my thick hair during my physical.  I only took two a day instead of three because of the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 15 months I went down to one a day for three months, and eventually my hair started thinning back down.  I have been back to two a day for the last few months and I&#x27;m good again.  This is a MUST for me.  I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. I have dry hair and it replenishes and strengthens the hair. The price is great and the delivery time is as stated. I recommend the seller.</li>
    <li> My friend introduced this product to me. She was loosing hair due to her medications. I actually saw small growth of hair so I&#x27;m trying it. After 3 months, I too now have small little hairs growing. Its a fantastic product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Good product doesn&#x27;t take long to see results I was sceptical but very happy I purchased  the pills are large</li>
