<li> Very soothing and claming after a hard day at work.</li>
<li> But be careful:</li>
<li> Splash it on when you&#x27;re going to be out in the heat to kill germs that would cause any unwanted odors due to sweating.  </li>
<li> We dip a rag in the bucket, and drench the kids or let them just wipe down their face and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I typically use it my bath water .....</li>
<li> Ice water in a cooler and a little Florida water and then soak a wash cloth in the mixture and apply to your face, hands, and neck.</li>
<li> Carry a small bottle with you to the beach, the locker room, the job or school.  </li>
<li> Unlike perfume or ordinary toilet water, it doesn&#x27;t simply blanket unpleasant smells; it obliterates them!  </li>
<li> He didn&#x27;t play the game of \\&quot;buy it for 10 cents, but pay $10 per bottle in shipping\\&quot; like a lot of the goofballs \\&quot;dealers\\&quot; do, hoping you won&#x27;t notice!  </li>

    <li> Great seller keep up  the good work!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff for my youth football team... it cools them down quickly, refreshes them instantly, and hey - they smell pretty good for sweaty football players.  We dilute a 2 gallon jug of ice and water with 2 oz., so a single bottle is good for four practices.  We dip a rag in the bucket, and drench the kids or let them just wipe down their face and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dealer was also excellent.  He didn&#x27;t play the game of \\&quot;buy it for 10 cents, but pay $10 per bottle in shipping\\&quot; like a lot of the goofballs \\&quot;dealers\\&quot; do, hoping you won&#x27;t notice!  The package arrived in three days or so, which is also excellent.... a lot of Amazon dealers take a week just to put it in the mail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall high marks, and I will buy this product from this dealer again!</li>
    <li> First bought this product in Peru and was told it was used by shamans down there to cleanse your aura.  Have been cleansing my aura daily since.  Was happy to find this product through Amazon.  Got good price, quick service and will happily share this product with close family members and friends for Christmas. It has a wonderful, clean, lemony smell..much like \\&quot;4711\\&quot; from Germany...very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I am happy with my order of the Florida water. It has a pleasant fragrance that lasts practically all day.</li>
    <li> excellent aftershave - i like to &#x27;bootleg&#x27; this and mix it 50/50 with Aqua Velva Ice Sport - great stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff works as a cooling agent. Ice water in a cooler and a little Florida water and then soak a wash cloth in the mixture and apply to your face, hands, and neck. You will instantly be refreshed and drop your body temperature.</li>
    <li> Great summertime scent.</li>
    <li> Great price and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I like to give it as gifts along with a fact sheet on the product.</li>
    <li> The best ever!!! Great when you are fishing, cutting the grass or outside hanging out by the pool.</li>
    <li> I typically use it my bath water .....it works wonders to remove stress and allows you to relax.  Very soothing and claming after a hard day at work.</li>
    <li> I like smelling like my grandpa...feels good after a shower, or instead of one in a pinch...why so many words required?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Florida Water for over 20 years.  Despite it&#x27;s reasonable price, it has a subtle pleasant scent that lasts for quite a while and is suitable for men or women.  Splash it on when you&#x27;re going to be out in the heat to kill germs that would cause any unwanted odors due to sweating.  Unlike perfume or ordinary toilet water, it doesn&#x27;t simply blanket unpleasant smells; it obliterates them!  Carry a small bottle with you to the beach, the locker room, the job or school.  But be careful: don&#x27;t let it touch open cuts in the skin.  Because of its alcohol content, it will really sting!</li>
    <li> It is refreshing product! Several reasons for purchasing. Was highly recommended. We, will be purchasing a more very soon.&lt;br /&gt;thank You!</li>
    <li> This old-timey unisex cologne has a citrus and clove smell that is cooling, refreshing and invigorating.  You can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere. It&#x27;s been around for over 100 years and was especially popular in the South (was mentioned in the book \\&quot;Gone With The Wind\\&quot;).  It is sometimes used as a spiritul cleanser.  In Jacksonville I have only found Florida Water at drug stores in the ethnically diverse parts of town.</li>
    <li> Love it saved a lot of money thank u will oder more soon ache and may God bless u All</li>
    <li> I just re-ordered so it has to be good, right</li>
    <li> This is the real stuff, for luck or a real slice of Americana, couldn&#x27;t smell better!</li>
