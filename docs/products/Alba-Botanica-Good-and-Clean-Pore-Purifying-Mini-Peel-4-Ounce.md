### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>but I loved it.  </li>
      <li>It has a great fruity smell and is like applying liquid hand soap to your face, but I do love it.</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>I think the stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice exfoliator</li>
      <li>I personally loved the strong grapefruit smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Yes it tingles, but most products that have an alpha hydroxyl in them do.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a fruity gel that you rinse off.</li>
      <li>However, the tingling sensation has continued since washing off the gel, it is very mild</li>
      <li>If you want a good alpha hydroxyl peel at a decent price</li>
      <li>which was  clean, smooth skin.</li>
      <li>My face does feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>I like how clean my face feels after using it</li>
      <li>but my face did feel clean.</li>
      <li>and it makes my skin feel so incredibly clean.  </li>
      <li>I saw this in my local W-Mart and noticed it was an alpha hydroxyl peel and a good price</li>
      <li>It smells nice and is simple to use.</li>
      <li>Found it here on my favorite place for less and thought i could start stocking up :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27; goes on the face soft and you rinse it out easily like soap.</li>
      <li>You do feel a very gentle tingle while using it.  </li>
      <li>(the first one prescribed the retinol) and then remembered I had this peel in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
      <li>I purchased this at a brick and mortar store about a month back and love it.</li>
      <li>When I first put it on I was a bit concerned about the stinging sensation, but it said it may &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love ALBA products and this is no different.</li>
      <li>I did not notice any instant difference in my appearance but I will wait it out and see if the magic appears by morning.</li>
      <li>first impression: I will do a follow up.</li>
      <li>I love Alba and already use several of their products.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this it felt like jellyfish stinging my face.</li>
      <li>If you have super sensitive skin this may not be for you.</li>
      <li>and it came the whiteheads out easily the next day.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really noticed much a difference after I used it the first time</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used AHA before but this one seemed more than a little mild as advertised but not unbearable.</li>
      <li>I was ready to call the dermatologist again</li>
      <li>then I really think you should give it a try.</li>
      <li>and I cant notice it that much.</li>
      <li>I dont know what to really say because I dont see that much tightening yet.maybe it did</li>
      <li>And I really like the orangey citrusy smell.  </li>
      <li>It really started to create this burning sensation within a minute of putting it on my face and continued to sting after washing it off.</li>
      <li>So much better than the chemically over flowery smell on other cleaners.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my pores getting smaller, and I&#x27;ve been having fewer breakouts, so I consider it a success!  </li>
      <li>I like this, especially since it makes my face feel so clean.  </li>
      <li>I bought this, used it once, and now it lives under my sink so I will not be tempted to give it another shot after the complete disaster that happened the first time I used this.</li>
      <li>the tingle didn&#x27;t read what it was and just thought it was a normal face mask.</li>
      <li>When I was rubbing with my fingers to get the last of the gel off my skin felt very much like a sunburn in some areas such as my nose, my right cheek, and my jaw area.</li>
      <li>When I washed it off the peel came off easily and did leave a slight smell of citrus.</li>
      <li>I prefer AB&#x27;s Dead Sea mask to this, but this is good as a very gentle pick me up in the middle of the week or when you&#x27;re feeling down.</li>
      <li>Having said that my face had previously been clear and blemish free for about 3 weeks before I put this stuff on there</li>
      <li>Firstly I bought this on sale because I loved that it had natural ingredients, but sadly I thought it was an actual peel.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll continue to purchase to help clear out my pores.</li>
      <li>I might be imagining things, but I imagine I can feel the fruit acids gently dissolving all the oil and makeup deep in my pores.</li>
      <li>A couple years ago I developed acne out of nowhere as an adult, and this product was one of the two that helped me control it.</li>
      <li>I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin with lots of clogged pores and blackheads.</li>
      <li>I recently got interested in alpha hydroxyl and retinol products, but most are pretty expensive.</li>
      <li>With alpha hydroxy, they are serious when they say that it makes your skin more susceptible to sunburn</li>
      <li>I have oily sensitive skin and have not had any major issues with this peel.  </li>
      <li>When I first picked this up on a whim at my local Whole Foods, I expected an actual PEEL, but it doesn&#x27;t peel off at all.</li>
      <li>It does not dry.</li>
      <li>And you can smell the citrus in it, so it makes me happy to know that I&#x27;m not putting harsh artificial chemicals on my skin.</li>

<li> The second time I was almost afraid to use it for fear of the burning again but it was much better.</li>
<li> Used directly as instructed, and woke up the next day to a very red, very rough and uneven textured face.</li>
<li> That is not new information.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe this, but just one treatment with this stuff, left on for a few minutes and warmed up at the end with a warm washcloth, drastically reduced an acne pockmark on my nose from a bad breakout about 6 months ago.</li>
<li> It even took away some small blemishes I had almost completely.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m hoping it is the deep down dirt and gunk being dissolved</li>
<li> and I also have noticed my skin is less oily the next day after using it.</li>
<li> I continue to purchase it along with other products from this brand.</li>
<li> Granted, it could be due to my skin tone and genetic make up</li>
<li> (past experience with a different product).</li>
<li> to other reviews.  </li>
<li> This did not tingle for me like other reviews stated.</li>
<li> I am in my late 30s with combination skin that still breaks out occasionally.  </li>
<li> I do get a few pink splotches on my face</li>
<li> and it broke me out in less than a day.</li>
<li> As I&#x27;m a fan of masks, I thought I would give something new a try and, sadly</li>
<li> AHA is the only thing that exfoliates my very thick skin.</li>
<li> but they go away after a few minutes.  </li>
<li> so I thought hey, maybe they just undersold the stinging bit a little bit to make it sound less terrifying.</li>
<li> No more mini-peels for me, I guess.</li>
<li> I use this at least once a week</li>
<li> I mean, I&#x27;ve had this on my face for up to 10 minutes before</li>
<li> The uncomfortable sensation is just not worth it to me.</li>
<li> The next morning when I washed my face, I woke up to the formation of 4 particularly painful pimples.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s a brief tingle, but it isn&#x27;t a painful sensation by any means.</li>
<li> I applied thin layers to all but the nose area.</li>
<li> However, I&#x27;m confused about it being called a &amp;#34;peel.&amp;#34;  </li>
<li> Salicylic acid is useless.</li>
<li> Shocked.</li>
<li> It was horrible!</li>
<li> I am 38 and very disappointed to find that I still get acne breakouts!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t get it  - it&#x27;s watery and I never felt a difference after using.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. A couple years ago I developed acne out of nowhere as an adult, and this product was one of the two that helped me control it. I put it on just before bed and my acne always decreases in size and redness overnight. It smells nice and is simple to use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this, but just one treatment with this stuff, left on for a few minutes and warmed up at the end with a warm washcloth, drastically reduced an acne pockmark on my nose from a bad breakout about 6 months ago. I have been using prescription retinol and Mederma every day for months and still had redness and a pockmark. I was ready to call the dermatologist again (the first one prescribed the retinol) and then remembered I had this peel in my bathroom cabinet. Used it in the bath last night and woke up to a totally different situation with that acne mark. Shocked. Will keep using it and hope the results continue!</li>
    <li> I am 38 and very disappointed to find that I still get acne breakouts!  I bought this product to see if it would help and I was amazed.  I left it on until it tingled and rinsed it off.  By the next day, my breakout was almost gone!  Granted, it could be due to my skin tone and genetic make up but I loved it.  And I really like the orangey citrusy smell.  So much better than the chemically over flowery smell on other cleaners.</li>
    <li> I like this, especially since it makes my face feel so clean.  However, I&#x27;m confused about it being called a &amp;#34;peel.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s not an actual peel.  I mean, I&#x27;ve had this on my face for up to 10 minutes before and i&#x27;ve never had to actually peel it off.  It&#x27; goes on the face soft and you rinse it out easily like soap. No peeling at all.</li>
    <li> I have oily sensitive skin and have not had any major issues with this peel.  I do get a few pink splotches on my face but they go away after a few minutes.  I like how clean my face feels after using it and I also have noticed my skin is less oily the next day after using it.</li>
    <li> I love Alba and already use several of their products. I am in my late 30s with combination skin that still breaks out occasionally.  I was looking for something to help minimize the pores/blackheads on my nose and decided to try this.  It works!  I put it on while I brushed my teeth and then washed it off.  The next morning I checked and my pores were noticeably smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to other reviews.  I did not notice a smell on my face afterwards. Yes, it does tingle, but not unbearably so (if you have ever used alpha hydroxy you know the feeling).  Also, you need to thoroughly rinse your face afterwards, or some residue will remain and can cause redness.  Also wear sunblock!  With alpha hydroxy, they are serious when they say that it makes your skin more susceptible to sunburn (past experience with a different product).</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m a fan of masks, I thought I would give something new a try and, sadly, I don&#x27;t think I will be using this product again. It really started to create this burning sensation within a minute of putting it on my face and continued to sting after washing it off. The uncomfortable sensation is just not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I like this exfoliator but it does leave a stench on your face of oranges. It&#x27;s a nice exfoliator but I wish the smell wasn&#x27;t left on my face.</li>
    <li> When I first picked this up on a whim at my local Whole Foods, I expected an actual PEEL, but it doesn&#x27;t peel off at all. It has a great fruity smell and is like applying liquid hand soap to your face, but I do love it. There&#x27;s a brief tingle, but it isn&#x27;t a painful sensation by any means. I prefer AB&#x27;s Dead Sea mask to this, but this is good as a very gentle pick me up in the middle of the week or when you&#x27;re feeling down. I never noticed anything with ridding acne, but it does leave me with a &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; sensation after rinsing it off. I continue to purchase it along with other products from this brand.</li>
    <li> I recently got interested in alpha hydroxyl and retinol products, but most are pretty expensive. I saw this in my local W-Mart and noticed it was an alpha hydroxyl peel and a good price so I decided to give it a try. I think the stuff is amazing. Yes it tingles, but most products that have an alpha hydroxyl in them do. I can only assume the people that used it and didn&#x27;t like the tingle didn&#x27;t read what it was and just thought it was a normal face mask. It even says in the directions that it may tingle a bit. Only leave it on for a couple of minutes, don&#x27;t use a ton, rinse it off and when you wake up, hopefully you will experience what I did which was  clean, smooth skin. It even took away some small blemishes I had almost completely. It should last awhile because you really don&#x27;t need to use to much to get results so you really can&#x27;t go wrong. If you have super sensitive skin this may not be for you. If you just want a cucumber mask that peels off this is not that either. If you want a good alpha hydroxyl peel at a decent price then I really think you should give it a try. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> This peel is facial grade and wünderbar!</li>
    <li> I use this at least once a week and it makes my skin feel so incredibly clean.  I might be imagining things, but I imagine I can feel the fruit acids gently dissolving all the oil and makeup deep in my pores. You do feel a very gentle tingle while using it.  Whatever it&#x27;s doing, between this and my face brush I&#x27;ve noticed my pores getting smaller, and I&#x27;ve been having fewer breakouts, so I consider it a success!  And you can smell the citrus in it, so it makes me happy to know that I&#x27;m not putting harsh artificial chemicals on my skin.</li>
    <li> I like that it is organic. The scent sometimes makes me sneeze . I dont know what to really say because I dont see that much tightening yet.maybe it did and I cant notice it that much. I cant tell but it stays on my face overnight and it came the whiteheads out easily the next day.</li>
    <li> The only thing that works on my acne-prone skin is AHA. This is a wonderful product. Everyone knows AHA stings. That is not new information. AHA is the only thing that exfoliates my very thick skin. Salicylic acid is useless. I love ALBA products and this is no different.</li>
    <li> first impression: I will do a follow up. Firstly I bought this on sale because I loved that it had natural ingredients, but sadly I thought it was an actual peel. It is NOT A PEEL OFF PEEL. It&#x27;s more like a fruity gel that you rinse off. It does not dry. I left it on for 5 minutes. I&#x27;ve used AHA before but this one seemed more than a little mild as advertised but not unbearable. When I washed it off the peel came off easily and did leave a slight smell of citrus. When I was rubbing with my fingers to get the last of the gel off my skin felt very much like a sunburn in some areas such as my nose, my right cheek, and my jaw area. I applied thin layers to all but the nose area. My face was red and patchy after fully rinsed. I did not notice any instant difference in my appearance but I will wait it out and see if the magic appears by morning. My face does feel squeaky clean. However, the tingling sensation has continued since washing off the gel, it is very mild but I do feel my face tingling. I&#x27;m hoping it is the deep down dirt and gunk being dissolved but we will see.    **UPDATE**  The next morning when I washed my face, I woke up to the formation of 4 particularly painful pimples. One next to my lip, one on my chin and 2 on my cheek. Having said that my face had previously been clear and blemish free for about 3 weeks before I put this stuff on there and it broke me out in less than a day. Returning this ASAP.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I purchased this at a brick and mortar store about a month back and love it. I leave it on until it tingles! Found it here on my favorite place for less and thought i could start stocking up :)</li>
    <li> Used directly as instructed, and woke up the next day to a very red, very rough and uneven textured face. It was horrible! When I first put it on I was a bit concerned about the stinging sensation, but it said it may &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; so I thought hey, maybe they just undersold the stinging bit a little bit to make it sound less terrifying. I bought this, used it once, and now it lives under my sink so I will not be tempted to give it another shot after the complete disaster that happened the first time I used this. No more mini-peels for me, I guess.</li>
    <li> This did not tingle for me like other reviews stated. I didn&#x27;t really noticed much a difference after I used it the first time but my face did feel clean.</li>
    <li> I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin with lots of clogged pores and blackheads. I&#x27;m truly blessed. The first time I used this it felt like jellyfish stinging my face. I personally loved the strong grapefruit smell. The second time I was almost afraid to use it for fear of the burning again but it was much better. I have noticed my skin became softer but my pores are still clogged and I&#x27;m still breaking out. I&#x27;ll keep using it but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll continue to purchase to help clear out my pores.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference immediately (2 days).  I leave it on for 5-10 minutes and my skin does look brighter with smaller pores!</li>
