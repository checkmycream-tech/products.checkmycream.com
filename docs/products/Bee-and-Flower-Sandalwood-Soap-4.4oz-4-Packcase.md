      <li>Rinses clean.</li>

<li> My skin felt REALLY dry after using this.</li>
<li> Also don&#x27;t be fooled by all the positive reviews, because they are in fact fake and fabricated by the seller.</li>
<li> Sadly, these soaps have very little smell at all and what little smell they do have disappears very quickly.  </li>
<li> Hard to find locally!  </li>
<li> Leaves little residue as well.</li>
<li> A little drying.</li>
<li> But you might be smelling yourself for few hours afterward.</li>
<li> It had a very artificial, perfumy, floral smell, rather than a rich sandalwood smell I would expect from Sandalwood soap.  </li>
<li> I received the soap immediately, as usual.  </li>
<li> pretty nasty actually.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is by design</li>

<li> I&#x27;m really very disappointed with this soap.  </li>
<li> &amp;#34;Nature &amp; Herbs&amp;#34; shipped this order faster than anyone I&#x27;ve ordered from before.&lt;br /&gt;However, the &amp;#34;Bee &amp; Flower&amp;#34; brand of sandalwood soap is without question, the worst sandalwood soap I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m really very disappointed with this soap.  I&#x27;ve been scouring the stores looking for sandalwood soap.  When I found this on Amazon and read the reviews, I gladly purchased it because I thought I&#x27;d found what I was looking for.  Sadly, these soaps have very little smell at all and what little smell they do have disappears very quickly.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this brand again.</li>
    <li> This does not leave a scent on me after the shower, which is what I expect from soap.  But it is very pleasant while bathing.  I thought the price was excellent for the amount of soap they sent.  Packaging was fine and order arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> The Sandalwood part is very light.</li>
    <li> Smell does not seem consistent at every purchase. This time it was a more mild smell.  This is my second time purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> no similarity to &amp;#34;sandalwood&amp;#34; fragrance.  pretty nasty actually.</li>
    <li> I smelled of Bees and Flowers for a good while. It lasts for while and great in the tub. I need to get more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This sandalwood soap has a marvellous fragrance and is an old favorite that has been on the market for many years and we love everything about it from the shape, imprint, smell, colorful paper wrapping and reasonable price.  It is always a happy purchase and one we make frequently.  Its also a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I think the other review that mentions inconsistency is probably correct; I&#x27;ve only purchased one box, and my own experience was that these had to go into a drawer quickly, because they smelled *so strongly* that it overpowered the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawer has since remained shut; The soap will be thrown out if the scent doesn&#x27;t subside between now and the next time that drawer opens.  Either way, I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Our family is hooked on the wonderful fragrance (yes, this is a guy writing this).  We keep several bars on hand.</li>
    <li> I love this soap......it is the best.</li>
    <li> Just love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Hard to find locally!  Smells great. A little drying.</li>
    <li> Lathers up well. Great fragrance. Rinses clean. All the attributes of a fine designer soap. Leaves little residue as well.</li>
    <li> Fabulous fragrence. Super non-drying. I even use it on my face. I was so pleasantly surprised when o opened the package. The outer wrapping is attractive enough to display in a basket or on a shelf. So pleased!</li>
    <li> Love this soap. I have used it for years. It has a nice earthy scent</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived before expected, and the first bar lasted over a month. Plus it smells grand.</li>
    <li> Not only perfumes you but your bathroom as well.  Love the scent and is gentle on the skin too.  The only soap I use.</li>
    <li> This soap smelled like a perfumed spank rag.</li>
    <li> Good soap,  large bars. But you might be smelling yourself for few hours afterward.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product.  It smells wonderful and is great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely lovely sandalwood fragrance!</li>
    <li> Well shucks. I&#x27;m always a five star, full positive feedback type of customer. This review doesn&#x27;t reflect on the seller, &amp;#34;Nature &amp; Herbs&amp;#34; at all. &amp;#34;Nature &amp; Herbs&amp;#34; shipped this order faster than anyone I&#x27;ve ordered from before.&lt;br /&gt;However, the &amp;#34;Bee &amp; Flower&amp;#34; brand of sandalwood soap is without question, the worst sandalwood soap I&#x27;ve ever tried. It smells more like &amp;#34;hotel soap&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;When on an elevator, you can always pick out the people that are overnight tourists and have showered. They have a scent of &amp;#34;hotel soap&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not offensive at all, but it ain&#x27;t sandalwood soap. In my opinion, the best sandalwood soap is by MySore, or anything made in India, not Chinese.&lt;br /&gt;This package of soap had no sandalwood scent, and the &amp;#34;hotel&amp;#34; scent overpowered everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee &amp; Flower&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood Soap&lt;br /&gt;Display box of 4 individually wrapped bars&lt;br /&gt;Net weight per bar 125 grams or 4.4 ounces&lt;br /&gt;Total weight per box 500 grams or 17.6 ounces</li>
    <li> the fragrance is amazing</li>
    <li> I received the soap immediately, as usual.  It smells wonderful and gets good and soapy when washing my hands. Nice.</li>
    <li> Gross stuff, you can tell it was made in china. Smells like someone&#x27;s butt. Also don&#x27;t be fooled by all the positive reviews, because they are in fact fake and fabricated by the seller. Just read how generic they sound, like a commercial trying to sell you a turd.  You should be ashamed to call this garbage soap actually get away with selling it.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed with this soap.  It had a very artificial, perfumy, floral smell, rather than a rich sandalwood smell I would expect from Sandalwood soap.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is by design and it&#x27;s just a matter of taste, or if this is just a cheaper sandalwood soap, because I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with different brands.</li>
    <li> This takes me back in time forty some years. So glad they still make it.  The aroma lasts a while on the skin and even if it did not, it is a pleasure in the shower.  And this is the first soap that I&#x27;ve found in a long time  that I want to put the wrapper of into my drawers to scent the clothes.</li>
    <li> Been using it for quite a while. It does not dry out the skin and only has a very, very light sandalwood fragrance which is only noticeable during showering.</li>
    <li> If you love the manly smell of sandalwood, you&#x27;ll love these soaps; super sudsy, wash clean, smell great..</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this soap. It&#x27;s not overpowering, too sweet, or too spicy (for me). As a soap, I feel like it cuts skin oils well, feeling clean, without being too drying. My husband and I both use it as the perfume is very gender neutral.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this soap! I love the smell and the effect on the skin also. I hgihly recommend it!</li>
    <li> love this soap and the scent&lt;br /&gt; long lasting good soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re beautifully wrapped - so would make nice little stocking stuffer type gift&lt;br /&gt;but of course you know that soaps last longer if you unwrap them so they harden up - put in your linen closet</li>
    <li> Nice soap, lathers well and lasts a good long time. Smells great but not too overpowering. Great price</li>
    <li> This soap smells a little like incense, which I don&#x27;t find to be a bad thing. I do like that it lathers fairly well. Overall this soap just didn&#x27;t make the cut for me. My skin felt REALLY dry after using this. I will probably stash them in my linens (I bought a bulk pack), because I do like the smell.</li>
