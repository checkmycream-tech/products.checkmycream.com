<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product is way too dry.</li>
    <li> Great colors, pretty good coverage and no cheap lipstick feel or smell. Happy with what I paid for, probably would buy again. And lastly, very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected but they weren&#x27;t the worst.</li>
    <li> Very Good. Recomended!!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Ok so I was going to buy a mac lipstick but I couldn&#x27;t justify myself into spending hundred of dollars to get several shades.. While surfing here on Amazon, I came across this lipstick set and gave it a thought, read the reviews, and decided to give it a try. When I got it, my eyes lit up because the colors are truly beautiful! All the colors that I was looking for was in it. From red to pink to coral. What else can you ask for? So now for the test..... After applying it on my lips, I actually like it even more! It glides on smoothly and does not dry my lips at all! I also noticed that it last a while before you have to re apply. I&#x27;d say all morning, if ur not constantly eating and licking ur lips, re apply after lunch and ur good till the rest of the afternoon. If you have any doubts, it&#x27;s only $8 something. I am glad that I did not spend a lot on high end. I already recommended this to a friend and she loves the colors! I am looking to buy the lip liners soon. Thanks Nabi for this great product.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and a lot of tubes for your dollar. I wish they weren&#x27;t all so pink.</li>
    <li> My brother purchased these through his amazon acct for me and they r fab. I love love love. Worth it all. The only thing is that there r 2 reds that r not as red on your lips as they look. Buy!!</li>
    <li> Really nice colors. Also last for a long time .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lighter skin toned black woman and these colors with the exception of baby pink look great on me. There is no smell, colors are rich and long lasting ( I ate pizza and the lipstick was still there) plus it applies creamy and smooth. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The colors they give you are amazing I love the light pink but I gave it four stars because the lipstick chunks up a little when you apply it to your lips but for the price they are amazing.</li>
    <li> YOWZA! I love these lip colors. Out of the 8 I received, two were orange which is fine with me but not sure if everyone wants two orange lip colors. They go on so smoothly and, my favorite thing besides the deep colors, they have NO SCENT! I hate scented lip colors. I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> Sucks! Its like wearing cheap lipstick that doesnt last does not apply evenly and will stick to cracks in lips even if i moisturize before would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors work on me and some don&#x27;t but these are really moisturizing and stay after I have spent the afternoon licking my lips. Its awesome</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and long lasting love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for clients. They are lighter then they appear but creamy and matte. I only got one dark color, and one red color in the bunch tho, mostly pink to orange colors, with no shimmer or deep pigment. So they are perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t wear lipstick and want&#x27;s &#x27;some&#x27; color. These go great with some shimmery gloss. I think I will keep them for my light makeup lady&#x27;s. but it would have been nice to get more pigment in the dark shades. like a nice berry tone or a deeper red. So don&#x27;t buy if you want deep color&#x27;s or shine, you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like most colors</li>
    <li> {UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had them for 2 years, I use them all the time! Love them!!!  I know they usually say that sometimes after a certain amount of time you should throw away your make-up because they can supposedly expire but I haven&#x27;t had any issues at all}&lt;br /&gt;Love these lipsticks they look great there are a few shades of pink that look exactly the same but they&#x27;re not! They&#x27;re really soft and creamy which I love I believe that there Matte but you can always put a nice lipgloss on top of it as well. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments when I wear them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There towards the back of my pictures but I have them with all my go to colors</li>
    <li> bright colors &amp; good texture</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t in love with every color. A  couple of the lighter colors in the pack went on in a weird pasty way and didn&#x27;t look good. the darker colors seems to go on better and looked more quality on me. I am happy with my purchase though because it was less than 9 dollars for so many colors! i like probably 3/4 of the lip stick colors i purchased. I knew i wasnt going to be in love with every color in the pack because thats just unreasonable that i would look good with EVERY color! I plan on giving away the 2-3 that i dont like to friends/family ! haha !</li>
    <li> wow love these, I can&#x27;t believe how much I paid for these</li>
    <li> A very nice variety of colors which stay on better than most lip sticks.  They do seem to make my lips feel dry.  I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> this lipsticks is very moist and my favorite is Red Red but unfortunately a lots of this lipstick have a similar color..</li>
    <li> Loved them however, the melting was an issue, but you communicated so well!!!</li>
    <li> The Colors are absolutely fantastic !!!!! I love it .! Gave them  to my sister for christmas and she loves them.</li>
    <li> I loved the colors!! A bit thin and easily comes off😕 overall I loved the colors!!</li>
    <li> They came on time and undamaged. The colors are a bit one sided but for the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> lipsticks came wrapped up in a dusty sheet of bubble wrap, and at least one was open and smooshed into the cap.</li>
    <li> Nice array of colors but the application is kind of dry - not much moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick quality product at a very good price. Not to dry not to waxy. Very nice everyday colors.</li>
    <li> i love these lip sticks but i wish the had more darkers shades to choose from im darker toned and the pinks didnt do much justice for me, and i really like the darked reds burgendys and purples. but i loved them they feel so good look amazing with my make up,</li>
    <li> Love how they looked! ! :)</li>
    <li> These were alright, pigmented but didn&#x27;t last very long. About right for the price though</li>
    <li> got here fast good colors but they break! I opened the 1st one and it just flew out of the container! along with the other 9!!!</li>
    <li> Great i bought 3 times for me and my customer, everything is ok</li>
    <li> This pack was advertised as matte lipsticks but they are not. They are still nice but not much of a variety in the colors that come in the pack.</li>
    <li> Nice lipstick,it stayed on longer then expected. The main colors are Oranges and pinks with the exception of one red but its a pink red.</li>
    <li> It was ok, the colors were too bright for me.</li>
    <li> Stays on and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips. Only reason for 4 stars is with it being a little difficult to apply with precision. Highly pigmented and stays on after drinking and eating. You do eventually have to reapply, but it&#x27;s not as often as most.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves these lipstick, she is very happy with these lipstick.</li>
    <li> This one is exactly what I want. bought one in the market but is a kind of moisture, and it&#x27;s like water when I paint it on my lip. However this one is like wax and totally suitable for my lip. Also, cheap and wonderful. Love it</li>
    <li> Received in time. Coloures were good. I really like them.</li>
    <li> They are awsome!! The red one paints like my lipstick NARS, I really love these lipsticks</li>
    <li> This are a little bit brighter than in the photo but still lovely and they last a long time (at least for what I&#x27;m used to with the lipsticks I already have)</li>
    <li> I really love these colors they match the picture and I honestly like this brand more than mac. It stays on way longer, it&#x27;s cheaper in price and it has no smell. Even after eating and drinking things it stays on,  yea it comes off a little bit just depends how much yu lick yur lips but,  it&#x27;s not even noticeable. I put the red one on at 5:30 before my brothers soccer game and I ate and I was drinking juice and at 9 I still had it on I was surprised with Mac I would have had to re apply more. I like this because it dries more like an stain I was drinking from a straw and there was nothing on the straw which was good because it looks kind of gross having it all stained with yur stick. The only thing is that some of the lids come of easily but thats no biggie 💋💄👄</li>
    <li> The quality of the lipstick is great, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out.  Two of the colors are almost exactly the same though. One is &amp;#34;Rose Pink&amp;#34; and the other is &amp;#34;Pink Rose.&amp;#34;  A little disappointed about that. Also, when I received them one of the reds was broken. The lipstick was stuck to the cap. It&#x27;s still usable but looks messy now. I have to be extra careful when using that one.</li>
    <li> I m very happy with this lipstick they go on smooth and the color last .</li>
    <li> Small size, but I love all the color I received.</li>
    <li> Didnt receive any of the darker shades but overall satisfied with product</li>
    <li> Love this lippie... Nice colors and pigmentation</li>
    <li> Other than light fading over the day, which is to be expected with most lipsticks, this one works well for me as I can choose which color accentuates my outfit.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice, good quality.</li>
    <li> I love these colors and the different shades, the only time i have to re-apply the lipstick is when i eat or after i have had several contact with wine glass , beer bottles etc</li>
    <li> I love the pinks, again I prefer them, but the other colors are ok too, they are not that moisturizing so they don&#x27;t slide on the lips, and best to apply lightly over a bit of moisturizer if your lips are dry.  The tops also don&#x27;t stay on, which is frustrating, so I leave them at home now on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;But the colors are nice, but for me it works best if I use a touch of lighter moisturizing color or gloss.</li>
    <li> A few of the lipsticks were broken when I got them. But they are great colors.</li>
    <li> It comes off very easily and isn&#x27;t long lasting as described. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> they are what you pay for. I use them for makeup during photoshoots and they work perfectly for that. I wouldnt wear these for a night out though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried 3 of the shades of lipstick so far but you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I usually spend this much $$$ for one lipstick. Used the darker shades and so far I really like them!!!</li>
    <li> Love the way it sticks to my lips. Doesn&#x27;t get on my teeth. Wish it had different colors..mostly pink and red....</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors. The lipstick goes on smooth and color is vibrant. Great if you want to try a lot of different shades for the price.</li>
    <li> The lipsticks are Great And I Really love The Colors but They Are different from the ones on The Pictures, I Didn&#x27;t Get Lilac, Instead It Was Replaced With Another Pink. I Still Like The Colors But I wanted What I Was Expecting.</li>
    <li> they are  pretty much all the same color</li>
    <li> I love the most the red color on this lipstick</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to order these lipsticks but after receiving them I am a huge fan! They shipped quickly and arrived undamaged. The lipstick is great quality, it&#x27;s not sticky or cakey. It is very lightweight and the colors are vibrant and perfect. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! Great deal! Will definitely buy Nabi AGAIN!! Arrived with no damage to product. Ready to use!</li>
    <li> The texture is odd. It almost looks as if I applied chalk to my lips. I have to use a clear gloss over the lipstick to keep it from looking like my lips are  dry and cracked (which they are not.)</li>
    <li> Beyond pleased with this purchased. I just got it today a day earlier than expected. Carefully wrapped with bubble wrap. No flaws in the lipsticks. I tried them all right away. Came on smooth , vibrant and didn&#x27;t have any weird smells. Highly recommend. It feels as smooth as Chap stick. I love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely never write reviews. But this is the worst lipstick ever. The colors are to similar and also the colors don&#x27;t stay. I moisturized my lips with Chapstick and I started trying them out on my lips and the color was horrible you could barely see it. I should went with my gut and never got these.</li>
    <li> I ordered these ones for my wife and received it yesterday.Very bad quality.Its looks like color sketch pens.Just wastage of money.Totally Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love these lipsticks, 2 of the colors I personally wouldn&#x27;t use but I&#x27;m sure others would, it feels light on my lips and stays on great</li>
    <li> colors are very similar, like a highlighter on your lips</li>
    <li> Love this 8 lipstick..... The color are as strong as I thought ... But I love it. Yes I will recommend it</li>
    <li> Excellent product came in great shape none of the lipsticks was damaged  packaging was phenomenal. Excellent colors the lipstick has a moisturizer in it they&#x27;re just absolutely fabulous I highly highly recommend buying don&#x27;t listen to negative reviews.</li>
    <li> Colors are all fairly dark in this kit.  Goes on well and stays but, once applied, they are very similar to each other.  Just slight variation of shade.  I do value the matte appearance. Price was good for set.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks do the job, are lovely shades and do not run.  They are long lasting and a great value. Thank you for a great product that is affordable.</li>
    <li> Awesome colors! Absolutely loved them. I thought they&#x27;d come in a case or something, but they didn&#x27;t. That was the only bummer. They stay on pretty well, just need to apply here and there.</li>
    <li> there were a lot of pinkish colors, while I was hoping for more orange or brown based colors</li>
    <li> The colors are pretty true as pictured. They have good staying power, and the assortment (while tending toward the pink end of the spectrum) is versatile.  I love the red.  I will definitely purchase again - great value for the money.</li>
    <li> They work well with lip gloss not so dry lipstick</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Just got it and tried some.</li>
    <li> I love it... They are way better than what I expected..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little light so you must put on a little bit of a heavier amount when first applyin but the colors are great! I love them!</li>
    <li> Loved the colors. Color still wears off but last longer than any other product I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> The colors are more for a teenager, not any older. I hated them.</li>
    <li> Great value and so far they seem fine. Just received them.</li>
    <li> Excellent product consider me a new fan</li>
    <li> Great quality product with amazing price. Fast transaction &amp; delivery.</li>
    <li> This was for my kids, My four girls are ages 10-2 yrs old, the older ones are into make up a lot and are always trying to steal mine. This time it was me who was the one stealing lipsticks lol, I loves the pink ones, they did not irritate my lips which i have a real hard time with lipstick they always make me feel like i need my carmex. However not this. The color stayed on my for most of the day only needing to touch up after drinking or eating, the kids needed to apply more often but then again they are kids and were very active, I would say I was very pleased and impressed with what we got for our moneys worth, they were great and would so buy them again,</li>
    <li> i am light complected, and although I like the colors, I like mauve&#x27;s and lighter colors.</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors! Great deal!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Very rich color. One came broken but I expected it based on other reviews. I liked about 5 of the colors so it&#x27;s a win-win for me. These dry out my lips so I have to make sure to use a lip primer and reapply gloss topcoat throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Cheap and best but it won&#x27;t be long lasting on lips...</li>
    <li> good price+good quality</li>
    <li> thats not bad‥pretty color with good price</li>
    <li> i wasnt impressed by all the colors, a lot of them remind me of justice and claires from when i was a pre-teen (now in my 20s). i would say some of the colors are somewhat &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; if you know what i mean</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant placing this order because the price was so cheap, $8 +some change for 8 tubes of lipstick, but I was very pleased and impressed when I got them. All the colors are as seen in the picture. Depending on your natural lip color, they may vary slightly. The lipstick are made very well too, you only need to apply one coat (which is very soft with no scent or greasiness either). All in all i am very happy and would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to try out something new.</li>
    <li> I love this product . I would recommend.</li>
    <li> great colors, Nabi lipsticks</li>
    <li> if i want to bay 100 beace you have</li>
    <li> They are nice overall...there are two colors, Rose Pink and Pink Rose, which are basically identical. If you like very potent colors, then these are for you. With one swipe of lipstick you get the full, very strong color. It will last all day, even after eating, and is very durable.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the colors or the feel!</li>
    <li> Too many colors I will never use only two nice colors</li>
    <li> Colors are nice. They show up okay. The lids don&#x27;t stay on, though. Everything in my purse is stained red. :(</li>
    <li> Love it ! Love the shades, the packaging and the quality ! It lasts long !</li>
    <li> I wish I could give negative stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It broke as soon as I searched it for color, piece of crap... DONT BUY</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not even that great dude. I was not impressed</li>
    <li> Colors aren&#x27;t really pigmented as other lipsticks but for the price I&#x27;ve got these for the quality is doing me just fine! Hehe! It doesn&#x27;t really last all day like I want it too but using a clear lipgloss after putting the lipstick does the trick. Hope this helps happy shopping!</li>
    <li> Terrible. They smear everywhere and never dry.</li>
    <li> I love each color! Now I can go from one lipstick to another! Great set!</li>
    <li> The reason for 4 stars is the package doesn&#x27;t really contain a 7 assored color because the pink rose and rose pink has the same shade of color. Other than that the lipstick are nice, they don&#x27;t clump and they stays longer. They are also taste less and odor less :)</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL pigment :) loved this lipsticks. Apply almost like a balm and stay on well if applied with a gloss.</li>
    <li> It is not long lasting at all....</li>
    <li> My wife loved the colors and wear them every day.</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick, I was surprise to see how good it is, it also smells nice. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> These lip sticks are so pretty very bright colors I love them .. Got here pretty quick also just didn&#x27;t like that about 2 of them broke real easily but other than that I love the way they look.</li>
    <li> Love these lipsticks! They are a great price and amazing for beginners!</li>
    <li> I dint like the product that much , i feel few of the colors are easy to apply and rest are not that great and they don&#x27;t look smooth on the lips, I think its just Ok ! I would buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Lots of colors to choose from and beautiful colors too. But it doesn&#x27;t stick on as well as other brands of lipstick. So you&#x27;ll have to keep reapplying</li>
    <li> Shipped on time.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the assortment of colors. I had to reapply a few times throughout the night so these are not matte&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t feel caked on nor did it feel sticky like lip gloss&lt;br /&gt;I knew that when I purchased a few of the colors would not look good on me personally. I plan on keeping 4 of them and giving the rest away.</li>
    <li> I received one of the lipsticks broken. I had no problem getting a refund due to the broken lipstick. The customer service was exceptional and expeditious.  Although the price is good, I decided not to reorder because I only liked 4 of the 8 colors. If I&#x27;m not mistaken only 4 of them are matte finish.</li>
    <li> Super cute! I use them everyday!</li>
    <li> The lipsticks leave a good finish, but the colors are all quite similar and slightly lighter than what is shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> They are amazing! my skin is tan and they all looked really great on me, if youre on the edge about this item dont be theyre great</li>
    <li> Good for the price gorgeous colors.</li>
    <li> Great price and great quality. I was a little apprehensive about ordering lipstick online without trying it on first. I also wondered how the quality would be, considering the price. I was very pleased. I normally use a higher end product, but I would say this lipstick is just as good.</li>
    <li> Nice but had trouble with 2 so far ~&lt;br /&gt;Nls15Pastel Pink is actually a bright orange.  After I removed the seal tape , I swiveled the tube and the lipstick moved around to the other side and wouldn&#x27;t go up.  Also, 1 other of the lipsticks had the seal removed and the info tag on the bottom was missing.  Unable to contact the owner.</li>
    <li> It comes on dry, not moist.  I put gloss over the lipstick to make it look moist.</li>
    <li> the lipsticks are really soft as expected and last for the right amount of time</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. Lipstick s go on creamy and appear matte but not dry. Very pigmented but not overly bright. I have medium light asian skin. All the colors were flattering except the red (a bit too orange) and light pink(too light).</li>
    <li> Some of the colours look pretty similar one applied. There was no dark colour like shown in the picture. However, product applies well with a slightly creamy texture.</li>
    <li> This is the best lipstick and it looks amazing. I love the finish and it is smooth and non wax finish. I would highly recommend this product. I will not buy another brand ever! The colors are amazing and are exactly what is pictured.You will not be disappointed with the color or texture.</li>
    <li> too many dark lipsticks</li>
    <li> There were only a couple of shades that I couldn&#x27;t use, but others may like. The color does stay and is matte. I think these are a good purchase overall for the price.  I&#x27;m set for lipstick now!  PS - None of them were broken as was mentioned in some other reviews.</li>
    <li> Luv this! Luv the colors. It lasts all day and leaves my lips moisturize</li>
    <li> Great product! Worth the money and very moisturizing. Plum is the only one the isn&#x27;t highly pigmented but will works great!</li>
    <li> Terribly cheap product, chalky and the color palette is not at all as pictured</li>
    <li> me and mom loved the colors</li>
    <li> Hated them. I don&#x27;t like the texture or the colors.</li>
    <li> Got this over the weekend and I was expecting something dismal or something disappointed but was relatively pleased to find out that they were selling the actual stuff and that they were not lying about the quality. The color was what I expected and it lasts the whole day thereby making it a real &amp;#34;worth-your-money&amp;#34;product. It wasnt harmful nor did it leave any side effect on my lips.</li>
    <li> Very nice lipsticks but very bright in color.  If I was young again it would be fun to be so daring but I need a little more subdued color scheme.  There is no smell, goes on nicely so the product is wonderful, I should have chosen my colors better.</li>
    <li> This are great lippies, super pigmented and the price does not beat it. However they do transfer but i set them with clear powder and make them matte and last a little longer, you do have to reapplied often but for the price is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Decent lipstick. Love the colors.</li>
    <li> Really good product, very nice lipstick. Was a little worried because they were so cheap but overall great product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing these lipsticks but Im glad I did. They are very pigmented.  Although I feel the colors arent true to its name. A few of them had a matte finish to it. They arent an all day lippy, you have to reapply but overall its still a great buy.</li>
    <li> I love these, the colors are nice, they apply well and aren&#x27;t too transparent like other brands in this price range. So happy with them.</li>
    <li> You should be able to pick your colors. And the delivery time was late</li>
    <li> The lipsticks are great, there are almost 4 or 5 the same color.. Which is fine if you really like the color red but I planned on really expanding my lipstick collection. Other than having a bunch of similar lipsticks it was a nice buy for the price</li>
    <li> I have only been using them for about a week but I am very happy with the colors and they are very smooth on the lips.  They did not cake at all. The color does a slight stain on the lips. I was able to drink something without everything coming off.  I am using these with the Italia lipliners and the colors of the two go really well together. I really like them and I will be looking for more colors in this brand.</li>
    <li> I really love this lipstick set, I was a little bit hesitant because of the price but they are awesome, very pigmented, soft and really good quality, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Since I prefer colors on the pink spectrum on the lips, this set worked for me. If you want a variety of colors, this is not for you. The colors are relatively the same  or just a shade or two off. It&#x27;s very pigmented, but also a little drying so you will need to wear chap stick or a lip balm under. I wouldn&#x27;t say this lasts 24 hours, probably 4-8 hours at most. If you wipe your lips, you&#x27;ll need to reapply. For the price, its definitely worth it if you like pink.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about my lipsticks and usually buy expensive brands. Recently I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find great quality for more reasonable pricing (I usually misplace or family takes them anyway). This by fair is the BEST I&#x27;ve found. I line my lips and I also use finishing powder so it really ups this product.  I hope more colors become available because the only flaw is the shades weren&#x27;t varied enough and the tops do have a tendency to fall off so make sure you secure them. I let my mom have one and she&#x27;s very basic with her lipsticks but she loves it and how it stays on and how its positioned to glide on smoothly.  Last long, stays put, doesn&#x27;t stain my teeth, and very smooth. Would buy again. Recommended and looks good on medium and dark skin shades. ☺</li>
    <li> Good product.some colors are weird</li>
    <li> Would give this the full five stars but unfortunately the lipstick rubs off easily and needs reapplying frequently</li>
    <li> Several different shades of red. What a score. I love the color red so this is really a prime purchase for me. Love it all!</li>
    <li> Love these colors! Every single one of them! The darker reds tend to stain my lips a little bit, but it lasts a long time! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
    <li> Only use like two of the colors here.. they&#x27;re nice but i just dont look good with many of the colors</li>
    <li> I love them! They look great</li>
    <li> Cool colors but when you apply, the lips look like they have cracks on them. It looks weird.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and only received 5 of the 8 lipsticks I was supposed to receive! Also a few of the lipsticks were melted.</li>
    <li> Wooooooooow really awesome&lt;br /&gt;Even loved more that l&#x27;oreal</li>
    <li> nice colors. would recommend them</li>
    <li> As expected.  Worth the price.  Love the red.  The pinks are very pink, but I mix and layer colors.  Very matte.</li>
    <li> I love them. I just wish the colors weren&#x27;t so similar.</li>
    <li> Stays on for a long time. The orange one was surprisingly my favorite!</li>
    <li> I love all the shades in this set. They&#x27;re all so pretty. These lipsticks are great, they&#x27;re very hydrating for my lips... Just wish they lasted longer because I have to reapply twice or thrice throughout the day...</li>
    <li> Great product! Stays on for at least an hour or two with only one application! Colors are perfect for any skin tone. Will reorder for sure!</li>
    <li> Very good selection of colors. They don&#x27;t last all day, but as long as you don&#x27;t eat, you&#x27;re covered. They&#x27;re creamy,mate and a little dry</li>
    <li> Havent used them too much but they are a little greasy</li>
    <li> I like all the colors</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I only kept half of the colors though. I don&#x27;t like how it feels or how it puts on. Does not stay on long either but eight lipsticks for that price... what do you expect? I&#x27;m a cosmetologist so if you know a lot about make up and beauty, don&#x27;t buy. And the lids come off easily so don&#x27;t keep them at the bottom of your nice make up bag!! Hope I helped someone decide.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected ! Too matte and no matter how much I primed my lips it was still &amp;#34;crammy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I thought it said &amp;#34;lipsticks&amp;#34; this is a cross between a balm and a gloss. I would not recommend them or this brand. I tried the lipsticks, lip pencils and eyeliner pencils. They all sucked.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expect, cheap material I wouldn&#x27;t but it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m olive skinned so the orange tone of these shades works ok for me. The colors are very bright and high impact colors on the orange side of the spectrum. Liked the quality, went on smooth and didn&#x27;t need too much reapplication. Great deal if you&#x27;re looking to try some new bright colors.</li>
    <li> None of mine came broken. Great lipstick for a cheap price, I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> I just received 7 lipsticks, and the order was 8.</li>
    <li> Got it today two days after I ordered it and it came in the same box I ordered my wig in so I got it all at the same time I love them well with the price</li>
    <li> Not as pigmented as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Fantastic colors, I love it</li>
    <li> They were mostly good! One of them broke after a bit, but it&#x27;s understandable, they went through shipping, and I can still use it. I love them and I&#x27;m wearing them right now!!!</li>
    <li> Good but little bit light colors</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price, my favorite color is the deep red. Some poeple were saying that 4 of the colors were pretty much the same, but i think it may just depend on your skin tone, i am fair skinned and i could clearly tell the difference between them all. there were only two that were very similar and the major difference between them was Shimmer level.</li>
    <li> these are well made lipsticks, the pigments are beautiful and it does last quite a while. well worth the investment</li>
    <li> I love the colors! They stick out and really finish a look.</li>
    <li> i am crazy for my these shades they are great and lasting is too good, i am so pleased with this product</li>
    <li> Great lipsticks! True to color and long lasting. Was slightly disappointed that one of them was broken when I arrived.</li>
    <li> Each broke with first use. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love them, great product and very well priced</li>
    <li> would not purchase again</li>
    <li> A nice rich color.  It would have been nice to of had more of a color variety.  Mostly in the pink family.  I like my colors a little less bold especially with the bright colors.</li>
    <li> Colors are beautiful on.  Very moist and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> These were not the colors expected, half were okay, half were an ugly brown orange</li>
    <li> omg i just love it...good $ price$</li>
    <li> great lipstick for the price but I wish they had more pink, corals, nudes and red colors  and delete the brownish tones which I wouldn&#x27;t be using</li>
    <li> Great colors - and they stay on all day. I bought these for travel to a formal wedding Texas in the hot summertime. The lip color stayed with me. I applied once just to freshen up after eating. Am delighted.</li>
    <li> The reviews I read said they last a long time, not true!</li>
    <li> These are a catch. I absolutely love these lipsticks they are so moisturizing. Some are sheer like the Orange is sheer but it&#x27;s perfect for creating ombré style lips. The lilac one is probably my fave it has a soft matte finish and is the exact replica of the Milani fuchsia freeze which isn&#x27;t made anymore. The colors are really nice. If the Nabi products are this good then I need to get my hands on their other products.</li>
    <li> I love it, especially the nude color. great product for such a great price!</li>
    <li> The lipsticks are very nice and they feel nice as well. The shipment came 4 days earlier than expected which was really awesome and the product is great, it looks really nice on and all the colors are very beautiful.</li>
    <li> Cute colors and the quality is great - but two of them came broken so I&#x27;m giving the product 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Very cheap, real long lasting and vivid colors. But the colors are all too similar.</li>
    <li> I got this as a little starter lipstick set because I&#x27;ve never used lipstick before. First off I like the different colors it comes with. Each one is different from the other one. It stays on my lips nicely and shows up really well. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t look to cheap. I would recommend to anyone who wants to try lipstick for the first time.</li>
    <li> Package delivered really quickly and product was amazing. It is long lasting and  applied really smooth. I like the variety of colors as well. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Too bright for an everyday look because I&#x27;m already so light. But good to play around with</li>
    <li> The colors are nice but the quality is more like a colored gloss than a lipstick. The color does not last and needs to be reapplied often. I have medium/dark skin tone and I had to apply the color several times for it to show.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cheap brand that has decent quality, I would stick to NYX or Wet N Wild.</li>
    <li> Not good! The colors are awful!</li>
    <li> very very very very nice thanks a lot</li>
    <li> These lipsticks do not dry out my lips as some do. The only downside is that they are not as bright as I hoped they would be. They need to be reapplied a few times throughout the day to keep the color fresh.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic quality for the price. I was expecting some decently good lipsticks, but these are great! Mostly true to color, a tad pinker than pictured, but in a good way! They are matte and don&#x27;t give off a whole lot of shine, and they go on well, covering fully, and not leaving any lip showing through. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for great lipsticks at a low price. One of mine had broken during shipping, but easily just fit back in the tube and all is well, the others were unharmed.</li>
    <li> This stuff ROCKS!!! It stays on for HOURS!!! Good colors. Has several beautiful shades of pink, a perfect bright red and some orangie colors that I don&#x27;t personally use but for the price, I don&#x27;t mind. This is a great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Excited to wear my lipstick. I Haven&#x27;t off worn lipstick since I was a little girl in grandmas makeup box.&lt;br /&gt;The versatility in colors for a great price helps me find the little girl in me and play modestly.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are a fantastic quality for the price. Most of them are true to the color. Some are a bit pinker than pictured, but not in a bad way. They don&#x27;t give off a whole lot of shine, and they go on well, covering fully, and not leaving any lip showing through. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for great lipsticks at a low price.</li>
    <li> For what these cost, they are pretty amazing. 8 awesome colors.  Love</li>
    <li> I love the colors so far.  I do wish that there were a couple darker ones, but I knew what the options were when I ordered this.  I am currently wearing Red Red and it is fun, bright, and has stayed on all day. It also feels good and does not cake up like some long-wearing types.  Shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Receive the order the color are OK but some don&#x27;t really blend as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> The color pay off is good, was skeptical at first. They aren&#x27;t drying to the lips and I got a good variety of colors/shades!</li>
    <li> I am a lipstick lover and rarely find shades that work for me, so the prospect of so many colors at such a great price was beyond my wildest dreams.  When I received them, I found I could use all but 2 colors, which I will pass along to a friend.  The lipstick goes on easily and smoothly, lasts better than most and I can&#x27;t be more pleased.  It was truly a bargain. Now I have a &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; at a fabulous price. No need to hesitate in ordering these.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors but disappointed that some of the shades were multiples in the pack. It&#x27;s okay though, made a good gift.</li>
    <li> I do like these products, the colors are pretty much what you get, my one reason to give it 4 star is because some of the colors are so close to the same shade that its hard to tell its a different shade at all, but they serve their purpose, Its a shade that you will need to wear with a gloss because when you put the color on it comes on sort of dry. However all in all its a nice lipstick for a good price, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> On my day off I swatched these right away on my hand to see how long it would last. I still had the stain even after washing my hands and using a face wash to take it off. A really good staining lipstick! They&#x27;re smooth and I will definitely be ordering these again!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife.. She was skeptical about this product before ordering.. Still she wants to try this reading about other reviews.. The package arrived safe and the lipsticks were intact.. Okay after trying she really liked this product.. The product went on smooth and no icky lipstick smell.. Good color range and the price is excellent..Really Red and pink shades of the lipstick were good.. Gave them 4 stars because ddnt like the shimmer shades much..</li>
    <li> great deal! love the lips sticks feel!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. I&#x27;m not exactly ecstatic about the quality.</li>
    <li> The colors aren&#x27;t too bad, though they are one the orangy side.  The reason I gave them 3 stars is because the color is very matt and dry.  I feel like I need to put gloss over the top.  For the price they are worth it but don&#x27;t expect too much from them.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money for me. Lipsticks came all smashed in their caps. I am very unhappy about it....!</li>
    <li> Love the color variety! Works very well on unbroken lips!</li>
    <li> This product is just okay. It can be very drying and doesn&#x27;t seem to go on smoothly. I wish there were different variations because some of the colors look very similar.</li>
    <li> Love it.! Will order again excellent colors although some of them doesn&#x27;t match with my skin color</li>
    <li> Rich colors, go on easy. Doesn&#x27;t wipe off easy.</li>
    <li> WOW a great product. I highly recommend! Got the lipsticks and they were all in tact, no broken ones. I tried out all of the colors on my arm and they  all seemed to come out as colored. The colors are very much like as pictured. When they go on the lips the color comes out so well. I really recommend getting them. Just a tip if you order over the summer, make sure you put them in the fridge when you get them because the heat makes them a little soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly drinking, eating, talking, kissing my kids. This lasted really well</li>
    <li> Purchased these to add to a bachelorette favor bag to add one more thing to make it a fun girly bag.  I picked these lipsticks over the others I saw online due to the great reviews.  The girls were impressed with the quality of the lipstick and even more impressed at the fact it came from amazon.  It rolls on with a medium pigment tint, and the colors blend well if you use two together to make it work best with your skin color.  I randomly had given them to the girls without taking their skin into consideration and everyone was still able to make the colors work for their makeup look.</li>
    <li> I love the colors but I only received 4 colors not 8</li>
    <li> The lipsticks were all too bright for me. They are still sitting in my bathroom cupboard. I couldn&#x27;t find ever one color that I could wear.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lipsticks. Goes on smooth, slight gloss, stays on! Does not flake/peel your lips.  Loved the colors too and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I only loved 3 out of the 8 but that&#x27;s only due to my skin tone. Nice for the price.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!!  Better colors than expected and nice and creamy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shades and smooth and moisturizing feel! Stays on for a couple hours before needs re-application.</li>
    <li> Great pigment and stays on long!! Great buy!</li>
    <li> A lot of people said these appear orange. To me they were true to color and actually more pink. They go on smooth but dont feel greasy. Good deal for 8 lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Fun colors, a few too many orangey ones for my taste but they work great.</li>
    <li> Was better then I expected.Came in the mail pretty fast.Only complaint is that 3 of the colors look the same. Other then that happy with it.</li>
    <li> For the price, the quality of these lipsticks is great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay only would use 1 of the 8.</li>
    <li> Love these lipsticks makes your lips feel soft and smooth the Colors shows on my lips so great I recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice colors but looks kinda cakey</li>
    <li> These are some very good lipsticks so far I ve tried the pastel pink and the pink rose and both did their job and  look great on me. The only problem is that they have a lot of pink. As I m a newcomer to trying lipsticks I wanted a more variations in colors, but I love those and I don&#x27;t regret the money spend on them. They have 2 shades of red also red red and red, an orange and a lilac and the 2 other shades of pink which are baby pink and rose pink. All the colors look beautiful, but so far I only tried two so I m pretty sure in the future I m gonna have to add comment to this review. Delivery was ok they were on time and they came in plastic bag inside the package which looks like a little freezer bag.</li>
    <li> Lipstick goes on smoothly and seems to last for a while throughout the day. The lids tend to fall off in my makeup bag, but other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> O MG ladies hurry up and get this ,the colors are brilliant and beautiful. I cannot say enough for this item except O MG.I want to know if the sell lip liner sets for this, but you really don&#x27;t need it, its just a preference.I has a look like they use in Hollywood, professional.</li>
    <li> 4 RED 4 PINK LIPSTICKS THAT RUBBED RIGHY OFF.  GRANDDAUGHTER LIKED REDS  I LIKED PINKS BUT TOO BRIGHT FOR 79 YEAR OLD.</li>
    <li> It is ok. All the colors look the same. Also they taste disgusting :/ it is alright I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***A lot of these revies with 5 stars are lies***</li>
    <li> I was happy with my order very cute and great quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m displeased. One of them is smeared horribly onto the cap and another is also smeared a bit but also the twisty part is broken and then when I tried to apply it onto my lips it broke off and I didn&#x27;t even put that much pressure into it. However the pigment isn&#x27;t bad. I&#x27;m definitely not going to buy this again.</li>
    <li> Excellent, just what expected.  Nice doing business with you...</li>
    <li> Beautiful lip color, they stay on nicely</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re very waxy. It feels like you&#x27;re rubbing a melting crayon on your lips. Not happy with the colors, very dim. Just don&#x27;t like them overall.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice lipsticks.. you will have to put on more than one layer initially for good color though. They appear matte but are easy to apply which I like. In my opinion, each shade looks different, despite some reviews saying some shades are alike. They come in shades of pink, red, and orange. I was surprised to see I actually liked the orangey shades. The red is also nice. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again but they are nice to have for the price.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly I saw lipsticks almost like these in Ulta in the Calvin Klein section.  The colors are bright and wear for a few hours.  Pretty standard lipsticks, but great solid colors true to what is shown.  You get a bunch of pinks in this, one bright orange and a few reds that are too similar to each other, but I bought this for the pinks.  The orange is NOT coral, so it&#x27;s straight up orange. Looks good on though.</li>
    <li> These shades are very appealing when you look at them, but when you apply them it&#x27;s totally different.  You can not judge what these will look like until you put them on.  Only two of the eight were NOT smashed into the top during delivery; these lipsticks need re-applying frequently and make sure you don&#x27;t have any dead skin on your lips because it will cake up.  Not my favorite lipstick...but you get what you pay for....</li>
    <li> Did not even get the product... Very disappointed in this. If your looking to buy just don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> colors look horriable when it is applied</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. But I tried it when it arrived so I could come up with this review. I hope she doesn&#x27;t mind. It&#x27;s just that I wanted to write something on my profile and this goes along my first couple of purchase and as a writer I get writing itches. Anyway, this is not the first time I wore lipsticks. My wife made me wear one a few weeks ago for a party. So I&#x27;m supposed to know how smooth and fragrant lipsticks are and this nabi lipstick did not disappoint. I just tried one of the eight so my wife won&#x27;t notice.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are very bright and seem to last only minutes.</li>
    <li> I stand by Nabi lipsticks 100%. I first heard about them from a makeup artist and I asked her where she go her lipstick from because it looked really high end. NOPE. Nabi. Since then I&#x27;ve bought 6 lipsticks so far and they go on so smoothly, it&#x27;s just amazing. I have my coworkers ask me what lipstick I&#x27;m wearing and when I tell them what it is and how much it cost, they&#x27;re in shock. I don&#x27;t even need lipliner</li>
    <li> Love the colors and it&#x27;s twisted very nicely.I buy it for my Wife. She loves Lipstick very much. Super fast! Exactly as described</li>
    <li> I love them . I read a lot of reviews before buying them and I was kinda upset with some of the reviews . They must not have really looked at what they were buying before they made their purchase . Mine are perfect and exactly what I thought I was getting . The colors match the picture and a lot of reviews seems surprised there was a lot of pink/red/orange colors when the picture clearly shows it . I am completely thrilled about the lipstick none the less . I wore Pink Rose around my house , ate and drank and stayed put for the most part . Of course there was a little fading but it&#x27;s really soft and didn&#x27;t need a lipgloss or Chapstick to put over top in my opinion !</li>
    <li> Pretty colors but my lips are getting dry even with Chapstick on top</li>
    <li> Love the variety of pinks and reds. The lipstick glides on easisly and doesnt leave your lips feeling dry. Very pleased with this purchase! Would definitely buy more products from Nabi.</li>
    <li> For the price you get what you buy. The colors look pretty much the same not unique from each other.&lt;br /&gt;There is only 3 colors that truly stand out, the rest are shades that blend together.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Efficient product which is long lasting, though the price is little on the higher side!</li>
    <li> Love the colors! I think for the price these are really good lipsticks. :)</li>
    <li> Just got them and so far I absolutely love them! I really love the two matte lipsticks that you get with it. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I wish that there were more red colors in this set, but most are pinks. So if you are looking for a bunch of different pink colors than you are in luck! They are beautiful colors.</li>
    <li> Perfect for any girl! Lots of beautiful colors all in easy on-the-go tubes! I would buy this again :)</li>
    <li> Sorry it&#x27;s garbage don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> the color is great but the texture is wird</li>
    <li> I never thought I could pull off bright lipstick. I have been so happy with these colors. I mix them for my own color or just grab one tube to put in my purse. The only reason I give 4 stores is because it isn&#x27;t as long lasting as I would like but for the price its an amazing deal.</li>
    <li> Never heard of this brand before, but love all the colors, and the way it feels on my lips when I wear it!</li>
    <li> I bought this cheap set to use as a dye for lip gloss I had made.  It melts well for all intents and purposes.  Then I actually started wearing one of the colors and everyone compliments me on it.  It&#x27;s pretty long lasting too!</li>
    <li> Nice colors but you have to put more than one or two coats on your lips to get the color to appear nice and vividly.</li>
    <li> These colors are super, great price and lots of lip stick.</li>
    <li> Really, REALLY loved these.  They go on so smooth and very evenly.  The finish is more like that of a balm, which is great, since sometimes I like that more matte finish.  If I want a bit more shine, I add gloss.  The lipstick goes on so lightly (though the pigment is generous) that the extra layer of gloss still doesn&#x27;t feel cloying.  All this for just a little over a dollar each?  Yes, please!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I recently started trying lipstick for the first time ever in my life. I wasn&#x27;t sure which colors I would like on myself so I bought this set so I would be able to try out 8 different shades at once without spending a ton of money. I like three or four of the colors in this set. Great set for the price.</li>
    <li> Smooth application and stays on for hours even after eating!  Colors are nice and this set was a bargain at this price!</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors. The lipstick goes on smooth and color is vibrant. Great if you want to try a lot of different shades for the price.</li>
    <li> Super cheap, you need to moisturize your lips first or it will wear VERY dryly and cheap. No shine, so looks kind of matte, except very drying.</li>
    <li> Colors are all pretty! They stay on for a while</li>
    <li> I´m very happy with my ítems, they were just  like  I expected.  I recommend  the  seller  and this product.</li>
    <li> I like these lipsticks. I wish there was a brown color included though.</li>
    <li> Beautiful unique and classic colors</li>
    <li> This lipstick is beautiful and it looks great on darker skin tones as well, and the quality exceeded my expectations. I loveee it!</li>
    <li> Awful! No pigmentation whatsoever! Not worth a penny!</li>
    <li> The colors are slightly different than the picture shows, but still beautiful.  The lipstick doesn&#x27;t glide on as smoothly as I would like, but are still good quality. I would buy these again. These colors are very complimentary to fair skin.</li>
    <li> This product is just what I expected it to be and I wear it all the time!</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are ok,  I think that have a weird smell.</li>
    <li> Some of the colors are similar but they are pretty good quality so i can&#x27;t complain. I did a review on them -&amp;#62;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;CJjhjiNMeug</li>
    <li> The lipsticks are made form organic materials making it safe for everyday use. It also prevents irritation that could damage the texture of your lips.</li>
    <li> after using them for a year when you put them on for a long period of time without lip condinter or hydering lip balm under it. It&#x27;s very drying towards your lip. It goes on very smooth and very pretty just wait couple of mins to dry little bit. The deep consider is that it&#x27;s very horrible to take off. It&#x27;s smears when you take it off and I found that old cloth and soap and water is the best way to take it off. Any other form of recovering it it&#x27;s horrible. It looks like your clown after taking it off.</li>
    <li> For my grandaughter and these were her answers....</li>
    <li> Not all of the colors are flattering on me, obviously.  But there are so many that are it exceeded expectations.  The lipstick color goes on smoothly, and actually lasts.  It has been a lot of fun to experiment with these colors, and for such a great price.</li>
    <li> Nice......lassting too.</li>
    <li> These hardly showed up. I couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing anything. Not much pigment as I was hoping they would have.</li>
    <li> Very happy with all thee colours, too soft and beautiful colours.</li>
    <li> Not a quality lipstick.</li>
    <li> I love the lipstick and the color&#x27;s its self... It arrived right on time however it had three of the same lipstick colors jus re worded I did not like that</li>
    <li> The colors look wayyy better on than how they looked in the tube. Some looked darker on and others looked lighter, and some looked brown in the tube but were really dark reds and purples. anyways, i love it.</li>
    <li> It applies SO well, at first you think its going to be hard because it looks really waxy but hey what lipstick doesn&#x27;t, and the colors are really nice. i love them all except mayvbe MAUVE, which i probably won&#x27;t wear as often. I got them all intact, none were broken, none were melted, its nice and smooth, no irritation and was well priced. I really loved it and will definitely buy again. Maybe next time you could offer some nude tones?</li>
    <li> I LOVE these lipsticks! They blend in very well with my skin tone! I wish the variety of colors were expanded because the colors vary around pink and red. Besides that I highly recommend this lipstick set! They do not smudge at all and last! If you&#x27;re looking for Matte lipstick, I would recommend using another product! Love these though!</li>
    <li> I just want to say that this is the FIRST lipstick I have ever bought that goes on as expected without me having to go over my lips a million times. It went over my lips twice and got the desired color I wanted. The color looks exactly as it should and my lips feel moisturized while I am wearing it. I rarely ever leave feedback but I felt compelled to because I was REALLY IMPRESSED! I was expecting to have to give one or all of them to my daughter but after trying them on I could NOT part ways lol!</li>
    <li> Pros: - Long lasting. You can eat, drink, lick your lips all day long and it will hardly budge! I went to Disney World and wore the red lipstick, it stayed on through water rides, food, the heat, etc. I only had to reapply once I think. - Hard to wash off, in my opinion this is a pro. It just goes to show how well it stays on through out the day. - Very pigmented, the colors show up well. - Absolutely in love with the red lipsticks. There&#x27;s a normal red and deep red and they both are gorgeous colors. - Good price for the lipsticks.  Cons: - Not the variety as pictured, the orange and purple are more pink than anything.  Only the reds and baby pink stand out. - I feel as if I bought 4 of the same exact color. Rose Pink, Pink Rose, Pastel Pink and Angel Orange all look the same on your lips. - They do not moisturize your lips and make mine feel dry so I tend to apply chapstick over it. - Not a smooth application.  For me personally the pinks look all too close in color and I feel like I bought only 4 different shades instead of 8. The color will stay on your lips all day the reds are gorgeous but when they run out I will not be buying these lipsticks again.</li>
    <li> the price is way too low than the quality of product. its awesome n i am loving them</li>
    <li> My two year old daughter accidentally ordered this while playing on my phone. I did end up loving them after it arrived so will be keeping. Not crazy about the Orange one</li>
    <li> Thrilled with my buy. For the price the quality and amount is amazing. Feels great on my lips and the pigments are vibrant! Plus, with prime it came the day after I ordered.</li>
    <li> Better than as expected.</li>
    <li> I bought these and the colors were nice . The price was perfect and it worked fine . I would recommend buying this . Also there were really nice colors .</li>
    <li> Lipsticks are my &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; so I had to try these, the price was right and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try all the colors.  They arrived in a plastic poly bag. Each lipstick had an intact seal and no colors were smudged on the clear plastic cap or marred. I did a swatch test and here&#x27;s where I was disappointed: four of the pink colors are only a shade or two off from each other. Pastel pink, lilac, rose pink and pink rose are extremely similar. I don&#x27;t know what world the manufacture lives in but lilac and pastel pink should be completely different from each other and different than rose pink. The colors do lean towards warm tones. There is only one frost, and as I don&#x27;t like to wear frost lipstick this was a positive for me, the rest of the lipsticks are a satin or matte finish. As for the pigmentation these are wonderful. There is no noticable smell, which I am fine with. The formula doesn&#x27;t feel overly drying and is actually pretty decent for a pigmented matte/satin lipstick. It doesn&#x27;t slip and migrate from your lips, it actually has amazing staying power. Whenever I wear lipstick and vape the lipstick usually ends up all over the drip tip but this one actually hardly got on it, I was almost shocked. This is an excellent lipstick, I just wish there was more variety in the colors.</li>
    <li> Considering the price, I didn&#x27;t expect such a fine product. These 8 matte lipsticks come in beautiful colors. But the best part is they stay on so long.</li>
    <li> Love them great colors</li>
    <li> Several were received broken and the lids refuse to stay on.</li>
    <li> Colors are bright, but not glossy at all.</li>
    <li> All the colors are a great shade and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Was not crazy on all the colors but I liked a few and they go on very nicely</li>
    <li> Just&#x27;s just ok! Not great, but not bad.</li>
    <li> It arrived on date expected, Nice, beautiful fun colors to carry on. I give some to my sister and friend. They like it much also.</li>
    <li> Love it! I bought these and the pencils to match ! It&#x27;s ok quality! But the colors are great!</li>
    <li> There was only one color that was realistic for every day use, the other colors are way too bright.  The stickers used to hold the tops on are so sticky, I had to use &amp;#34;goo-b-gone&amp;#34; to get them off.  The lids don&#x27;t stay on and I find the one color I carry in my purse lidless all the time.  I&#x27;m giving the rest of them away to my neice to use for dress-up and costumes.  Dissapointing.</li>
    <li> I love them :) the colors are amazing for any event</li>
    <li> I feel like these are a must have in every girls makeup collection! The price is amazing for what you get as well!!</li>
    <li> got it today and tried every color. i gave 5 star to the product cause most of colors i loved it  like red, lilac, rose pink. also i got 2 red and 2 rose pink which are my favourite. baby pink is also ok for something light. color which i don&#x27;t like are pastel pink and orange, they are i guess totally off as per my complexion which is wheatish. but totally worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Not the same colors as pictures. Still decent lipstick</li>
    <li> Good colors and quality, but one was broken when it arrived. There are also 3 colors of different shades of pink, and 3 of red,so if these colors are not for you, better choose other product</li>
    <li> The first lipstick I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t rub off in the 1st ten minutes love love love</li>
    <li> Very very pleased with these lipsticks very smooth and true to the colors shown they have no icky lipstick smell or taste they were shipped fast I am extremely pleased and will be ordering from this company again :)</li>
    <li> Great colors, very vibrant, when dry stays well and lasts a good 5-6 hours.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift, not sure of quality. They looked pretty though.</li>
    <li> its more than i expected from a cheep product. i love the colors they are very precise and creamy.</li>
    <li> Glides on nicely and have gotten compliments on the pink red color. Other colors not as deep, but good introduction to Nabi. No need for gloss and long lasting. Soothing on lips.</li>
