      <li>It&#x27;s a no-scent, leave-in conditioner gel that&#x27;s easy to apply and a little</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent product. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> This gel is perfect!  It&#x27;s a no-scent, leave-in conditioner gel that&#x27;s easy to apply and a little goes a long way.  It remains in my hair for control all day long, yet it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or unnatural.  It also makes my hair look just a little darker which frequently invites compliments.  I&#x27;d purchased Protein 29 for years at a regional store chain which suddenly dropped it from their inventory!  The other 3 - 4 brands I tried either looked greasy or were scented and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well, so I was overjoyed to find Stephan&#x27;s 29 again on Amazon!</li>
    <li> It is the only hair groom my husband will use.</li>
    <li> I have used Protein 29 form more than 20 years - If not able to find in local stores - Amazon has it. Excellent product for hair conditioning - Highly recommended - G. Greer, Minister</li>
    <li> This product stinks.  Whatever you think I mean, you are correct.  Leaves a bit of a greasy feel and the smell makes me nauseous.  I can only descibe it as an \\&quot;old hair-tonic\\&quot; odor, like something my grandfather may have used.  I just threw away a near-new tube.  If you don&#x27;t like that stiff feel, this may be okay for you.  I just couldn&#x27;t get past the \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY HAIR PRODUCT MY HUSBAND LIKES FOR HIS HAIR. HE HAS USED IT FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS. IT HAS BEEN GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND IN A STORE OR PHARMACY THAT CARRIES THIS PRODUCT. SO HAPPY TO FIND IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BY CAROL HULICK (GAMER RHI&#x27;S MOM)</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and can find no other like it.  Leaves hair manageable without leaving it stiff or greasy. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for decades, and it is no longer available locally throughout retail outlets.  I still like the product, know of nothing else equivalent, and have to go on line to find it.  I am glad I can do so.</li>
    <li> does not leave a gooy residue and when you wash your hair, you hair comes clean.</li>
    <li> Probably the best in the market place, but tough to find. Amazon is about the only place that I could source it.</li>
    <li> Been using for decades.  No longer available in stores that I can find.  I am glad to still be able to purchase somewhere.  The gel is not smelly and easy to apply.  Great product!</li>
    <li> THIS IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN STORES.  BUT IT IS THE ONLY HAIR GEL THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO ME.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product has been discontinued.  For someone with only a fringe of hair left, it is IDEAL because it adds some body to the hair and keeps it more controlled when wearing a cap.  Brylcreem does not!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about thirty years and find it superb to other hair dressings.My hair is sparse and thin but this product gives it good body without a greasy look. A little dab is all that is needed and a 3oz tube lasts me 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until a few months ago my local CVS had it in stock for under $5.00 and I became anxious as I couldn&#x27;t find it elsewhere until I searched Google and found several places that stock it at various prices. I finally settled for myotcstore.com at a price OF $4.44 plus $1.99 shipping. As much as I like dealing with Amazon, I feel they overpriced this item and hope they will reduce the price to a reasonable amount.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product my husband uses and none of the stores carries it any longer.  Fortunately , I was able to locate it here on amazon.  Hopefully they&#x27;ll continue to carry it!</li>
    <li> Score was discontinued long ago, but this product is very similar.  I use this and alternate with Old Spice &amp;#34;Spiffy Pomade:. Both enrich hair look.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  It keeps my hair nicely groomed without any oily substance or sticky gel.</li>
    <li> My Father-in-law has used this hair gel for years but can&#x27;t find it in his area any longer.  he was very happy to see that we were able to get it for him.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else when styling my hair.  Protein 29 keeps my hair in place all day and keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I use this product only if I can&#x27;t get the liquid Protein.  It is not greasy, and it holds thin hair in place!</li>
    <li> Thick, sticky gel that doesn&#x27;t wash out easily.  Not good for child&#x27;s long hair, it made it very difficult to brush through.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for a long time. It controls and protects his hair. At the age of 71 he still has a full head of hair. I am glad we could find this product since it is not on the shelf anymore.</li>
    <li> Used it for years. Not sold in stores, now. Works great to add moisture to hair in dry areas. Also use liquid form.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but I love the product</li>
    <li> I have used this hair product for about 30 years. Purchased on line because it is harder to find it now locally.Glad it is still available.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this personally but my husband does.  We originally bought it out of necessity while traveling when he ran out of hair gel.  It was not a big hit at first but it has really grown on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a smell but not an overpowering or bad one, just a faintly woodsy smell.  It does not leave his hair greasy or full of white flakes at the end of the day like so many other gels have done, it just keeps his hair in place and that&#x27;s that.  If you appreciate simple things that do their simple task well this one is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the packaging that looks like the gel is decades old deter you, it is a good product that just hasn&#x27;t had a lot of advertising modernization done.  Next time we will order the bigger container since it&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that are perfect but have been removed from the shelves of local stores to make way for inferior products.  I wish the Stephan Company could be apprised of the need for this excellent hair grooming gel and return it to the stores.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years even under the original Mennen Label, not Stefan.  The ingredient list looks the same to my old pharmacist&#x27;s eye.  It has served me well and delivers what it is billed to do.  I am glad that I found it, since I could no longer purchase it at the pharmacy under the Mennen name. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, have used it for years.  Have really unruly hair and very little now in my 70&#x27;s.  Will use it until I&#x27;m completely bald</li>
    <li> This is the best product for use on my hair to keep hair mosited and manageable.  Keeps the scalp moist and prevents dryness and danduff.</li>
    <li> This is getting harder and harder to find but as usual with these things Amazon came through. This stuff is economical to use, you don&#x27;t need much and it keeps your hair in place all day without being greasy. It is much better than the competition. Delivey was on time and in perfect order.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, but this time it appears to have changed. It was always a firm gel which was easy to handle and apply. This tube is more of a liquid, very runny, and hard to use. I&#x27;m not sure if the manufacturer has changed the formula, or if it is just this one tube, but it is not what I am used to.</li>
    <li> Great Product...using it for 60 years...still have some hair left at 88!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 85 year old father. He has used this product for a long time. He really likes the way it controls his fine hair.And he stills has a full head of hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Needs Local Distribution!</li>
    <li> Does a good job as usual. I have used it for years. It is not greasy or \\&quot;smelly\\&quot; but it does keep wayward hair in place!.</li>
    <li> This order was exceptionally well processed and handled with delivery of the product being very fast, delivered quickly just before the promised delivery date window.  The pricing was reasonable and below some who have tried to jump the price for this product.  I have used Protein 29 for a long time, purchased from a variety of sources, and this Amazon Simply Savvy combination performed exceptionally well overall, with no negatives.</li>
    <li> Not available elsewhere and I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
    <li> Great to get the gel I have been trying to use for over 20 years again.</li>
    <li> We were very please with how quickly we received the product and since we were familiar with the product it was just as we had experienced it several years ago.  So glad we found a place to buy it.  Thanks so much.  Judith</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my husband. He really likes it. It&#x27;s the only product that works on his hair so he was happy.</li>
    <li> I purchased Protein 29 Clear Gel for my husband. He has been using it for years and loves it. It&#x27;s inconspicuous, odorless, easy to use, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair gummy and it is a great product -- not expensive and works well.  A long time ago a pharmacist friends of mine recommended the product as being healthy for my hair!</li>
    <li> My dad loves this product. Too bad it is not sold in the store any longer.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have used for years, and am very satisfied with its performance on my hair.  The only place I seem to be able find this product is on Amazon.  They say it is available at some retail outlets and I have searched and have not found any locally.</li>
    <li> My old tube was from the time it was made by Mennen.  Nobody seemed to carry it when I needed a new tube.  Thank goodness for the Interweb!</li>
    <li> Good product that also fits nicely into travel bag and can meet the airport TSA three ounce&lt;br /&gt;limit for gels and liquids.  Works well and holds hair in place without being greasy.  No&lt;br /&gt;need to use heavy application as a small amount spreads quickly and evenly.  Only complaint&lt;br /&gt;is that it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Living in AZ my hair gets very dry and so Protein 29 completely takes care of it and it puts a nice shine on my hair.</li>
