      <li>A great product for severe dry eyes.</li>
      <li>great for severe dry eyes</li>
      <li>This product is great for my dog who has chronic dry eyes</li>
      <li>, Pharmapacks take the care to use an special care to protect the box inside, never saw the cushion they used, the result: The inside box arrived PERFECT!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is too thick to use it during the day but perfect for sleep-time.</li>
      <li>and I wake up and reapply, but I have been able to make it almost the whole night with one application of these.</li>
      <li>It feels soooo good when I put the gel in my eyes that I always sigh deeply.</li>
      <li>This came quickly saved me from running to the store to buy it and it works great as I have very dry eyes and have to use this type at night.  </li>
      <li>It is a super product and has done wonders for one of our cats.  </li>
      <li>Really good for chronic dry eye.</li>
      <li>Good eye gel for dry eye condition.</li>
      <li>Used for sometime with good results for dry eyes.</li>
      <li>but, well worth it.</li>
      <li>I do think this is useful and helpful for those who need some longer lubrication in the eye - for me it works for a couple of hours on cloudy days</li>
      <li>Since I rarely need them in the daytime hours, I then tried the nighttime Gen Teal</li>
      <li>I have fairly severe dry eyes, and I also live in Arizona.  </li>
      <li>Great product, but getting hard to find.  </li>
      <li>Never ordered any pharmaceutical product over Amazon, this was my first order</li>
      <li>Try a dab in each eye and then place a hot damp cloth over your eyes and rest them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>SO much cheaper than buying it at the store too!</li>
      <li>One thing that scared me when I first began using it, is that my eyes would be &amp;#34;foggy&amp;#34; in the morning.  </li>
      <li>It was highly recommended by our vet for daily use and the price is better online than in the store for the dual pack ($19 at CVS).</li>
      <li>and it is incredibly easy to apply, especially to a squirming dog.</li>
      <li>Nothing better for dry eye than this product.</li>
      <li>I stopped using eye drops with preservatives and, presto, my eyes got better - still dry eyes, but no allergic reaction.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
      <li>I think the gel works very well</li>
      <li>My doctor wants me to use this brand.</li>
      <li>It works really well.  </li>
      <li>yet they are very moist.</li>
      <li>I suffer from dry eye, and I am a huge fan of this product.</li>
      <li>Most drops only last a couple of hours</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe it cost a little more than some.</li>
      <li>But that all the eye gels and lubricant eye drops are outrageously expensive , as are most personal care products in the US, where they cost pennies to make and charge 8 dollars per 10 grams  (1/3 ounce) when all it contains is some plastic is truly amazing.</li>
      <li>I had tried more then a few eye drops before finding Gen Teal Lubricant Eye Gel.</li>
      <li>All I have to do is use some regular Genteal or my R drops and it clears right up.  </li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best stuff, including expensive prescriptions, I have found for dry eyes, allergy eyes and Giant Cell Arteritis (autoimmune inflammation of eyes).  </li>
      <li>but I feel old!).</li>
      <li>After spending weeks trying different solutions, e.g., eye-lid scrub, hot compresses, night gels, etc.</li>
      <li>Really fine product and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;All eye care products are expensive and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find this product at stores so ordering here is much more efficient.  </li>
      <li>No complaints as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
      <li>The box shown in the online picture has preservative free, and tear drops, but when the box actually arrived; this was not present (similar to the one that could be bought anywhere else).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used GenTeal for years.  You had a good price on it.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry eye, and I am a huge fan of this product. Nothing I have tried works better.</li>
    <li> Really fine product and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;All eye care products are expensive and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;In spite of that I&#x27;ll continue to use it since it is the best gel I have found for use at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars for that reason and also because shipping was fast and the order arrived in good shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using eye drops for years due to my serious dry-eye condition.  I had been using the best eye drops that HAVE a preservative, making it easy for me to carry them around.  Then, one day, my eyes starting getting an allergic reaction.  After spending weeks trying different solutions, e.g., eye-lid scrub, hot compresses, night gels, etc., I happened to read on some website that constant use of eye drops with preservatives can result in this allergic reaction.      I stopped using eye drops with preservatives and, presto, my eyes got better - still dry eyes, but no allergic reaction.  At home I use Refresh preservative-free eye drops, but now I can carry these eye drops - GenTeal tube - wherever I go.  They seem to work as well as the other Refresh products I&#x27;m now using.  This is good!</li>
    <li> A great product for severe dry eyes.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended these after my Cateract surgery.  I like the fact that these drops seem to linger longer than the drops</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the genteel drops, it&#x27;s a thick gel.  Not easy to use.  I won&#x27;t order any pharmaceuticals from Amazon.</li>
    <li> The product is good but I&#x27;d prefer  to deal with a liquid rather than   a gel.  I mistakenly ordered the   wrong item.</li>
    <li> Very strange product. Not drops, but gel so thick it plants wherever it is laid. Your eyebrows and lashes may love it but the eyes go begging. Bad pick.</li>
    <li> Keep in mind this product is for severe dry eyes, not for folks who have occasional issues. That being said, this will make your vision blurry for a bit but does work pretty well and helps much better than drops. I do use this with drops. Oddly enough, when I bought the smaller tubes of the same product it stinged a bit when it went in my eyes, but this large (very large) tube does not. I am not sure why - whether I am used to it now or what. I do think this is useful and helpful for those who need some longer lubrication in the eye - for me it works for a couple of hours on cloudy days (you know how weather works on your eyes!)</li>
    <li> Best treatment for dry eye I&#x27;ve found.  Requires only one application at bedtime to last for 24 hours. No other drops, including gel drops, provides me such relief. Only the eye gel in tube works--not the gel drops.</li>
    <li> After  having cataracts removed from both eyes, the doctor prescribed this for use at night to help keep my eyes from feeling like they had grains of sand under the lids.  Since the operation, my eyes don&#x27;t lubricate like they did previously, so I must use drops several times a day and this product at night.  I would not think of going a night without putting a little in each eye, and when on occasion during the day my eyes feel scratchy in spite of the drops, I  use this product also.  It is very effective.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my two pugs&#x27; eyes as pugs are infamous for eye issues.  One of my pugs is a stray with dry eyes as his eyes were not properly taken care of by his previous owner.  I think the gel works very well and it is incredibly easy to apply, especially to a squirming dog. :)  It was highly recommended by our vet for daily use and the price is better online than in the store for the dual pack ($19 at CVS).</li>
    <li> Sorry that I&#x27;d bought this believing it was the night heavy duty gel. Should have read the description more closely.</li>
    <li> I tried just about all of the brands from ointments to saline to gels. Generally the gels are the way to go if you have severe dry eye. I tried the oily ointments before I found out about the gels and they were just plain messy and in fact I would wake up with horrible sharp pain in my eye that also has corneal erosion. Now I only use Genteal drops and Gental night time gel.</li>
    <li> Simple fix for my chronic dry eyes.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great product, but getting hard to find.  I have been using it for years.  Dealer gave prompt delivery.  Usually I can find things on Amazon at a decent price than other web sites.</li>
    <li> This came quickly saved me from running to the store to buy it and it works great as I have very dry eyes and have to use this type at night.  Would recommend it to anyone with severly dry eyes for at night use. I use the drops for the daytime.</li>
    <li> This twin pack is the most affordable way to purchase this gel.  I use it on a Pomeranian with tear duct issues and it has really helped keep his eyes moist and helps prevent the irritation he gets having dry eyes.</li>
    <li> I have very dry eyes and have to use these drops every night before going to bed.  Most drops only last a couple of hours and I wake up and reapply, but I have been able to make it almost the whole night with one application of these.</li>
    <li> Some medications I need cause severe dryness to my eyes by evening. I had tried more then a few eye drops before finding Gen Teal Lubricant Eye Gel. This product is a tad pricey but, well worth it. Since I rarely need them in the daytime hours, I then tried the nighttime Gen Teal the only drawback is if you awaken during the night to use the facilities it made my eyes cloudy. So I stick to the daytime gel. My opinion this is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste,&lt;br /&gt;MommaBird</li>
    <li> This gel has saved my vision.  I have severe dryness and I use it before going to sleep.  It is too thick to use it during the day but perfect for sleep-time.</li>
    <li> Just what my optician ordered.</li>
    <li> In March 2006 had emergency eye surgery and ended up with a scleral buckle  sutured to L eye. One year later started having really dry eyes, eye pain in the morning and blurred vision first few hours of each day. Seems I have nocturnal lagophthalmos (medical term for incomplete eyelid closure during sleep). Basically I was drying out my corneas each night. After trying 5 different eye drops (including Genteal drops) I bought the Genteal eye gel for severe dry eye. The gel along with Omega 3 capsules and Tranquileyes moisture goggles at night have finally given some relief. I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering with dry eyes. The gel is a little harder to get into your eyes but the relief is worth it. I suggest you store the gel with the tip of tube facing down so it comes out easier. Be sure not to touch the tip of tube with your eyes or fingers to maintain sterility. Wash hands before applying and know your vision will be blurred for a few minutes after application as gel is thicker than drops. See an eye doctor too to check out your eyes if dryness persists more than 3 days.</li>
    <li> Label said preservative free, when it arrived it wasn&#x27;t. The box shown in the online picture has preservative free, and tear drops, but when the box actually arrived; this was not present (similar to the one that could be bought anywhere else).</li>
    <li> I have horrible dry eyes now that I am an old lady (Ok I&#x27;m not quite 50 yet but I feel old!). I also sleep with a CPAP which will sometime cause a breeze across my eyes at night.  These drops have been my savior for the past 4 years!  I use them almost nightly. Without them I feel like I have sand in my eyes.  They are a gel and make your vision blurry but used at night with your eyes closed they heal overnight and prevent dryness.</li>
    <li> Nice price and good  product for extremely dry eyes.</li>
    <li> better than systane balance</li>
    <li> GenTeal soothes tired eyes.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  No complaints as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  However, this is the only lubricant eye gel I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Just as in thee store but not needing to go out to purchase.  Used for sometime with good results for dry eyes.</li>
    <li> This eye gel helps me sleep through the night and so far, the others only give me an hour of relief or so. Dry eye syndrom is so painful, and life altering that if you are frustrated and exhaused from lack of sleep because you&#x27;re waking with eye lids stuck to your eye balls...you must try this gel! Be sure to take omega 3, get plenty of fluids, and talk to your doctor about tear duct plugs. You&#x27;ll be better in no time :-)</li>
    <li> Work well. Nice packaging. Not sure what else to say really, I bought them for my dog.</li>
    <li> product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
    <li> Product is the same wherever you purchase it.  BUT, Amazon had the best price. My wife says nothing else works as well as this product.</li>
    <li> Great price for a product that my husband requires.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Not as sticky as most of the others. My husband loves it. Really good for chronic dry eye.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t open my eyes some mornings before I got this.  It keeps my eyes moist.  SO much cheaper than buying it at the store too!</li>
    <li> Never ordered any pharmaceutical product over Amazon, this was my first order and I&#x27;m very satisfied, Pharmapacks take the care to use an special care to protect the box inside, never saw the cushion they used, the result: The inside box arrived PERFECT!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to find this product in some pharmacies chains, maybe they are going to retire from the market, but Pharmapacks have it in stock and with good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I would like to see in the future is the expiration date of the merchandise, you don&#x27;t know until you receive it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I&#x27;m purchasing again in this store.</li>
    <li> Good price and is very good for dry eye. My eye Doctor recommends this eye cream for dry eye</li>
    <li> It does as intended but is over priced!</li>
    <li> I have severe  glaucoma and dry eyes caused by the Rx drops I must use.  In my sleep, I apparently have my eyes partly open so drying gets worse.  This product is the best I&#x27;ve found.  One thing that scared me when I first began using it, is that my eyes would be &amp;#34;foggy&amp;#34; in the morning.  Then I realized ithat the gel was drying  on my eye a bit..  All I have to do is use some regular Genteal or my R drops and it clears right up.  It&#x27;s hard to find this product at stores so ordering here is much more efficient.  You do not want to run out of it!&lt;br /&gt;x</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that will save you if you have terrible dry eyes like I do. I use it every night and it works so well. I also use it on long plane rides. Thank you for this product!</li>
    <li> I may have tried every dry eye drop available over the past year and a half but these are the ones&#x27; I&#x27;ll re-order.  They &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; longer than any others which means I&#x27;m not using them every hour, a couple of times a day does they trick.</li>
    <li> This eye gel keeps my eyes moist all night long. I no longer wake up with gritty, dry eyes.  I live in a dry climate plus have lasik dry eyes but this gel works wonderful. I squeeze a teardrop shape of gel, put it in my finger and place it in my lower eye lid. This method was recommended by my eye doctor. Make sure hands and fingers are very clean.</li>
    <li> great products, great price and great and fast delivery!  my eye doctor gave me a sample of the eye gel to use and after trying many kinds to lubricate m y eyes, this gel seems to be the best.  the GenTeal is manufactured by the same company that a more expensive brand is that is hard to find, more expensive and the same ingredients</li>
    <li> Good eye gel for dry eye condition.</li>
    <li> Really helps the dry, scratchy eyes that seem to come with age and low humidity! I use it at night, and for a few minutes my eyes are a little blurry, but they quickly clear up and my eyes stay moist all night long.</li>
    <li> It is a super product and has done wonders for one of our cats.  Thank you and have a happy day!</li>
    <li> I have fairly severe dry eyes, and I also live in Arizona.  My eyes used to run or leak all the time.  This can be fairly embarassing, because I am a therapist.  The day I started using these drops I have almost no leaking from my eyes yet they are very moist.</li>
    <li> This was a good product. It was just not concentrated enough for my extremely dry eyes.</li>
    <li> great for severe dry eyes</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product that gives me relief from the extreme dry eyes due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome. The seller has set the price competitively. It feels soooo good when I put the gel in my eyes that I always sigh deeply. Restasis, a prescription drug, is said to treat severe dry eyes, but I could never get past the intense burning. Thank heaven for GenTeal. I tried virtually all the other drops and gels. This works for me.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best stuff, including expensive prescriptions, I have found for dry eyes, allergy eyes and Giant Cell Arteritis (autoimmune inflammation of eyes).  Try a dab in each eye and then place a hot damp cloth over your eyes and rest them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have nothing to lose but the suffering.  Give it a try.  You will be tap dancing with happiness.</li>
    <li> Anyone who has dry eyes, probably knows how well these Genteal gel works.  I put them on at night before bed, and I have moist eyes all through the night.</li>
    <li> I have used this Gel for at least 3 years.  I have extremely dry eyes due to cataract and laser procedures.  As part of my nightly routine, I put a little of this gel in each eye just before bedtime.  It works really well.  The next day may require the gel once, but usually it holds for the rest of the next day. It is thick, but it seems to melt right into the tears I do have. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Genteal gel is the best lubricant around if you have dry eye syndrome and you have to use a night time lubricant. But that all the eye gels and lubricant eye drops are outrageously expensive , as are most personal care products in the US, where they cost pennies to make and charge 8 dollars per 10 grams  (1/3 ounce) when all it contains is some plastic is truly amazing.</li>
    <li> Best dry eye relief I have found. Easy to carry with you. Wish it were cheaper that&#x27;s all I can say</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t mess around with any other bands. I&#x27;m serious. I&#x27;ve been using GenTeal products for several years. I have a dry eye condition caused by a surgery. My doctor wants me to use this brand. I trust him. And I&#x27;ve come to trust GenTeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it cost a little more than some. I don&#x27;t really care. How many eyes do you have? What are they worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from the really cheap stuff. It can do more harm than good. GenTeal is top notch.</li>
    <li> Can use during the day. Blurs vision only slightly and for a short time and helps soothe itchy dry eyes</li>
    <li> It works.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Great product - great service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over 6 months now, during the day and often in the middle of the night.  They do not leave any residue on my eyes.  I will continue to order these from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love using this product.  I would highly reccomend this to anyone who has dry eyes.  My doctor is the one who advised that I use Gen Teal.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my dog who has chronic dry eyes</li>
    <li> I was buying it locally but tried to see if I could find it on line.  It helps to keep my eye moist and less scratchy, which is caused by dry eye</li>
    <li> Nothing better for dry eye than this product.</li>
    <li> One of the best products!!!!!!!  Will not hesitate to recommende it also would like to recommend also the pharmacy they are the best</li>
    <li> This lubricant is also being used for our dog who has dry eye syndrome ... helps to relieve her eye irritation.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly. Expiration date satisfactory. I have used this product for years and am very satisfied with it. No preservative so no irritation caused by preservative. Best used at bedtime.  Dissolves by morning.</li>
