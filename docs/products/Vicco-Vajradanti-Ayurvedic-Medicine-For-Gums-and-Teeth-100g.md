<li> but it may be an unfair judgement considering</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years &amp; our healthfood store stopped stocking it. great for sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> So much better feeling in the mouth after using than the regular toothpaste amazing everyone should try and get away from the other stuff that has so many none natural things in them,I am into herbs and alternative meds so I am really happy with I am ordering again and again so amazing helps with gum pain I was having after flossing and gum bleed I Al&#x27;s use with the vicco vajradanti powder.alittle messy but well worth truly.</li>
    <li> your price is double then Indian Herbcare -200mg for $6.99 and that&#x27;s why you lost me here  adjust it and you might get me back---YOU ADVERTISE TO BE THE LOWEST??</li>
    <li> I wanted a toothpaste made with natural products, but was afraid the taste would be bad.  It is the best tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever had and will be ordering more soon.  My teeth feel as clean as when I leave the dentist.  If you are looking for a natural toothpaste you must buy this one.</li>
    <li> This medicine is recommended for everyone,who has issues with their gums.Once you start using the paste ,you will feel the healing effect instantly. Since I am free from gingivitis, I use it for prophylactic purposes and it works well. (my dentist can prove it )&lt;br /&gt;I would be glad,  if this medicine would be available at specialized vitamin department stores .&lt;br /&gt;I am lucky, I accidentally found it at the Indian store in Fort Worth,TX .</li>
    <li> When I get a new article, I use it right away - like Xmas every time. If I get a new shampoo, I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair ( and so on). So when I received this yesterday, I brushed my teeth immediately and have twice more before sitting down to right this review.&lt;br /&gt;First, I too was put off by no foil wrapper sealing the tube. I have been conditioned to &amp;#34;know&amp;#34; that that means an item is safe to use (whatever). Reason for the 4 starts and not 5 but it may be an unfair judgement considering the herbal ingredients probably render the goo more microbe free than what gets processed in the US (I daresay).&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance and I&#x27;ve not been sick yet (it&#x27;s been 18 hours) - I love this toothpaste! Reminiscent of another toothpaste I used a long time ago that I cannot find... My mouth feels clean and I swear my teeth are whiter already (I did not buy it for cosmetic purposes). I have ordered the powder which I expect will contain only ayurvedic components and no sorbitol, etc. I expected, based on reviews, for the taste of this paste to take getting used to but it&#x27;s not shocking at all - kinda foamy and mildy minty with undertones of cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;The intention is to get my husband to use it to get his gums back into shape. Been thinking of &amp;#34;oil pulling&amp;#34; but the horrific thought of triggering the gag reflex first thing in the morning has suppressed all the enthusiasm about committing to that task. Hopefully, between this paste and the powder that hasn&#x27;t arrived yet, we&#x27;ll see some results that will save us from swishing hard-to-find raw sunflower oil for 20 minutes as soon as you wake up.</li>
    <li> using this for over 8 years.... it has taken my gum problems away, completely.&lt;br /&gt;despite recommendations by dentists for all kinds of gum therapy, didn&#x27;t need it&lt;br /&gt;after six months of use.  Best stuff ever.&lt;br /&gt;would not use any other tooth cleaning paste.</li>
    <li> Specs sounded good for dry mouth, gums teeth, etc.  First taste is bad, after taste makes you gag!&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed my mouth out about 4 times and still couldn&#x27;t get rid of &amp;#34;lingering&amp;#34; taste.  I returned it!</li>
    <li> HEALTHY GUMS!&lt;br /&gt;It cleans teeth and gives you healthy gums. Amazed my dentist. I am allergic to most tooth paste.</li>
    <li> excellent toothpaste, without all the poison that one finds in the widely available labels.</li>
    <li> Actually I can get beyond the taste....which has improved over the years or maybe it&#x27;s just my taste buds.  Hopefully it will improve the oral health.</li>
    <li> The few of the ingredients below  are concerning,  I&#x27;m quit using this because of Sodium Saccharin and Sodium Lauryl Sulphate  and Benzoate Sodium all which negative  effects on health.  I&#x27;m disappointed with this product, not so Ayurvedic after all with the toxic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine Chalk, Water, Sorbitol, Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, Gum Tragacanth, Extracts of Indian Licorice Root, Currant, Common Jujube, Rose Apple, Barleria Prionitis, Asian Holly Oak, Persian Walnut, Prickly Ash, Indian Almond, Bedda Nut, Bishop&#x27;s Weed, Sarsaparilla, Catechu, Sappan Wood, Medlar, Cinnamon, Gum Arabic, Bengal Madder, Mayweed, Flavour, Sodium Saccharin, Methyl Hydroxy Benzoate Sodium.</li>
    <li> thanks, great product it work well. Thanks alot will order in the future. Once again, thanks thank thanks thanks tjhankss ksksks</li>
    <li> If you take sensodyne or colgate or any tooth paste you can find, there are tonnes of chemicals and rock powder (silica) in there which might give you a second thought, \\&quot;do i actually need all these chem to clean your teeth, doesn&#x27;t it work adversely on your cavities\\&quot;. We all being kept in their marketing gimmick. Vicco turmeric product has a long standing legacy of using natural stuff which is meant to be used by human.</li>
    <li> I ordered Vicco toothpaste along with Rejuv oil and a gum brush as a result of having a couple of &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; ratings from my dental office. They said that I would need deep scaling to try and improve the situation.  After three months of using these products (along with Periowash mouth wash) I&#x27;ve reduced both to 3&#x27;s and I expect this to improve even further.  So I feel that changing my toothpaste to this and ditching the commercial brands have helped turn the tide</li>
    <li> NICE AFTERTASTE, LONG LASTING CLEAN</li>
    <li> It seems like a very herbal based toothpaste. Pleasant taste.&lt;br /&gt;I like it so far. I&#x27;ve been using it just a short time. We will see. Seems to clean my teeth really well so far.</li>
    <li> I wholeheartedly recomend this toorhpaste! It has no flouride, no chemicals, and it leaves a refreshing clean taste afterwards. It is specially good for those who have sensitive gums or suffer from tooth aches. This tooth paste is perfect!</li>
    <li> The taste of this stuff is ungodly. Like mint mixed with dawn. I don&#x27;t know what is tasting like mint, nothing minty is listed in the ingredients on their website (lists clove and cinnamon, which you can&#x27;t taste at all) It foams unnaturally, and keeps foaming no matter how well you rinse your mouth. I wouldn&#x27;t wish this stuff on anyone, it certainly isn&#x27;t natural</li>
