      <li>I&#x27;ll keep buying it until there is something better.  </li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I love this for in between hair appointments.  </li>
      <li>By far the best among the best gray covers I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried three other brands.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily.</li>
      <li>I just wish that the product didn&#x27;t come off so easily when touched, or when it comes in contact with something (i.e., gets on fingers and nails if you scratch your head).  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, covers well.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product, big help, every day use.</li>
      <li>The absolute PERFECT cover up for your grey hair between hair color appointments!</li>
      <li>covers well &amp; the nozzle is what makes this unique in that you can target just where you want coverage.  </li>
      <li>Works great but dulls the hair applied to.  </li>
      <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
      <li>The Super Fine nozzle lets you pinpoint exact placement.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t go through it so quickly.</li>
      <li>I first bought a can in a local grocery store and loved it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, I order it regularly to do touchups for in-between dyes.</li>
      <li>This product really helps hide those grays in between hair colorings!  </li>
      <li>It is also messy to wash out -- shower for sure; don&#x27;t shampoo in the bath!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to use and fast with instant coverage.</li>
      <li>It really extends the time between colors.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a lot considering the packaging for shipment and the can that goes straight to the landfill.</li>
      <li>and it really works, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>no dripping, no weird obvious lines or powder....</li>
      <li>The spray applicator is tiny and targets exactly where you want the color to go.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>It not a heavy spray</li>
      <li>After 205 years this product keeps &amp;#34;old Abe&amp;#34; looking young.  </li>
      <li>Covers gray with a natural look.</li>
      <li>No mess,</li>
      <li>Usually buy this locally and will from now on; this product works and the brand is my favorite but</li>
      <li>The only draw back is that you can&#x27;t really run your fingers through your hair once it&#x27;s applied</li>

<li> I have tried root marker type concealers, mascara type, little swab/lip gloss applicator type, and this one is by far the easiest to apply, dries fastest, and works as well as the others.</li>

<li> but it leaves black stuff in your hair</li>
<li> Too ashy, also too dark for what  i tried to accomplish!</li>
<li> this is very dark...</li>

<li> I like the results and the ease of use; however, there is too much waste for so litle product.  </li>
<li> I usually have to dye my hair every 2weeks.</li>
<li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t dull when applied &amp;</li>
<li> I like it very much, at least it complys with what I was expecting.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Covers gray perfectly. Stays in til you wash it out.</li>
    <li> What a GREAT product!  It really extends the time between colors.  I just wish more came per can so I don&#x27;t go through it so quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Received on time.</li>
    <li> Works well, covers the roots. The only draw back is that you can&#x27;t really run your fingers through your hair once it&#x27;s applied, it feels kind of like hairspray, and you&#x27;ll have brown fingers.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Just don&#x27;t run your fingers thru your hair or your fingers will be black</li>
    <li> Very good product. Easy to use and with very good result</li>
    <li> I first bought a can in a local grocery store and loved it. It not a heavy spray and it dries quickly. I do t understand why Sally&#x27;s or Ulta wouldn&#x27;t carry something like this.</li>
    <li> Usually buy this locally and will from now on; this product works and the brand is my favorite but the color is NOT as pictured! The can shown is the color of the medium brown I wanted...this is very dark...color is actually called &amp;#34;Black/Dark Brown&amp;#34;, item description says &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34;, leaves out the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; written on the package</li>
    <li> This works GREAT!  Covers gray with a natural look. Washes out easily.</li>
    <li> Love this spray! It gives good coverage to my gray hair. Now I can go longer on my visit to hair stylist! Not only I&#x27;m saving money but also saving a lot of time!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I order it regularly to do touchups for in-between dyes. it&#x27;s excellent, it&#x27;s not greasy, does&#x27;t rub off or leave residue, it just simply does what it says, covers gray! It&#x27;s extremely easy to use and fast with instant coverage. All you do is spray and go and then that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> works great but it leaves black stuff in your hair</li>
    <li> I like the results and the ease of use; however, there is too much waste for so litle product.  The can says 40 uses.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a lot considering the packaging for shipment and the can that goes straight to the landfill.</li>
    <li> covers well &amp; the nozzle is what makes this unique in that you can target just where you want coverage.  still can&#x27;t touch or scratch as it will come off.  using hairspray afterwards helps seal it in.</li>
    <li> By far the best among the best gray covers I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried three other brands. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and a good solution. It is a great product, big help, every day use. I recommended it</li>
    <li> The absolute PERFECT cover up for your grey hair between hair color appointments! The Super Fine nozzle lets you pinpoint exact placement.</li>
    <li> Too ashy, also too dark for what  i tried to accomplish!</li>
    <li> I love this for in between hair appointments.  I actually used it for like 4/5 months while I was prego! Saves you money for sure!</li>
    <li> Good grooming gives me confidence.  Unless they&#x27;re bald, no one my age has NO GRAY HAIR -- some people look wonderful with their lovely silver gray hair, but I don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve used other products, but Gray Away has been my &amp;#34;go-to/quick fix&amp;#34; for a few years now, since it first came out.  I color my hair regularly, but Gray Away always comes to my rescue when those gray roots sneak up on me and make me look tired . . . and ancient.  It&#x27;s handy and easy to use and washes out when I shampoo, so I&#x27;m always at my best.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, at least it complys with what I was expecting.  It solves my problem.</li>
    <li> Maybe my hair is too gray for this to work okay.</li>
    <li> I have tried root marker type concealers, mascara type, little swab/lip gloss applicator type, and this one is by far the easiest to apply, dries fastest, and works as well as the others. The spray applicator is tiny and targets exactly where you want the color to go. I will be using this from now on.....</li>
    <li> This product really helps hide those grays in between hair colorings!  I just wish that the product didn&#x27;t come off so easily when touched, or when it comes in contact with something (i.e., gets on fingers and nails if you scratch your head).  It would be perfect except for this.</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully! I use it in between dyes and it really works, I highly recommend it. You wont regret it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, in original packaging.</li>
    <li> After 205 years this product keeps &amp;#34;old Abe&amp;#34; looking young.  This is a &amp;#34;must apply&amp;#34; before going on stage. An expensive product, but worth it!</li>
    <li> I love the product and it works just perfectly as a filler.</li>
    <li> This stuff has changed my life! I usually have to dye my hair every 2weeks. I heard about this product from a hair dresser and bought it at CVS.....WOW! It has bought me an extra two weeks without dying my hair. You just spray it where you need it and go! No mess, no dripping, no weird obvious lines or powder....it is revolutionary!!! I have bought bottles as gifts for friends and relatives! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, covers well.  Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> Works great but dulls the hair applied to.  It is also messy to wash out -- shower for sure; don&#x27;t shampoo in the bath!  BUT, this is the very best product I have found and it works wonderfully!  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t dull when applied &amp; a pre-wash is essential.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it until there is something better.  Good seller &amp; prompt delivery as promised!</li>
