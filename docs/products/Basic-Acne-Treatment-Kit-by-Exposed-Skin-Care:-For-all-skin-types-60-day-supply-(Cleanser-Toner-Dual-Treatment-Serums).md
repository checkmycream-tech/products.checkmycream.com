<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have seen a HUUUUGE difference in my face. I suffered from perioral dermatitis and rosacea. This product has cleared it up quickly and has kept it clear!! My face has a glow and it&#x27;s clean!!!!</li>
    <li> tought it would work.</li>
    <li> After researching the best acne treatment for adult skin; Expose was tied for the #1 spot with another popular product on several websites. I followed the instructions word for word for 4 weeks and have not had any skin improvement! Definitely a waste of money :(</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Suffered from adult acne for quite some time and could never find a product that was affective until now.  It has done a phenomenal job in clearing up my skin.  I can&#x27;t tell the last time my skin looked this good.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne-prone skin and have tried every product out there. I&#x27;ve had no luck with any other products and I was getting pretty desperate as my wedding was getting closer and my skin still looked terrible! I was skeptical after reading other reviews of this product, since it was the same stuff I was reading on EVERY product I had tried and nothing had worked for me. Still I decided to give it a try and purchased the Basic Kit. After a few weeks of using it I noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. Not only did my acne disappear, but the marks started to fade and my skin just looked healthier! I have never been so happy with a product and highly recommend it to anyone who has tried &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> What a major disappointment these products were. My daughter tried them for three months and saw no improvement in her skin. She followed the instructions very carefully every day. We definitely wonder now if they are a scam. We subsequently went to the dermatologist and got a prescription face cream and her acne has cleared up nicely. We would not recommend that anyone with real skin problems waste money on these products.</li>
    <li> My teenage son has been using this product and has been very happy with the results. It has helped clear up the breakouts and taken away some of the redness from his previous or current outbreaks. His only complaint would be to much of the product comes out to easily, not much control over how much or fast it comes out.  thanks</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff. Works great. Proactive and everything else did not. Thisstuff had my teenage sons looking like a baby&#x27;s bottom within 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> I used to use the Clinique acne line, until I found out I had a serious gluten allergy.. which led to an allergy to dairy.. and soy.. fun stuff. Not really, especially when you just turn 21.. Of course the lotion in this line had barley as an ingredient. That explained why my skin was slightly irritated. So I was left searching in the dark for a face wash that was safe for me to use and would clear up whatever was going on with my face. I tried a few and got no where fast. My acne got so bad, I went on a search to find make-up I could use to cover up. Then, one day my mom was searching online trying to help me out and came across Exposed Skincare. After we confirmed it was gluten, dairy &amp; soy free, we took a chance and ordered it. The most amazing thing started happening, my skin started to clear up and the scars were fading!! Now I&#x27;m back to no make-up and my skin is actually glowing! It&#x27;s NEVER been this clear, I&#x27;ve even been complimented on how nice my skin looks! I can&#x27;t thank Exposed enough for making such wonderful products!! :) I certainly have no problem recommending their products.</li>
    <li> Used for about two weeks now and I feel like it is making a positive change.  Not overly drying which is important because of my Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINOR WARNING: One of the serums can bleach your towels.  It says so right on the bottle but unless you happen to read that one particular line on the back you might ruin something.  Just wash your hands with soap after applying.  Lucky for me my wife wants different towels anyway.</li>
    <li> Works well, but cleanser bottle is small, and lasts only about 30 days. Other products last 2-3 months. Recommend buying an extra bottle of cleanser to start.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone) I&#x27;m 21 and I&#x27;ve been struggling with the acne problem since 14. I tried many different acne solution lotions and creams, but none of them worked well for me. After spending two days writing the reviews about Exposed, I decided to buy it regardless the price. Well, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied by now, I use it for 2 weeks already, and I see the results. But what I would recommend you, is to order expanded kit, not the basic one as I did. Cause you really will need the moisture cream, I regretted that I didn&#x27;t order it, although the difference was $10 only. Your skin becomes a little dry at the beginning, so better you to have the moisture cream for it. I liked that shipping was pretty fast and absolutely FREE. Good product and works well.</li>
    <li> This is certainly the best acne treatment I have ever used. All my life I searched for the best acne product and then I got old (45 years),now I get a few pimples and it works to keep my skin smooth. However my teenage son now has severe acne and I ordered this product for him. It is just miraculous. He gets every type of acne: blackheads, whiteheads and cystic acne and believe it or not this product purifies the skin and eventually rids the skin of all blemishes. It truly is great I recommend this product and thank the makers of this product. I hope to always be able to buy this product and I consider this the secret to clear skin for people who suffer with acne.</li>
    <li> I originally found out about Exposed online researching for an acne treatment. I have tried Proactive and never saw the results that i was looking for. After a week of used exposed i noticed a huge difference. not only did my skin start clearing up, but my skin just looked healthier. After 2 to 3 weeks, other people started to notice my face clearing up. I will have to say that you really do need to follow the directions and do it twice a day; in the morning and at night. But I defiantly will be purchasing Exposed again!</li>
    <li> I like exposed acne treatment and have been continuously using it for about a year now. I am pleased by the way it gives my skin that smoothness and suppleness that I don&#x27;t get from many other products I have tried before. But I don&#x27;t feel that it is doing a great job treating my acne (though it helps a bit) that is why I have to incorporate other products into my regular skin regimen that successfully dries up my acne better. So with the combination of exposed acne treatment and the unblemish by rodan and fields, I am now getting the results I can say I am more satisfied. Specifically, the exposed products I am regularly using are the exposed facial cleanser, the acne treatment serum and the moisture complex but alternating it with soothe cream by rodan+fields and when I  get that nasty big acne, then I use the sulfur wash of rodan+fields unblemish. I have to experiment with different timing and different combinations to get the result that I am happy with. If I stop the use of exposed products and just use the unblemish products then I don&#x27;t get that smoothness and suppleness in my skin, my skin gets too rough since the unblemish is too strong for me if I use it consecutively, it&#x27;s only a reinforcement when the worse acne comes. I still do get breakouts here and there (hormonal thing) but the general condition of my skin now is smooth and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> My 17 year old daughter has struggled with acne since she was 13.  Acne was never &amp;#34;bad enough&amp;#34; for acetone, but dermatologist had her on antibiotics for a year, prescription strength benzoyl peroxide, retin A, monthly facials etc.  Tried several other products, proactive plus, paulas choice etc.  I ordered the  treatment kit for her about 6months ago and her skin has responded to this like nothing else she has tried.  It took about a week to see results and her skin is remarkably clearer than ever.  She still gets an occasional breakout from time to time, but much less severe.  I have reordered a few times and my teen would tell you that for the first time in her life she is happy with her skin.  Never heard that before!</li>
    <li> Greetings to all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Exposed Skin care for about 8 months now. I used to break out badly due to several reasons and was in desperate need of an acne care system to clear my face and do it well. I have used several products, those you can get from the store and prescription and nothing worked consistently. I researched skin care systems and I saw good reviews about Exposed and decided to give it a try. After using it, I saw the great effects at about 3 months and have been using it ever since. It is definitely work trying and patience is needed! The only reason 4 stars were given, is that nothing is perfect! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful to all and blessings to you!</li>
    <li> Finally, an easy process that results in clear skin!  I bought this kit at a friend&#x27;s recommendation and have continued to buy it for my teenage son.  His acne has really improved while other acne soaps did not work.  Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my daughter. She tried several other products including Proactive. None of them seemed to work. Exposed worked great! Cleared her acnes in the first month and the tiny red dot scarring marks in the second month. Her skin looks healthy and clear. I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S you need to follow the routine and use all the products especially in the beginning.</li>
    <li> I never had acne... until I was 25. Not only was it embarrassing to have swollen red spots all over my face, but I was surprised by how bad it hurt! I used expensive products from several name brands for years, but I still constantly had breakouts and pimples. Finally, a friend told me about exposed skin care; and after my first basic kit arrived, I have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To purchase the product, just go on their website. They ask you if you want a membership, and you get a discount shipping (or maybe its free). With the membership they automatically send you a new kit when the estimate you will need one. If you are uncomfortable with this, with your first box you get coupons that give you a discount on future products. So ether way, its a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously recommend this product! its just fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have very stubborn acne and this product is the first one that actually worked in clearing up my skin.  For the first time since I was a teenager I have clear skin.  It is great to find something that actually works!  I would strongly recommend giving this product a try to anyone who suffers with acne and have unsuccessfully tried other products.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t worked for me and all my money got wasted</li>
    <li> I have suffered from moderate acne for about 10 years now. I have tried a number of diffetent facial cleansers and acne prescriptions which gave me little to no results. Using proactive actually made my skin worse! I ran across Exposed Skin Care one night while I was browsing through diffetent acne solutions and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did! Within just a few days idea an incredible improvement in my skin. My acne was disappearing, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin! So far I love this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves having clear skin!</li>
    <li> My daughter has mild acne.  Before choosing Exposed I searched the web for a product with the most positive reviews.  It really does work great, her acne was just about gone within 2 weeks.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been so thankful to finally have an acne product work!  My skin was clearing withing a week of using Exposed Acne Treatment, and I noticed my old acne scars healing, also the overall texture of my skin has improved dramatically. I am now more confident to show off my skin in bright sunlight. I am still using the product after a year and won&#x27;t go back to anything else, this product is a natural wonder.</li>
    <li> I thought I loved Exposed Skin Care, but when I ran out and my face broke out like crazy, I realized I not only love it, but I cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything out there. (Over the counter &amp; dermatologist) Nothing worked without horrible side effects. I love this product!!! It clears up my acne &amp; is gentle on my super sensitive skin. Now it is all I buy.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and have always had acne-prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for about a year. It&#x27;s made a difference! I use the basic kit and have found that I have to use all of the components consistently to get the best results. My only complaint is that I go through the wash and toner fairly quickly.  I&#x27;d love to be able to buy larger quantities!</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and have found that this product is gentle enough for my aging skin without over drying. I have been using this product for almost a year.</li>
    <li> it WORKS!!!! says what it supposed to do and does it.. ive seen results in a matter of weeks.. i love this product and i have been using over a year now.. i have oily skin and this is the only acne solution that works for me AAAAA</li>
    <li> I purchased this Exposed skin care set about a year ago when my skin was flaring up due to stress. My current skincare regimen that had worked before was no longer doing the trick, so after doing some online research I decided to get Exposed. I was not disappointed. The cleanser is really light, gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and not overly dried out. The Clear Pore Serum that is used overnight also fights acne while I sleep and the Acne Treatment Serum is light enough to use under my makeup everyday. I started seeing results in about 1-2 weeks and haven&#x27;t had any issues with my skin since. My only qualm is that I have to purchase this product online, but if you sign up for the package they automatically send it to you so you never run out. I definitely reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed for about a year and a half now and have been very pleased with it. It is much gentler on my skin than Proactive was. I love that the clear pore serum is moisturizing to balance out some of the drying ingredients in the acne treatment serum. I started using this product when my skin was at one of its worst points in my life and my skin has stayed mostly clear ever since. I know that some of my acne is hormone related so any topical solution can&#x27;t completely prevent my skin from breaking out, but Exposed does a great job of quickly clearing up whatever breakouts do occur. I would highly recommend giving Exposed a try!</li>
    <li> All I have to say is that &amp;#34;Exposed Acne Treatment&amp;#34; is the solution !  It COMPLETELY solved my acne problem.  They say when you reach 40, you are your own best doctor.  So, just before I found Exposed, I experimented cutting out various foods that I thought provoked acne.  Guess what ?  Me quitting raw (uncooked) milk was my main culprit because within a week or two, many blemishes on my back (and some on my face) disappeared.  Somehow cooked foods with milk in them don&#x27;t seem to bother me as bad, but that&#x27;s research I may not complete for a while.  The point is, the succinct literature that Exposed sends you with their basic kit ADVISES you to lay off milk !  That has flied in the face of most of my dermatology advice (and books), but Exposed is obviously on the ball.  And also guess what ?  Recently, dermatology &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; are now linking acne with milk.  Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;  So, did quitting milk do it alone ?  No, because that acne had been around for almost 30 years and obviously had a stronghold.  Hang in there, because in less than one month, the super-easy morning and evening steps gave me clear skin.  And what&#x27;s so nice about all this is the natural ingredients they use.  I have a somewhat sensitive face, but never been dried out by their product.  It&#x27;s a God-send.  It works, is easy, and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no side-affects.&lt;br /&gt;  No one is paying me to say this, BTW.  I&#x27;m just so happy I found something that works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;  Bottom line:  Buy it now, and have GREAT EXPECTATIONS !</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a little over a month and have seen good results. OTC products at the local drug store worked for awhile but then I needed something stronger. I would recommend this product....</li>
    <li> Exposed Skin Care really works! I saw differences in the first week of using this product.  I got the basic kit as a present and would suggest the moisturizer as well.  Though clear, after using Exposed for 3 weeks I noticed my skin becoming tight and dry.  Everyonce in awhile, my skin would start to flake in the areas I felt were tight. After applying a gentle moisturizer the tightness and flaking went away.</li>
    <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to say that this product does help, at least for me, more than any other topical acne products I&#x27;ve tried. They claim your acne will be gone in 10-14 days and I didn&#x27;t believe it and I was right, it definately wasn&#x27;t gone. It doesn&#x27;t help with acne scarring at all however it does lessen big pimples it seems like.</li>
    <li> I am almost 40 and thought I would have acne for the rest of my life - until I found this line of products.  It is the one and only line of products I have found that actually work.  They are a God send!  When you adhere to the easy-to-follow routine, and the benefits are life changing.  I actually get compliments on my skin now - something I thought would never happen!</li>
    <li> I have tried many many products. This is a little pricey, but by far the best I have ever used. It is so gentle and smells very refreshing...not like chemicals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Exposed for about 4 weeks, but so far so good. I still have occasional breakouts (mostly hormonal), but they heal quickly and the products do not over dry my skin. I wear foundation on top and it doesn&#x27;t feel thick nor greasy. I&#x27;m looking forward to buying a second batch! Goodbye proactiv!!</li>
    <li> So happy to have found a product that actually works.  After 2 times on accutane, we were desperate to find something else to help. So far so good with these products.  Our teen cannot go on accutane again, which is another heaven sent drug, but it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep the acne away permanently.  Beyond frustrating too that government and lawsuits ruined better access to that amazing drug.  But luckily we found this product to get through the rest of the teen years...severe acne is a horrible disease.</li>
    <li> This product worked pretty good for my skin. I have had acne since I was 12 and this did a nice job clearing it up. Make sure to follow the steps for bet results.</li>
    <li> If you decide to try the product, use it for at least 5 weeks. My acne did not start to clear up until the end of week 3! It did completely clear up in about 5 weeks! However, I thought I was cured and stopped using the product and started having small breakouts again. So continue the use if it works for you. Also, if 90% of your acne is clearning except some stubborn pimples you mane need to get a deep chemical peel to get the dirt that&#x27;s clogged deep down..Hope that helps</li>
    <li> Works well if you use it regularly. Some of the bottles in the package are too small and run out pretty quickly</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I used this products for months and did not had good results.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with cystic acne for a very long time and was very miserable... I have tried proactive, clindamycin, minocyclin, lerosett, Bactrim, microdermabrasion, retin A, neutragena and the dreaded accutane... Even steroid injections and differen gel, I also used oils. Some of the products I can&#x27;t even remember, but nothing worked... I thought I would give Exposed Skin Care a try after watching some videos of people who have used this product with great success. I started using Exposed five days ago and to my surprise, it hit the ground running... My white heads, blackheads, excessive oil production and the cysts are dramatically reduced! I usually would get three to four big bumps a day and since I started FIVE days ago only one came up... I&#x27;m super excited about what&#x27;s to come, because I can feel it this time around that Exposed is the one... Can wait to see what it does in the next few days... I know they&#x27;re many skeptics out there, I was one them too... I  didn&#x27;t think Exposed would&#x27;ve work so fast, so this was also a major plus... I did go back and research the ingredients and now I realize why it&#x27;s so effective... Science and nature coming together. I know I&#x27;m nearing the end of my struggle and I can&#x27;t thank them enough!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel good, even if it isn&#x27;t super fast with total clearance of acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the basic kit for about 3 weeks now. Considering that I have tried all OTC products, and Proactive for about 1 year, none of them have produced the results of Exposed.  I have suffered with adult acne for years and finally I have a chin with no big, red bumps or millions of blackheads and whiteheads.  It costs about $60 a month and the product I get could be just a little more.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended the line of Exposed skincare to me last year, and my daughter and I have been using it since. The skin cleanser is my favorite: its gentle enough for my 11-year-old and \\&quot;tough\\&quot; enough to help treat and prevent my breakouts. I have one bottle on the sink, another in the shower, and another in my gym bag. I use it at least twice daily, and I never have trouble with dryness. I use it in combination with the cleansing tonic and acne serum (when needed). My second-favorite product is the mask, which really helps whenever we have breakouts. The mask clears up our skin after just one use. Love it! The moisturizer adds just enough moisture without bothering my oily skin. I highly recommend this line of products--and I&#x27;ve tried so, so many over the years.</li>
    <li> Used this product for 2years now and i can&#x27;t stop using it! (even though my acne has disappeared now!) Had stubborn acne around side of my face and nothing I used worked, except for this product! Amazing results within a month or two of using it and it has never came back! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am close to my 40&#x27;s &amp; STiLL have acne..what?!?  thought that was one of the benefits of getting &#x27;older.&#x27;   Well, I have been using Exposed Skincare for my acne on/off for a few years and it works for me.  It has really cleared my face within a couple weeks (when acne at it&#x27;s worse for me).  I make sure to follow all the steps for best results.</li>
    <li> I had been fighting acne like alot of people since I was a teenager. I tried every product out there...Proactive, all brands and nothing changed. Until a couple of years ago I had had enough, searched on line and found Exposed! I had never heard of it and of course was skeptical with my past luck, but I decided one last try...I was amazed within just a couple of weeks I could tell the difference! After a month I kept looking at myself in the mirror amazed that it was me-with a clear beautiful complexion! I never thought I would be complemented on for my beautiful skin and now I am all the time! When you feel great about how you look your life changes and exude confidence naturally!   I have been using Exposed for just over two years, I travel a lot and do not leave home without it!  It works like nothing else I have tried before!  Thank you Exposed-Please continue the good work!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of expensive products and mostly felt like I had to accept my terrible acne. I was determined one day to find the best acne product after several articles I knew Exposed was the very best out there, and actually felt hope and was really impressed by all the good reviews. I was so grateful that my skin cleared so quick I became super confident about my face. I will never stop using Exposed Skin care but I&#x27;m confident that Exposed Skin Care will take me to the day where I may not need acne medication.</li>
    <li> Exposed Acne Treatment is great for adults with constant breakouts.  I&#x27;m 36 and have always had consistant problem areas.  Proactive was too harsh on my sensitive skin and quite working after a short period of usage.  I have used Exposed Acne treatment products for over a year now and it is wonderful.  It has a pleasant fragrance and is tolerated well by my sensitive skin.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had used Proactiv in the past and was not fully satisfied with the products and results. After doing some research online, I decided to try Exposed and I&#x27;m happy I did. My skin has never been too bad, but Exposed has kept my skin clear, moisturized and feeling healthy. I really like that the the solutions don&#x27;t carry much of a scent and aren&#x27;t rough on your skin. If you have bad skin and are willing to spend the money on an \\&quot;acne kit\\&quot; then I would definitely recommend Exposed over other products.</li>
    <li> Over the yrs. I have tried several different products and product kits never feeling very impressed with the outcome. When I stumbled across Exposed Skin Care I was a little skeptical, but i was looking for something different so I gave it a try. I immediately noticed that the products left my skin clean while they did not leave it skin dry like the others I had tried in the past. There was no burning tight feeling at all or those towel stains that some of the other harsh products would leave behind...scary to think I use to put those things on (of all things) my face. I have recommended this to friends. Especially those using really harsh abrasive products.</li>
    <li> I have been using exposed for over a year now and will not use anything else. I have tried many over the counter products and prescription medications including accutane and this is the only stuff that has worked. It does not over dry your skin and leaves it feeling soft and comfortable. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have had problems with acne for about 20 years.  This is the first product that I have used that completely cleared up my acne, and prevented any new breakouts.  I have used this product for about a year and I have to say it&#x27;s worth the money becouse it works!</li>
    <li> I bought both Proactive and Exposed at the same time for my friends 13 year old daughter. She is already getting bad acne. Proactive was a failure. Exposed is working good, so I&#x27;ve continue to buy it for her. I do recommend it and I hope it will work for you as well since we are all different.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne for 20 years.  I have tried everything under the sun including prescribed topical treatments and nothing worked for my acne until I tried Exposed. It really works! I have been using Exposed for 2 years and it is still working for me.  I recommend Exposed to everyone that suffers from acne especially adult acne and body acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed for exactly four weeks, and I have definitely seen improvement. I have run the gambit of products, and I did Proactiv for much too long. Nothing seemed to work. Now, in my twenties, I am excited to see that my skin looks smoother and brighter than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After four weeks I am NOT acne free, but like I said, there is a definite improvement. I think with continued use I might actually have blemish-free skin, and that is something to get excited about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con, however, is certainly the price tag. But you get what you pay for, and if you order of Exposed&#x27;s website they almost always have coupons and deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another pro tip is that this product, like any topical medicine, will dry your skin out. But again, I found much worse irritation when I used Proactive and Neutrogena. Applying simple oil-free moisturizer/lotion once a day fixed me right up. You can even purchase moisturizer in your Exposed kit, though a cheaper off brand worked great for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this isn&#x27;t a miracle product. It does take time to heal. Overwhelmingly, I am really quite pleased with the progress.</li>
    <li> Bought the five piece system in June and have been using it religiously.  I was hoping to see some results in two weeks or so, but there was nothing.  After two months, I&#x27;m still in the same boat.  Some days, I felt as if my skin was really oily halfway through the day, and there really weren&#x27;t options for that.  I was also frustrated that when I called the customer service to cancel my subscription (don&#x27;t get the subscription, it&#x27;s welcoming yourself to spam city and useless emails ALL THE TIME), they kept me on hold for about twenty minutes and then said they couldn&#x27;t help me and I would have to go back online to cancel.  I then had to go through that process, and it wasn&#x27;t confirmed, so I had to call back to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t going to be charged $60 again later.  I also, throughout the process, had many problems with the face mask, which I had also purchased later on.  Overall, it was not a quality system, and I was disappointed in their customer service.  I will be going back to the original acne.org system.  One plus is the microfiber washcloth!!!!  I could scrub off all of my make-up, and despite the pure white fabric, it washed out completely just being run under water.  Incredible, I will be keeping that!</li>
    <li> Prior to using this product, I rarely used any product on my face.  I had rosacea for about a year and a half before attempting to find something that could manage the problem and keep my skin looking good.  I have been using this product for over 4 years and have found that it just plain works.</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed Skin Care for several years now. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  I did not have severe acne but I always had several zits on my chin area.  I have been using Exposed and have not had an issue since.  Even through the stress of planning a wedding and now the crazy hormones of being pregnant.  Exposed is really gentle on your skin and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I have tried going back to my other cleansers when I run out of Exposed and forgot to place a new order.  My skin burns from those but not with Exposed!</li>
    <li> I first started using Exposed Skin Care 1 year ago and I have found it excellent. I have sensitive skin and it was very soft for my skin and did not upset the balance. It has also been very effective and I have totally clear skin. I would really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I would give this product zero stars but it wasn&#x27;t an option. Didn&#x27;t work at all for me. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for more than five years now.  I&#x27;ve always had problems with breakouts and never found anything that has provided such consistent results.  At this point, I&#x27;m not using the full kit all the time but I never stray from the facial cleanser, toner, and acne treatment serum.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I started this product a couple weeks ago.  Have shown some improvement.  Definetly works if used correctly.  I love the green-tea toner! :)</li>
    <li> I tried all sorts of stuff to cure my acne and nothing worked, including proactive. I found Exposed online one day and ordered it. After only a couple weeks using it, my face was so clear. I was stunned and absolutely fell in love with the products. It is so gentle and smells good too. Its really easy to use and does not dry out my face at all. If you want to get rid of your acne just order Exposed and you will love it just like I do :)</li>
    <li> I serendipitously found this product while I was trying to find the Proactiv website.  I have had acne since I became a budding teenager.  Throughout my life, I have tried antibiotics, Rx creams, Accutane, Proactiv and all OTC products.  When I happened upon the Exposed website, I figured I had nothing to lose.  I bought my first Basic Kit and began my life acne free.  My face for the first week was a bit dry, adjusting to all 4 products.  But by the month&#x27;s end, I had clear skin that was finally healthy, smooth and soft.  I love the Clearing Tonic. It balances my skin, leaving it feeling refreshed.  The products are free from any overwhelming scents.  I have stopped having to wear make-up as cover-up.  I have had many people compliment me on my skin, telling me how lucky I am to have such &#x27;nice&#x27; skin.  Each time anyone does, I tell them about Exposed and what it has done for me.  Having the membership (kits auto-shipped) every 60 days makes it effortless.  The cost is equivalent, if not better than most of the high-end products available.   I feel confident leaving the house fresh faced without make-up.  I LOVE this product with all of the natural, yummy, good for your skin ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and have found some that don&#x27;t work, some that make acne worse, and some that tore my skin off.  I have been using Exposed for almost 2 years and I would recommend it. I even recommended it for my teenage brother.  They have changed the facial cleanser a little bit for more of a soap rather than a watery liquid.  I still like the product, especially the acne treatment and clear pore serum.  This is really good for people that have slightly sensitive skin because it is gentle.  So just try it! I am sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work.  I decided to try something new and actually stick to the face washing regimen, seeing as other washes and medicines never actually worked for me either because I didn&#x27;t follow instructions or they didn&#x27;t take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 26 year old male who has had acne problems since I was about 14-15 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with a picture journal on a weekly basis and after 4 weeks still saw little to no results.  Then after a couple months of still seeing little to no results I just decided to stop.  That&#x27;s when a few friends of mine said to me, &amp;#34;You know what your problem is? Is that you wash your damn face too often. STOP WASHING YOUR FACE!!&amp;#34;.  So of course after trying every piece of medication and over the counter skin care products I stopped washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go to the gym on a daily basis and work in an automotive repair garage, I do not wash my face with soap anymore (only if I REALLY need to) only water and my skin has never looked better.  Other than some small blemishes from time to time, I get nothing like I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY ANY OTHER SOURCE OF ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS BEFORE DOUSING YOUR FACE WITH CHEMICALS.</li>
    <li> I have used the Exposed products for a couple years now and I would say it works ok.  I started out with a huge breakout just before I decided to order it.  Within 15 days, my face did clear up.  However, over time, my face has broken out again and again (some of it is due to hormone fluctuations)but overall it just hasn&#x27;t been what I had hoped.  I&#x27;m thinking of trying something else.</li>
    <li> This product is most effective when used as a kit and it is a great change due to the fact that it is so gentle on your skin yet still works so great! After years of harsh chemicals, this is the best product Ive used thus far.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and offers you fast, long-term results. Would definately recommend this product to anyone fighting moderate to severe acne.</li>
    <li> Exposed is fantastic! Im 25 years old and have been seeing a dermatologist for acne since the 3rd grade. I have tried EVERYTHING from prescription gels/creams to acutane to $500 worth of microderm abrasion with little results. I spent a lot of time researching acne treatments and this system came up rated the highest. I love that it has lots of natural ingredients. While it has not completely eliminated my acne it has made an infinitely greater difference than anything else I have ever tried. The lotion makes your skin really soft to. I recommend using a spot treatment as well like Murad&#x27;s Acne Spot Treatment. You may also need an additional moisturizer in the winter time. While the product is expensive it is worth every penny to me to have clear skin.</li>
    <li> I was excited to start this considering I&#x27;ve tried everything else, but I&#x27;m pretty convinced there&#x27;s no solution out there that&#x27;s going to completely heal and help acne! It has been about a month since I started this product. I&#x27;ve been faithful to it and used it as instructed. I don&#x27;t see a dramatic difference and I still get cystic acne like I normally do. I do like the Clear pore serum and the acne solution cream. I could, however be fine without the cleanser and toner. The toner is like water and you can&#x27;t use your hands to apply it as told to do in the instructions, I have to use a cotton ball. I&#x27;m going to continue to use this till I run out but it said I&#x27;d start to see results in 2 weeks but my skin is basically the same but on top of that I&#x27;m getting little pimples I never got before. I have horrible blackheads and I get cystic acne occasionally and I was praying this stuff would help but on top of that now I&#x27;m getting these little pimples to worry about now. I&#x27;m kinda just disappointed that its not reversing my acne and healing the scars like the product says it does. I don&#x27;t drink soda and I don&#x27;t eat horrible and I drink tons of water and exercise normally, so I know its not me. Just really wish I could get rid of my acne completely and find something that will heal scars while reversing the acne itself. So back to more and more research I guess.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have had acne for 20 years. Tried MANY prescription and non-prescription products for Acne. Within 1 week of using this product, there was a difference in my face. I have been using this product for about 4 months now and have not had a pimple in months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Proactiv customer for years and decided to switch things up after Proactiv updated their system.  I came across Exposed Skin Care and after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It works great!!!  I have only been using it for 4 days but I already see results.  My skin is much softer, I have fewer blackheads, and some skin discoloration I had has diminished.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I love Exposed skin care! Nothing else has takin care of my acne quite like this product has! So glad I have found this product and takin full advantage of its benefits!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne my whole life. I&#x27;ve used proactive for a long time and I think my skin just got use to it so I wanted to try something new. I got the 2nd biggest kit. I still have break outs but not as bad. So far this product has worked well. I have yet to find a product that clears my face completly but this seems to be the best so far.</li>
    <li> First, a little background: I only had issues with acne/pimples once I became pregnant. So much for that pregnant woman \\&quot;glow\\&quot;; My husband used to joke that he was worried that I was going to give birth to a pimple instead of a baby. (How lucky he was that his pregnant wife only suffered from zits and not emotional outbursts.) But once my baby was born, I continued to be plagued. I chalked it up to the fact that I was breastfeeding. Once THAT was done, I expected my skin to return to its former luster. Alas, motherhood apparently entails the additional burden of acne in my case, and thus began my earnest quest for a cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a couple of major systems without luck, and also had my PCP prescribe a topical antibiotic (Cleocin-T) to see if that would help. It did not. But honestly, I didn&#x27;t feel that my problem was serious enough to seek out the services of a dermatologist. Compared to some, my battle with acne is small potatoes indeed.  But, after 2 years...enough is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did some online research (I know, not exactly the most reliable of research sources, but bear with me here) and I was impressed by the Exposed double guarantee and their professed 96% improvement rate. I subsequently ordered their basic kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved their system, and while I can&#x27;t honestly tell you whether there was actual improvement in the first 30 days - I felt like there was improvement. Moreover, I saw definite improvement as I continued to use the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two favorite items in the basic kit are the cleanser and the Derm-X cloth. I truly feel that for my situation, those are the two most important components. The cleanser is very mild (I cannot find any other store brand that has a SA percentage as low as theirs) and the Derm-X cloth gets rid of everything left on my face. Your skin seriously feels like new after using this cloth, even if it doesn&#x27;t quite look like new yet. However, their caution that you should NOT use fabric softener whenwashing this cloth is really important. Mine accidentally found its way into the wrong load, and I noticed that my cloth wasn&#x27;t as abrasive anymore, ergo - it didn&#x27;t do its job in quite the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the kit is great too, although I did also note the same thing as one of the other reviewers, which is a crystallized (almost like a small sliver of glass) component in the nighttime cream (clear pore serum). Since this didn&#x27;t bother me and the product was working, I didn&#x27;t bother contacting Exposed, I just continued using it. Otherwise, I actually really liked the natural smell of the nighttime cream. It was nice being able to crawl into bed beside my husband without feeling like I smelled like a medicine cabinet. The day cream (Acne Treatment Serum) doesn&#x27;t smell quite as great, but I cover it up with sunscreen and makeup anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, my basic kit ran out, and I did not order a new one (I had chosen the \\&quot;no membership\\&quot; option) as I intended to become pregnant again and did not know if Exposed was safe to use during pregnancy. (Some doctors say you shouldn&#x27;t use products which contain salicylic acid when pregnant.) Since that time, I have noticed a huge backslide in the clearness of my skin. As a result, I will be re-ordering the cleanser and a new Derm-X cloth ONLY, as I believe that the low salicylic acid content of the cleanser alone is probably safe to use topically. (Although I will obviously run this past my doctor as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story made short: This system worked for me, and what&#x27;s more, I actually LIKED using it. I think products that work for you make the process less tedious as a whole. I only stopped using the system because of my own concerns about SA and pregnancy, but apart from that, I would have continued using Exposed without any hesitation. Indeed, depending upon the opinion of my doctor, I may very well pick it up again regardless.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old son has terrible acne as do most teenagers.  We tried soap, lotions, off the counter products as well as another popular brand of acne product!  Nothing worked until we tried Exposed!  His face was clearer than it has ever been, then we made the mistake of trying something cheaper and back came the acne.  We are going back to Exposed and never looking back.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This product was more than I expected! I am a 16 year old teen who HAD breakouts and when I started using this product I seen results within weeks!!!!!! The only bad thing about this product is that the price is way expensive, but hey its worth every cent. The cleanser lasts about a month, so if your willing to pay $70 to almost $100 do it because it works!!!!!</li>
    <li> Exposed works on and off for me. Sometimes it works well and other times I need something more. Obviously my acne has something to do with my hormones. I would like more product for the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed Skin care for almost 2 years now and love it!!!! Exposed Skin care is the only products that works for me without having to take meds. It worked very quick, within a couple of weeks. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for 2 weeks but I can ALREADY see my face clearing up!! The products never feel too heavy on my face and do not make it extra oily or dry.  Definitely try this!!</li>
    <li> I have had acne for almost my entire life!  I was very skeptical trying out the exposed skin care products because I have had so many disappointing results in the past.  Exposed Skin Care basic kit was all I needed and I saw fabulous results.  My have few pimples that show up, and when they do, they are quickly disposed of by the acne serum.  I am so grateful to have the Exposed Basic Kit to help aid my fight against acne.  My wedding would have been dreadful with out it. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one year now, and I have to say that it really does everything as claimed. I used to break out often, however after using Exposed Skin Treatment I rarely get breakouts. The creams are soft on the skin, none of the dryness that other Benzol Peroxide products gives. It is rated the no.1 or no.2 skincare product in the US, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 2 years now and it still works great. When i first started using it, everything was cleared up in a little over a month. After that i never have had bad acne again. I get minor spots every once in a while, but they last about a day. Great product, and i will continue using as long as i have to.</li>
    <li> ONLY product that has EVER worked for me!!!! I was so amazed and happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I purchased Exposed after trying tons of other products to clear up my skin.  Exposed was the only product that worked for me.  It even worked better than a prescription medication a dermatologist prescribed to me.  I was amazed by the results.  For the first time in my life, I have clear skin and it&#x27;s all thanks to the Exposed skin care line!</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed Acne Treatment for years now, and have absolutely no complaints.  I tried EVERYTHING before: from drugstore remedies to physician prescribed medications and nothing worked.  Then I tried Exposed and it really did change my life.  After all these years I could leave the house without a full face of make-up.  I finally didn&#x27;t have to keep trying to mask my acne - and could \\&quot;expose\\&quot; the real me.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  For those new to the product, it may take a few weeks to work but give it the time - it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Skin Care for over one year now and I must say, I love it. I have very oily skin in some places, very dry in others, and this product has been so great for me. At first it didn&#x27;t work, but after about four weeks it started to take a dramatic effect. Where I used to have very bed skin, I now have smooth, clear skin. Exposed is certainly a product that I will continue using, and one that I would recommend to anyone else.</li>
    <li> At the age of 46 I have had mild acne with monthly breakout for years.  Nothing worked so I googled \\&quot;best acne treatment\\&quot; and Exposed Skin Care came up.  I have been using it for about 8 months and have been acne free since.  My skin feels smooth and looks amazing.  I have been recommending it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> This stuff sucks broke me out horribly into cystic acne my skin is the worst it has ever looked I gave it a month and no improvements.  Do not fall for this crap.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this stuff. There was about a 2 week adjustment period where I was a bit concerned it might be drying my face out too much, but I stuck with it and I am happy I did. Now my face is clear without feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used ProActive in the past but I never saw the results that I have attained with Exposed.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Im a teenager that has had acne since 7th and I&#x27;m in highschool now. My acne isnt horrible but its still pretty bad. I have used everything from proactive to clear skin max to neutrogena to skin id, literally everything. Then I tried this product. My skin is very sensitive so if you dont get the moisturizer it might get dry but just make sure to apply the moisturizer and it will be nice and smooth. I noticed a dramatic difference in about a week and now my acne has pretty much gone away you just have to make sure you are very consitent with it and use it every single morning and night. Also the vitamins are excellent because they make me feel so much more healthier. Thank exposed!! definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I get the Exposed acne basic kit every 60 days, and it feels much more reliable than the proactiv product I used to use. My skin looks clearer and definitely feels better. Sometimes there are off days, but as long as you remain consistent, it is good!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work. get Pro-activ</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my daughter who has the most sensitive skin and it has worked beautifully! She is absolutely thrilled that we finally found a product that clears her skin but does not cause her face to get red and too dried out! She is happy and that makes me happy! Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> Exposed acne treatment is amazing!! It works way better than clinique, albany, neutogena, skin id, etc. You get what I mean. Even though it may take a couple weeks to show results, it&#x27;s definitely worth the wait. I used to have mild acne, especially on my forehead and the t-zone. After three weeks though... forehead acne - GONE! blackheads around my nose - GONE! The shine on my forehead and especially on my nose has also gone down. Even though it&#x27;s pretty expensive, this stuff is top quality and works really well. Exposed also gives you extra ways to get store credit, which helps bring down future prices. The travel kit is perfect for trips, with the right amount of each product. The only thing you should be concerned about is if you&#x27;re extra sensitive to smell. The scent seemed a little off a first, it had almost a forest or woodsy scent. I&#x27;m fine with it, but if you&#x27;re sensitive to smell I would gradually build up on the amount of product you use so it&#x27;s not so strong.  Otherwise great product and I&#x27;m never going back! Thank you Exposed!!!</li>
    <li> I just recently started breaking out alot more so I purchased Exposed Skin Care after reading great reviews about it.  I LOVE IT! It has really cleared up my skin.  If I do get pimples, exposed helps speed up the process of them healing.  I have sensitive skin so it made my face pretty dry at first so just use it sparingly.  However, after a few days my skin got used to the product and no longer gets dry.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has an acne problem and it is very reasonably priced which makes it even better.</li>
    <li> Guys, if you, just like me have been looking for that one products to take the stress of bad acne away, EXPOSED is simply the best! Took off a day a while back to search for the best acne treatment on the internet. Finally, I landed on EXPOSED and been using it for a month now - the progress is phenomenal! Got rid of my old proactiv kit, been using EXPOSED dilligently following all 3 steps twice a day and my skin tells it all! I&#x27;m so happy with it, wow.[[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.I use to use proactiv and it dried up my face. I switched to this product after all the deeing all the good reviews and I absolutely love it. My face is not dry and I can actually see it working.</li>
    <li> No improvement at all with this product after 60 days of faithful use.  Will be returning and using the 1 year guarantee.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It took a while to see results (which the products tell you it will), almost a month to really do what i wanted it to do and now I&#x27;ll continue it.  Great for those acne sufferers who cannot seem to find the right product(s).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as they claim. I am still breaking out and because i have to use the product twice a day, my skin is a little dry (although it is the cold season). I am not sure if it is the product or going from washing my face once a day to twice a day, but my pimples don&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
    <li> I started using this kit on July 2013. I had noticed the improvement on my skin on the second week. After 4 weeks, my skin felt really smooth though I still have 1 or 2 pimples few days before my period. But nothing to worry as after a few days, my pimples doesn&#x27;t leave any blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exposed works better than proactiv because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I have used proactiv for 6 years and it also worked but it was very drying for my skin so I had to apply moisturiser all the time. With Exposed, I never have to worry about flaky skin when I apply my foundation. Right now, I also noticed that my pores have become smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews show that Exposed are paying their customers to post a review, I say this is true but what they said was \\&quot;Just quickly write an HONEST review...\\&quot;, which means that their customer could either make or break them. So to the others, please read again the email you received before you give a bad comment on Exposed.</li>
    <li> I purchased the exposed 30 day kit several months ago after hearing about its remarkable results all over the web. As an individual with many random breakouts here and there and mild acne scarring, it seemed like, just as everyone else claims, there was no cure. Let me tell you that I was extremely surprised by the effects of these products. Just like any other products out there there is always that anxious one to two week waiting period where you just want to see the results already. I&#x27;ve used many products in my day and after using what seems like every product out there, there seemed to be no permanent solution. Exposed is no complete miracle (obviously you must watch your diet and practice good hygiene to have healthy skin)but it&#x27;s estranged approach proved effective. Exposed uses a more natural tackle unlike the other chemicals we pour on our skin. I&#x27;ve noticed that with other products I would see a quick result followed by that horrid immediate scar that doesn&#x27;t go away. A week into exposed, my skin tone evened out and reduced any inflammation and bumps. For the first time ever, I&#x27;ve actually had acne free skin with the exception of that random pimple every other week or so. With exposed, you cleanse your face and help build the foundation for healthy acne free skin. So for all you skeptics out there, exposed is definitely worth a shot.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and still dealing with hormonal acne.  I have tried many things that have worked a little.  This system has worked great and has not dried out my skin at all!  I only occasionaly have to deal with a blemish and it is gone much faster than before.</li>
    <li> Exposed acne skincare kit is a very good product on the whole the different ingredients used in each product blend together and create the perfect balancing act for your skin. First off the gentle facewash is very gentle and doesnt irritate your skin at all and then coupled with the salicylic toner and then finished off with the benzoyl peroxide day cream it creates a perfect blend to keep your skin healthy during the day make sure you use moisturiser staright after these and your skin will glow. the salicylic night cream and the exfoliating cloth are the best two products i use the clothe in the shower to scrub the facewash off and then use the cream after which is very soothing and feels great oon your skin and also works a treat. Overall i have given this 5 star because it is currently the best product available.</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed Skin Treatment for 3 years.  I have struggled with blemishes for many adult years, and tried many products from my dermatologist.  My daughter found exposed skin care online when she was having trouble with breakouts.  She had tried Proactiv but it didn&#x27;t work for her.  We continue to use Exposed daily and have not needed to try any other products since.  My younger daughter likes it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out and make her skin flaky like so many other acne products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Skin Care products for over 4 years.  As I entered my 30s, the occasional pimple became more like a frequent breakout in a concentrated area of my face.  I am African-American with fair skin, so my pimples weren&#x27;t only large, but red too.  For me,  Exposed products are soothing and do not irritate my skin (when the proper amount of product is applied). The basic kit works for me.  However, I find that I use up the Acne Treatment Serum quicker than the other products.   The moment I see or feel the formation of a pimple an extra drop of the Acne Treatment seems to prevent the pimple, or it heals fairly quickly.   Overall, I am pleased with Exposed Skin Care.  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne most of my adult life, tried everything on the market for acne control and I found that Exposed Skin Care was the only product that worked for me. I really like that Exposed uses natural ingredients unlike many other skin care products which are filled with harsh chemicals and dries out your skin, making you toxic in the process. Highly recommend it along with a clean diet.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I are now getting older but still fight the affects of sporadic outbreaks. This is the first product we have found that we both can use. We have tried proactive and others but this is by far the best and cleanest product out there. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed and you have nothing to lose they offer a 1 year money back guarantee something I have seen none of the other even dare to do. My wife and I love Exposed Acne Treatment Products we will use nothing else on our skin we will now and forever remain lifelong customers.</li>
    <li> This has been the most effective treatment by far for my adult acne. I have used similar products, but my skin is way too sensitive. Exposed did not irritate my skin at all. I originally got the full kit - I rarely use the mask, scrub, cloth, or moisturizer (although I do like it), so now I reorder the basic kit and probiotics. In the first few weeks I continued to have acne as it healed and I got a few new pimples, but they were smaller and healed faster. After about 2 months I was clear for the first time in years. If I stay on the regimen, I stay clear with maybe a stray pimple now and then. If I go off, I start to break out. I will say the cleanser is not a makeup remover so I use another gentle cleanser at night for that, but it hasn&#x27;t altered my results. My favorite products are the clear pore serum and the acne treatment serum. If you do research, the effective ingredients for acne are salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. Exposed uses these in lower but effective concentrations, plus other natural ingredients. For me, my skin feels great and looks better than ever and I&#x27;m never irritated from the products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but I have never not had a pimple on my face. I have used ProActiv before and found that all it did was dry out my skin (even with the moisturizer) and leave it red and irritated. Then, I tried the store brand AcneFree and I did not see any change in my skin with that. I have been using Exposed for exactly one month now and I have seen a noticeable change in the quality of my skin, the look of my skin and the number and severity of blemishes. It first brought out some acne that was under the skin and my face worsened a little but then that cleared and the smaller bumps Ive had under the surface forever it seems have also gone away! I love these products and would recommend them to anyone!</li>
    <li> Before I started using this product, I had mild acne, but it was something I never could get to go away. I eat healthy and get exercise on a regular basis, and I have tried just about everything to get it to clear up. Nothing has ever worked! I figured there just wasn&#x27;t anything else I could do, so I pretty much gave up. Then I ended up finding out about Exposed. I figured i&#x27;d give it a try, especially since they have an amazing refund policy. If you don&#x27;t like how the product works, they will fully refund you up until a year! I have been using Exposed for about a month now, and I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin. Nothing has ever worked, but this does! I completely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am 33  yrs  male... was struggling with acne and Sun burned  skin for long long time. Found this product while searching on Google  two years ago in 2011. After 5 months of continuous use.. got rid of all the acne and  dark spots. Personally I would recommend this product for  acne treatment... coupled with  increased water intake and  facial hygiene.</li>
    <li> Before Exposed Skin Care, I had basically tried everything there is out there for acne without success. I started seeing results within days and within a few weeks my skin was clear of acne. I love these products, I still use them, they also help with acne scars.</li>
    <li> I love exposed skin care!!  I have tried many different products over the years and have found exposed skin care to work the best.  The others were too harsh and didn&#x27;t give me the results exposed does.  I still got acne with the other products but very rarely with exposed.  I would recommend giving Exposed a try.  I feel much more confident instead of hiding my face because of acne.</li>
    <li> For the first two weeks, my acne flared up like crazy! My forehead looked like a bunch of mini volcanos. I just keep using it everyday and my face has started to look good again. This is week 5 and im not breaking out anymore and my skin is looking good.&lt;br /&gt;Im 30 years old and my skin was great until a year ago when i started working in a dirty warehouse. I stopped working there but my face had gotten pretty bad and i was waking up every morning with a new pimple somewhere. I would recommend exposed if you can stand a week or two of breaking out before it gets better, but eventually it will</li>
    <li> Best product ever !i try so many different things for my face and nothing ever work am 31yrs old and my face has never look so clear and beautiful a can walk around without make up now ,I love it !i being using it for a  whole year and I&#x27;m in love now my sister in law and her brother are hook on it .The Best !</li>
    <li> This product actually does work. I have tried numerous different brands and types of acne medication, and out of them all this one works the best. Breakouts are at an all-time low, and my face is much clearer in only 20 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The natural ingredients in the treatment lotions soothe the skin and prevent irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is the price. Compared to other products this is the most expensive I have purchased. It is worth every penny, though.</li>
    <li> I first decided to try Exposed Acne Treatment after doing a google search to find out the best rated acne treatment. Exposed was rated number 1. I have tried numerous products to clear up my adult hormonal acne and nothing was helping me. Once I started using Exposed my face cleared up in less than 2 weeks. I have to say I am greatful I found this product and I am so happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Maybe I was hoping for a quick fix and had unrealistic expectations.  This system definitely helped my acne but the moment I stopped using it (dryness in the winter) my face started breaking out again.  I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and my complexion has always been somewhat of an issue.</li>
    <li> Works great for my teenage son!!  The ease of use helps to ensure that he will actually wash his face.</li>
    <li> I was VERY skeptical before ordering this product. I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne and have never had clear skin. I tried proactive in the past, but hated the results! Now that I&#x27;m getting married I was desperate to try something that would work. I went online for recommendations and noticed this product seemed to top all the lists. I&#x27;d never heard of Exposed before so I read the reviews and ordered the basic kit to start (in case it didn&#x27;t work). Within 2 days I&#x27;d noticed the change! Within a few weeks my skin cleared up, breakouts were gone, and the texture of my skin was transformed! I no longer breakout, (which used to be a constant occurrence for me) and when I do notice a pimple, its tiny and is usually gone in a day or two. I feel so good about my skin now because it&#x27;s FINALLY the skin I was meant to have! I would recommend this to ¡EVERYONE! who deals with embarrassing acne and wants a product that doesn&#x27;t just clear your skin for a week, but keeps it clear consistently day after day...I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
    <li> (I posted this review on the other kit, thought it would be relevant here too) I&#x27;m 30, a dude, and have been fighting with my skin since i was about 14. I&#x27;ve gone through cheapo in store products (too many to name) and some of the more expensive products: Murad, clinique, etc. No matter what i always had blackheads, a few random pimples, and about 1 to 2 times a month i would get a lovely breakout. my skin wasnt THAT bad but i always always always had problems. I found Exposed by accident. I went online looking for alternative ways to get my skin to stop screwing with me and i got a link for the exposed \\&quot;lifestyle tips\\&quot; page. That led me to looking into the actual product. I skeptically pulled the trigger and got the uber kit with all the goodies. First week was not that rough, i got a few new pimples but i noticed my blackheads were getting a little smaller. Most skin care programs will warn you that it usually gets worse before it gets better. It got better. Weeks 2 and 3 showed steady improvement, few new minor pimples and my skin started looking healthier. I&#x27;m on the middle of week 4 and my skin looks better than it has in longer than i can remember. I KNOW my skin is healthier too. I used to get up early so i could give my face time to calm down before i went to work. Even washing it gently with my hands would leave it red, patchy, and swollen. Lotion was also a daily requirement. Definitely not the case now, i scrub and scrub and no irritation. I also know it&#x27;s healthier cause of the comments i get at work. People complain about the tonic. It DOES hurt at first. get over it, your skin is jacked up. I started using it once every other day there was certainly a little discomfort. Now i use it 1 to 2 times a day and there is absolutely no discomfort. Actually, all of the products in this kit have a much shorter and extreme \\&quot;getting used to\\&quot; period than other stuff i have tried. I recommend geting the kit with everything on your first buy. Some stuff works better for certain people. I live with my sister and we both use the products a little differently. Try them all and then you can re-buy the ones you really like. Lastly, i like that this program addresses scarring. I&#x27;ve definitely got a few red marks from all the years of torment and like exposed claims, the marks are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the other reviews, definitely a few fakes, it&#x27;s kind of off putting but whatever. If you leave a comment i&#x27;ll try to respond. I know how awful it is to worry about your skin all the time and if my input can help another exhausted acne victim i will be glad to give it. No skin care program works for everyone, just make sure give whatever you try a fair chance. Nothing is going to happen overnight. I strongly recommend giving Exposed a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, wash your pillow cases... a lot. people always forget to do that.for certain people.

    <li> This is good for the average person without many breakouts but otherwise it is not strong enough. It smells nice and if you get the odd breakout or your face is a bit greasy, this should work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with the Proactiv advanced formula myself. It simply comes down to the active ingredients. There is less of a % in this brand and for me it makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Alright so i was scared to get the product due to the amount of 5 star reviews, it seemed too good to be true. I was right they are all fake promoting their product. They say you will results in 10-14 days it has been 1 month!!! For people who suffer from acne there are many tricks to get rid of it. I ice my face for like an hour to get rid of my pimples and havent had any problems since. Dont buy this treatment waste of money, and if you have it try to return it but they work very hard to keep their money. It is just a big scam so i use ice for mine and it helps a ton. Look up on youtube best ways to get rid of acne, ice salt water, baking soda work. But everybody is different so find the treatment that works for you. I hope this review was helpful to people with acne and considering this product. Good luck on your quest for clear skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Exposed basic kit for the past month.  I used to have horrible acne, but Exposed helps like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Now I&#x27;m not saying my skin is totally flawless now, but I have seen a marked improvement; old scars are fading, and I get very few zits, rather than the many I used to.  The price tag seems a little high, but when I think about it, it&#x27;s about what I was spending before anyway, with much less satisfying results.  Overall, I would reccomend this to anyone.  Even if you end up not liking it, Exposed offers a 100% refund on the first kit if you return it within, get this, a YEAR.  Happy Shopping!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone suffering with acne. I suffered for years without being able to find ANYTHING to get rid of it, and finally somehow stumbled across this magical regime. It has been the only thing that has ever cleared up my terribly acne prone skin, and KEPT it clear, as well as smooth and soft! I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 and my skin has been acne ridden since I was 11 years old. As you can imagine, in the span of those 11 years I&#x27;ve tried (what felt like) every acne treatment targeted to both teens and adults. Browsing the skin care sections of convenient stores not only overwhelmed me but caused depression. At-home remedies didn&#x27;t work and neither did watching YouTube tutorials. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever find a product that worked. I had almost given up hope but I remained determined. I knew there must be a solution and I have found it. I started searching around online because nothing on the shelves would work and it seemed like every site I bumped in to would mention this product. I had never heard of it before since it&#x27;s not commercialized so I didn&#x27;t know how trustworthy it was. I have to admit, after doing my research and reading tons of positive reviews on this product I was still a little apprehensive (they ALL claim to be miracle workers, don&#x27;t they?) I searched and searched but I couldn&#x27;t find a negative review and that&#x27;s what really sealed the deal for me. I originally bought the Ultimate 9 Piece set (figured I&#x27;d try it all.) What I liked best when I received this treatment program is that it actually outlines your progress and informs you when you can expect to see results and let me tell you, they were dead on. 3 months in (it took a lot of patience) my skin looked better than it had since my pre-adolescent days. If you don&#x27;t deviate from their specific instructions and regime you&#x27;re sure to see gratifying results! My skin doesn&#x27;t break out anymore and if I do happen to have a blemish, it dries up and dissipates within a day or two. My skin feels refreshed and radiant and SMOOTH. I generally purchase the Expanded 6 Piece set with the addition of the Clarifying Mask. I swear by Exposed Skin Care, it has restored my faith in acne treatment programs. Do yourself a favor and try this product. You deserve it.</li>
    <li> let me start this out by saying that exposed is a way better product then proactive. i&#x27;ve been told by my dermatologist and other facial spas that proactive actually damages your skin while exposed is suppose to help it actually become better. I love this product and would recommend anything that they sell! Helps clear your skin up and continues to do so as long as you follow the steps. the only reason why i&#x27;m giving it four stars is because of the price. it&#x27;s a little expensive but so are all acne products. I just wish that they would lower the price!</li>
    <li> My daughters use this product daily...and have for months.  Their skin is clear and beautiful and they even managed to avoid breakouts during high intense sport seasons.</li>
    <li> I am 22 years old and never had a problem with acne until about a year ago. Since then I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING from products you can buy at Walmart to more expensive brands such as Proactive. NOTHING WORKED!! Obviously I was very frustrated so I did alot of researching online and everyone was talking about \\&quot;Exposed\\&quot; so I decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. I bought the basic kit and although it took about a month for me to see results, I did finally see them! I found that the directions the company gives you did not work for me, so I tried my own combination. I use the facial cleanser every morning and night and use the acne treatment serum as a spot treatment. Every once in a while when I feel like I need a deeper clean I use the clearing tonic as well.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS WORKED AMAZINGLY FOR MY SKIN. VERY GENTLE AND EFFECTIVE. i HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN SO I ONLY USE THE FACEWASH AT NIGHT AND IT DOES NOT DRY OUT MY SKIN.</li>
    <li> I am 35 year old guy and have been struggling with acne since my teenage years. I&#x27;ve tried various over the counter options as well as branded stuff. Although some does help with the problem, I still have odd breakouts here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Exposed by accident through browsing the web and took the plunge since the last product I&#x27;ve used (ProActiv Solution) used since my early 20s, was still not 100% reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for over a year now and it has been excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I followed the daily care guide that comes with the pack from day 1 and started to see and feel the difference after 1 month of use. It has been a tremendous revelation!</li>
    <li> works sometimes and for the money you pay i would try to find something else</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. It really truly works and is worth the money. I have very sensitive skin and have tried everything you can imagine. I also have fair skin, so my breakouts would show up even worse. I have tried all over the counter acne washes and creams, even makeup with acne fighting ingredients.- and nothing worked. I would get large hard cysts under my skin and break out for no reason. I even splurged on the Clarisonic Mia face cleaner as well. I started this a few months before my wedding and it cleared up my skin completely. Exposed skincare works wonders but you have to be patient. It takes a few months to start fully clearing your skin. My skin has never looked this good and I never have breakouts anymore. If you follow the directions and be patient you wont be disappointed. This is NOT a scam and have recommended this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> This is the best line I have tried since Pro-Activ.  Pro-Avtiv worked well for me in my mid-teens but as I have gotten older, has dried my skin out to the bone! I found that I had to buy 2 additional moisturizers with their 3 piece kit!  I have now uesd Exposed for a year and have NO complaints! The basic kit is a well balanced skin care program! When I get facials she always comments on how even my skin tone is and how clear it looks without feeling rough. Exposed worked quick for me and has continued to work well this year! YAY</li>
    <li> I have been using this system since August and am impressed with the level of clarity my skin tone has taken on.  The product does not burn and is not harsh like proactive. I have switched to exposed and have not gone back to proactive! I love the gentle yet effective face wash.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything from dermatologist visits with prescription pills and topicals, to proactiv and everything available over the counter. Exposed has worked the best for me, and I&#x27;ve been using the system around a year and a half. What I like about the acne treatment serum is that it doesn&#x27;t get dry like toothpaste on your face like most BP creams (which is unfortunate when you put it on in the morning). I&#x27;ve found spot treating with BP on top of the clear pore serum at night really helps. Definitely won&#x27;t go back to using anything else.</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old, and I have had acne for 8 years. I have tried many different products, from creams to gels to wipes, and none of them were effective. I have even gone to the doctor. Most these products are similar, mostly benezene based products that dry out the skin. But Exposed is the best product i have ever used. In fact, its the only product that has shown any significant improvement.  I have suggested ths product to all my friends who suffer from acne. The ones who have used it have shown significant improvment as well.   I would highly recommend this product to anyone with acne, and with alll levels.</li>
    <li> I used the kit for about 8 months and loved it. My skin looked great and then I decided to take a break and see how I did.   After 3 months my mild acne came back. I wanted to just order what I really thought helped the most. So I have been using the clearing tonic and the acne treatment serum along with my own whole made face wash.  Seems to be working really well.  I like the products cause they help prevent future breakouts and you can use them day or night. I have tried proactive and many other acne lines and this has been the best thus far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many acne products over the years with mixed results. I have to say that this is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. It is a bit pricey but it pays for itself when you see the results and gain that boost of confidence I&#x27;m knowing that your skin is clear.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Proactiv dried out my skin &amp; my face didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;. I used Murad for years &amp; really liked it but I was still getting periodic breakouts. Plus, I have very sensitive skin and was allergic to some of the products. I found Exposed Skin Care almost by accident, doing a random search while trying to learn if a different Murad product would be better than what I used. Tried Exposed and immediately loved it. Worked wonderfully. I have had no issues with the product and my skin looks and feels great. I highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried everything before I found exposed skin care. I have really oily skin and thought I would never find anything that would work. I finally did! When I started using this product I noticed a big difference in 2-3 weeks. I will never use anything else again. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 9 years now! I recommend this product to everyone!    Lindsey from Orlando</li>
    <li> I had a major acne problem that would not go away. My chin and forehead were completely covered in acne. Even when I was a teenager it was never this bad. I tried an array of different acne treatments, including Proactiv and other leading skin care brands. None of them worked. Finally I ordered Exposed Acne Treatment. After a couple of weeks I saw results. In fact, it worked better than the other \\&quot;popular\\&quot; brands that celebrities rave about. It requires lower maintenance and is less harsh on the skin than the other brands. I have been using it for a couple of months now and my acne is completely gone. I strongly recommend Exposed Acne Treatment. Great product!</li>
    <li> Exposed Acne Treatment is the most effective skin care product I have ever used. It is affordable and simple.  No other product has worked for me. Over-the-counter treatments were too weak and prescription kits were too strong.  Exposed Acne Treatment is strong enough to counteract acne but not strong enough to dry out your face.</li>
    <li> Exposed skin care products have been pretty good. So far my skin has cleared up and it has greatly reduced redness and swelling on my face. I had very sensitive and bad acne which has greatly improved since I began using exposed 6 months ago. I have used the expanded and basic kit so far and I realy like the natural ingredients exposed uses with the other technological products like syclicilic acid ect. Before getting exposed I tried taking antibiotics, but that just lead to intestenial issues and after I went to a Naturopathic Doctor I learned that my acne was caused from the antibiotics. After getting off them my acne got severe Exposed help to control and now my acne is almost eliminated. Although it is pretty expensive, the stuff works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Got this for my 14 year old daughter who suffered from acne.  After about 2 weeks her acne was cleared. With continued use she stays clear which has done wonders for her self esteem.</li>
    <li> Exposed is amazing!  I have sensitive skin so was a little reluctant to try this, but I started getting whiteheads and bumps on my face, so I ordered Exposed.  The whiteheads are almost gone after only three weeks and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I was a long-time user of Proactiv Solution, but when I moved overseas shipping costs went up astonomically.  I went looking for alternatives, and I found Exposed.  They ship anywhere in the world quickly and for a very reasonable cost, their customer service is five-star, and I believe their formula is gentler and more natural than anything I&#x27;ve used to date.  My skin took a couple of weeks to adjust after I switched to Exposed, but I&#x27;ve been using Exposed ever since (about a year now), and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I only have great things to say about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with active acne for 40 years, so needless to say I&#x27;ve tried everything. Nothing will ever \\&quot;cure\\&quot; my acne, but the Exposed line of products is the very best I&#x27;ve ever used. They are effective without being harsh. Other than the occasional flare up, I actually have the healthiest skin I&#x27;ve had since I was 10 years old.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a year ago or more and haven&#x27;t switched to anything else because its the best I have tried. I used the proactiv years ago and it worked for awhile and then failed. The best part about the whole system I think is the 1st step(the cleaner)it works really well. I would recommend the whole package because each component has a acne fighting duty. I think if you use just one component you will be disappointed. The only thing in the whole kit that I have probably 5 bottles of is the moisturizer, one bottle goes a long way for me...my skin is oily so I prefer not to use it a lot. Its not a miracle cure but it does help a lot.</li>
    <li> I have hyper pigmentation and suffered from cystic acne...pleas note the use of the past tense. I&#x27;ve been using exposed for 2 years and after 2 months my acne was gone and I&#x27;ve had clear skin ever since!</li>
    <li> I just love my Exposed Skin Care!  I have tried every OTC acne product and prescriptions and nothing has worked for me.  I was so frustrated one day after I found that I may be allergic to some of the ingredients in the other medicines, what am I supposed to do?  Well, I googled an acne product that all natural and for sensitive skin and Exposed popped up.  I tried it with no high expectations and I was surprised when my skin started to clear up in a couple of days.  I love the clear pore serum that you put on at night.  I can put the serum on a pimple and it&#x27;s gone in just days.  The cleaner is not over drying and neither is the toner.  None of the products are harsh and all of the products complement one another well.  All in all a great product and would recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin and acne.</li>
    <li> The most important thing to say about Exposed is that it works for me and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years. Every time I have forgotten to order more, my skin has gone right back to the painful acne that I started getting in my mid twenties. The best product I think is the toner, but I really like the face wash and the acne serum for night and day as well. I have used Proactiv with decent results but I hated the smell and felt like a teenager carrying around those recognizable bottles when I had to go somewhere. I decided to try Exposed because I saw a favorable comparison online. I chose to continue with Exposed both because I saw results and I like that they focus on more natural ingredients (and it looked and smelled better).    Recently, they started making smaller kits available so traveling with them is perfect. I keep a small set just for that and use the larger bottles for daily use.    The reason I give it a 4, rather than a 5, is over the years I&#x27;ve noticed some changes with consistency in the product, which I found a little annoying, but in all fairness, my skin never noticed the difference, so I&#x27;ve continued using it. Also, one difficult thing about the kit is that you get about 6 weeks worth of toner and cleanser and about 2-3 months worth of day and night serum, so I often order an extra bottle of toner and cleanser with the kit so that I&#x27;ll have enough to get me through (less shipping that way).</li>
    <li> this stuff actually works.  I tried a bunch in the past, but exposed is the best.  After using for about a year now I hardly ever get acne, if at all.  Great product and value!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Exposed Acne Treatment Kit for several months and I have seen great results.  My skin gets mild break outs and it is more sensitive than anything!  This has been the only treatment I can use daily that helps rid my break outs but keeps from irritating and drying my skin out like other acne products typically do.  I love how mild, yet effective it is.  It does not smell strong and it is light weight and easy to apply make up over it.  I will continue to use this product and I recommend it to anyone with mild to severe acne.</li>
    <li> When I was in my teens I never had bad acne, but when I entered my twenties I began suffering from one of the harshest and most painful forms of acne, cystic acne. This devastating form of acne would cause me to have painful, large open sores on my face that would last weeks, maybe even months. NOTHING would cover these embarrassing sores, so would go in hiding. I tried anything and everything there is on the market to cure my acne, but nothing worked.  At my wits end, I decided to try one more thing, Exposed Skincare and I&#x27;m glad I did! Since starting Exposed Skincare, about a year ago, I have been acne free!  Now, acne no longer controls me and I can live my life the way I want to!!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything, from Proactiv to Philosophy to more expensive lines like Dermologica and iS Clinical;  but I&#x27;ve never had the kind of results I&#x27;ve seen with Exposed. After trying so many products, over 20 years, with no results, I was frustrated and very skeptical about trying Exposed...Now I only wish I&#x27;d stumbled upon Exposed sooner! Not only has it cleared up my skin, (without leaving it dry and flakey), it&#x27;s also relatively inexpensive and they have fantastic customer service...After receiving a package and finding that most of the bottle of cleanser had leaked out during shipment, they quickly responded to my e-mail and sent a replacement. I&#x27;ve never had a problem that wasn&#x27;t quickly and appropriately remedied, in nearly 3 years of use and bimonthly delivery.</li>
    <li> I had been on and off oral medications for my acne over 10 years. I had tried almost every product found in the stores and online. I saw Exposed Skin Care and figured I had nothing to loose. I have been using it for over 3 years and absolutely love it! Not a day goes by that I don&#x27;t use the products. I have been acne free since I have started the products!</li>
    <li> Perfect product. excellent results.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used exposed for about a year or so and it started working in about month and continues to work well. recommend everyone try exposed even if you have severe acne.</li>
    <li> I give this 3 out of 5 because it does help treat acne to a degree but not near as much as it promised. I still have breakouts on my face more or less everyday. I use exposed twice a day exactly as directed. I have used proactive and it does a much better job.</li>
    <li> Exposed worked pretty fast and well. My biggest gripe is that their products vary in consistency. At times they&#x27;ve had chunks of their raw materials in their moisture complex or clear pore serum. And their products smell good sometimes and bad another. Seems like their quality control needs a bit of work but overall, I think their products do a decent job in clearing up my face. Best thing is it doesn&#x27;t dry it out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for about 2 months. It did work so far. It cleared out my skin though I had light acne. The perfect thing is that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out compared to the other products I have used. I am worried about the breakouts once I stopped using it. I still got plenty of amount left. I will stop using it for a while and test it out if it will break out afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for exactly one month, purchased off Amazon prime.  Call it correlation or causality, but I have had zero breakouts since using it; I&#x27;ll update the review as time goes on to find out.  I&#x27;m an adult man, with a light beard and very sensitive skin, and I have not had any of the dryness or tightness you often get from using products like this.  If you have sensitive skin, this is a very good treatment.</li>
    <li> As a woman who struggles with hormonal acne, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for acne products. After using proactive, which worked wonderfully, I decided to try Exposed so my skin wouldn&#x27;t get used to the proactive to the point where it would no longer work. What a mistake! Not only did I break out twice as much, (purging is a myth btw) over the course of a month, but exposed also dried out the little healthy skin I have. When I would apply the moisturizer, it would actually burn my skin! At first I thought that my face just needed to get used to a new product, but now, going on two months of using Exposed, I&#x27;ve decided to give away the rest of my kit to someone with hopes it may help them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin, and proactive which can be harsh, according to a lot of reviews, worked wonderfully and never once irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never write reviews, but by posting this I&#x27;m hoping to help out those who are curious about this product. In my option, it&#x27;s a whole lot of money for very little results! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had even one day of clear skin since I made the switch from proactive to Exposed, and I will be switching back ASAP!</li>
    <li> Works fabulously.  The washcloth and probiotics make a difference.  Suggestion get extra face wash as it can be used on the body too.</li>
    <li> Best skin care I have ever tried and I have tried everything!  I&#x27;m an adult with acne so its hard to find something not to harsh and this is it!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Exposed Basic Kit for my daughter who started having acne problems at the age of 15. She tried a long list of off the shelf products at the store and was getting totally frustrated with not getting any results. So after doing much research online and reading many reivews about many different products that claim to help clear up acne, we decided to give Exposed a try. We purchased the basic kit and within a month my daughters skin began to clear up and her whole outlook on skin care did a 360. She loves the product, the smell and fresh feel she has after she washes her face. When the reorder email came, I asked her if we wanted to continue and her response was an astounding YES. Give this product a try, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is definitely expensive, but works pretty well.  My daughter has been using it and it has helped.  Just remember to not skip steps or days.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 2 months but I can&#x27;t see any improvement, maybe it only for some type of skin but for me, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have always had acne prone skin, ever since I hit 12/13 years old. I have tried everything! From Clean &amp; Clear, to Neutrogena, all the way to Proactiv. None of them ever worked for me, in fact, some of them even made my skin worse! Finally I have found a product that actually works. I think it&#x27;s the natural ingredients in them, my skin is clearer than ever! This product is most definitly worth it. Don&#x27;t buy that other junk it will not work. Thank you so much Exposed!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have tried everything from a year with a dermatologist, to ProActiv (which irritates and stains!), to over the counter items like witch hazel and tea tree oil treatments.  Nothing has worked as well, or as gentle as this product has.  I have very sensitve skin, mild to moderate acne with slight rosecea and this product does not irritate. I love this product and saw results within the first week.  It does not dry my skin at all.  My only complaint is that the face wash is really runny and I feel like I waste a lot because it drips out of my hand.  The bottle on wash could be larger also.  The other product in the basic kit go a long way but the wash runs out quicker.</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old and still have acne. I tried ProActiv, but it was very drying for my skin. I switched to Exposed and have been very happy! It is not drying and has really helped clear up my adult acne.</li>
    <li> i never review a product and i buy from amazon ALL the time.i agree with the previous posts. these reviews are probably a company scam. i have been using this product for over 2 months and am very unhappy with the results. i have tried every product out there as well as a dermatologist. clenziderm for oily skin is by far the best ive tried, but they have discontinued step number 3 in that kit. my skin hasnt become worse but far from clear!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different skin products and none of them have worked as well as Exposed. Results were amazing and my skin has been this clear in a long time. I recommended this product to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> My son has used a few other brands for teenage acne, but with little success. Exposed has worked well for him. He will continue to use this. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible acne but as a teenage girl I have a spots concentrated on my forehead and sides of my face. I wanted something to make my skin flawless! Proactiv didn&#x27;t sound very reliable from all the negative reviews I saw so I researched online and decided to risk it and try exposed. My results were amazing ! My forehead is completely clear now and the only thing that bothers me is my usual one or two pimples I still have once in a while. But WOW my skin is soft and mostly acne-free now. But with the basic kit, your skin will get very dry ! Make sure to moisturize</li>
    <li> I started using this product one month ago and my skin is definitely doing much better.  I had used Retin-A for 2 years and then it just seemed to stop working so I thought I would give this a try. After 3 weeks I noticed maybe 50% improvement in my skin and now after 4 weeks maybe 60-70%. I have a lot less irritation than I did with retin-a and other benzoyl peroxide creams I have used in the past. I have mild to moderate acne and could see how this might not be strong enough for someone with moderate to severe acne. The only downfall is that this item is expensive for the amount of product you get and the toner does leak a bit.  However, I will be ordering this item again and hope that it continues to work for my skin.</li>
    <li> I got much better than before. But I was using other products at the same time. So I am not sure if it takes effect.But I do recommand it since it can control acne quite well.</li>
    <li> As a former ProActive user, I can say with confidence this is a much better product.  I am 42 years old and have struggled with Acne my entire life - not horribly, but enough in my T-Zone to be embarrassing and hurtful.  While Proactive does help keep acne at bay, as I am growing older, it was drying out my skin, which led me to look for an alternative.  After trying many professional grade products &amp; suffering with horrible breakouts, I found what I was looking for with Exposed!  My skin is dewy, &amp; fresh, &amp; best of all, ACNE FREE.  I still have scars that are healing but their MicroScrub and the dermacloth are helping reduce them daily.  I still have the occasional breakout with my hormonal cycle; however, they are SO much smaller, and shorter time frame - no painful cysts any more.  When hormones aren&#x27;t conspiring against me, my skin is so clear I can go without make up.  As a Jazzercise Instructor, this is very important to me as I teach at 6:00 am and when you are sweating alot, you don&#x27;t want cover up!  With Exposed, none is needed.  I&#x27;m modeling in a Bridal Show soon, in my office job I deal with clients all the time, and I am getting married next August - with the Exposed kit and daily use, I feel so much more confident about my face.  And if it doesn&#x27;t work for you?  You get a money back guarantee - everything to gain and nothing to lose!!!  THANK YOU Exposed for giving me my face back!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I have moderate acne. I tend to get some massive pimples once to twice a month.  This is the fifth product I&#x27;m trying out (been using Proactiv since around 2003) but none seem to work.  I&#x27;m tired of using Proactiv and really wanted to find a new acne product but looks like Exposed won&#x27;t be that product.  I am giving it one more month and see what happens. It does leave your skin nice and soft, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for breakouts.</li>
    <li> People who say they wanted this product to work obviously is not giving Exposed enough time or using it properly. With this product, remember, the less you use during your routine, the more results you will have. You know a product is worth it your money when it is top of the line and the company doesn&#x27;t even have to advertise it a thousand times a day on every channel (such as Proactive and X-Out). This is the ONLY product that my skin has not gotten used to and begun to break out again. Yeah, it took a good month before my skin was back to being clear on a regular basis, but now, 5 months later, I don&#x27;t even break out. Mind you, it isn&#x27;t just about a facial cleansing. It&#x27;s also about what you put into your body and the levels of stress you may have. If you&#x27;re someone who constantly eats out or whips up a frozen dinner because they are too lazy to take the time to home cook their meals, of course this product isn&#x27;t going to work because harsh chemicals in processed foods will always overrule natural ingredients causing you to break out and waste your money on this product. This is the BEST facial cleanser I have ever purchased and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> After trying so many different acne products, I bought this for my 15 year old daughter to try.  Initially, she didn&#x27;t like it, as her skin seemed to get worse the first week or so, but after reading all the info on this, it said that would happen.  Then after about 2 weeks, her skin started clearing up  and the redness was much less.  After about 2 months of using it, we forgot it when on vacation, and the difference in her skin coloring, tone and acne was noticeable.  Now she loves it and uses if faithfully, especially after seeing how her skin got worse when she didn&#x27;t have it on vacation to use.  I would recommend this to anyone to try.  It even got better reviews than Proactive!</li>
    <li> product is working very well</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t worked on me. I didn&#x27;t even had that much acne as I do now. in need to figure out how to claim the warranty</li>
    <li> I have literally tried everything over the counter, from clearasil, St. Ives, etc...Even some home product acne removal methods such as baking soda, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar. But nothing has come close to the results I have received from Exposed. My skin cleared up within the first two weeks and I was able to see visible results within a week. The texture of my skin just feels so smooth and exfoliated, I would definitely reccommend this product to anyone searching for the answer to clear skin!</li>
    <li> Definitely not immediate results but i do notice a reduction in breakouts. I&#x27;ve never had terrible acne. Just a pimple here and there and I have noticed a reduction. Been using the product for 3 weeks now.</li>
    <li> This is by far, the best product on the market today.  I had tried every product out there, including their competitors brand, but only received limited success.  If I were to be stranded on a desert island with only one thing, my Exposed Skincare would be coming with me.  Thank you, Exposed, for such a terrific product!</li>
    <li> We tried many over the counter and prescription products for my son&#x27;s acne. None worked as well as the Exposed Skin care acne treatment basic kit.  His skin was clear in a few weeks and continues to use the product daily with great results. We like to gentle combination of  conventional and homeopathic medicines we found in this product.This product is truly a blessing.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used many skin care products but enough to know what works and what&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those great products. Leaves the skin feeling smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Could not ask for a better treatment!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne my whole young adult life. I was on high prescription skin cream and pills for most of high school and college and dealt with peeling and red skin because of it. After altering my diet and controlling my acne for the most part, I got of the prescriptions and went &#x27;all natural&#x27;. While my skin didn&#x27;t get as bad as it had before, I still suffered with white heads and breakouts. I came across Exposed on a blog that I read and I went for it. I saw results instantly. It is absolutely an incredible product and my skin is Beautiful without the expensive prescriptions! I use the face wash and Acne serum mostly, but include the other products a few times a week. For someone who was beyond frustrated with clearing up my face, I could not give a better review for this product! Thank you to Exposed for making such a wonderful and natural skin product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit based on all of the stellar reviews and I tried it for several months, also what was recommended by previous reviewers. The product at first made me break out (which is to be expected when trying a new acne system) then cleared up pretty well (better than Proactiv). However, after my third purchase my face really broke out. Not sure if there was a change in formula? I literally have a rash of pimples that won&#x27;t heal. I won&#x27;t be buying this again, also be aware of the fine print in their refunds policy. It&#x27;s for unopened items or the first kit only. So if you try any individual items and don&#x27;t like them- you won&#x27;t be getting your money back.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for the past month. it seems to keep my acne managible with no new flare up&#x27;s. i do have to say if you really want clear skin you need to exercise, drink water, and cut salt and sugar items from your diet to see really good results. the product can only do so much with no help. ill keeping using this product till it runs out but good so far. a little iriitation for the first week but use small amount to begin with so your face gets use to it.</li>
    <li> I have used everything and nothing worked till i found this product, the smell is not to great but the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> It was alright, but just didnt&#x27; work for me, so I won&#x27;t be getting again but maybe it will work for you, never know until you try</li>
    <li> I liked the product for the simple fact it worked fast. I was able to notice a change within the first week. Just the feel of my skin started to change. Less bumps and less effort on the part of me doing the 3 easy steps. But like I said, it worked fast within the first week. I ran out of the Clearing Tonic within my first week and a half of use. I probably didn&#x27;t use it right, i&#x27;m not to sure. I just know for the passed 3 weeks i have been using peroxide for the 2nd step. I believe it can be a wonderful product if I was to continue. It just frustrated me due to the fact I wasn&#x27;t able to get the full use out of it. I would recommend it to ones who don&#x27;t have many issues with there skin, but as far as a person with a severe skin problem, i&#x27;m not sure they would be satisfied to the point where they buy a single product out of the whole system due to the fact one product seems to get used up in a way quicker time span than the other products in the system. That&#x27;s all really,other than that it was worth it for the moment. Thank you for the experience.</li>
    <li> I am 49 years old and have suffered off and on from acne for more years than I care to admit.  I have tried everything on the market, spent tons and tons of money at my dermatologist, and still, nothing worked.  About two years ago, I reached my frustration point.  I had 3 under the skin pimples that were painful to the touch.  I got online and googled, \\&quot;best adult acne treatment\\&quot; and the first thing to come up was Exposed Skin Care.  I read countless reviews and did not come across one negative.  So, I took the plunge and ordered my first skin care kit.  The transformation has been magnificent!  Not only has my acne subsided, but acne scars on the side of my face have faded as well.  As  I mentioned at the onset, I have been using this product for about a year and a half.  I have found my lifetime skincare regimen.  The secret is the all natural ingredients.  They are very gentle on your skin.  There are no harsh chemicals to cause that unflattering redness that occur with so many acne products.  If you have been suffering with skin problems, please, give Exposed Skin Care a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> hello,&lt;br /&gt;I used exposed skincare and the results were from the beggining...now I have no more skin problems but I continued to use it and I strongly recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I am a 36 year old woman. For starters I have been to a dermatolagist. The products are very drying and my skin does clear up with antibiotics but that cant be good for long term use. I have tried ProActive  for 6months(good product but over drying for my skin)   Murad for 6 months ( not as drying as ProActive but not as good of a result either:(   So i decided to try one more product...Exposed has been just right for me ! My skin feels great and my pores are even smaller. I can even go makeup free if I wish:) I have been using it for 3 months now. I still have an ocassional bump but usually hormone related. For all the grown women out there .....This is it!!!  The only con I have is that the cleanser and toner often run out before the other products in kit. So they have to be ordered between shipments.</li>
    <li> Exposed is a VERY good product. After trying so many products for my skin which did not work, I almost did not try this one too. But I&#x27;m happy I did, because ever since, I did not have to be ashamed of my skin anymore. This is the ONLY product that worked on me and I am very, very satisfied. I look forward to use this for a long time. And more than the great product, they also have great customer service and fast delivery. So what more would you ask for? :-)</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed Skin Care for about a year now, and I love it. It is the perfect amount of oil control without drying!</li>
    <li> After trying many different treatment systems including proactiv...Exposed was the only one that finally cleared my skin.  It works!  I&#x27;ve also recommended it to other friends and their teenage children and they&#x27;ve also had satisfying results without medication or a trip to the dermatologist.  I love this so much I have it shipped wherever I am even if I happen to be out of the country.  Thank you very much Exposed.</li>
    <li> I tried everything for my acne for years and years, even Proactiv. The exposed products cleared my skin in weeks without over-drying. My skin is clear and healthy and has been ever since I started using Exposed. I highly recommend this product line as a safe, cost-effective treatment for acne. The natural ingredients in the products bring out a healthy glow - try it for yourself and see!!</li>
    <li> I spent 8 weeks in Ireland, and my skin, which always has a little bit of acne, broke out like crazy the entire time!  In my hairline, behind my ears, and along my jaw and neck was a painful, red rash of thousands of whiteheads.  Around my mouth were giant, deep pimples.  I started using this system when I returned, and, now, after 8 weeks back in the States, my skin looks almost like it did when I left.  I did six, gentle chemical peels in the first 4 weeks as well, and upped the usage of the Clear Pore Serum and Acne Treatment Serum to 2x/day for the last 4 weeks:  Clear Pore Serum first, let dry, then Acne Treatment Serum.  I didn&#x27;t change my diet, which is low-sugar, low-diary anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rash and whiteheads improved immediately, and were gone in 4 weeks.  The pimples improved immediately too, and were mostly gone after 4 weeks.  One took the full 8 weeks.  I had 2 new ones crop up 3 weeks ago; one is already gone, and the other is healing.  Lots of red marks remain, but the texture of my skin is smooth.  As the Exposed products run out, I&#x27;ll go back to my over-the-counter items.  I probably have 4 weeks of product left, having ordered one Basic Kit and, for Christmas travel, one Trial Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off because it is dang expensive.</li>
    <li> I had used Proactiv in the past and this product was similar in application so it did not take long to get used to the routine. I like how the product is infused with natural substances that make the skin feel cool and not inflamed. My skin doesn&#x27;t dry out either and most of the cysts do not appear anymore. I use the clothe every now and then and see the reduction of blackheads in my pores. Overall pretty satisfied but could use more of the clearing tonic as I seem to run out of that before anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this system for maybe 3 weeks now. It has worked well for me so far, and I really do like the components of each of the steps and how the product is made in North America. My face has felt cleaner and fresher as I have been using this product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I could not give it too high of a rating because the product design could use some improvement. Included in the product box is a guide. In this guide, the company advocates the &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; approach when using the product. Cool beans, I totally agree. But the product&#x27;s bottles and tubes don&#x27;t lend themselves to this. Controlling the amount of product comes out of each container is difficult, and there isn&#x27;t much product in each container either. This product isn&#x27;t at the price where I wouldn&#x27;t care about this; I savor every drop, especially because it works! But if there isn&#x27;t much and too much comes out, then I&#x27;m not too sure if this is a good investment for me on my college student budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it does work (at least for my skin it does), but the product design (and maybe pricing?) should definitely improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Ordered this for a relative who is struggling with Acne. Inside the package the cleanser appears to have leaked out quite a bit. I&#x27;m not entirely sure how this happened, but it might have to do with the bottle design itself.</li>
    <li> Purchased this directly from Exposed. I don&#x27;t think there is a single acne solution that works for everyone, but this one worked for us after a lot of struggling to find something for our teenage son that didn&#x27;t involve taking antibiotics and killing his immune system. He had moderate-severe acne with cysts that flared right back every time antibiotics were stopped. We chose Exposed because of the extra natural ingredients that address the causes of acne, such as hormones, in addition to the tried and true acne busters. It took awhile and it did definitely get worse before it got better, but after about 5 weeks the acne is almost completely gone. He still has red marks that will fade over time but no new breakouts.  Doesn&#x27;t apply to this kit, but like another reviewer we found that he had better results without the moisturizer that comes in the expanded kit. If you are considering it I think the moisturizer would be better suited for women with adult acne.  You do have to be pretty religious about following the program so don&#x27;t spend the money if you can&#x27;t make that commitment.</li>
    <li> I purchased the basic kit because I had a breakout around my nose for several weeks and I am not one to have a lot of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research before purchasing and it seemed that the Exposed line was the most chemical-free and successful line I could find. I only purchased the basic kit not knowing how long I&#x27;d have to use it but I ended up re-purchasing full size bottles of the cleanser and astringent after the fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company&#x27;s customer service has been great and always prompt in replying to emails about product questions. Currently I only use 3 of the products to maintain my skin clarity but the area that had been broken out is clear and had been red for a while but has since cleared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still get minor white heads that I extract myself and I also still have minor blackheads but it&#x27;s pretty much normal and under control with a little extracting on my own.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products that have not worked.  I first started out using Proactive and it just burnt my face.  My skin just flaked off and was always read.  These products are not harsh on your skin.  I had terrible acne until my first year in college.  I used to go to the dermatologist and pay $200 for a prescription.  One night I got fed up and looked up acne systems and their reviews. This system was one that had the highest recommendations.  Now after only two months my skin is unbelievably clear!  It is a little pricey, but they have great offers for members.  I love how this product has changed my skin! I am a real user and reviewer of this product.  This is not a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; review.  I highly recommend this product line if you cannot find any solutions.</li>
    <li> I was a user of another over the counter product for about 7 years and switched to this after the other lost effectiveness.  I love it and it works so well.  I also feel like I am taking care of my skin rather than just treating acne.  My skin looks and feels better than it ever has.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 2004 and love it.  I had acne problems in college and tried this when it was fairly new.  I have had clear skin since.  The only drawback is that the acne treatment serum bleaches colored fabrics.  Once I found this out I started taking the serum off my hands with a white towel and the problem was solved.</li>
    <li> Honest to goodness, I really do love these products. Im half-way through my second batch and I really have seen noticeable results. My acne has never been severe, but I would call it persistent. There have always been pimples and blackheads on my face and NOTHING would get rid of them. Of course I tried proactive and over-the-counter stuff, and even got a prescription for epiduo, but exposed has been the best. I know how fake it might sound, but not only has my acne been reduced (I still get the occasional whitehead) but my skin is softer and looks more even.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m not going to say this product is for everyone. After all it is (at least for me) extremely expensive. I won&#x27;t claim that it&#x27;s a miracle product and the best acne treatment on the market. I can truthfully say, though, that it is the best product that has worked for my acne and it has noticeably improved my complexion. If you have the money (and can&#x27;t find anything cheaper that works for you) I would definitely recommend exposed.</li>
    <li> I was having serious skin breakouts post menapausal.where I have never had acne in my life and started getting huge cysts and big breakouts. I tried everything and finally a friend recommended Exposed and I can say after 1 week my skin was clear and by 2 weeks it was radiant. You have to get this product.</li>
    <li> I am a 40 yr old male and recently started up with acne issues.  I started the Exposed Skin Care treatment and it did exactly what it said it would do.  Stick with it and do not get frustrated.  You will most likely see small breakouts but within a few weeks you will start to see things clearing up.  I am on my second box and do not plan on stopping.  My wife said my skin has never looked better.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I was VERY skeptical before ordering this product. I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne and have never had clear skin. I tried proactive in the past, but hated the results, it would dry up my skin really bad. I am a dog groomer and work in a very dirty environment so when proactive didn’t work I began to search for something that would really make my face feel clean and not dry it out. I came across exposed while searching online and decided to give it a try. I have been using exposed for over a year now and I must say that it sort of, kind of, works, if you know what I mean. I can say that it really makes your skin clean, clears your pores, and makes your skin vibrant. As far as getting rid of acne, it is no miracle treatment. The truth is, you&#x27;re going to have acne whether you use this or not. If you want to buy this, buy it to improve your skin, not to cure your acne. I understand that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but if you&#x27;re searching for a new product give it a try.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for anyone who is struggling with acne or breakouts. Personally, I have been using it for little over 3 months now, and I can still feel the difference in my skin as if I have just started using it. The thing I love most about this acne kit is the free moisturizer they give every time one orders it. I am glad that I finally found a product that works long term and that I can trust. I really recommend it !!</li>
    <li> My daughter and son both are using exposed.  Their acne did look worse the first week. However, my daughter&#x27;s is now clearing up.  Her forehead breakout has been there for three years and is now completely gone. The areas on her cheeks are also clearing up.  My son started a week after her.  His skin is starting to look better, but has not yet had the results my daughter had. But again he started a week after her.  Before exposed we tried Cliinique acne wash and treatment as well as prescription treatments and nothing seem to work.  Exposed has by far had the best and quickest results.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son as he suffers from acne :(. I like Exposed for several reasons. The bottles of product as much bigger than what than I expected. The kit contains everything you need for a good skin care regimen. The directions provided are simple and easy to follow. Initially his acne became worse using the product but I expected that. I told him within a few days this would reverse itself and he would see his acne clearing up which it did. I am very happy with this product, it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am a 33 year old female and I have tried EVERYTHING to clear up my complexion.  I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, Differin gel, Acnefree products...etc etc etc!  Nothing has ever worked for me until I tried Exposed Acne Treatment Products.  My skin started clearing up right away, and after about 10 days it looked AMAZING!  What I love the most about these products is that they don&#x27;t dry your skin out like ALL of the other products do.  In fact, my skin always feels really soft and smooth.  Thank you so much for making such an amazing product, I will be a life-long customer!</li>
    <li> My face was a mess about a year and a half ago. Regardless of what product I tried, nothing would get rid of my breakouts. At 30 years old, I thought pimples were a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to find Exposed online and it had great reviews. I have been a customer ever since and my skin is so clear now. Even if I get an isolated pimple, it heals quickly. My skin feels fresh, moisturized and evenly toned. I would recommend to anyone! Oh, and make sure you follow the instructions/steps - it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> I have researched about many acne curing products and finally after looking at the reviews , i went for Exposed. I &#x27;ve used Proactive before which creates more dryness and itchy sensation. Exposed has worked good so far but the change to see the healthy skin takes more time than what is said in the website</li>
    <li> Cleared me skin up a lot. Highly recommend. Can cause some bleaching of pillow cases and towels though so beware of that.</li>
    <li> I have had reoccurring acne throughout adulthood and have tried various products, prescription and non. This system really worked for me, and I am still using the face wash and microderm wash for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;. The kit is great, but there are a few products that I liked and some I didn&#x27;t use as much so I switched from ordering the kit to ordering single products. They have good discount codes for one to multiple products so it worked out. Also, not an expensive system to begin with, considering some alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to know, this did not vanish my acne right away. But nothing has in the past. You also should take their suggestions very seriously about changing some lifestyle habits to reduce your acne. Like washing your pillowcase regularly, drinking more water, and being careful to wash soon after you work out. After a couple of months I was seeing a good difference and it has been about 5 or so and I feel like the very rare breakout happens during peak times for women, but otherwise pretty under control. And, this time they were pretty aggressive to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very satisfied and continue to use the face wash and moisturizer products.</li>
    <li> My skin isn&#x27;t super terrible, but it has always been sufficiently bad that I&#x27;ve been very self-conscious about my face. However, within three weeks of using this, my skin is great! I don&#x27;t even wear makeup most days because my skin is so clear! I&#x27;ve been using it for over two months now, and it still works great. I even miss putting it on some nights and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to be significantly affected. I do get a few pimples few and far between, but they are very small and frankly, probably only noticeable because I&#x27;m always looking for them (Perfectionist? Paranoia?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, great product!</li>
    <li> Recommendation: improve the tonic packaging. It spills easily and I lost 3/4 of the tonic in the first week just at by accidentally knocking it over on the counter, WITH the lid closed it still spills everywhere.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for about a month now after reading the rave reviews, which im quite certain are a big scamming operation. Kind of awful that this is possible, especially on amazon. Really amazon should get it together more. Anyway, i never fall for any of these miracle cures, u know- the ones that are only available off of tv or the internet and not in normal stores- for me that has just always equalled bull****.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after realizing my adult hormonal acne (im 29) is just getting worse and worse i started googling about options and came across Exposed Skin Care System. And with the money back guarantee thing decided to give it a shot. I was really hoping i would not be one of those people who&#x27;s acne would \\&quot;get a little worse\\&quot; before it got better. Thankfully, i wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is quite mild and for me does not irritate my skin at all, nor does it excessively dry it out. Which is very unexpected because i tend to have dehydrated skin. I went to a dermatologist and showed him the stuff i was using and he said it looked like good stuff- but what surprised me is that he said the percentage of active ingredients (salycic acid and benzol peroxide) was really tiny, so tiny that i would probably not notice a difference. This was actually a very comforting idea for me because i dont actually like the idea of putting really aggressive stuff on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO DOES IT WORK FOR ME? Yes, i think it does. My acne has not gotten any worse and in fact i think it has gotten a little better. What i like most about the products is that i feel like my skin is really CLEAN. And i do believe that is the first step to combatting your acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, i started taking a fermented cod liver supplement about 2 weeks ago and WOW this is really making a difference. Though i still have some pimples, my overal skin tone is amazing and really looks as if it is glowing. If anything, i strongly recommend this stuff- its absolutely revolting butit&#x27;s so damn healthy (just think, its what the sailors were taking and they could battle storms at sea) and it really does wonders for your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using the exposed skin care system because i do believe it contributes to my skin getting better, but i am not sure if i will buy a second batch once this one is finished. I think i will look into more natural products and nutrition- after witnessing the effect of this cod liver oil.</li>
    <li> Its slow working, but mostly anything worth doing is. For example weight loss, its going take time and a strict routine. When i use it properly and keep my diet in check I see beautiful skin, not just acne free, but that satin matte look and feel. Unfortunately if i miss one wash, my skin goes back to oily and littered with bumps from under the skin blackheads. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have sever acne but it is persistent and other products like Proactive or over the counter products have never worked. I&#x27;ve used the product for about three months now and have seen an improvement, but it did (like the product mentions) about a month and a half. if u expect over the night results, go to moon while your at it because that&#x27;s impossible.</li>
    <li> Before giving it a shot I went through positive and negative reviews about this product. After careful consideration I thought better to try it once. So I ordered and started applying it on my face. It dried my acne from its root and they just came out very easily without leaving any marks on my face. I really love the essence of both natural and chemical ingredients in it. I think this product is great but if the price was lower I could have been more happy and might have bought further kit for future use if the acne shows up again. Thanks...So price is definitely one concern for me...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 and have horrible, all over my face acne since I was 12. For six years, I used proactiv. While it definitely helped, my skin was never really totally &amp;quot;clear&amp;quot; and always had this horrible, bleached, greyish hue to it. When I decided to quit proactiv five months ago, my skin freaked out. It had never looked worse and there were days where I didn&#x27;t even want to leave my house because I was so embarrassed of the way my skin looked. I tried everything shy of returning to proactiv, but absolutely nothing even helped. When I found exposed, I was obviously skeptical because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews but I was so desperate for a solution that I was willing to try anything. Two months later, my skin is completely clear. Every time I look in the mirror I want to cry because I&#x27;d never thought my skin would look this good. Not only is it clear, but the old scars I had have started to fade, my pores look smaller, and the skin on my face is no longer bleached and dead-looking. I will say that in the first two weeks, my skin got much worse before it got better. I know that acne can be frustrating, and that everybody wants a miracle product that will clear their skin immediately, but you really do have to give the system time to work.</li>
    <li> I was deeply in need of this product and I am extremely grateful to the seller for having shipped the product so promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many acne products over the years and I just started Exposed upon receipt of the product. It is so gentle, yet so effective. Proactiv was not working at all on my skin. Exposed products are easy to use, smell nice and a little does go a long way. I am so glad I came across Exposed Skin Care. You are a blessing. Thank you a million times!!!! I am already seeing some improvements.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this product for a year and his acne is very much under control now!  We have been faithful purchasers.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever given on a product. I&#x27;m a male in my twenties and have tried everything. Everything from proactiv to tomatoes to antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after a week. I have been 80% acne free since that time. Sometimes 100% free. If I forgot to use a few nights in a row, there may be a small popout, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;This product works. I had very bad acne, it has left scars. This product has made my skin look very good and finally cleared out the horrible acne I have had since I was a teenager. After almost 10 years of dealing with this struggle, I am finally free.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get the product, but my husband loves the exposed products.  Unfortunately when we recieved it, there was 1 bottle missing, the amount of time it would take to send back and recieve a complete package wold have taken too long so we didnt file a claim, but the hubby was not happy...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Skin care for about 5 months and don&#x27;t plan on ever using any other acne product again.  I don&#x27;t have acne just the occasional break out but have tried almost everything for perfect looking skin and because Exposed Skin care is so gentle it is perfect for my sensitive combination skin.  When I do get the occasional break out the healing time with Exposed is unreal compared to any other product and all of the vitamins and natural  ingredients  seem to have helped with the oiliness of my complexion as well.</li>
    <li> fist, i want to clear i bought this product on ebay, not amazon, however i would like to help people out there, dont waste your itme and money buying this, did nothing for me other that irritate my skin, didnt work, my face turn red and dry in a couple of days after trying this, waste of $60, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this, i bealive the good review are fake, by the way is not espired or anyhting, suposse to help to clear my face, only cleared my pocked.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 10 weeks now and it&#x27;s just starting to show positive results. My pores were VERY clogged so I knew it was going to be a while before it was all cleared out. That means I was having breakouts all the time but slowly my face was clearing up. I have only a few rough patches now but it looks so much better. The basic kit has everything you need except lotion. This stuff will really dry you out so just make sure you put facial lotion on after it all soaks in.  Update 4/28/15 - I&#x27;m about 18 weeks in now. I still wouldn&#x27;t say my face is clear. But I regularly get told it looks &amp;#34;so much better.&amp;#34; Better is nice but clear skin is ultimately what I am hoping for. I just ordered my second kit and will continue to use it until that it gone. Then I may re-evaluate and try something new. My face isn&#x27;t dry anymore like it was so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> I never have breakouts anymore since I started using this product. I tried many and this one works like a miracle as far as I am concerned.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this for a few months and we have seen a big improvement.  We hope to see more improvement as he continues to use it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! I have been using it for a year now and it completely cleared up my face so I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> this product has a lot of fake reviews so dont be fooled, check out the people who are writing the reviews, such a shame</li>
    <li> Good product on time delivery.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 5-days and already see changes in my skins appearance. I am happy with this product so far.</li>
    <li> I got this system for my 15 year old daughter who is experiencing facial outbreaks.  When she uses it there is a huge improvement.  BUT getting a 15 year old girl to commit to a twice daily regimen is difficult.</li>
    <li> My wife has always struggle with acne and has spent horrible amounts of money to clear it.  This product has done even what acetone could no do.  Clear her skin.  She leaves the house with no make up and looks great because she feels so happy about her skin.  In my mind she never needed and make up the confidence this product has given her is enough.</li>
    <li> I have really liked this product.  It cleared up my acne although it took a little longer than the 30 days.  I have not had overdryness and it is keeping my skin clear.  I find it a little expensive but it works great for me.</li>
    <li> I think that the Exposed line of Acne products are wonderful. I struggled with acne through college and literally tried everything, including Proactive to Acne Free and even shifted to all natural products of Burt&#x27;s Bees. None of these products worked for my face, and I really felt like I would never have clear skin again. I didn&#x27;t want to get a prescription, which is what I was given through the dermatologist, which dried my skin like crazy and caused other issues, so I really wanted to find something that would work without one. I looked online and found Exposed and loved that it was a mix of natural and other ingredients. At first it didn&#x27;t work, but I kept with it and followed the directions completely, and I am so excited about my skin. It has even helped in healing some of my acne scars from before. I highly recommend this product. It has boosted my confidence in myself, and I&#x27;m really thankful for this product. I know it is a little expensive, but I think it really is worth it if you struggle with acne like I did. I&#x27;ve hardly had any zits since, and I feel great about the skin I&#x27;m in!</li>
    <li> I tried the kit for my adult acne.  It started out great.....very subtle.......not drying.  But as time went on, it wasn&#x27;t working for me any more and my skin became too dry.  I stopped using it and tried it again.  But the same thing occurred.  Now I am afraid its too late to return the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. You have to follow the directions and use it as directed. It takes a little time to see the results but you will see them. I bought this for my teen, and as long as he is using it, his face is clear.</li>
    <li> I purchased the entire kit for my grandson, upon his request. He has late teen acne, lots of hormones to blame. He has been using Exposed Skin for about 7 months. His skin is looking clearer and it has helped him control the acne issues associated with his hormones. Thank you Exposed Skin.</li>
    <li> As cliche as it may sound, I have tried many-an acne product. Most of the blemishes on my face are now scars from poking and scratching, mostly in frustration that nothing ever worked for me. However, since starting Exposed, my skin has cleared up significantly and has allowed me to use scar treatments- the acne will not interfere. It is a great product, and I love that they go deeper than just skin health: you have to eat right, drink water, exercise (but wash your face after!) and live a healthy lifestyle. It is not just about appearance; it is about health. Love this and have recommended it, and would a thousand times more.</li>
    <li> My skin felt so smooth starting the first day if use and when used two times a day, face cleared quickly! The two month supply lasts longer than anticipated. Wonderful product and way better than any other including proactive!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who has had acne for 4 years.  My son has tried Accutane (caused large swelling to lip after 5 days so stopped) minocycline (Effective but caused liver enzymes to rise after using for 2 years so stopped) and has also tried Erythromycin which while no side effects did not reduce acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son has used exposed skin care for 12 months and while it has not cured his acne, it has improved his acne and he will keep using it for the foreseeable future.  This is a good produce which is not a miracle cure but should at the very least improve acne.</li>
    <li> After learning as much as I could about acne, I found a couple products that work for my kid...this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because we haven&#x27;t used it alone, but part as an overall skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;My teen has a fair,sensitive complexion with fairly moderate acne.  For the past 2 years we tried a lot of different solutions, all topical.  Started with basic cleansers and then some drugstore zit medications. A trip to dermatologist for a low level Retinol cream.  Everything irritated the skin making it dry and red along with the blackheads/pimples.&lt;br /&gt;  I finally got myself educated thru the magic of google on what causes acne. Here&#x27;s one of the tidbits that intrigued me and my engineer husband because it made sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exposed works because it has Vit B5 in the cleanser which normalizes the skin growth cycle. Thats why people take B5 as a supplement for acne.  There are also several antioxidants, green tea,and tea tree oil , which are all great for healing and combating free radicals, etc in the product.  All good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Let&#x27;s be real, there are  people who get a few blemishes or a big whitehead once in a while and there are folks like my teen who have several pimples, redness, swelling constantly.  It started with puberty, I am not talking growth spurts, I mean full on turning into an adult NOW  with total body changes happening....which means LOTS of hormones.&lt;br /&gt;Which is why the science of the above referenced site made sense to us as a possible cause.&lt;br /&gt;There is the difference in what kind of acne one is dealing with and how each body handles the interaction of the hormones or androgens with the skin&#x27;s normal growth cycle.&lt;br /&gt;If normal washing and zit creams don&#x27;t work for you, you may have a deeper reason for acne.&lt;br /&gt;Some people have the propensity for androgens to  interfere with the normal skin cycle.&lt;br /&gt;  That creates inflammation, which creates clogged pores, which in turn creates a prime enviorment for bacteria (pimples)to grow.&lt;br /&gt;So if you can normalize the skin cycle, the inflammation goes down which in turn, keeps acne from forming.  At least that is my non-medical take from the referenced site. Google mTor and acne.  If your body reacts a certain way, there is a cause for acne, .very interesting what they are discovering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teen has this kind of hormonal acne. So I wanted to figure out how to break this cycle.  So what works for my teen is Clearzine, a B5/zinc supplement.&lt;br /&gt;Started with 6 capsules-2 caps 3 times a day for the first 2 weeks. This alone made a 75% improvement in the amount of breakouts and lack of new pimples.  After the initial 2 weeks of supplement, we then started the Exposed basic system which has made another huge difference in the complexion.  My kid is now taking 2 caps Clearzine twice a day with breakfast and dinner, taking a vit C (nutrigold amla) and green tea extract (life extension brand) (both antioxidants) in the morning,&lt;br /&gt;and doing the Exposed routine morning and night.  It has been a week of doing both and the skin keeps improving.&lt;br /&gt;The whole family will start taking a NAC supplement again too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, I hope to drop down to 2 capsules of the Clearzine daily and continue the vit C, green tea and Exposed routine.  Oh and my kid doesn&#x27;t use the Exposed moisturizer, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine, but we already use Aim2skin products and their face and neck cream has aloe/urea/antioxidants and other ingredients that has always calmed down and healed the complexion.  They have a whole line of natural skin products that we use and are awesome for fair/sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m listing everything thats working for us because I get so frustrated that people aren&#x27;t willing to talk about whats working for them and wanting money to tell you their \\&quot;remedy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of skincare, but I really like exposed. The face cleanser is mild (does not sting your skin), but is effective against acne. Overall the products do not over-dry my skin. They heal and prevent breakouts. My favorite product for spot treatment is the clear pore serum, I use it at night because it won&#x27;t bleach my pillowcases like benzoyl peroxide spot treatments.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a while ago. I followed the instructions exactly how they where stated. After months and months of no improvement I quit. My acne had went from moderate to cystic. We went to my dermatologist and took a couple tests. It turned out this product infected my skin..... Yes. Infected... Now I am on hard antibacterial and anti viral acne meditation along with Desert Essence products which work a charm. My skin is now clearing up.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with terrible acne for years, since I was around 13 up until I was 17 when I found this skincare regime. I had tried EVERYTHING, from nearly every kind of face wash from the drugstore, to Proactiv, to going to the dermatologist, and NOTHING would clear it up. And then in 2010 I discovered Exposed, it COMPLETELY cleared up my skin without even drying it out in the process. I was amazed. I have now been using it for three years, and suffer very few breakouts (mostly in which I forget to wash my face or don&#x27;t order more products in time or around that time of month) and my skin is smooth and clear. I will forever use Exposed, it has been a miracle for my skin and has boosted my self-esteem so much. Thanks Exposed!</li>
    <li> It makes me anxious and skeptical to read about acne treatments that have a high percentage of positive results, because I am optimistic that a product can help me too, and yet I have been through this rigmarole too many times. I am 25 years old, and I have struggled with my skin since I was about twelve. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, Mario Badescu, black soap, and plenty of drugstore products to treat my acne, but none of it ever made much of a difference. I started using the face wash in August 2013, which I noticed greatly decreased the number of breakouts I was having but didn&#x27;t completely take care of the problem for consistently clear skin. For my husband, however, the face wash alone does the trick (better genes, apparently). About a month later, I ordered the basic acne treatment kit from the website (it&#x27;s cheaper there) and have never been happier with the results of a product. Not only is it very mild on my sensitive skin, but it also feels healthy AND like it&#x27;s actively working. I love the washcloth, as it gently exfoliates my skin. I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how positive I feel about this product. For those of you who have a lifelong struggle with acne, there is nothing like finding a product that actually works. I&#x27;d practically pay any amount necessary to have clear skin. I am incredibly thankful that I found this. It also has top ratings for skin care, which is how I found it on Google. Please give the whole kit a chance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other popular acne treatments, but this is the only one that cleared my skin without drying it out! You only need to use a little of each product, so they really last a long time. I&#x27;m a 26 year old woman who never had pimples as a teenager. This cleared my skin in a matter of days and now I only get the occasional tiny bump. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 2 months until it ran out. I have Severe acne on my entire face, and this kit only stopped it from getting worse. My face looked the same before and after the treatment. I would personally guess it would be your best bet for small seasonal breakouts, even then it would take a while to actually help.</li>
    <li> Got this set for my teen who struggles with moderate acne, after doing quite a bit of online research on various acne systems.  Overall the products did make her skin look and feel more vibrant and healthy.  She noticed a difference in her pores within a week.  She has been using it for a couple of months faithfully as directed.  As far as the acne goes, it definitely isn&#x27;t a cure all, but I doubt any product is.  I would say it has reduced her acne, but she still has flare ups.  I had hoped it would have kept her acne more under control considering the cost and reviews I read about it.  I&#x27;m not sure I want to keep investing in an expensive product that&#x27;s not really dramatically reduced her skin issues. I might continue to buy the cleanser as that is her favorite item of the set.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with my skin for years and tried MANY other products, Proactiv included. I decided to research other skin care brands that were actually rated as &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; and found Exposed. I decided to give it a shot and right away it made a big difference. I have very sensitive skin where most anything, especially lotions, cause it to break out or become super flaky, but Exposed hasn&#x27;t done any of that. I love that they send a scrub cloth too so that you can exfoliate gently. I also love that you can alter how often you get it easily! I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This system did not work for me. I finished 30 days of use (religious use) and have not seen an improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months now and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement. I had moderate/bad acne and I would always pick at my face which left me with some scars. Although my acne isn&#x27;t 100% gone, Exposed has really improved my complexion by about 80%. I still break out every now and then but when I do I only have small pimples compared to the painful, huge ones I used to get. My face didn&#x27;t dry out too badly when I started using exposed and the dryness only lasted a few days. I would definitely say this product is worth getting and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I had acne from the age  of 12, onward into my late 30&#x27;s.  It was mild in my teens but grew increasingly worse in my twenties and thirties, not what anybody wants!  I tried many, many treatments and products including: OTC salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, birth control pills, microdermabrasion, laser therapy, AGGRESSIVE benzoyl and salicylic treatments (because I was told \\&quot;if your skin isn&#x27;t flaky, it will continue breaking out.\\&quot;)  Nothing worked.  I continued to have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; breakouts with occasional long-lasting cystic breakouts, coupled with new maturing skin problems: crows feet and dry skin.  Weird combination, because what are you supposed to use?  Estheticians recommended moisturizer, which seemed counter-intuitive, but I tried.  It helped a little bit with the over-production of oil, but not with the continual breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After yet another internet search for something to fix my problem skin, I stumbled on Exposed.  I was torn between trying Proactiv, and this, but after reading a few reviews, I tried Exposed.  I received my first basic kit, and by the time I had gone through it, my skin was clear.  And I don&#x27;t mean just clear - - my always enlarged pores had become smaller, blackheads had shrunk, and I didn&#x27;t dread getting up in the morning and seeing the beginnings of a painful month-long cystic pimple.  Admittedly, i don&#x27;t really use the cloth, because I don&#x27;t need to really scrub now.  When I do I use one of those round, scrubby cotton pads.  After four years of continued use, I still have smaller pores, only occasional and very short lasting tiny pimples, and people actually complimenting me on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are NOT harsh and painful.  They smell very light and soothing.  The facial cleanser is gentle and light; the clearing toner is non-stinging, and the acne treatment serum goes on really smoothly.  There is no residue or harsh drying.  The clear pore serum is actually as close to a \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; asI&#x27;m willing to endorse.  It really clears out pores.  Forget those yucky strips that you plaster on your nose and then remove and leave all that gummy residue.  This actually cleans and shrinks the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I guarantee these products will work for everybody?  No.  Can I guarantee they work for someone who has tried many, many things, some of which have been painful?  Yes!  Can I guarantee you won&#x27;t be disappointed?  No.  Can I guarantee it is one of the least expensive things you will try, with potentially wonderful results?  Yes!  Give it a try because you have nothing to lose but bad skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very gentle and probably you don&#x27;t need to worry about allergic reaction even though you have a very sensitive skin like me. But...it&#x27;s too gentle to really control acnes.</li>
    <li> I have tried every product under the sun for my acne. Some traditional, some non traditional. This is the first system that actually works for my skin! The adjustment time for my skin was only about a week. I switched from Proactiv to Exposed and there is a world of difference. With the former regimen, my skin was super dry and no matter what I did, my face was still broken out all the time. Now with the Exposed system, my skin is clearing up, it&#x27;s balanced and just looks and feels better. I&#x27;ve never been able to say I have clear skin. I&#x27;ve always had super oily skin, blackheads, whiteheads, and terrible deep cystic acne. This has saved me! Try it!!</li>
    <li> Literally all there is to say is it works. I dont have acne anymore. I got one minuscule pimple in the last week, gone in two days. Wish i had gotten this product quicker. Your acne may get worse when you begin to take this product, but if you just stick with it and continue the regiment, your skin will look amazing</li>
    <li> Yes many reviews in little time but it is all true. I started using the product and in about 20 days my acne has gotten better. I am going to continue using the product. The basic kit is good enough. I haven&#x27;t used the others as they are a bit more expensive but basic works! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using the treatment for a couple weeks now.  I still have new and healing acne.  My complexion looks brighter and I can see a little bit of difference; which makes me hopeful that after a month of use it might be completely or near gone.  Be careful when using the serums- just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bought the system for my 12yr old daughter.  Made her acne 5X worse!!!!  Do not believe all the 5 star Reviews.  This system  DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Found this product for my teenage daughter following years of trying other topical treatments, antibiotics, light box treatments and even roaccutane from a dermatologist. Within a month her skin was dramatically better and 5 months on it is almost perfect. This range has been fantastic for her. At first the routine may seen time consuming but it soon becomes quick and easy to use night and morning.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works for you too.</li>
    <li> This product is for my teenage daughter. She is too lazy to go through all the procedure everyday. She only used it two to three times a week. Even that, I can see the obvious result. Her face was cleared up gradually. The result encourages her to use it more frequently. Hopefully her face can be cleared up completely before she finishes the product.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!  This product really works. My 17 year old was all broken out and this regime cured her. We tried everything before finding this system and this is the only thing that worked.</li>
    <li> I am an Asian female, age 24. I wear make up everyday along with this product. I tried this product after doing a research on acne treatments, and this one seemed to have good reviews. In this review, I will write about my background regarding my acne, and product review on this product. So if you just wanna read product review, you can scroll down and skip my background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BACKGROUND: I had serious acne problem back in age 13~14ish, but that was a hormonal thing so it eventually went out. But I had acne all over my cheeks and I remember getting called as &amp;#34;pimple face&amp;#34; at a park from this boy. That was shocking, but I was indeed a pimple face..lol thank goodness it went away in my high school years, and I never had acne again until recent. I don&#x27;t know the exact reason for this, but I all of the sudden started to form acne on my forehead and also on my cheeks, around 1st semester&#x27;s final exam period in Senior year of college. Maybe stressed out? Maybe hormonal thing? I don&#x27;t know. But I was getting stressed out from this acne. I wore makeup everyday, because ai hated my skin with all the acne. But makeup wouldn&#x27;t hide it, and a lot of ppl around me asked me if I was okay (because they saw my pimples that i didn&#x27;t have before). I tried an acne treatment kit called &amp;#34;Calming Skin&amp;#34; by Atomy, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin. My acne kept on forming and forming. That&#x27;s how I came to this product. Ok now,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about a month now. I started using this at the end of May this year, when I had lots of acne marks and some serious red acne skin. Here are some good things that I feel about this product:&lt;br /&gt;- Everything spreads smoothly, so you only need a small amount to apply on your skin (unless your acne is super serious).&lt;br /&gt;- It smells &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; Unlike other products that I have used before, this product doesn&#x27;t have any unnatural scent to it, at least in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;- SinceI used little by little, I still have more than halfway left of everything.&lt;br /&gt;- Now I can go out without make up sometimes. I feel confident without it, because my skin got so much better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, HOW THIS PRODUCT WAS TO MY SKIN:&lt;br /&gt;- it still didn&#x27;t heal my acne &amp;#34;completely&amp;#34;, but I never got worse or had break outs from this.&lt;br /&gt;- I can see that some of my acne marks that I thought I would never be able to get rid of, are now smaller and fading.&lt;br /&gt;- It did not work &amp;#34;right away&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;suddenly&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;extremely,&amp;#34; though.&lt;br /&gt;- The change comes subtly to me, but I definitely see healing now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I wear make up everyday, and perhaps it would work even better if I didn&#x27;t wear make up.&lt;br /&gt;This product probably works so subtly, because it doesn&#x27;t contain strong chemicals in it, and it says that it is made from natural ingredients. But IT DOES WORK, SLOWLY. I hope my skin will get better in another month.</li>
    <li> I bought the basic, no pills.  60 day supply lasted about 40 days and I only used on my neck and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face wash active ingredient - Salicylic Acid&lt;br /&gt;  Exposed contains .5%  Clearasil Facewash contains 2% (costs $6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Pore Serum (nighttime) - Salicylic Acid 1%  basically same as face wash but in a gel and you leave on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearing Tonic (morning) - Salicylic Acid 1% same as serum except in a more liquid form and quicker drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne treatment Serum active ingredient - Benzyl Peroxide&lt;br /&gt;  Exposed contains 3.5%  Clearasil Daily  10%  ($5)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermabrasion cloth - basically just a terrycloth washcloth, nothing special&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product until it was finished, I still had breakouts and it did nothing to prevent new breakouts.  It doesn&#x27;t help with any scarring and it does not work as advertised.  The only way I can see this product being beneficial is if your skin is so sensitve you can&#x27;t use something like clearasil.  Personally, I don&#x27;t know how this is getting such good reviews and it is also one of the best rated acne treatment systems there is.  Does not give me much hope.</li>
    <li> Iv tried just about every product to keep my skin clear and acne/black head free and I came across exposed skin care about 2 years ago. I bought it thinking it would probably be like every other product but to my surprise my skin cleared up in a couple days. Exposed skin care doesn&#x27;t dry your face like most products, my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten &amp;#34;used to it&amp;#34; over time or anything. It has actually kept my skin looking beautiful for years and I will never use anything else on my face! I seriously recommend this product to everyone because it truly does keep your skin so beautiful and acne free. My face no longer breaks out when I am on my menstrual cycle, from stress, or anything it&#x27;s always clear and looks so healthy!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few days right now but so far I absolutely love this! I have acne prone skin and when I received this I was in the middle of a terrible break out (worst one I&#x27;ve had in a long time). After just a few day I can tell it is starting to clear up. They are still there but most of what is left is just the redness when&#x27;s it&#x27;s not done completely healed. I would recommend this to anyone with acne prone skin. As long as you can follow the directions, it may start clearing up within a couple days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a year ago and have had great results! My acne has cleared up dramatically not to mention the spotty redness that tends to come with it. Unlike other products I have tried, this product does not dry up my skin, which for me is very important. It is slightly on the pricy side but if you want truly clear skin and long term clear skin your going to have to pay a little more!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would be saying this but this product does work. Re-ordering my 3rd kit now. Read and follow the instructions though. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This kit is effective but it does not do exactly what it says.  It does clear up your skin a bit and the chemicals used are all natural and smell great but the cost just makes this product not worth it.  The main ingredient to tackle acne is benzoyl peroxide.  This is just a common ingredient in almost every acne kit out there.  It&#x27;s not worth playing a lot more for only a tiny bottle of the chemical.  The best place to buy benzoyl peroxide at a cheap cost and great results is [...].  I have been on the [...] stuff for about 8 months and it works wonders, just as well as Exposed but at a affordable cost.</li>
    <li> Expensive package to not include face lotion.  Didn&#x27;t seem to work with my skin, I had better luck with an over the counter product found in any drug store (the CeraVe line).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love, believe, and whole heartedly trust in this product. I have suffered from acne all of my teenage and adult life until i found the Exposed Skin Care line of products. I can see a real difference in my face and so can others in my life. I have bad skin and the acne treatment is powerful enough to clear and safe enough not to burn or irritate my skin. I swear by this product! As soon as i can follow the directions, and use 2-3 times daily, i will send in before and after pictures to prove quality and accuracy</li>
    <li> Tried many other products for my now 17 year old son with moderate to severe acne all over his face and forehead.  Some over the counter and some prescription.  Exposed has worked the best.  It took about 2 months to show major improvement, but from then on my son&#x27;s face has looked much better.  Way fewer active pimples (they are rare and isolated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am giving this a 4 star instead of 5 is because his skin still has a few deeper red spots under/on the skin.  Not pimples, but not clear skin.  He has been on exposed for about four months, so these may go away also.</li>
    <li> I have tried every acne kit and I have found Exposed Skin Care to be the best yet.  It hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up my skin, but it is much better than it has been in the past.  I also find it will dramatically reduce the size of pimples overnight.  Good product - just wish it was cheaper!</li>
    <li> I love this product but you actually have to do it every morning and every night. If I usually the products together constituently my face looks amazing!!</li>
    <li> total waste of money. See a dermatologist and get on accutane program if you have cystic acne. Also, beware, any benzol peroxide product will bleach anything you wear or touch.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 6months.  It is awesome.  At 1st I was not sure that it was working but after approximately 6 weeks I started to really notice improvements.  I normally breakout more around the time of my period but this product has kept me under control during this time.</li>
    <li> This kit is AMAZING. I have never had bad acne, just a few breakouts every once in a while, and my skin got a little worse when I stopped taking birth control. In the booklet that comes with this, it says you should start getting clear skin in 2-4 weeks, but I started noticing a difference the first time I used it. I have tried to many acne products- Murad, Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Proactiv, etc. This is the only one that worked so well that I actually noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;As for the people who haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement with this- they might have hormonal acne. That is a lot harder to get rid of than regular acne. I have a little of that on my jawline, and I&#x27;ve been taking Chasteberry Extract supplements and Evening Primrose Oil, which help a lot with that.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with the reviews that say this is a scam- it&#x27;s not! I found out about this kit on acne.org- check it out on their to see more reviews. :)</li>
    <li> this product works decently but not great. definitely better than using a grocery store product. Overall happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the product after so many positive reviews as well as after reading the ingredients. I was having severe breakouts almost every week in the same areas.  After doing some research, I came across Exposed and decided to give it a try.  I have been using the kit for almost six weeks and it works for me!!!  So far, my skin has cleared up and there has been no more breakouts.  If you follow the guidelines (as far as foods,etc to stay away from) you will see improvements.  I believe my breakouts were do to my consumption of cheese and milk on a daily basis, which is one of the items they tell you to stir clear of.  I&#x27;ve pretty much, cut cheese out, as well as milk.  I also drink a lot more water, which is also recommended.  This makes sense, because your diet has an affect on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very little of the product goes a long way, so if you&#x27;re not heavy handed this one kit should last you at least six months, if not longer.</li>
    <li> Im not one to write reviews but I needed to this time.&lt;br /&gt;I have had acne since I was a teen and im 45 now. I literally have tried everything on the market , this is the first product that I felt really really worked. I started seeing a change within a wk and I will never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know why more people dont know about it.&lt;br /&gt;Great product line just try it and be consistant and u will be pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 months now and I have gotten very good results from it. Before Exposed I had tried everything from Proactive to prescription antibiotics and creams; all of which were extremely harsh and really hurt me. I have very sensitive  and thick skin which was really damaged after using Retina for a few months. Exposed has been the only skin care product that has actually helped to heal my acne scars and give me better skin. I do still break out, but nothing is going to cure you immediately, so I&#x27;d recommend sticking to this product for at least a year to see best results. I feel so much better using natural products that are safe for me and won&#x27;t harm my skin by over drying or burning it (Proactive gave me chemical burns). I really love the Microderm scrub because it leaves my skin fresh and smooth while helping to get rid of the extra skin and acne scars. Over all a very good product if you stick with it, plus it won&#x27;t hurt sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had incredible luck with this kit.  After almost a year of trying various products, including ProActiv and Neutrogena, within a month of using Exposed SKin Care my face had cleared up and has remained clear and less oily in the 6 months I&#x27;ve been using it.  I occasionally get a large pimple now and then, but it always goes away much faster than before.  The scrub and mask also make a huge difference in my overall complexion.  The products boasts about helping reduce old scars and I have found this to be true.  Not 100% but definitely enough to notice a difference.  I&#x27;m very happy I&#x27;ve finally found something that works!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my grandson, within two weeks his acne was cleared up almost completely. He was very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different acne products and been seeing a dermatologist since I was around 15. I am now 22 and expose is the only product that gave me the best results!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Exposed skin care products for the past 6 or 7 years.  Can&#x27;t remember how long exactly :)  They really work!!  I&#x27;ve also had excellent experience with Exposed as a company.  They are great to work with.  I highly recommend Exposed skin care products to anyone who is suffering from issues with acne.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal customer for at least 2 years now and am thankful I found Exposed Skin Care. After trying Proactive for a while and not getting the results I wanted I decided to give Exposed Skin Care a try. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to work but after sticking with the directions they sent with my product and watching my sugar intake things began to change for the better. I love the box that all the kits and or individual orders come in. I keep everything in there so that every night when its time to wash my face I just bring the box into the bathroom with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect of Exposed Skin Care that I love the most is the ability to choose when you want your kits renewed. I tend to go through certain products faster than others so I don&#x27;t always need to buy a kit again. With their easy and simple ordering system I can delay my renewal kit for whenever I want. This way I can purchase one or two products, whatever I need and not have to spend my money on an entire kit. Some of the other competitors I know make you always stick to a reordering schedule and I wouldn&#x27;t stand for that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the products themselves I they feel great, especially the clarifying mask. The easy steps they suggest really do work if you stick to them and are diligent enough to stay on track. Exposed usually includes directions in every box in case you need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the customer service is excellent! As I said at the beginning I have been a customer of Exposed Skin Care for a while now and recently one of my shipments took a little longer than normal to get to me. Maybe it was the holiday season, maybe it wasn&#x27;t but I called the customer support number and the lady on the other end apologized for the delay, checked on the status for me, and gave me $25 off my next order (which basically is a free product). It was quick,easy, and painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day I would highly recommend Exposed Skin Care to anyone like myselfwho is tired of acne and just needs some help. Some of us know that we work really hard on keeping our skin looking great and healthy and nothing seems to still work. It can be frustrating, but whether its simply genetics that is the cause or something else, let Exposed Skin Care help. You&#x27;ll be glad you gave them a chance like I did!</li>
    <li> I love exposed. It works to clear skin without being to harsh. It comes with a great moisturizer and leaves your skin soft and never dry or flaky.</li>
    <li> I found myself experiencing adult acne during my early 30&#x27;s, much to my surprise and dismay.  I prefer to use products that are naturally based and avoid harsh chemicals because my skin is also very sensitive.  I had tried Neutragena Naturals and really didn&#x27;t have any significant improvements.  From there I went on to use YesTo brand products, which I do love, but only saw some minimal improvement that ended up being temporary.  Finally, after some research, I stumbled upon Exposed Skincare and I am so glad that I did.  I can honestly say that in the 4 months since I began using the system my face has never looked better.  I will still get an occasional tiny blemish, but nothing like what I was experiencing.  My T-zone is significantly less oily and the general appearance of my skin is just healthier.  The products smell great too, which is a bonus.  I highly recommend these products if you&#x27;ve tried and failed with other brands.</li>
    <li> Works very good, wish it was cheaper so I could keep buying it!</li>
    <li> This product has saved my skin. I had really bad acne in my teens till now 25. My acne was balls full of puss sorry but it&#x27;s true. All over my face no one wanted to do facials on me because they never seen a face like mines. I used murad didn&#x27;t work all the clean and clear , 3 steps systems I tired it all. I started using proactive it helped my skin a lot. Kept using it for 2 years until it stopped working plenty of times thought the two years. So I decided to search for something else. I came upon exposed tried it and since then I been hooked. Been using it for 4 years and has never stopped working I use the soap , toner , acne treatment serum and the clear pore serum and I moisturize with rose day cream light. My skin has been amazing. Exposed is very strong at getting rid of acne but at the same time keeping your skin balanced and not dry like proactive. Overall am very happy with the products best system out there for acne.</li>
    <li> worked incredibly well and help clear everything up. would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> bought this acne product starting almost 8 months for my teenage son.  He has worked amazing on clearing his skin, make his skin look so refreshed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but now that I&#x27;m in my 30s and was still struggling with breakouts, I finally decided to give this a shot. My skin is rather sensitive and never responded to any drug store skin care products.  And I got the lovely deep cystic breakouts like clockwork once a month. I started this about 2 months ago and it works like a charm!!! I was afraid that the products would be too harsh and irritate my skin, but they don&#x27;t (a little goes a long way). And I have no idea how, but I haven&#x27;t even had any of those deep cystic breakouts either--I thought those weren&#x27;t able to be controlled through topical products.  Even if my skin thinks about forming a pimple, it is barely noticeable and will be gone by the next day.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier! My skin looks so much better, I can&#x27;t begin to say how relieved I am to find something that works!!! It is expensive, but for me, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had moderate adult acne with some under the skin nodules for years now. I feel like I have tried every product (including proactiv), every home remedy, diet adjustments, etc etc etc.  This stuff works.  I&#x27;d say within 1 week of using, I was seeing results. I&#x27;ve only had maybe one or two small pimples since then.</li>
    <li> I have been using this acne treatment for 5 days now and I can already tell a difference in my skin. Since I was 14 I have always struggled with acne.. I have tried Proactive, home remedies,  even going to the dermatologist.. Now being 21 my acne proceeded to get worse after having my child and I felt like nothing would help my acne. I finally did research and found Exposed! I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the results already! I have super sensitive skin and this treatment feels really clean on my skin and doesn&#x27;t burn like all of the other products I have tried. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in the next couple of weeks! Very awesome product and I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Before starting this, my acne was never THAT bad. One or two cystic pimples on my cheeks. I used this product for about a month and a half and it gave me HORRIBLE cystic acne. I have about 10 active pimples on my right cheek that will not go away. I wish I never bought this product. I&#x27;ve recently stumbled across Acne.org&#x27;s The Regimen and it&#x27;s finally getting rid of the stubborn pimples this kit has left me with. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND checking out The Regimen because I still have yet to find a review that says it HASN&#x27;T worked for anyone. I will never ever purchase anything from Exposed Skin Care again. This is the worst product to have ever touched my face… NOT worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a great system! I did not respond well to Proactiv or OTC ointments/treatments however my hormonal acne cleared up within 1-2 weeks with Exposed Skincare. After only 1 treatment, my skin was less inflamed and pimples were smaller. I occasionally have 1 or 2 pimples pop up around my period but  this system has truly changed my life for the better. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of the salicylic acid clear pore serum but it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience for such drastic results.</li>
    <li> I suffered from terrible acne from the age of 12 to 33. I tried every over the counter product and nothing worked. In 2011, I found Exposed Acne Treatment and I have had clear skin ever since. I will occasionally have one or two blemishes but they usually go away within a few days, sometimes even overnight.  -A from VA</li>
    <li> OKAY HELLO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO SEE THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;HELLO! READ ME!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I am no Whitman with words, or Fitzgerald or Shakespeare, but if you take the time to read this, you won&#x27;t (hopefully) be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;I am taking a lot of time and thought to write it. So just read it :D&lt;br /&gt;The reason I want people to read this review is because ITS NOT A SCAM!! I was so hesitant buying this product because I know for a fact a lot of the reviews on here are a straight out scam, from people the company hired to give their product high stars. Same thing with Clearzine, which was expensive and did not work for me. THIS WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I am an 18 year old white female with semi-dry, flaky, sometimes red skin. I have been struggling with acne since sophomore year when I was about 15/16. I had clear skin before that but then BOOM! Break out city. Lets be clear.. it wasn&#x27;t just break outs. I had a face full of red irritated heaps of acne. IT WAS BAD! I once saw an esthetician  who said my face was at a level 4 out of 5 so it was about moderate/ severe but I felt like it was at the severest of severe. I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne so long and my main motivation was that I DID NOT want acne when I was going to college. It was embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really became self conscious about my horrible acne because I felt so pretty when I had smooth skin, but when I started to get acne I felt like my skin just LOST all of its beauty. It became a horrible mess that I had to paint with makeup whenever I went to school to cover up my acne, and I always washed it off right when I get home. I HATED having to wear makeup to cover it up. I love makeup but when I put it on with acne it just cooks dry around my scabs and you can see the dark spots underneath along with all the redness that comes along with acne. I felt ugly all day. I know beauty is on the inside too, but its hard to laugh and smile and be happy when you have huge acne.. thatliterally causes pain if you move your skin. I would never wear makeup at home and tried to as least as possible when I went out to stores on weekends or during break. I felt so ugly and like people were staring at my red face, but I thought my skin would clear up, or look a little better if I didn&#x27;t wear makeup for a couple days. or weeks. or months. but it never worked.&lt;br /&gt;EXPOSED SKIN CARE WORKS!! It really does. I have tried so so so so so so so many products, (mostly all over the counter because i&#x27;m too poor to go to the doctor).&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different of the following&lt;br /&gt;-medicated washes (st.ives scrubs, Neutrogena clear pore, many MANY more, but those 2 were my favs.)&lt;br /&gt;-lotions (with medication &amp; without)&lt;br /&gt;-spot treatments&lt;br /&gt;-vitamins&lt;br /&gt;-Clearzine&lt;br /&gt;-birth control (doesn&#x27;t do anything. tri-cyclen)&lt;br /&gt;-antibiotics from doctor&lt;br /&gt;-no make up&lt;br /&gt;-healthy diets&lt;br /&gt;I have never had anything for the past 4 years work like exposed skin care.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great combination of products that balance and help eachother out to get rid of acne and give you clear skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKAY down to the experience of it.----------------&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 4-5 products depending on if you get the moisturizer or not, which I highly recommend for clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first week and followed the directions every morning and night, strictly.&lt;br /&gt;The first week was horrible :( I didn&#x27;t want to leave my room because my acne broke out super bad, but it was already worse enough. The fact for my experience is that is did get worse for a week before it got better. I was so frustrated. Then after 2 weeks. BAM clear skin. Heaven. Its really working and I feel great and confident that I know its working so much. I FEEL LIKE I FOUND A CURE. I love waking up every morning seeing more and more improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Just warning you that you might want to set aside a week where you don&#x27;t plan on wearing make up and don&#x27;t see people unless you don&#x27;t mind them seeing you, because my acne got flaky and it looked a little irritated. It&#x27;s just not pretty, then week 2 starts and BAM your a total hottie.&lt;br /&gt;The wash is good, cloth I use sometimes its alright. Benzoyl Peroxide acne treatment is heaven after 2 weeks once you adjust because it can get harsh (this is the main acne product I believe). Everything is just good. lets leave it at that.</li>
    <li> Both me and my wife struggle with acne. I get good results from dermatologist stuff, but it never worked well for her (1.5 yrs on clinidimisin and adalopian). She tried this after that failed. Really seems to work well. Both were skeptical because of the we had problems with proactive. This stuff works way better than old school proactive (not sure about the new stuff). She has been on it for two bottles of each, about 2 months. I haven&#x27;t tried it because dermatologist stuff works for me.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of acne. I used this product for 3 months and my acne is clear. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 13 years old and this did not work. Worst product in my life I&#x27;ve ever used it did not work it worsened my skin. I thought it was going to work after all those good reviews but it did not it was a lie. They are fake scam people. I hate exposed acne skincare treatment it is the worst So pissed. I would rate this a point one star</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my 13 year old daughter. She has tried everything including proactive, prescription topical medication, prescription pills plus anything and everything you could buy at the drug store. It has been 4 weeks and every day is a little better than the day before. Her break outs were so bad that it looked painful. Her cheeks, chin and forehead were covered with break outs. Now she just has some scarring that will need time to heal. But she no longer wears make up because her face is clear enough to not need it.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a natural product and it&#x27;s supposed to work wonders on your skin. I found this product when I was looking for top acne products, I read the reviews and they were all amazing so I thought I&#x27;d finally found something for my severe acne, which I&#x27;ve been suffering since I was 16 I am 20 now and the acne would just not stop. I got marks because of it, and my skin was very dry since I had used many products that never worked. I spent 100&#x27;s of dollars between dermatologists, prescribed pills, prescribed topical creams, soaps, best said what didn&#x27;t I try. Well I bought the whole kit from their website for $100.00 was very exited about it, followed instructions precisely .. Changed my pillow cases and sheets every 2 days as recommended and so on... Point is it didn&#x27;t work for me :( I was very disappointed .. I just returned the product since they have a 365 days warranty and I am waiting to see how the refund process will go. Well the main point of this review is that I FOUND SOMETHING THAT HAS WORKED WONDERS ON MY SKIN, YOU SHOULD KEEP READING IF YOU WANT TO GET RID OFF ACNE WITHOUT DRYING OUT YOUR SKIN...&lt;br /&gt;Well I had heard about natural remedies such as yogurt, oatmeal, HONEY AND GROUND CINNAMON I never wanted to try these but I finally decided to try the ground cinnamon with honey and wow the results are amazing it leaves my skin moisturized and feeling clean I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now and my sking looks so clean !!! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY THIS before you keep buying chemical stuff for your face !&lt;br /&gt;I hope it helps :)</li>
    <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found that works for my sensitive acne prone skin. A little pricey, but a great line!</li>
    <li> Actually work s no gimmicks</li>
    <li> I had very severe acne when starting this product and used it for over 2 months with no improvement. I eventually had to return this product frustrated with no results after spending time and money on Exposed. I have used Proactiv and Neutrogena and I do not find them any better, but if you are going to go for non-prescription acne treatment I would still probably recommend Exposed because the customer service is much better. It has a lifetime warranty so if you do not get results you can return the product and they will reimburse your first kit which is really good. The warranty for other products like Proactiv is much worse so if choosing between the two spend a little more on Exposed but get a better return policy. Again, if you have health insurance and you acne is from moderate to severe I think you are wasting your time getting over-the-counter products.    If you have severe acne like I had, the single best thing you can do is go see a dermatologist and the sooner the better. They devote their lives to correcting skin problems such as acne and will prescribe stronger medications for severe acne patients that get the job done. I have been on prescription topical medications and in two months have experienced excellent results. With insurance I am not spending any more on my prescription medications as I did with the over-the-counter treatments and personalized doctor prescribed medications have actually worked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for several years, and every once in a while i think about trying something over the counter, and my skin always breaks out.  I&#x27;ve had chronic acne since I was a teen (i&#x27;m now in my early 30s), and this line is really the only stuff that works- and I&#x27;ve tried it all, including proactive.  it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and with consistent use, i rarely get bad breakouts any more. I mean, everyone&#x27;s skin is different- mine is a bit oily in the T-zone...a lot of my acne is concentrated on my chin, around my mouth and along my jaw line.  and i don&#x27;t use the moisturizer because it&#x27;s REALLY thick- instead i use clean &amp; clear&#x27;s acne moisturizer.   Also, I find that the products last about 4 months. to each his own, but i hope exposed never goes out of business!</li>
    <li> My son and daughter have tried many over-the-counter cleansers, none of which seemed to clear their acne. After only one weekend of using Exposed, their skin looks brighter, clearer, and much healthier. Their skin tones are much more even. I had their pediatrician check the ingredients, all of which she said were safe for them to continue using. I was going to try ProActive (a second attempt) but so very glad I discovered Exposed Skincare first. After researching Exposed Skincare reviews on many websites, I noticed a common thread was Exposed was rated number one in every case. So we tried it, and cannot believe the results! My teenagers have noticed and are so excited and encouraged at how fast their skin has cleared.</li>
    <li> Exposed skincare products are THE best treatment for acne that I have EVER found. I have suffered from acne in varying degrees since I was thirteen. I am now in my late thirties. A well-meaning doctor told me kindly as a young teenager, &#x60;Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll grow out of it.&#x27; You know what? I never did. The doctors put me on everything; every antibiotic known to man, so it seemed, was tried with varying results that never lasted long. Eventually I was put on Roaccutane - three times: and although there were improvements and the acne never came back as badly it still persisted to a lesser degree. After having put up with this skin problem for over two decades I had had enough. I knew someone; somewhere must have found something that works. I was right.     I am a hypnotherapist and so I am used to doing things that are off the beaten path. I can tell you I was immediately impressed by the Exposed skincare website; it was highly professional and very informative - its product range was totally different from anything else, using science, herbs and even utilising probiotics to help treat acne (I had discovered that the health of the human gut and acne were linked before). I soon had very high expectations of these products and they were not let down - they were surpassed.  What these products will give you is hope and confidence. Hope that you have found something that ACTUALLY works and the benefits are cumulative, so the acne gets better the more you use the products. You will have confidence that your skin can and will be clear again. My skin is so healthy now it is unbelievable, the improvements started by the next morning, within days my skin was noticeably clearer, within a week it was almost blemish free. Although now and again the odd small flare up occurs, using the products they were controlled and eliminated within days - this stuff destroys acne without harming you.     I have experienced no side effects and my skin is now after many months use incredibly healthy looking. An old friend of mine said that my complexion now &#x60;glowed&#x27;. After years of acne I never thought anyone would say that to me. One of the worst things about acne is the way it attacks your self-image and self-confidence. These products restored mine. I hope they will do the same for you. I would advise anyone to give them a go and see how they work for them. I will go so far as to say that Exposed products are a revolution in acne treatments and I know because I tried &#x60;em all! The things is don&#x27;t make Exposed your last chance make it your first choice in acne treatment. You will be amazed and so will everyone you know and those you don&#x27;t. I can honestly say that using Exposed products was one of the best decisions I ever made.</li>
    <li> Exposed is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months now and have seen a big improvement. Other products like Proactiv just don&#x27;t get the job done. The trick with Exposed is to not skip any days in the treatment regimen and not use other products with it. Once I tried using a different facial moisturizer and it seemed to do more harm than good so I stick to what is in the kits they offer. I think they are reasonably priced considering I now have clear skin. I&#x27;m not going to say it is 100% perfect at permanently preventing breakouts but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Exposed Skin has been the BEST product I have ever purchased for my daughter - and this is after years of expense on antibiotics and treatments offered by several dematologists. I was very much afraid and skeptical in the beginning and suggested to my daughter not to try it until she was home on break over Christmas holidays (4 weeks) but she chose to try it immediately - and we were just amazed that she had NO bad reaction to any of the products in the basic kit. We are so sold on it that we keep one kit in her dorm, one at home and one at her sister&#x27;s for when she visits on weekends. I can only say it has been amazing.      My daughter had more problem on the sides of her face and forehead - and it was very bad acne. She is 19 now and has had such a bad problem since she was around 13. All I would ever hear is that when she could she would have her skin peeled - as soon as she could.  She has also suffered some scarring - and we will deal with that down the road.      I honestly cannot recommend this product any more highly. She has stopped crying over her acne.....thank you!          Renee O&#x27;Kelley</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many acne products including SkinID and Proactive. This was the only kit that worked consistently. My skin is clearer than ever, and I have no complaints. This kit is my secret to clear skin.</li>
    <li> I liked the product a lot. It is somewhat expensive but it does really help overall with acne problems. I noticed I use the facial cleanser more than the rest but overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of different skin products, but this is by far the best! I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I was having horrible acne on my chin area, and getting scars from it. Seems like I tried everything under the sun. Every esthetician I saw said it was hormonalFinally I came across exposed Skin Care products, thought why not it can&#x27;t make things worse. Just a few days into it I started seeing results. I have had great results ever since. My face had cleared up, although I get an occasional pimple, it&#x27;s not the same as before....it&#x27;s sooo much better!</li>
    <li> I never had great, smooth skin and always had to wash my face constantly throughout the day which made it very dry. This product has a quick, morning/nighttime treatment that really does work. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now, and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to before.</li>
    <li> i have been using exposed for over a year now and i absolutely love it. it has made my skin clear and kept it that way. i had used proactive before and it made my skin really dry but it still worked though but after couple of months it stopped working. my acne just would not go away that&#x27;s when i started using exposed and been using it ever since and love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different things for my skin and it got to a point where I didnt know if I would ever have clear skin. I&#x27;ve had skin problems since about 14 I started to break out and once I got around 18 it got worse and worse. I used everything! I even went to the doctors and got pills but they made head hurt. (Even though they did work) Different things work for different people but it works for me.</li>
    <li> I have always had pimples, never acne, but consistently I have had a pimple or two until I began using this product.  It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it did clear it up!  I have tried a lot of other acne treatment systems and they were either too harsh or made my skin worse than ever!  I know that there are more popular systems out there, but it continues to baffle me as to why?!  Other systems may have a bigger advertising budget, but their products remain inferior!  Not only is Exposed great at clearing up breakouts, it does so without the harsh smelling chemicals that are the \\&quot;Method of Operation\\&quot; for so many other products!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on Amazons credibility as it had some good reviews. But this seems to be a total scam so many good reviews in  such a short time and only those people have reviewed this product only.      I don&#x27;t have severe acne but I do get break outs  here n there some times as exposed skin care might say this might not suit u but I don&#x27;t think that  should be the case for very  mild acne. I  am totally disgusted after 2 weeks  use and I followed instructions to  the book. I did not see any improvements infact i saw more break outs at different spots on my face.This should not be happening as this product must be taking care of my skin not messing it up.  Wish I could get my money back. I had contacted amazon web support they said they will look into this but this questions amazons  as a review based website as anyone could hire people to post good reviews and  scam other people..     After fiasco I gave proactive a try and it is controlling the acne and I see better results within 7 days. But I want to warn amazon  again about this scam of fake good reviews.. this questions  your credibility amazon and I want my answer why do all the  people with 4 or 5 star review have only 1 review only for this product?    I wish Amazon had some good mechanism to check this kind of scam.I hope this helps other Amazon customers. [[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
    <li> Had moderate adult acne, worked like a charm.  Definitely recommend it to any one that has had problem acne before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands of skin care products and this is by far the best for what it does. I really like that fact that they use more natural ingredients and they all work great!</li>
    <li> I noticed improvement immediately, and an exacerbation. I have been going 7 weeks now, and seeing a bit of improvement now. I realized that I was being too harsh on my skin and making matters worse by irritating my skin (I.e. rubbing product in hard, scrubbing with a rotating brush nightly, picking and popping like crazy, not realizing the bacteria I was spreading and adding from my nails, etc). I am also being better about changing my pillow case often, drinking lots of water, and trying to get more sleep and exercise. I love the ingredients in this. With other systems, I felt like I had to add a bunch of calming procts to combat the excess dryness the chemicals would cause. With this, it includes those aspects of skin care, using medicine and natural remedies. After trying so many different things for so many years, I finally realize there is no cure for acne, but it is a lifestyle change you have to make in addition to your routine. This system seems most healthy,and I&#x27;m going to stick with it for now, especially since they have the 1 year guarantee! That way,if it fails to work later on, like Proactiv and others did for me, I won&#x27;t feel like I completely wasted my money.</li>
    <li> The products are great, they work. BUT I did not realised, untill re-shipment actually happened, that I&#x27;ve signed up to a regular purchase and a regular charge directly from yhe credit card!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that legal? In my opinion such a regular \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; should be stated in bold red font during the order! Unfortunately, as later discovered, the terms of automatic re order were explained in gray small font on an order confirmation e-mail!</li>
    <li> I have been following the directions 100%. My face is the same as it has been since before I started this product. I had very few break outs here or there nothing big at all. My husband didn&#x27;t think I needed to spend this kind of money for the small break outs I get. Also the second week I started to get humongous large pimples under my skin and were painful. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> So far this has worked great, my only complaint is that it does dry my face a bit so you definitely need the lotion.  Also, the acne solution tub leaked on me on a trip and that was not a fun mess to clean up.</li>
    <li> Bottom line is that I&#x27;m extremely impressed! Not only with their products, but also with their prompt service. First of all, I&#x27;ve always struggled with facial acne and have tried numerous products with no luck. After coming across a review on YouTube, I decided to give it a shot because the reviews seemed overwhelmingly positive. After a few months of using their products, my family and I have all noticed the improvement while using the products. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ve still had pimples from time to time, but it&#x27;s rare now. For the few people who have negative things to say about it, I&#x27;m truly surprised because it has really helped me a lot and would recommend it to my friends and family. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase and I hope it helps a lot more people because my confidence has truly improved and I&#x27;ve been much happier.</li>
    <li> This kit is great if you have acne. I have suffered with acne for a while and this product has really helped clear my skin. I still have some scarring and some acne but it has greatly reduced.</li>
    <li> been pretty effective so far. does not dry out my skin but would definately recommend the clarify mask for over night use as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of acne treatment products out there and I would have to say that this is not the best or helpful product I have used and would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Why? - I think it&#x27;s because of the steps that it takes or it&#x27;s just not strong enough. That or my skin is not compatible with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I switched back to Pro Activ and my acne was gone in a few weeks so there&#x27;s that...</li>
    <li> I seen results within one month of starting, this is the only product I have tried and seen results (Proactiv did nothing for me).</li>
    <li> First off, all the 5 star reviews are fake. Look through them and you&#x27;ll notice that they&#x27;re all fake accounts, with just 1 review on this crap. Second, it doesn&#x27;t work for s***. It actually made my skin worse. Slowed down my skins healing time, and made it really dry.    Save yourself the time and money, by not falling for this scam. I wish someone would&#x27;ve warned me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old female.  I&#x27;ve battled several types of on-going acne-type skin problems since I was 12.  It&#x27;s been constant - everyday of my life with no breaks at all.  I even have cystic acne.  I&#x27;ve been on everything through the years including topical and oral medications and antibiotics. I went through 3 rounds of Acutane.  While the Acutane definitely helped my chest and back, it did nothing for my face.  I&#x27;ve been to the best dermatologists in the area and participated in research studies as a guinea pig.  The last doctor I saw actually said to me there was nothing else he could offer me for treatment.  We exhausted all options.&lt;br /&gt;Continuing my quest to at least keep the acne in check as much as possible, I came across an ad for Exposed somewhere on Facebook.  Why not, I figured - it would be just another $100 or so to throw at my skin like every other product.&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted to say that while the Exposed Skin system has not cleared my skin and solved my problem, it has GREATLY REDUCED my nasty breakouts and the usual stuff that appears daily!  I actually have a few days here and there where, with make-up, you can&#x27;t tell the battles I endure and my face has a somewhat clear appearance to it!  It&#x27;s mid-January 2014 and I started this system in early October of 2013.  Even though the information with the product said that my skin may get worse before it gets better, mine did not!  I was pleasantly surprised and have continued to be delighted with the Exposed products!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my 16 year old daughter because OTC acne treatments weren&#x27;t working. Her acne is clearing up, and the products are gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> seriously no words can explain. i live off this product. i really like this package because it comes with everything you need for a good price bundle. but i have to admit that the clearing tonic runs out faster than most so i usually end up ordering that separately. my acne cleared up COMPLETELY in 2 weeks. and it has continued to be clear for the past year.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months now and I feel it works really well for my skin. I&#x27;ve gone to dermatologists on and off since high school but whenever I&#x27;d get off the prescription medications my face would break out I tried so many over the counter treatments which would work for a while then stop but with this my skin has continued to get better my skin still breaks out sometimes but is a vast improvement from before. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is a little pricey in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Exposed Skin Care is a great product. It cleans my skin but doesn&#x27;t leave it dry. I seldom have breakouts anymore. I use the mask about once a week and that works great. The auto ship is convenient and comes at the right time. I have tried many acne treatments, including several prescriptions, and Exposed has made the biggest difference with my skin. I have been using it for 4 months and will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this skin care system! Totally changed my skin- I used to have problem acne but I have not had a bad breakout in months! The system may seem like a lot of steps, but once you get started, it really is simple to use! I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I personally love Exposed Acne Treatment!&lt;br /&gt;Everybody and more importantly, every face is so different from one another so I can only speak for myself! With that said I&#x27;ve tried what feels like every brand at every price and this is the only brand of acne face wash that has done my face any good!! I hope it works for you like it has me!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter. Didn&#x27;t see any changes after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> My son and daughter both use this product. Acne is hormonal of course so looking for a product that helps manage acne. Exposed works well, doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of it but I don&#x27;t think any product will when acne is caused by hormones and that is hard to manage. Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I started using this product in April of 2013. I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but mild. And I only developed it a couple of years ago. When I started using it, it really dried my skin, but then I realized what quantity suited my skin best and stuck to that. It gave awesome results and cleared my face. But now it seems that it stopped working as efficient as it used to. Maybe my skin got used to it? I use the cleanser, the tonic, the clear pore serum, the acne treatment serum, the moisturizer and the clay mask. And I change my pillow case every other day and I don;t use the same face towel more than 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;The disadvantage for these products is the fact that they bleach everything they &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve ruined almost all of the house towels by simply just using the towels after washing my face with the cleanser. I&#x27;ve even managed to bleach all of the pillow cases I ever slept on since using these products.</li>
    <li> I have mild/moderate acne. It started when I was 15 (five years ago), and developing a panic disorder did not make the situation any better. I discovered Max Clarity and it worked WONDERS for my skin! Made my skin flawless! Unfortunately they abruptly discontinued this treatment, which left me frantically searching for another worthy replacement. I came across Nanocleanse which had ingredients that team up and work well with my skin (both salicylic and benzoyl). I used it for a year and I suppose my skin became immune to it, and I started breaking out again. So I came across exposed on the internet and decided to give it a try. After the first use my skin felt soft, and my skin felt mostly clean. I continued to use it, but I noticed that I had developed a cyst on my face from this product. So after a week I decided to quit using this treatment. It&#x27;s way too expensive and you run the risk of developing cysts. And FYI: cysts scar! So if you decide to use this BE WARNED. I would not recommend this product, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I just know it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me. I&#x27;ve tried nearly everything for my acne - and I had really high hopes for this product since others said it was great. It didn&#x27;t break me out worse, but it definitely didn&#x27;t help. Try something more natural - I always resort to Alba!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say that it did anything better than Neutrogena did for me. For it price I can just use that and get the same results</li>
    <li> This was by far the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done to my face. I feel more confident about life and it&#x27;s just a lot easier to look someone in the eye. I have tried most of the things you guys have heard about and by far the best is exposed</li>
    <li> I have been using exposed skincare for almost a year and have experienced great results! The product is made of all natural ingredients, so it doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin. Id recommend it to anyone especially people with sensitive skin.[[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
    <li> After trying many other products, Exposed Acne System has worked best!  The system is easy to use and very effective.  For any of you that have seen a dermotoglist, you will notice the same products recommended by your doctor are in Exposed products.  I am so thankful I found this company and their products. You will be too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed Skin Care for about a two months and I love it. People noticed almost immediately that my skin looked \\&quot;nice.\\&quot; I have tried Proactiv, Murad, Acutane.. everything, and NOTHING has worked on my face. I really like the simplicity of the products as well as the little extras like the microderm scrub and the derma cloth that you can buy separately. I also like the mask. You get free samples of all these in your kit. The company is also wonderful and very customer friendly and helpful. Try it!</li>
    <li> I used to break out all over my forehead and once i started using exposed it got worse for the first couple of days. Then after about a two weeks my face cleared up. Since then i have been using it for two months and i get an occasional pimple. Exposed keeps my skin under control and pimple free.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my kids, ages 16 and 17 and both have had very good results.  Acne was such a problem for them and both had taked rx for their acne.  Exposed has produced better results for them than anything at the drug store and better than Pro-Active.  I have purchased about 4 kits overall and now purchase the products individually as needed.</li>
    <li> about 10 years ago (in my 20&#x27;s) I developed acne and nothing I tried was working. I started researching it on the internet and after reading reviews and searching forums for what others had tried, I decided to give Exposed Skin Care a shot. My skin started clearing immediately, and now I rarely have breakouts :) I&#x27;ve just ordered some for my teenage daughter who is starting to get acne too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and had been suffering from adult acne for a few years.  Antibiotics helped but I did not want to be on them long term.  I discovered the Exposed skin care products about a year ago and they have completely cleared up my skin.  Exposed skin care products are amazing!</li>
    <li> Exposed Skin Care is amazing! It helped clear up my skin! Although you may want to order two facial cleaners because they tend to go fast! It took me 2 weeks till I started seeing results... I have had Exposed for over 2 years now! Not to mention then honestly have amazing costumer service! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs now and my skin has never been better.  Tried everything in the past to no avail.  Started working for me immediately and I noticed a real difference in 1 week.  All the products are excellent.  I highly recommend it and will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been figting acne for years. I used to go to the dermatologist and have used various other acne treatments (including ProActive) and nothing really seemed to work. I started using the Exposed system about a year ago and I can honestly say my skin has never been so clear. This system works great and will not over dry your skin like many other products do. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to get rid of thier acne and prevent it from coming back.</li>
    <li> I have had mild acne for several years now.  I did try Proactive, but saw little results.  With Exposed, my skin is clearer and looks more healthy.  It took a few weeks to see results, but I&#x27;ve stuck with it for over a year now and love it.  With the discount coupons they give you, it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than all the over the counter cleansers I was wasting my money on.</li>
    <li> After having acne for over 30 years and being on Accutane 3 times, the Exposed Acne treatment is the only thing that has worked consistently for me for over 5 years.  I know it works because every time I forget or am unable to use it for a few days, my acne returns.  As an MD, I can get anything for acne and I choose Exposed Acne skin care!</li>
    <li> I just finished reading a couple of reviews about Exposed.  Frankly, I disagree with several of the reviews.  I have been a user of Exposed skin care for over 4 years . . . since June of 2007.  Following the Exposed treatment has truly been a blessing for me.  I have had acne and boils for much of my adult life.  So, like many individuals, I first went to a dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve used internal prescription products, such as tetracycline in addition to Retin-A of various strengths during my 20s . . . only to have my skin be horribly irritated, dry, and red.  In fact, because it itched, I think I probably made the acne worse. I&#x27;ve also done microdermabrasion and used very expensive skin care products.  I tried several drug store variety over-the-counter products. . . nothing.  I happened upon the Exposed Skin Care products while doing an online search.  So, I tried it, especially since they offered a life-time guarantee.  The instructions indicated that my skin might break out more approximately 6 weeks into the treatment, after which my skin was to show improvement. I did break out, but did I show improvement thereafter? OMG!! ABSOLUTELY!!! Amazingly WONDERFUL improvement.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I&#x27;ve tried using some other products (Murad, Dermalogica) in these past few years because I could buy them in a store.  However, each time I started using alternatives, I would break out, again. So, I&#x27;m back to using Exposed.  In terms of cost, Exposed is comparable to Murad or Dermalogica.  So, it is more expensive than drug store cleansers and acne treatments, but for me it has been well worth it!  I&#x27;m to the point where I am no longer embarrassed of my skin.  It is smooth and acne free.  Thank you, Exposed!</li>
    <li> This kit worked really well to help clear my skin. The ingredients are safe and feel good on your skin along with a good odor. I recommend this to anyone with acne problems cause it does work over time.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne all of my life. As a 40 year-old man, it is now, admittedly, not as severe as when I was younger, but none-the-less, it is still there. I get generalized pimples on my face and larger, more painful zits around my nose and on my forehead. I have tried several remedies over the years, but none have ever been totally successful. I was about to try Proactiv when I discovered the Exposed Skincare Website. I was more impressed with their range of products and holistic approach to healthy skin. I ordered the products, which arrived quickly by courier and within around a week, my spots were noticeably better. Also, my skin was in much better condition. The regimen: a face-wash, cleanser and then treatment cream is simple to follow and because the face-wash doesn&#x27;t have any peroxide in it my towels have not been bleached out! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 18 months now and my skin has remained clear (except for the occasional spot that we all get). Although the basic pack is around $50 or so, it lasts well and to be honest I used to spend more on the piecemeal approach I had before where I was always buying and trying different products. I totally recommend Exposed.</li>
    <li> I do see that there is a warning on this item. Those of us reviewing are product users, but buy the product directly from the company, not through amazon (the company did ask us to write reviews on the product). A major reason I order directly is because in their signature packet they can give you the combination of products that you want over the phone only (I can order three tonics and one face wash if I want). I believe there are five signature products. My favorite products are the skin tonic and the acne treatment. IF you use them consistantly on a nightly basis as I did (see my skin type above), you will see a major improvement. In fact, June 2009 was when I bagan to use the product when I had bad acne on my back and chest and was in a wedding that summer. I used the product for one month and it completely cleared that up. My face acne is worse, but this product continues to work well for me. I do not have oily skin, I have fairly dry skin and when I used the pro-active product it dried my skin out to extreme levels -- this product will not dry and flake your skin, so if you have extremely oily skin I would guess a stonger product would be better for you, but this product is risk free and they do refund you for anything you do not like.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid for the basic kit, it really didn&#x27;t do as well as I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> After trying another name brand acne system which literally ate the paint off the bathroom walls and bleached my towels, I am very happy with the results my son has had with Exposed.  His face is not red anymore like it was with the other product.  He does still have minor breakouts but they are few and far between.  He seems to go through the product more quickly than expected but that may be due to using too much.  Overall we are glad we switched.</li>
    <li> My son is using this kit and likes it a lot.  Very easy to use and seems to be&lt;br /&gt;working well.  Does a lot of sports and sweats a lot and therefore breaks out&lt;br /&gt;for all the headgear.  Good product for his use.</li>
    <li> As everyone knows, acne is horrendous. It&#x27;s embarrassing, and painful. I had chronic, cystic acne all along my jawline. At one point I had four huge, deep pimples on my jaw near my ear. It hurt to move my head. I was trying everything, even diluted bleach. This stuff cleared up all of my cystic acne! I still get small pimples, but none of those monsters anymore. And the small breakouts are probably from makeup and face touching, if I didn&#x27;t do that I am certain my face would be much clearer because of these products. I am extremely serious when I say give it a try! It&#x27;s a little expensive to keep up with, but oh my god it is so worth it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Acne Care for the past year and it really has improved my skin. There was a period of time (that was noted in the instructions on how to use the products) that there may be a side affect of getting more acne before it got better. It was good they noted it but it did get worse and stayed that way for over a month which got to be a bit annoying. My skin did clear up though and since then it has stayed that way. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone who has been battling acne and just can&#x27;t seem to find a product that works.</li>
    <li> Works great awesome price</li>
    <li> I have been using exposed acne treatments basic kit for a month and a week. I didn&#x27;t start she see a significant improvement until I mixed it with my Skin ID products. both alone werent given me the results I wanted but combined theyre working pretty well, problem is I can&#x27;t afford to use both. I have mild acne and break out pretty frequently so I figuered it would clear up my skin but my skin still is not clear even with the 30 day guarentee.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mild acne for a few years and had exhausted my options. Prescription face wash, topical and oral antibiotics, in addition to the run of all of the typical drug store treatments. I exercise often, eat healthy, drink lots of water,but couldn&#x27;t figure out why my skin didn&#x27;t clear up! I started researching various options and decided that the Exposed system seemed to have the best reviews, reasonable prices and a seemingly stellar product. I&#x27;ve been using the kit for about 2 months. I immediately saw change in the overall appearance of my skin. It just looked healthier :) The exposed skin care treatment has drastically decreased my breakouts, and improved the overall health, and appearance of my skin. There are a ton of factors that contribute to acne, and everyone&#x27;s skin is so different, so I know this product isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it has worked well for me! I think it&#x27;s worth giving it a try! If you&#x27;ve exhausted your options and are looking for a quality product, this one is great and the refund policy is dynamite.</li>
    <li> I have used several other products to help clear up my acne.  This is the first product that I have used that actually has given me results.  I still tend to breakout once in a while, but I put some of the acne treatments cream on it and it helps clear it up quickly.  No other product has proven to be this beneficial.  I do not even have to use very much to see results!</li>
    <li> This face wash may not take off my scars but I feel like I do not have to worry about my face at all! I was skeptical at first but my face looks great and my complexion is smooth with a little bit of makeup! It is a great product but can be a little expensive.</li>
    <li> It is the only thing that worked to clear up my daughters face.  We tried all the others and this works!</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t believe they are still selling this crap . When i bought this product few years back i had a customer service saying that 30 days or money guaranteed back . Didn&#x27;t worked for me so i called them back and they lied straight to my face saying 1 year you should try at least . Seriously my face was making worse and top of that who wants to continue using it. This product should be totally illegal. Go ahead if you want to take a chance ruining your face.</li>
    <li> Good product. Just be consistent and patient. It does work, it just takes a while.  Be prepared to buy more.</li>
    <li> This product works! ** ACNE TREATMENT SERUM WILL BLEACH FABRIC** I have tried everything from proactive to seeing a dermatologist. I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne since I was 14. I finally had clear skin when I began to visit a dermatologist, but I was sick from the pills that he prescribed and it began to become really expensive. I read about Exposed and ended up giving it a shot. It took about a month and a half for me to start seeing real results. I have been using it for about a year now, and my skin is really clear. It&#x27;s gentle, smells great, and works perfectly. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my skin. The only downside is that the acne cream will bleach your clothes. I once fell asleep without washing my face at night and it bleached my pillow case. You have to put the acne cream on after you put on your shirt, and let it dry completely before you put on your makeup. Other than that, this is the best product for clear skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Exposed Acne Treatment Basic kit in November 2013 and have been using it religiously ever since.  I am a 34 year old female and while I do not have severe acne, I do get mild acne breakouts and I always break the cardinal rule of do not pop, pick, prod, or poke, which only exacerbates the situation.  I had previously undergone a 6-month Acutane regiment in my late 20&#x27;s and was nearly pimple free for over 5 years, but after having a child, my mild acne problem has resurfaced.  I had been a Proactive customer for over 10 years as I thought it was the best alternative to seeing a dermatologist, so I had been consistently using it blindly even though the repairing treatment lotion made my non-oily skin shine like an oil slick!  I tried Clinique for a few months before going back to Proactive, as I had used Clinque in high school and college.  With Clinique I found that the general health and glow of my skin improved compared to Proactive, but the number of pimples on my cheeks multiplied exponentially, so I went back to Proactive. In November 2013, I developed quite a few nodules on my right check and jawline.  After being too embarrassed to leave my house during the Thanksgiving holiday unless completely necessary (and only then covered in a thick layer of concealer, foundation and powder) I desperately started Googling alternative solutions to Proactive, a product which had never really impressed me, but it was all I knew.  I came across Exposed Skin Care and spent the better part of a day researching the product and reading customer reviews.  Being some-what risk adverse I was hesitant to spend the money on a new mail-order product and have it fail, but the money back guarantee made me feel comfortable making the initial investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I nearly cried at the AMAZING results I saw the first few days and weeks using Exposed Skin Care.  The large pores on my nose which are a veritable field of black heads shrunk to a near invisible size.  In the initial months my mild acne all but cleared to nothing.  When I did have any small pimples that I popped or squeezed (which we all know is a huge NO-NO, but I literally cannot stop myself), redness and swelling was significantly less and healing time was shorter compared to when I would commit this sin while using Proactive and Clinique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now August 2014 and I am still having very positive results with Exposed Skin Care.  The onset of mild breakouts has started to increase in frequency in the last 2 or so months while I&#x27;ve continued to consistently use Exposed, but I suspect it may be related to a mild Iron and D3 vitamin deficiency, so I followed up with my primary care physician and per her recommendation have started a daily multi-vitamin supplement that promotes healthy skin, hair and nails.  The biggest problem with my skin is my horrible habit to pike, pop and squeeze.  On the few occasions when I am able to control myself and not pop, any breakouts clear within a few days of surfacing with the recommended use of Exposed Skin Care.  The key for me is not to make a small problem a big-scabby mess by doing all of the things we all know we aren&#x27;t supposed to do! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that I use the Cleansing Tonic faster than the rest of the products and when I do have breakouts, I tend to slather on extra of the salicylic treatment gel, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any excessive dryness or irritation.  I definitely found that following the simple directions with recommended usage product amounts yields the best results.  I always started changing my out my pillow cases every few days as recommended by Exposed.  I previously only changed my pillow cases weekly when I stripped and washed all my bedding on Sundays.  I&#x27;ve found if I get lax about changing out fresh pillow cases I do notice an increase in breakouts, so that is a tip from Exposed that I would recommend users take to heart as following the directions is important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope otherwomen have the same success I have had as clear skin is key for me to be my best, most confident self!</li>
    <li> We tried many other products for acne that didn&#x27;t work very well. Exposed Skin Care system cleared the acne better than any other product..</li>
    <li> After trying anything and everything, I stumbled upon Exposed skin care and I can honestly say I have finally found my solution.  My acne isn&#x27;t completely gone, but it is definitely under control and I don&#x27;t get huge flare ups around my period anymore.  When I do break out, Exposed helps it heal fast.  I have sensitive skin that can dry out easily, but the gentle formula keeps my skin from getting irritated.  My only complaint is that I wish I got more of the toner with my bi-monthly refills, I always go through it too fast.  Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry skin, and I recently started breaking out like crazy (stress from work). I tried this set, and my skin cleared up within 5 days. I love waking up and not needing a bunch of foundation to cover acne. I highly recommend you try this set.</li>
    <li> I have tried both ProActive and now wnated to see the different with this product. I am sure it depends on your skin. I typically have very oily skin. This product seemed to actually make it worse, my skin was incredibley oily when using. I went back to proactive within two weeks of receiving this. Did not like the results. ProActive make my skin actually feel clean and it witholds that feeling all day long until I wash again, even with makeup! This probably works for some people though so I would still recommend trying and finding whats right for you!</li>
    <li> I got the entire Exposed Skin Care line as a gift and hated it! It destroyed my skin and made my acne much worse and even more painful.  After about a month and a half, my skin felt leathery and rough to the touch.  It took several months for my skin to return to its normal state.  I know it&#x27;s not an option for most people but I got started on the pill to clear my acne not long after this experience; it cleared my acne within three weeks.  I still use the Acne Treatment Serum that I have left over though and it is the only product in the line that I still use.  It&#x27;s helpful for spot treatment so if you have that big date coming up and you want to get rid of that sprouting zit fast, this serum will do it.  I highly recommend it for that--definitely not for full blown acne!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son about a week and a half ago and I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything I&#x27;ve ever bought but this product WORKS I would highly recommend  it to anyone that has acne it really does work.</li>
    <li> I have tried several acne products with little success. From proactive to murads my face was never clear. After using this product for only a week I began to see results and now a month later I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> This is my first day using this product. So far so good. It smells nice and clean. The pore gel is kind of sticky but I bet I used too much. So a little goes a long way with these. I didn&#x27;t receive the moisturizer so I cant review it. Cleanser and toner worked great as a team if your more into the basic cleansing of the face. I will come back a review as my experience with the product gets closer to 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I have used this combo for 8 months now and it works well for me.  I have sensitive skin and the natural formula used in their products is really gentle yet effective.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Over the past few years I&#x27;ve had acne combined with very oily skin. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to combat the two and this is the only thing that has continuously worked. Its hard to pick a favorite but I really love the clear pore serum. I love the way my skin looks and feels now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Acne Treatment Serum for a few years now. Initially I started with the whole product line but can&#x27;t fathom not using the serum in my everyday regime. It&#x27;s definitely a miracle worker. I&#x27;ve also turned a good friend of mine onto to product and she repeatedly praises the product. The cost is decent for a product that will answer your prayers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for at least 10 years. I ordered this product not on amazon but on the exposed skin care website. However, I couldn&#x27;t find a place to write a review there. First it felt like I was just washing my face with the hand soap I use in my bathroom and the other products were not much better. This is overpriced and did not work for me. When I mailed it back to get my money refunded I had to pay shipping, fine, whatever. Then when they credited my account they also charged me for them shipping it to me in the first place. Annoying. If you have money to waste go ahead but I was quite displeased and really regret trying this out. My skin doesn&#x27;t look any different than when I started a month ago and I&#x27;m out about 30 bucks. Just don&#x27;t waste your time on this.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews and trying just about every product out there, I decided to go with Exposed Acne Treatment.  I have combination oily and dry skin, and as excited as I was to use this product, I still break out on a regular basis.  Definitely not buying it again.</li>
    <li> I was a little on the fence about spending $60 on an acne system. I read the reviews and they seemed like they were generated from people who were paid to write positive things about this product. I finally gave in and decided to try it because of the 30 day guarantee. After using it for 3 weeks, my skin is absolutely clear. Even with my stress levels rising from school and work my skin still stayed clear. I hardly have to put on any foundation before I leave the house..which is AMAZING. I have super sensitive skin and this stuff did not irritate my skin nor did it dry it out. The only issue I have found is that the face wash doesn&#x27;t last as long as everything else. I ran out of face wash within 3 weeks which I thought was pretty fast. All in all I would definitely recommend this product. I have literally tried everything including Proactiv and it just burnt my skin. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get my Exposed from Amazon, I order it directly from the company itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used to get cystic acne (like a huge bump, seems like every six weeks) and I&#x27;d get breakouts all the time.  I&#x27;m a 50 plus woman, and up until I started using this stuff several years ago, I experienced pimples quite a bit.  Since using this, I no longer have cystic acne or breakouts...unless I quit using this product consistently.  Twice a day - the cleanser, tonic, and acne or clearing lotion. Sometimes I use their moisturizer, but not often. I have normal - oily skin plus large pores and have had pimples since high school.  Not a lot - just one or two but they would be large and disturbing.  My daughter has different skin type and she said her skin got worse at first (which sometimes does happen while it&#x27;s clearing out impurities) and then she gave up on the product.  Another daughter uses is and has great results, like me. but this daughter has skin like mine, the daughter that gave up has delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love that this has herbs and other natural things in it.  It&#x27;s a great product and works wonderfully for me.</li>
    <li> Works well so far.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Honestly I expected more of this product. Though I know not everything works for everyone. I&#x27;ve been using it continuously for the past almost 4 weeks, the only good thing I&#x27;ve liked since the beginning is how soft my skin is after I apply the treatment &amp; creams.. But my pimples still appear, and one of the creams is to prevent as well as get rid of the acne. Another cream is to keep pores clean, I feel neither are really doing what they&#x27;re meant to.. Though I can say, they do dry up faster than they did on their own. My God it took at least a week for one painful pimple to  subside and go away. And lately it&#x27;s taken a couple of days, way better.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I am disappointed. I was optimistic about, thinking \\&quot;oh, it&#x27;ll start working next week, my pimples will stop..\\&quot; As of right now I have one, two, three.. Five pimples.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product, but I guess not for me. I recommend you try it though, it&#x27;s not a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The best stuff I have EVER tried.  Great ingredients and so much better than Proactive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the better part of a year now.  When I started it, I had mild acne on my chin and lower cheeks, which was new to me as I&#x27;d mostly had clear skin all my life.  I&#x27;ve since found out it&#x27;s due to a hormonal imbalance, but even birth control didn&#x27;t seem to help after several months, so I got this kit.  It definitely did clear up my skin.  Is it perfect?  Not really, I still get the odd zit and my skin tone is a little splotchy, but it&#x27;s definitely a big improvement, and I still use it because of that.  It definitely makes your skin FEEL softer, too.  Sometimes I run out of parts of the kit for a while, and I notice I am more prone to breakouts when that happens.  The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is the proportions of the different products are all off, so I run out of the facewash and the toner WAY sooner than I run out of the acne cream or the clear pore serum.  This makes it so I have a huge excess of those two products, because it doesn&#x27;t make sense price wise to buy the cleanser and the tonic by themselves.  I say no matter what, it&#x27;s worth a shot if you are suffering from breakouts.  It started working within the first month and I noticed even better results the second month.  But it should be noted that I also eat very healthy and do yoga on a daily basis, which could affect things as well.</li>
    <li> I tried many acne treatments, but none of them have worked as well as exposed. The basic kit is easy to use and helps to treat my acne without irritating my skin. Exposed has really cleared up my acne.</li>
    <li> Hi I am 29 years old and I have used many products with little to no success. I have even been on Roaccutane twice before and once the course was complete my acne returned.&lt;br /&gt;Theses products use ingredients that treat acne and love your skin and you will see results!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years or so.  It was the only thing that helped my acne.  Which I started to have in college.  (Probably stress induced)  I have tried proactiv and prescriptions from the dermatologist and nothing works! This prodcut definitely worked for me. I had people at work asking me what I use on my face to keep it so clear.  This product does dry skin a bit more in the winter so use a moisturizer (I like cetaphil).  However after using this system for a couple years I am noticing fine lines on my forehead and the overall texture of my skin isn&#x27;t to my liking.  I am only 26 so I am not sure if this is an age thing?  I was thinking of trying clinique acne solutions to see if this helps with the texture.  Also it is a bit too pricey for my college budget.  However...to keep acne at bay I may stick with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect. My skin looks amazing and didn&#x27;t dry to flakes like with other cleaners. This stuff is all natural and smells ok. It&#x27;s not great smelling but not foul or anything. I love this stuff honestly. Took a good ten weeks to completely clear my skin but it was worth it. My only complaint is that the day time &#x27;Acne treatment&#x27; and the night time &#x27;clear pore serum&#x27; are in these same gray/silver tube. It would make MUCH more sense to have one of them be a different color. Like the night time serum be a dark blue color or something. Other than that I have no complaints about the product. Can&#x27;t tend to be pricey but I pay it for no acne at 36 years old!!!</li>

    <li> These products aren&#x27;t \\&quot;bad\\&quot; so to speak, but they weren&#x27;t any \\&quot;better\\&quot; than what I&#x27;ve tried either.  It didn&#x27;t really make any difference on my skin.  I have moderate to light acne (I mainly breakout on my chin area) and they didn&#x27;t really clear anything up.  The Neutrogena face wash and Target acne medication gives me pretty much the same results (if not better) at less than half of the price. These products also don&#x27;t smell really nice and are very greasy to the touch.  Overall, the acne spot treatment from Proactiv was way better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My acne was very serious before, I have tried so many products included Proactiv, but there were no one worked on me. Till I used Exposed Skin Care, only one month that recover my acne! And the next two month my red spots is  starting to recover too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you also have acne problem, plz try it. If it is not work on you, you can ask the money back by the official guarantee! That&#x27;s why I would like yo try at the first time</li>
    <li> Yep, I actually forked over the big bucks to try this stuff out. What can I say, after a month, I could definitely see a marked improvement. I haven&#x27;t tried many other products before, so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to all the others out there. But this stuff cleared up my skin, made it look 10x healthier, and didn&#x27;t hardly dry it out. I love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit for my 16 year old twin girls who were looking for a product that would actually work! They wanted to buy the Pro-Active products but I wanted something more natural so we searched the internet &amp; found Exposed! After the first couple of days we noticed a difference in their skin. I would highly reccommend this product for teens experiencing breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have always suffered with Acne! I was teased in school, I took harsh medicines, still no complete results.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant about trying something new, considering everything else I had tried DIDN&#x27;T work...that includes Pro Active. I am here to tell you...EXPOSED WORKS!! I actually got a compliment on my complexion the other day...a girl I had never met came to me and told me...\\&quot;You have such pretty skin\\&quot;...I HAVE NEVER BEEN TOLD THAT BEFORE!!&lt;br /&gt;I will say this...if you have really sensitive skin, you may not be able to use the night cream...I can&#x27;t...but...doesn&#x27;t matter...Using everything else in the kit is fine...the only time my face breaks out now is if I neglect to wash my face as I am suppose to.</li>
    <li> Im not sure why everyone says this is aa awsome acne treatment. My experience was not great at all. In fact the simple and cheaper acne products work better for me then this product.  For the price i paid i would expect this product to work much better than a 6 dollar face wash acne soap. Im not impressed at all. :/ Still on the seach for something that works!</li>
    <li> i have been buying this product for the past 2 years and it has done wonders, i go from really bad break outs to clear skin as soon as i use the products. its very gentle and it never dried or made my face itch like it happened with proactive before. if you had to buy one product alone i would recommend the clear pore serum its amazing! it literally reduces those big pimples to nothing in two nights. i have recommended it to friends and they all love it. if you can just try it for yourself. the first time i tried it i was googling for best acne products and i ended up in their website and ever since it has not failed me.  the bad is that the cloth after so many uses you  have to get a new one since it absorbs a lot of impurities from your face. But a new one comes with every kit so no biggie.</li>
    <li> After seeing so many positive reviews, I decided to try exposed. I have had moderate acne for almost five years. After using it for a week, my acne worsened. I decided to stick with it. After a month, I had to stop because of how severe my acne became. This was two months ago and I still have noticeable scars from the time I used this product. I am sure it works for other people, but some may be sensitive to the benzoyl peroxide like I was. Use caution.</li>
    <li> Have used exposed skincare basic kit for about 1 1/2 years and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  It isn&#x27;t to harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product two years ago, and ive been hooked ever since! My skin started to break out badly along my jawline and t zone after coming off of birth control pills. I tried several other popular product lines and could not find one that worked for me. They were all too harsh and drying. I would end up with inflamed, peeling, painful skin.....and still had the acne! I saw tge exposed skincare line on tv and thought I would try it. I am so glad I did! The products are gebtle, calming to my akin, and they got rid of my acne! My only feedback would be to allow changes to the auto ship program kit. I don&#x27;t use tge clear pore serum very much, and I would love to be able to substitute one of the other exposed products for it.</li>
    <li> I had acne for 18 years before trying Exposed.  I literally tried everything from fasting to Proactive, and hundreds of visits to estheticians.  I discovered Exposed on a late night online plea to the Universe for help managing my acne.  I was drawn in by the natural ingredients, but also the science of proven acne fighters.  I decided once more to give a new product a try, and I have been acne free for almost 2 years!!!!  I also use the internal probiotic formula they offer in addition to this regimen.  I never thought I would be one to write one of these reviews.  I&#x27;ve read thousands.  I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to add my voice!</li>
    <li> I first purchased Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit several years ago and I have not looked back. It&#x27;s a great product that has made my face acne free. The packaging is great, the creams, cleaners, and towel all work. I recommend reading the little booklet that is given in each kit as it has several good recommendations and reminds you that the product is only as good as you treat yourself. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought the kit for my daughter and noticed a difference in her skin within the first week.  She has been using the products for about 3 months now and I can tell right away when she is slacking on using it because there is such a noticable difference in the appearance of her skin.  Unlike other acne products, this does not dry out her skin.  Her skin is clear, mosturized and she feels so much more confident in her appearance.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with these products. Not only did my children&#x27;s skin not show any improvement but it actually looked worse.  I emailed the company twice and all they said was it may help to use yet another one of their products. The first time I did order the product they recommended and showed no improvement. I even sent pictures of my son. The next time I just gave up.</li>
    <li> I used expose for a while to give it a shot...I use to use Proactiv beforehand and shied away from it to try something that possibly was less money and more effective. Exposed must of just been too gently for my type of acne because it didn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ve been though back on my proactiv and my skin is clear and acne free. Exposed though is probably great for people without acne prone skin and just probably a blemish here and there.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fourteen year old.  It reduced the redness and swelling of the acne in just a couple of days helping her feel more comfortable.  Her skin is clearer now.  She did have to reduce her use from twice per day as suggested to once per day and then every other day, because it was too drying/irritating otherwise.  Each person would have to adjust to her/his own skin&#x27;s tolerance.</li>
    <li> been using this since last week of aug..it did not work for me it worst..specially during my period like a week before all my face is full of acne and much bigger,so i decided to stop this product.:(</li>
    <li> I have been suffering with acne for many yeras, i got acne late in life i am now 40, so needless to say acne is very embarrising. I did some research and i saw how well rated this product was so i decided to give it a try. I also bought all new towels and pillow cases, one for each day. I was serious about getting rid of my acne. Within the first week i started to see a differnce. Within the first month i had 30 percent less acne, redness and so on. I am half way through my second month, 90 percent of my acne is gone. I am so happy. The packages are the best value, and whatever you choose is automaticaly sent to you on time, this is great. I bought the $100 package to start , it has everything the mask, moisturizer, even vitamins. I decided not to use the vitamins myself. I just started eating creamed spinach every day and a small piece of chicken liver. All good for skin. You can&#x27;t eat to much chicken liver because it is high in vitamin a, so be careful. I want to shout to the rooftops buy this product, it will clear your skin. Thanks for reading, and i hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> I used this for six weeks. It made my breakouts worse than ever, and now they&#x27;re in super weird places. My entire face is covered. I&#x27;ve felt like a monster for six weeks and I won&#x27;t do it anymore. Maybe if you use it for months and months it will work, but I can&#x27;t spend any more time getting worse. I followed the regimen religiously, washing the pillow cases and drinking tons of water and everything else and my face has gone so downhill it&#x27;s not even funny. I started this with a reasonably bad T zone, and now, six weeks in, I look like the before picture for one of those crazy severe acne treatment remedies. 0/10 would not recommend. Apparently it&#x27;s not for everybody.iceable Improvements. Very few new blemishes. Clearer complexion &amp; reduced redness. Skin is slightly smoother. &amp;#34; 9-11 weeks- &amp;#34;Healing continues. Prevent new breakouts. Improve complexion. Reduced redness. Smoother skin &amp; reduced pore size.&amp;#34;   TWO WEEK UPDATE  I&#x27;m getting terrible breakouts in areas I never breakout in. Mostly the far sides of my face and forehead. I have around 30 right now. I&#x27;m hating this.   I will update weekly, but unless you&#x27;re willing to cope with what I&#x27;m seeing these first two weeks, don&#x27;t bother trying.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review in my life.  Because I know how humiliating acne can be, I&#x27;ve decided to share with all of you the solution.  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on epiduo, minocyclene, exposed skin care, tazorac, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, etc... (I refused accutane).  Buy yourself a 50lb bag of Bokek dead sea salt and take 1-2 30min baths everyday (let yourself naturally dry off where the acne is).  For facial acne you&#x27;ll have to find a way to soak and let the salt dry, but for all body acne I promise this works...you will see results in 2 or 3 days.  None of this, &amp;#34;Oh it will get worse before it gets better crap...just give it 8 weeks&amp;#34;...&amp;#34;and I want to see you back in another 6 weeks to sell you on some other prescription&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and to the point. Like many of you, I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything out there to no avail (proactive included). I have normal to oily skin with lots of small pimples everywhere, which I&#x27;ve had for a decade now annoyingly. I started using Exposed about 100 days ago, which is about when some of the product started running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a URL to an actual progress photo of me: http://www.imagebam.com/image/a98435349098644&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, not super dramatic of a difference, but after 100 days, I mainly just have pigmented scars remaining which are much easier to cover with makeup! They warn you on the product that your acne may get worse at first, and boy it did for me. For the first month I developed huge, hard, disgusting zits, but with following their advice (not picking at them, changing pillow cases often, consuming less sugar, and drinking more water) as well as cleaning my makeup brushes more often and using hand sanitizer before applying makeup, they went away relatively quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now going to review each individual product in the basic kit. Not how well each works but just to describe them if you&#x27;re looking to purchase for the first time. Some of the reviewers on here kind of make me laugh when they point out which product works the best. This is an acne system, and being a biology major, I know that everything you use in/on your body affects things in complex ways. The only way you would find out which of products in this system you don&#x27;t need, is to eliminate everything but that product for a number of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;Feels light and clean, doesn&#x27;t stink or get everywhere and suds up nicely. If you get pretty oily like me by the end of the day, I recommend using a makeup remover wipe before using this product just because it doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of moisture like some cleansers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearing Tonic:&lt;br /&gt;I would like to have a conversation with whoever decided to putthis product in that bottle! This product is super thin, just like water except when it dries it leaves behind crystals. The bottle that they put it in causes it to leak out under the lid and it is too hard to control how much comes out so a lot ends up being wasted which is annoying when you&#x27;re not loaded$. I recommend transferring this into like an old contact liquid bottle or just something with a tight lid and small opening to control the flow. This is the product that ran out first for me...hmm I wonder why grrr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne Treatment Serum:&lt;br /&gt;No complaints really. I&#x27;ve tried benzoyl peroxide products before and idk if it&#x27;s because this has micronized bp that is able to penetrate better and kill acne causing bacteria but it seems to play a big role in the process, especially since they say you can use it two times a day if you like. But be fore-warned, if you use it at night, it will bleach your pillowcase. Also, I experienced no over-drying from this product but those with dry-normal skin should use a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear Pore Serum:&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this because of the licorice root, but it was bearable until it dried and then after a couple months I got used to it and it stopped bothering me. This is a relatively thin and sticky product which I wasted many a time because I wasn&#x27;t controlling my squeezing pressure well on the tube. My advice: don&#x27;t squeeze very much, just let gravity help you out, or once again, put this in a different container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this system did a relatively good job and cleared up about 75% of my acne. I think it works so well because it combines all the known ingredients that fight acne into one system (besides hormones which I don&#x27;t recommend). Next time I&#x27;ll try the expensive ultimate pack and see if I can get it closer to 100% clear. Hope this review helped some of you who were on the fence of whether to buy.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this product for over 6 months and her skin has never looked better!  The kit is the best value but there are always coupons for your next purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for about 6 months now and it is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that has actually made a significant difference in my skin. I hardly ever get breakouts anymore and it&#x27;s even helped with the scars I had from many years of horrible acne. Great stuff, I&#x27;m a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried every product out there, from proactiv to grocery store brands.  This is the only one that has worked for my son!  He has pretty sensitive skin and this helps his acne without hurting his skin.  Worth a try if you&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and nothing is working.</li>
    <li> I bought the starter kit around 6 months ago. As soon as I started using it, I noticed that a lot of the little bumps I had on my chin were starting to disappear after a week of use. Also, from the first day, I noticed that my skin was softer and cleaner. After about a month of using this product, I noticed a dramatic decrease in pimples and redness from past breakouts. I&#x27;ve continued to use this product daily, and my skin is almost crystal clear! I highly recommend this product to anyone. It does not dry out your skin or leave it oily. The ingredients are not harsh on your skin at all, and you will definitely notice an improvement within the first 2 weeks. This is money well spent, and I will continue to use this product forever! Thanks Exposed! :)</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old and still struggle with mild acne.  I have tried just about every product on the market with no success.  I can honestly tell you that this system works great for me.  I use the system twice a day as instructed and my skin has never been more under control.  Even if you do get a pimple, they are always small and go away quickly.  My skin is not over dry and I love the products. Highly recommend this skin care line.</li>
    <li> My daughters really approved it. It Works fast and harmless</li>
    <li> These products are amazing!  After suffering from cystic acne for many years and purchasing tons of over priced products that didn&#x27;t work, I tried the Exposed Acne Treatment Basic kit.  It took about 6 weeks to get the acne under control but once it was, it was gone for good.  These products have not only resolved my acne issues, my skin looks and feels so healthy.  I used to feel like I needed to wear lots of makeup to cover up scars and break outs.  Now I don&#x27;t feel like I have to put it on unless I want to because my skin looks so good.  The price is very reasonable especially for the results you receive.  I will be a life-time user of these products!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for the last three days and already my skin has calmed way down.smells of licorice. WEird at first but awesome. Way better than proactiv.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and have tried everything from Proactive to Murad and EVERYTHING in between (including ALL the over the counter products). Exposed products are the FIRST I&#x27;ve used that didnt cause a purging process, dry my skin out or cause redness/irritation. I wash my face religiously morning and night and always follow with the astringent. I&#x27;ve never had any dry patches or problems. Love everything about it. My skin looks its best..little to no breakouts and even my skin tone has improved (no splotchiness) I would give this stuff 10 stars if I could. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I started using Exposed after proactive didn&#x27;t work and dried my face out really bad. Never have that problem with Exposed and it works well. Make sure you never skip a day though, you&#x27;ll suffer for it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had moderate acne, but I have very sensitive skin which has made it tough to deal with. This product is kind of expensive (I bought off the exposed site, not on amazon), but I really do think it was worth it. About a week after using the product I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face. I couldn&#x27;t remember a time that the skin had felt so good. In all liklihood, it&#x27;s because the products I had been using previously all dried out my skin severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle cureall, but for my skin type it has been the best product I have ever used. I admit that I haven&#x27;t tried too many acne products like proactiv, but this has been suiting my needs well. Hope it can do the same for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with moderate acne since my teens. In my 20s I was on the Pill so acne was pretty manageable. After going off the Pill and then after having my baby I developed horrible cystic acne on my chin - three or four huge zits a month. I randomly came across Exposed on the Internet one night and bought it on a whim. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work but thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt. The first night I used the products, I had two large &amp;#34;underground&amp;#34; zits on my chin. I swear that within minutes of applying the acne treatment and clear pore serums I could feel the zits shrinking. I thought it was just in my head, but when I woke up the next morning, the zits were definitely smaller and within a few days had shrunk completely and never broke the surface as they would have normally done. I was amazed. I haven&#x27;t had a single cystic acne since. I&#x27;ve had a few small zits here and there, but I&#x27;ve been using the products for over three months, and the last time I ovulated (when I normally get breakouts) I didn&#x27;t get even a single, tiny zit. Finally, at 33, my skin is the clearest it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very oily, but I found the moisturizer to be too dry. I did start the products in the dead of winter, so I will try using the moisturizer when the weather starts heating up. I also don&#x27;t use the cleanser in the morning. I like washing my face in the morning with jojoba and castor oil - it makes my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t strip my skin. The Exposed cleanser is great in the evening and removes all traces of my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant to spend the money on the kit, I would definitely try the serums - I think those two products are what really made the difference on my skin. The cleanser and toner are great, but I don&#x27;t always use them daily like I do the serums and my skin still does great.&lt;br /&gt;And hardly anybody seems to mention diet and acne, but I do believe we have foods that trigger or inflame our acne. My skin was great when I was pregnant and I thought it was the change in hormones.  But I also realized that I wasn&#x27;t drinking alcohol or coffee on daily basis like I was after my baby was born. (Motherhood is hard - don&#x27;t judge!) cutting down my alcohol consumption and switching to decaf, I believe, has been a huge contribution to the appearance of my skin.  When I do have a cup of regular coffee every now and then, I will have a small break out two or three days later. Pay attention to your diet and you may discover foods that trigger your acne.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product, I noticed a change in my skin the first few days. My skin began to look alot more healthy and smoother. I love this product; it has done wonders!</li>
    <li> Hello everybody,&lt;br /&gt;This message just to tel How much I have been surprised by the results of Exposed Acne treatment. I bought it for the first time in January 2103 for my son 15 years old who had a strong acne, I didn&#x27;t want him to use the very hard medecines and Antibiotics for a long period and I found Exposed!!!! It takes 3 months and now is skin is very nice and he is so happy!!! The best product to taste and it works!</li>
    <li> I have just bought the Exposed Skincare kit. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of acne products, including Proactiv, and have researched all the ingredients that typical acne medications use. I&#x27;m not sure, but you probably should commit to this product if you do not have sensitive skin (since it is so costly). Using stronger acne medications works for you because you do not get dried out easily. Exposed is formulated more for people with adult acne, especially those with sensitive skin on top of it. It&#x27;s not the percentage of active ingredients that separates these two products. It is clinically proven that as long as there is at least 2.5% of Benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid in a product, it will provide the same effectiveness as a product that has a higher percentage of these ingredients. Both Exposed and Proactiv have these ingredients. The only difference between them is that Exposed contains more natural hydrating ingredients than Proactiv. I have learned that there is no product that covers every range of skin types, and what works for your friends, might make your skin look even worse. My skin doesn&#x27;t react well with using just the acne fighting chemicals because it dries my skin out which covers pores and traps more dirt causing breakouts. I hope I continue with these good results!</li>
    <li> Working very well. Wish I could customize order. After several months I have extra bottles of the nighttime treatment as I don&#x27;t use them as often.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon Exposed Skin Care while doing an internet search for acne products for my daughter. She suffered from acne at an early age and has tried many product and treatments including Proactiv. The Proactiv seemed to work at first, but after a while her face actually started getting worse.  We continued to use it for several months but saw no improvement.  That&#x27;s when we found Exposed Skin Care. My wife was very skeptical because we were supposedly using the best product on the market, but ultimately we decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.  We saw a significant improvement after probably one week!  And her face has consistently improved over time.  I won&#x27;t lie and say that she doesn&#x27;t have any blemishes at all but her skin looks better than it ever has! I encourage you to give Exposed Skin care a try!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. It did not minimize my acne. It only made me break out more. I understand that not all products work for everyone the same. This there any way I can get my money back?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and tried MANY medications to get rid of my acne, with no luck until I tried the exposed treatment. I now have clear skin, which I didn&#x27;t think possible. It&#x27;s cool because you don&#x27;t have to get the whole kit, you can choose individual products. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this for a few months.  We have seen some progress, but hope to see more as he continues to use it.</li>
    <li> This is the 4th time I bought it, my skin is very clear since I use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne ever since i was 12 and I&#x27;m 21 now. I&#x27;ve used products like neutrogena, clinique, clear.now, and they&#x27;ve helped but none of them have cleared my acne. For a few days It&#x27;d seem to be getting clearer than I&#x27;d start breaking out again. There&#x27;s a lot of products that claim to clear your acne and they would start but would never completely clear it. Exposed really really works! I spent 3 hours researching about it and was convinced enough that this was definitely a quality product and was what i needed without having to go to a dermatologist. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my skin is almost clear! It&#x27;s amazing! My skin has really affected my self esteem but now i&#x27;m starting to feel better about how i look. I used to break out every week at least 5 or 6 times or more now at most i break out is 2. Plus the spots i broke out i hardly ever break out there anymore. And my acne scars are also lightening. The only downside is it&#x27;s very overdrying. That&#x27;s the only reason i give it 4 stars. And i have oily skin. So as long as you use the clear pore serum and acne treatment serum sparingly your skin shouldn&#x27;t dry out that much. It&#x27;s hard to know which reviews are honest or which are just saying its good but you never know till you try. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed as far as it clearing your acne! This was my miracle product!</li>
    <li> Exposed is so natural and wonderful. I have used Proactiv for 5 years and it kind of quit working. When I switched to exposed, my acne cleared fast. If I had a sore spot that I knew would cause a large pimple, the clearing serum like draws it out so it is gone so much faster. It has helped my self-esteem about my face and is so smooth. Proactiv is kind of gritty, it makes your face feel clean, but strips the oils you need to balance. I highly recommend this, it is a perfect product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approximately a little over a month or so and cannot believe the change that it has made to my skin in this short amount of time. After trying numerous over the counter, dermatologist(s), and home remedy products I gave up for a awhile because my skin was oversensitive and in the end made worse no matter how \\&quot;friendly\\&quot; they claimed to be for sensitive skin.   I then decided to try proactiv for the 2nd time because it advertised an improved mild/less harsh ingredient formula...but then saw a review of the year&#x27;s best acne products and came across Exposed Skin. I was immediately attracted to the all natural and green tea formula thinking that would be the most gentle on my skin, so I tried it and the rest is kind of history lol Even though it is a little more expensive than other products, I am won over because my skin has never looked better and it is noticeably true so  in the end much worth the cost. It took a while for my skin to get used to it, but trust the process that you cannot demand instant gratification so at least use for a couple months to give a fair chance for the desired results to happen.   I stress that I have had very bad acne for almost over 14+ years and this worked for me when nothing else did...I may be the exception to the rule but nonetheless am thankful that something has FINALLY worked for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter and her skin has never looked so good! The products are amazing and the company is prompt with the shipment of orders. I love exposed skincare and would recommend it for anyone who is struggling with acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING!  Seriously.  My last attempt with a dermatologist left me hopeless, then I ran into some reviews of Exposed.  Thought I would give it a shot and it seriously cleared my skin within a few weeks.  I&#x27;m in my 30s.. been dealing with adult acne for some time now.  I&#x27;m so happy I found this product.  It just feels good on my face.  A month into using it, I went to the dermatology office with $300+ worth of their products explaining that their products left my skin extremely dry and STILL broken out.  And I found another product (fraction of the price) that actually clears my skin!  I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 17 year old male and started getting acne a couple years ago. It was mild to moderate and nothing seemed to work totally effectively. I used a clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide prescription to only half success. I always had small bumps below my mouth and in between my eyebrows. They remained invisible but every couple days one would flare up and become a pimple. Exposed helped most of these bumps surface, so my skin did get worse for a while. However, unlike stronger concentrations (10% BP, etc.), exposed was weaker and more natural and balanced. After a month my skin has become clearer than ever due to the perfect balance of strength and natural extracts to prevent inflammation. With all my other products I tried I moisturizer properly to keep my skin in balance, and I&#x27;m well versed in acne and it&#x27;s solutions. Exposed has worked wonderfully to (slowly) heal my acne, and after a month it has worked better than anything else. Give it time! The only gripes I have are the high price and small tubes that finish at different times. It takes much less clear pore serum than it does acne treatment serum. I also broke my bottle of toner so I never used it at all for my my first kit, which I just finished. It obviously works well without it. I also want to say how much I love their ingredients. I know BP, salicylate acid, green tee, and tee tree oil are all very effective, but they are almost never all used together. Exposed uses every good quality acne ingredient out there that I know of and all in one system. my biggest tip is to moisturize properly. For me, I use the cleanser, acne treatment serum, and ernest supplies protective matte moisturizer (fantastic moisturizer, and matte) in the morning. At night I use the cleanser, the clear pore serum, and cerave moisturizing cream (cerave is greasy but powerful and non comodogenic, so I use it at night). I will use the toner probably just once a day when I get my next kit, but I haven&#x27;t decided morning or night yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a disclaimer, I was not approached by Exposed to write this review. I am doing it as a testament to their great quality product and want everyone else who suffers from acne to benefit from the same products. I know this is my first review, and that might raise suspicions, but I&#x27;ve never cared enough about a product to write a review. Exposed isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s as close as you can get. What do you have to lose? Take advantage of the one year return policy if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy exposed!</li>
    <li> The exposed system is awesome, I&#x27;ve been really impressed so far. It has done wonders for my skin and I think it will do the same for most people.</li>
    <li> This basic kit is an economical choice for acne treatment. I am using it everyday and the skin looks better and better.</li>
    <li> First off I thought I might clarify some of the talk of \\&quot;false reviews\\&quot;. Exposed offers discounts occasionally (store credits) for anyone who will go to amazon and leave a review (good or bad) about the product. That&#x27;s prob why there are a lot of one time commenters... anyways onward to the review.&lt;br /&gt;My skin just sort of sucks, not gonna lie. It was fine up until I was in college and then for some unknown reason I started breaking out something awful. Before using this, BC was the only thing that helped... but that made me so sick/gain a bunch of weight that I just had to stop taking it. I tried Clinique for awhile and it stopped working after about a month (never saw a whole lot of improvement with their products). I then went on to Carley&#x27;s and my skin got way worse. There were days when I didn&#x27;t want to leave the house. I then switched to exposed and within 2 weeks, boom, cleared up skin. It got worse for awhile after that... but now 7 weeks in my skin is looking way better than it has in years. This product helped reduce my oily skin and my pores seem to look smaller. My color is definitely more blended and the redness is starting to fade.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s for sure not something that happens overnight though and it does take some responsibility (to stay on schedule). You also still need to be proactive about changing your pillowcases and washcloths frequently and getting vitamins, but I think it&#x27;s all worth the results.&lt;br /&gt;Happy facewashing&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the product never dried my skin out..maybe it was because I&#x27;ve fried it out on so many extra strength products, but that was a major pro for me.&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------UPDATE--------------------------&lt;br /&gt;So it is now 8/18/13 and I think I may have found the real deal. As long as I&#x27;m using the product (some nights I forget) it does wonders managing my skin. I highly recommend the clay mask as well, it sort of smells but afterwards you skin feels great all day! I have never stayed committed to a skin care product this long, I was even able to stop using my pricey foundation/concealer. I love this stuff, and I understand that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but if you&#x27;re searching for a new product give it a try. It might be cheaper on the actual website and they have some decent coupons (just search online for the codes).&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Exposed Acne Treatment Kit after hearing a Paleo blogger (I think it was Liz Wolfe) recommend the line.  I can honestly say that this is the first acne treatment line that has really worked to reduce and manage my acne without leaving my skin dry and flaky.  It did take at least a month for the treatment to really take effect -- seemed to get slightly worse around week 2 or 3, but quickly resolved itself.  So remember, be patient.  And they have a 30-day money back guarantee, so you can always return the products if they don&#x27;t work for your skin.  I love the natural ingredients in the line, and all the products have a pleasant scent (of course, I&#x27;m a huge fan of Tea Tree oil, and that helps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only purchased this product directly from Exposed Skin Care, and would recommend that others do this, as well.  Their customer service department was responsive to my needs after my second shipment was lost by UPS.  They even credited my account $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this line to several friends!  Love, love, love Exposed Skin Care!</li>
    <li> I think the bottom line is that you can buy a decent cleanser, an astringent with salicylic acid and any benzoyl peroxide product available in your local drug store for a fraction of the price of this kit, and get pretty much the same results, assuming you use everything consistently and appropriately. There are a few other ingredients/nutrients that Exposed is throwing in, but the benefits are negligible (if not completely absent) and they&#x27;re probably more of a marketing ploy than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re uninterested in purchasing cleanser, toner/astringent, and benzoyl peroxide treatments separately (from disparate manufacturers), then the Exposed kit is convenient, since it&#x27;s all packaged together... but you&#x27;re going to pay for that convenience.</li>
    <li> This product started out working well. Around week 3 I started having more breakouts. The flyer said this was to be expected. Then I noticed dark patches appearing on my face that were irritated. The product burned my skin. Quit using at this point and threw away.</li>
    <li> I have tried for years... literally since I was 13 years d ( I&#x27;m 26) and I have tried everything from Accutane to 300 dollar acne solutions and nothing has consistently done as well for my skin than Exposed Skincare. I have used this peoduct for just about 2 years. With all the great tips and inside of how to continuously keep your pores clean and keep your acne away and there is nothing in this moment in time that does the job like exposed skin care! I promise you will not regret the choice of getting this product.</li>
    <li> Exposed skin care cleared my face within a week, and has kept it clear for a year so far! I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Ifound Exposed about 4 years ago and have been using it ever since.  I tried many expensive skin care product, as well as spent so much money on spa treatments before I found this product.  The Exposed acne treatment has work better then any ohter product out there.  I have never had flawless skin until know.  People can not believe that I ever had trouble skin because of how clear it has become.  I love this product and would recommend it to anyone who has trouble skin becuase this was the sloution for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my face, including Proactiv, and none have worked as well as Exposed Skin Care. Each of the bottles and tubes that come in the kits works together to make your face clearer. I love Exposed, my acne has reduced and I have no black heads. When I&#x27;m on my period, that&#x27;s when my acne is the worst, it still is great on my face. Its soft and gentle as well.</li>
    <li> Exposed is by far the best acne treatment system I have ever used. I&#x27;ve had problems with my skin breaking out for years, and have tried so many things, including birth control, antibiotics, and tons of creams and cleansers. I remember thinking in the midst of trying so many things that it would be so great to have something more natural to use instead of all of the harsh chemicals. Exposed is the perfect combination of helpful chemicals and natural ingredients. I put it on and I know that it is working. My skin feels so clean after using it, and I have noticed dramatic results. I definitely plan to keep using it!</li>
    <li> I have always had incredibly bad acne. I&#x27;ve tried most acne products out there including Proactiv. NOTHING worked or helped my face. I discovered Exposed Skin Care about 2 or 3 years ago and I&#x27;ve been amazed. My skin is so smooth and healthy and clear. I never ever thought I would say this about an acne product. It works, it works, it works!</li>
    <li> My son never had clear skin. he tried different products with 0 results, so after asking my family and friends I went online for recommendations and noticed this product, I was VERY skeptical before ordering it because I&#x27;d never heard of Exposed before, but i was so desperate that I ordered the basic kit to start (in case it didn&#x27;t work). Within 5 days everyone noticed the change! Within a few weeks his skin cleared up, breakouts didn&#x27;t were all gone, but the texture of his skin was transformed! he had less breakouts, and when he does have a pimple, its tiny and is usually gone in a day or two. I really recommend this to EVERYONE who deals with embarrassing acne and wants a product that doesn&#x27;t just clear your skin for a week, but if you really want to see results you&#x27;ll have to use it as described.</li>
    <li> It worked okay for me--but not enough that I was willing to spend $60 a month on it. I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, just enough to make me a little self-conscious once in a while. I found a cheaper system that works a lot better (the AcneFree 24 Hour Acne Clearing System)--it has kept my skin clear for about a month for 1/3 of the cost. However, just because it didn&#x27;t work for me and my skin type, doesn&#x27;t mean that it wouldn&#x27;t work for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Exposed has great customer service. I sent in my empty kit to get a refund (there&#x27;s a 1-year money back guarantee), and for whatever reason, the package didn&#x27;t arrive. They still authorized Amazon to give me a refund.</li>
    <li> Amazing results.  In a week I had people asking me what I was doing different.</li>
    <li> My daughter love it. so I bought it and send it to Korea</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used exposed for a few months, and it out-performs Murad, and of course proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the steps religiously, including the weird step where you let your skin air dry instead of pat dry, it works wonders. It also smells unbelievable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this if you can afford it!</li>
    <li> This acne system made my acne worse.  I couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore after a month so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product. It has done my skin wonders. I inherited acne problems from both my parents and have been suffering with it since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s), and not just little pimples here and there, but almost everywhere. My back, Chest, T-zone, Cheeks and Jawline. I have combination dry to oily skin, usually on the dryer places like my back, and chest I have a lot of regular acne. But my cheeks, t-zone and jawline where it&#x27;s more oily I sometimes get cystic acne right by my jawline that never come to a head and just stays under the skin. Those were so painful to touch and such a burden. I tried EVERYTHING, Proactive, Clean and Clear, The Regimen from Acne.org, Neutrogena Acne washes, Olay Pro-X clear acne protocol, Clearasil etc. the list goes on since I was 15. I&#x27;ve switched to 4 different dermatologists over the years, I&#x27;ve taken Antibiotics and Prescriptions and after a couple of months my body got used to it and my acne would come back STRONGER and WORSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had given up and was going to learn to just deal with it and let nature take its course, until one day while on the internet a pop up ad had the link to Exposed Skincare. I read the reviews and started out with The Basic Kit. It has been my first week using it and to my surprise ALL my red little acne bumps are less inflamed and practically flat. Even my cystic acne has reduced in size and seems to be getting smaller everyday. This is the first time in years that I haven&#x27;t woken up to any new pimples. It&#x27;s even making my acne scars fade, which is wonderful. I&#x27;m starting to feel more confident not wearing makeup and happier overall! The Basic kit comes with a clear gel wash but it smells very natural. Not full of very harsh chemicals or strong fragrances. It also comes with the little wash cloth which I love, it has exfoliated my face and I can feel my face getting softer. The Clearing Tonic isn&#x27;t too harsh at all (Trust me if you&#x27;ve tried proactive or The Regimen those burn worse!) but every skin type varies, mine in on the sensitive side. I love The Pore minimized serum. There&#x27;s a tint of green to it and you can smell the natural herbs inside. I noticed even on my nose especially my pores has diminished in size. Finally the Acne Serum is the last the comes in the box, It contains a mixture of Benzoyl Peroxide, Tea Tree Oil and Green Tea Extract. I believe wholeheartedly the combination of those ingredients have made my cystic acne slowly reduce I&#x27;m size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this kit rocks and I would recommend this product to anyone who asks. I&#x27;ve never written a review about an Acne Product but I felt the need to do so with this one. It made my skin softer, more even complexion and strip away the stubborn scars that were left behind. One thing I will note if you stick to it religiously 2x a day it WILL dry out your face on the spots you tend to put more of the Clearing Tonic and Acne Serum. Make sure you have a good moisturizer that WONT irritate your acne or clog your pores (I use Eucerin). Best time to use the Clearing Tonic is when you&#x27;re fresh out the shower and your pores are open. It makes a difference. And when your face is still a little sticky from the Clearing Tonic that&#x27;s the best time to put the Pore Minimizer or the Acne Serum or even both! I wish the best to those who purchase this product and see relief and results :) one more thing, YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. Too much Sugary drinks, foods, and snacks doesn&#x27;t help either (Took me a while to apply I to myself) you can&#x27;t expect results on the outside if you don&#x27;t clean up internally either. Good Luck! I will be a returning costumer.</li>
    <li> I first started breaking out when I was 14, and expected to see my acne disappear after teenage years. Instead, my acne seemed to develop and evolve. I am now in my mid 20s, and my acne has moved from my forehead to my cheeks, breakouts are deeper, bigger, redder, and last longer. I used over the counter face washes. And no improvement. Used a prescription from a dermatologist, no improvement, used proactive, little improvement.  I hated that proactive stained my pillowcases, clothes, and towels (bleached from peroxide). The results simply weren’t good enough to deal with that. So I stopped and resorted back to over the counter.&lt;br /&gt;I started grad school and the stress, combined with crappy foods took my break outs to another level. I was embarrassed to go out, avoided eye contact with peers, and would be on the verge of panic if I couldn’t have make up on (like at the gym). It was not only my face that sucked, my social life was not being affected. So I needed to change. I searched online and found exposed. It’s easy to use and I have seen major improvement. It’s been a few months and my skin is not altogether clear, but all of those super-deep zits are slowly coming to the surface and one-at-a-time disappearing. My face is smoother, pores are smaller, and new breakouts less frequent.  I notice, more than ever, that my breakouts occur with bad habits in my diet (especially sweets). So since focusing on eating healthier I have seen even more improvement. I should also note that I only used the face wash and toner at night because my skin gets too dry otherwise.  I would highly recommend this product if nothing else is working for you. I did and I feel so much better.</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and she loves this product and has since switched from her old face wash</li>
    <li> I believe this is my first review on Amazon, but I felt I really should write a review about this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about nine months now, and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps with the adult acne I have.  A lot of my acne is hormonal (I&#x27;m a 27 year old female), so nothing really touches those flare-ups--not even prescriptions or oral antibiotics--but these products, when used regularly, seem to speed up the healing process while keeping any other non-hormonal break-outs at bay.  I live in Florida where it&#x27;s hot and humid, so my face tends to get oily very easily.  I could see this kit working extremely well for those who have break-outs with white heads/typical acne (not the under-the-skin hormonal cysts I get).  Even with it not being a 100% miracle product that magically fixes all my issues, it still works very well, and I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was a proactiv user for many years.  Proactiv doesn&#x27;t even compare to Exposed for many reasons. Besides the fact that Exposed works much better, it smells great and stays fresh for as long as I have the product.  The moisturizer is silk smooth and enables me to apply my make-up beautifully, the acne treatment &amp; clear pore serum works great to keep acne clear &amp; the microderm scrub is amazing.  I did not have results right away, it took a little over a week before I saw changes, but then it just happened!  My skin is soft looking, clear and beautiful.  Follow the guide in the box, you have to use it morning and night (don&#x27;t give up) and you will have clear skin too!  I will never go back!</li>
    <li> After 5 weeks of using Skin exposed my face still has acne and spots on it. This product doesn&#x27;t work unfortunately I will have to go else where.AA male</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing these products for almost a year now for my teenage daughter.  We have tried other acne products, but these by far have given her the best results.  She absolutely loves them and the way they make her skin feel.  We are 100% pleased with Exposed Acne Treatment products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless products in an attempt to clear my skin. Exposed is hands down the best and most effective solution.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old woman and I have been struggling with extremely persistent acne since I was 11. I have tried EVERYTHING--all the prescription medications, including acutane and everything available over the counter. Acutane was the only thing that entirely cleared my skin, but it is incredibly horrible for your body, so I stopped taking it after a short period of time. While the Acne Free regimen I was using did a fairly good job, I still got occasional breakouts. After reading a ton of reviews on this and other websites, I decided to give Exposed a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the directions, the first 2 weeks are the adjustment period: \\&quot;Some flare up may occur. Use products sparingly.\\&quot; This is a HUGE understatement. My skin was absolutely HORRIBLE for the first 3 weeks. It was like I was 13 again. I was crying and frustrated, but my husband encouraged me to stick with it for the full 5 weeks. Thank goodness he did! My skin finally cleared up and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since week 4. So, I recommend that you get this product and stick with it, even through the horrible adjustment period. Just don&#x27;t plan any major life events in those first three weeks--no proms, no weddings, no interviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months, I really love it. My skin is spotless and smooth. The red marks are fading and I&#x27;m very happy. But I still curse the adjustment period and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve only given this product 4 stars.</li>
    <li> best acne product and creates a smooth skin tone. Helps eliminate all acne and prevent them in the future. Saw results in less than a month and been a member for years. I used proactive as a teen and it did not help my skin but the exposed acne treatment definitely has helped me to this day</li>
    <li> You figure once you&#x27;re past your teen and 20&#x27;s you wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with acne. Not only that but most likely by that time you probably have tried everything, I know I did. That is until I stumbled upon these products.Results were not immediate, it took about a month before everything cleared up (Chin/nose/cheeks) but clear up it did. This is the first product that actually did what it was supposed to do. I only wish they had this 30 years ago.&lt;br /&gt; Make sure to drink lots of water and to launder your pillow case regularly. I flip the pillow and wash every 2 days.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ll also add that the company has great customer service both through email and Facebook.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything including Accutane and this is the only product that worked. I have been using this product for 3 years now and could not be any happier with it. My skin looks smoother and I haven&#x27;t had any horrible breakouts. The product is also very reasonable priced compared to the other skincare treatments out there. I strongly recommend you try it. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Exposed is a game changer. While many other acne treatment regimens claim the power of the chemicals in their product, they ultimately damage your skin. Exposed utilizes simple, yet effective products containing soothing active botanicals and acne medications (the smell is pretty fresh too!) I am in love with Exposed and am happy to spread the word to the acne sufferer community. Exposed is the best acne treatment I have found on the market today (and I have tried many). I love it.</li>
    <li> I feel like this hwlps to keep my skin clear. This is the second time I have purchased it. I only use the night time regimen because my skin is a little sensitive.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! Ive been using it for about a year now and Im very satisfied with the results.  As of this moment I have NO pimples on my face and will continue to purchase this product.  Sometimes my skin will get used to a facial product and stop working but not with this one.  I even recommended it for my sister because she was complaining about her acne.  That was 7 months ago and shes been using it ever since.  Two VERY satisfied customers!</li>
    <li> My 27 year old daughter and I have dry, allergic skin AND pimples. Exposed Skin Care is the only system we have found that helps both conditions for both of us! We love it.[[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
    <li> Works great for me and my 13 year old daughter. Her acne went from angry red to very mild big difference. 80 percent improvement after a week.  For me it is non abrasive doesnt make my skin dry or sensitive just a good clean.</li>
    <li> After seeing so many positive reviews, I decided to try exposed.But it did not clear up my acne and in fact seemed to make it worse.it is a total scam so many good reviews in such a short time and only those people have reviewed this product.</li>
    <li> cleared my skin but really dried out my face even when using less of the acne cream like the instructions suggested.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  I ordered it because my sister said she had been using it and it was doing wonders.  I was a little hesitant because I have trouble keeping up the routine (3 items, twice a day).  But this is super easy to keep up with.  It takes me about 5 minutes in the morning, 5 in the evening.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 5-6 days, and I&#x27;m already seeing improvement.  I&#x27;m definitely starting to break out, but it&#x27;s just the stuff coming out from the skin.  I can already see sections of blackheads I&#x27;ve had for years disappearing.  I think this has a great impact, and I&#x27;m really happy with everything.  I anticipate loving it for a while.  I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I think it is fantastic. For years I have had pretty unreasonable and thought as I got older it would get better but that wasnt the case. I have very oily skin as well which I beleive contributed to  the break outs. But after getting product, I was a little surprised at the size of the product but it actually lasts because you&#x27;re using  little at a time. After a couple of weeks I noticed my skin was less oily,smoother and no breakouts. I&#x27;m still going strong and Ioonow its a process to clear the old blemishes up but they&#x27;re starting to fade now also. I would definatelu recommend.</li>
    <li> So excited to finally find a product that worked!  We have tried more products than I can possible list to treat my daughters acne, including treatments prescribed by her dermatologist. While she is not 100% acne free, she is an impressive 80% acne free. So happy we found this product!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything and anything to get rid of acne. I have used Neutrogena, Clearsil, Proactiv, Biore, everything that claims to get rid of acne and reveal clearer skin. Nothing has worked for me until I decided to try Exposed Skincare one day after reading such great reviews. It was kind of expensive, but if it worked, I wouldn&#x27;t care! I tried it and honestly within the first week I just felt like my skin was clearer and softer and just felt better! After about three weeks everyone was noticing the changes, and the best part was, I wasn&#x27;t worried about going out not wearing makeup, because it seriously makes your skin glow. I use it as directed, and have been using it for almost a year, and won&#x27;t turn back. I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found something that works. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you try it!</li>
    <li> I received the expanded kit on February 23 and I&#x27;ve been using it until I ran out today April 15. It has worked for me. My pores are 80% smaller, no new big pimples. I still have some acne scarring but its going away. I just bought my second kit so I will continue to use. I bought the basic kit this second time cause i dont really use the moisturizer. I&#x27;m happy with the results. I&#x27;ll update when my next kit runs out. I think exposed is worth a try. Its pricey but it&#x27;s worked better for more than off the counter brands.</li>
    <li> I have been using exposed skin care for nearly a year now.  I have tried so many products and never saw any results.  Very frustrated and running out of options, I began to research solutions online and came across a survey that rated all popular acne treatments and Exposed was at the top of the list. Hesitantly, I ordered this kit and was surprised and pleased.  I saw results within and week, and have been a loyal customer ever since.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say, I had the worst acne ever and exposed was seriously awesome. It smells good, its smooth, and my acne is gone. I tried everything and exposed worked the best!</li>
    <li> Exposed skin care really works. I used to have horrible acne and whatever product I tried always seemed to be futile. Exposed on the other hand really controls my acne and I have been a faithful customer for two years.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with Exposed, and find it to be a much better line than the competitors. The products are natural and feel good on my skin. My skin has improved as well, where I saw very little difference using other lines.</li>
    <li> Product works ok.  I had ordered a single product to replace one of the items in the kit that ran out more quickly than the others.  Not only did I receive that product, but I received another full kit a couple weeks later.  I checked the website and they had signed me up for a subscription that automatically billed me for a monthly kit.  I will never buy this product again because of their deceptive practices.</li>
    <li> I found this product on a simple google search. I was initially skeptical, but trust me... The product is great!  I&#x27;ll never use anything else. Shipping times can be slow, but the product is amazing.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone struggling with mild to moderate acne from whatever source. It has proven results that I had not found with any other product that I tried. It truly does what it says it will do and with no side effects. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from moderate acne since I was 13 years old. I have tried many department store brand acne medications and have also used Proactiv for 3 years when I was 20. I came across the Exposed Acne Treatment a couple months ago. Now, at 24, my skin is as clear as ever. I started the kit in September of last year. I have always had stubborn recurring pimples on my chin area, and was a bit discouraged that it hadn&#x27;t improved after a month of using this product. However, I did notice that the overall tone of my face was getting better, so I decided to go ahead and order a second set of Exposed and continue my daily applications.&lt;br /&gt;After 4 months of using the Exposed kit, I only wish I had heard of it sooner. The stubborn pimples only occur if I splurge on chocolate/sweets during that time of the month, but even then, they only last a day or two. My acne scars are almost all gone! I am taking a vacation next month, so I made sure to order the travel sized kit so that I can take it with me and keep up my daily applications.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the need to use the derm-x cloth, but I do keep the moisturizer in my bag for emergencies (I prefer Clinique&#x27;s DDM gel) because it does the trick. I also order the sulfur mask and use it about twice a week.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but I have always had weird skin. I was sick of spending $80 a month on prescription medications and visits to the dermatologist (I&#x27;m only 18 - I ain&#x27;t got time for that)so I googled \\&quot;best acne treatment\\&quot; and Exposed came up. I went out on a limb and ordered it because I have already tried a bunch of different acne products that haven&#x27;t done anything for me. I have tried Proactive, Murad, generic brands, tretinoin, antiboitics... Anything I could get my hands on. But I feel like I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;typical\\&quot; acne. I rarely get pimples with whiteheads. My skin had a lot of tiny blackheads, which drive me crazy and make me want to pick my skin, and I would ocassionally break out in cyst-like acne. Even worse, even the skin that did not have any pimples was red and irritated and basically a complete trainwreck from all the random picking.&lt;br /&gt;I made sure I took a before picture before I started the treatment so I&#x27;d have a comparison so I could see if my skin changed at all. And it definitely is a lot better. My face is not acne-free, (I still get the occasional hormonal breakout, the kit isn&#x27;t a miracle worker) but it looks a HELL OF A LOT better. I think the key thing is the \\&quot;clear pore serum\\&quot; or whatever they call it. All of the blackheads that I would pick at were gone within the 12 weeks. My face feels and looks healthier in general. I don&#x27;t have as much redness, and my face is so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;The results definitely aren&#x27;t instant, but I began noticing huge changes to my skin within the first two weeks or so. This product is definitely NOT for everyone and NOT for severe acne. But it might work for you if you have weird skin like I do. Somehow, this product came through for me and I will be forever grateful to Exposed skincare for that.</li>
    <li> I struggled with deep cystic acne that would itch and tingle and tried everything from Dermologoca, Skin ID, proactiv and many others. I ran into Exposed on a website and it had fabulous reviews so I figured...why not it can&#x27;t get any worse. That decision was the BEST decision I have ever made for my skin. Within the first week I noticed a huge difference. The itching and tingling completely stopped and my acne finally calmed down. I&#x27;ve been using exposed for four months and you can&#x27;t even tell I struggled with acne. If I could only recommend one thing in my life exposed would be it I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t more popular!</li>
    <li> I takes a while to work but once you get used to it it will keep your skin clear for a long time :) Definitely reccomend</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 months now. It has cleared my skin up 95 %. I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just under 3 weeks now and it&#x27;s been working great for me. I&#x27;d normally randomly break out and take forever to heal but this stuff keeps any breakouts from happening...so far. Time and more use will only tell, but I have great hopes.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is it takes a bit of time to go through the 3 steps each morning and night, but ehh, minor issue.</li>
    <li> The only products I have used that actually work. Also, you can email the company any time for advice &amp; help, they always reply straight away.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing results! I recommend anyone to try them out. I have suffered for years! If only I had the products 20 years ago, my life would have been transformed.  I have had antibiotics on &amp; off all that time! Exposed has given me better results than my doctor! I have recommended to the doctor as well, but I don&#x27;t know if she has passed my advice on to others.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth a try if you suffer, I hope you have the same results as me!  Only thing I put on my skin now, &amp; so simple to use. Been a user for nearly 6 months</li>
    <li> i HAD THE WORST ACNE EVER, BELIEVE ME AND HAVE GONE THROUGH SO MUCH SUFFERING BUT NOW AFTER USING THE EXPOSED SKIN CARE KITS FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS MY SKIN LOOKS FLAWLESS. ITS AMAZING AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS. IT MIGHT TAKE TIME BUT IN THE END YOU WILL BE AS HAPPY AS EVER. GET THIS PRODUCT. IT WORKS.!</li>
    <li> After trying multiple acne skincare lines such as proactive, drugstore brands, etc. I never found any that worked, they either dryed my face out, irritated my skin, or just didn&#x27;t work. After searching online one day, I found Exposed, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s the best skincare line I&#x27;ve found yet. I would for sure rate any Exposed product 5 out of 5 stars. If I get a huge zit, the Exposed dries it up in such quick time. It always gives my skin amazing results and I would definetly recommend it to anyone thats struggling with acne.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. It works as long as you stay with the regiment. My acne came back when I lagged on use of the exposed. make sure to stay on top of game and it will work</li>
    <li> First off, I never had really bad acne but it always seemed that I had a couple of zits at any given moment. I had used a prescription but that made my skin dry so I wanted to try something different.. That&#x27;s when I decided to give Exposed skin care a try. I started off using it everyday and pretty much instantly I noticed my skin get clearer. One and a half years later, I still use it but now I probably only use it 3 or 4 times a week. My skin still looks great and it&#x27;s the same price that I was spending for my prescription. I only use the basic kit and it works wonderful.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a couple months ago after comparing Exposed Skin Care to other leading acne treatments, this one seemed to be the best so I gave it a shot, after months of using it, I definitely noticed a drastic change, I had less breakouts and my face started to clear up gradually and a bit slowly but I&#x27;m still using the product because I am satisfied and if you do want clean and clear skin, I highly recommend to stay on the treatment. My skin is very sensitive but this didn&#x27;t cause any sort of irritation or rash, I&#x27;ve actually been looking to write a review to share with others that the product actually does work with time and patience, not a bad price at all, there&#x27;s always a nice discount!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now.  I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my skin except for a rough patch on my chin that is starting to clear up.  I had better results with Proactiv.  I do have this to say though... Proactiv bleached every towel and pillow case I owned.  Exposed gives you a small white cloth to use and I have not seen any damage to my pillow cases yet.</li>
    <li> The best acne product on the market! Also, the easiest and most convenient to use.inlike Pro Activ, this is a three step product that takes no extract time to apply.</li>
    <li> Bought it twice because I thought it took awhile to activate. It hasn&#x27;t helped at all. I know people said it worked maybe it&#x27;s just my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mild-moderate acne for about 8 years.  I&#x27;ve used Proactiv, I&#x27;ve used pads, soaps, all sorts of stuff.  This is the only product that had a noticeable effect on my acne, to the point where there&#x27;s not a single spot on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I coupled treatment with this product with cutting a large amount of sugar out of my diet.  I thought I had outgrown acne, so i stopped using the product and started eating sugar again.  Sure enough, it came back in full force.  All I can say is that if you&#x27;re serious about fixing your face, use this stuff twice a day and cut out the soda/fruit juices.  Your face will thank you and you&#x27;ll be healthier all around.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try the Exposed system after reading such rave reviews. It instantly made my skin so much worse. After about a week, I noticed my skin get really tight and ridiculously itchy,still I was hell bent on beating this acne, so I continued using it for a few more weeks. I had even more break outs than normal and in places that I have never had break outs before! Around my jaw line/neck and around my temples. My chin, where I normally get break outs doubled in the amount of break outs I had! I am in my late 20s and adult acne is awful. This system made my skin so much worse. It is very expensive and time consuming for it not to work! I am retuning this system today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked by how many fantastic reviews this product got and how awful it worked for me. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous....better than pro active in my opinion...bought it for my son,and we had tried nearly everything to clear up his acne and this product did it with in a month.....</li>
    <li> Bought this set on regular base for my 2 teenage daughters.  it works for their skin which can limit the acne.</li>
    <li> Did not work. Used for estimated time, just left skin red and iritated. Did not have a good experience and would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product for people like me who are suffering from frequent breakouts. My acne got so worse that I was even scared of shaving my beard. I got amazing results just after 3 days of using this product. It has some cool tips about maintaining personal hygiene and eating habits. Just follow them and use the products religiously, you&#x27;ll not regret it for sure.</li>
    <li> I am a 48 year old woman and have battled acne since my teens. I started using Proactive a few years ago, and decided to try Exposed. I love it. I will not be ordering Proactive any longer.&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions and follow the steps for best results. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received the Exposed 4 piece Acne Treatment Basic Kit four days ago by mail. I started using it right away as directed and already I have noticed a major improvement in my skin texture. It is softer and smoother, the acne that I had is starting to shrink, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any new blemishes in days. I am a female in my thirties and my breakouts were due to a horrid hormone imbalance. Adult hormonal acne can be a very tricky thing to clear up. I discovered the Exposed products while on line looking to purchase Proactive. Exposed appealed to me more because of its natural ingredients (I prefer to take a holistic approach when it comes to health and beauty). I had used Proactive when I was younger, but it only worked minimally and it dried my skin out badly. I was willing to give it another shot because my current breakouts were less inflammatory and more in the classification of sebum overproduction causing clogged pores. I&#x27;m very grateful that I decided to give Exposed a try! For me, it appears that it will be a staple in my personal care arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did not make my Exposed purchase via Amazon, I wanted to write a review here because it seems for every good review that I read, there was a negative review claiming that the positive reviews were hoaxes. The official Exposed web sight backs up their products with a one year return for a refund offer. If you&#x27;re not sure how the products will work for you, make your first purchase through them. This way, it&#x27;s risk free. If the products do everything that they claim, including giving your confidence back, there&#x27;s no reason why you can&#x27;t continue to purchase Exposed products through Amazon, which does sell them a bit cheaper and offers free shipping. I may go that rout myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Skincare products for just a little over two years now. As a teen I had moderately bad acne, while most products would clear about 60% of blemishes, exposed skincare cleared between 90%-100% of my acne! The product sets are slightly expensive and can last around 6wks, definitely worth the expense though! I would recommend exposed skincare to any of my friends and family. I still use it today to have a clean and clear feeling to my face! Thank you exposed!</li>
    <li> I started using the Exposed Basic Kit about 3 months ago and have noticed a difference in my skin.  I was formerly using Proactiv and stopped because it wasn&#x27;t working and it was super harsh on my skin.  What I love about Exposed is that it is so gentle on my skin and doesn&#x27;t strip my natural oils, but yet is effective.  I still get some minor breakouts here and there, but they go away and heal quickly.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that has struggled with the same problem.</li>
    <li> My skin was not really bad, but I&#x27;d have recurrent outbreaks.  I&#x27;d tried Pro-Active which was ok, but was way too drying so I discontinued using it.  While looking for something else on the internet, I came across Exposed and based on the comments, I decided to try it.  Within a week, I saw the difference.  My face was totally clear and it&#x27;s remained that way ever since...about 6 months and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with over drying.&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is about the packaging.  I think the dispenser bottles and tubes leave much to be desired...even after 6months, It still feels confusing when I have to figure out which one to use...all the bottles look the same  Also, if standing, the tube leaks, so I have to keep it horizontal, and the the cleanser  bottle dispenses much more than is needed, if I&#x27;m not careful...it all needs a re-design.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old female with mild acne. I took a gamble on this because I&#x27;d never heard of Exposed before, none of my friends used it, and it was very expensive. But I had used Proactiv for about 8 years and finally realized that it hadn&#x27;t worked for the last several years and was not worth my money. This system is similar to Proactiv, involves more steps, and demands more commitment, but if you seriously want clear skin, it is all worth it. It&#x27;s only slightly true that my skin got worse before it got better, but not too noticeably and not for very long. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks now and just ordered my 2nd kit - the biggest downside to this product is the price and how fast it runs out. But it is absolutely true that is is stronger AND gentler than any other acne product I&#x27;ve used. My skin is finally clear but it&#x27;s not peeling or cracking!! (which happened all the time with Proactiv) It leaves my skin dewy, smooth, and soft. Pimples literally do not stand a chance if I follow the regimen strictly. I&#x27;ve also been drinking more water, changing my pillow case more often, and trying to avoid sweets &amp; dairy like the pamphlet advises. Exposed works beautifully under makeup.  I still get clogged pores because my skin is super oily, but not blackheads and not those deep red painful pimples I occasionally got before. I don&#x27;t use the towel that comes with it when washing my face, but I use a cotton ball to apply the toner (instead of just fingertips like the bottle suggests) and that removes a ton of gunk the cleanser didn&#x27;t get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple takeaway - it works and you should try it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product with amazing results.</li>
    <li> Two words &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34; this is the only acne product that I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used a gazillion that has improved my skin and gotten rid of my acne.. Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I just bought it and it is helping my face. The problem with you people is that you guys use it every day. Must be used minimum of 4 times a week, not 7.</li>
    <li> Bought this system for my daughter with difficult to control acne.  Even discouraged with prescriptions from dermatologist.  This stuff is working fairly well.  No horrible outbreaks, but not clear either.  She seems to like it better than Solodyne, but I thought the prescription worked a little better.....probably about the same since we don&#x27;t agree!</li>
    <li> The packaging was great and the product would have garnered an overall \\&quot;5 Star\\&quot; rating, however the packaging was missing the base moisturizer that was supposed to be with the kit. However, Amazon did give me a 20% credit back towards the original purchase so i was satisfied.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 2 weeks ago it was ok at first but now my face is very red and flaking, i mean very badly and im breaking out worse then before when i started using this. I have sensitive skin and i think theres something in this that my face doesn&#x27;t like. Don&#x27;t use if you have sensitive skin. I will be stop using this and find something else that doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse then before.</li>
    <li> This is the first skin treatment product that works well for my sensitive skin. I tried Proactiv for a while after hearing it&#x27;s praises sung from my college dorm mates but it did nothing other than drain my pocket. I then went back to generic brands like Neutrogena but was never completely satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to see results with Exposed Skin Care (about 7 months for my skin to stop flaring up) but I&#x27;m so glad I stuck it out. I hardly ever wear concealer or foundation anymore and I get compliments on my skin all the time 😀&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip: don&#x27;t use this 2x a day - my skin was getting oily from AM and PM use so I switched to just evening use. I have also started using it with a clarisonic brush I recently inherited which seems to be adding even more POW to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this product because of all the amazing reviews on amazon and other websites. Product seemed to work in the first month, but after, my acne started flaring up again, I kept getting cysts all over my face. Switching to nano cleanse now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using exposed products for a while now, and the products do reduce acne. The product reduced my acne very noticeably however it I&#x27;d not totally cure the problem. I am still pleased with how the product works. It is easy to use and add into your normal routine.</li>
    <li> my son tried this after reading the reviews online and trying EVERYTHING under the sun from Prescription meds to over the counter remedies.  This just went to UPS to be returned for my money back.  It smells wonderful, and i&#x27;m sure it works for alot of people, but it did nothing to improve or worsen my son&#x27;s situation.  So, i&#x27;m not knocking it necessarily, it just didn&#x27;t do anything for him either way.</li>
    <li> My daughter wants clear skin but does not want to spend anytime on it.  We tried Exposed and with in 1 week we noticed a significant improvement in her skin.  After a month... a virtual turn around.  She was so happy with the results that she diligently follows her routine morning and night.  I could not be happier. I use the moisturizer for my aging skin and love it!  It is light,  non-greasy and improves redness.  I love these products.  I would and have recommended it to others.  Now Exposed needs to come up with a formula for aging skin.  I&#x27;d be the first to buy it.</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter who has had acne for several years.  Always complained how &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; each moisterizer would be....not this one.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Exposed delivers! It took about a month for me to really notice a difference but now my skin is clear and soft and never been better!</li>
    <li> I have some of the most sensitive and oily of any one that I know. I have tried prescriptions from the dermatologist, Proactiv, Neutrogena, Cetaphil, Olay, and Target&#x27;s brand. Most of these brands worked for a couple months. But then, it was like my skin &#x27;out-smarted&#x27; the treatment. I have been using Exposed for 3 months now and I have stopped having breakouts. Exposed is actually healing my old scars...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I highly recommend Exposed! I am very grateful for trying this product and even more pleased that it performs so well!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have only been using it for three months and already I could tell a huge difference in my skin.  I am one of those adults who breaks out really bad with pregnancy and due to being pregnant there is not much you can use.  After having my last child I was more broken out then ever and prescription medication was not helping AT ALL!  So, my husband went online for me after one of my breakdowns.  He had intended to order me Proactive, but I had tried this with little success so he started researching a little more and we agreed to try this product for a month.  I am so glad I did!!  I cleared up that baby acne and now although I still get one here and there I am clearer then I have been in years.</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed Skin Care for a little over a year and it works great. I have tried so many different products and this was the first time iv really seen results plus it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most other products. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> My son used Proactive for six months with no results. Changed to Exposed acne treatment and with in two weeks his face was clear. He maintains it daily with the basic kit and his face is clear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently 42 years old and began having adult acne about four years ago.  I spent literally thousands of dollars on products and visits to my dermatologist.  My official \\&quot;diagnosis\\&quot; was cystic nodular acne due to hormones...I was going to the doctor weekly to have shots of medication injected into the affected sites. The doctor prescribed several different, (and very expensive), creams, gels, etc., and none of them helped...with nothing working, my doctor wanted to prescribe Accutane as a last resort.  After researching this medication, I was not willing to take the health risks involved, so I was left with doing more research, spending more money, becoming more frustrated, and even beginning to struggle with lowered self-esteem due to the condition of my skin.  One day I simply typed \\&quot;What is the best acne treatment available?\\&quot; into Google, and I came across Exposed Skin Care.  I must tell you that this is the very first review I&#x27;ve ever taken the time to write on any product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I&#x27;m writing this review because it completely changed my skin in ways that nothing else had been able to for four frustrating years.  Within the first week, I noticed calming of the existing acne...after that, the acne began to subside, then go away altogether within 4-6 weeks.  Not only did it treat the major acne, but also the whiteheads and blackheads.  I&#x27;ve used Exposed for about a year now, and I get compliments on my skin all the time...it&#x27;s fun to tell people that at this time last year I was in a doctor&#x27;s chair getting shots injected into cysts on my face, and now I don&#x27;t even have any dark spots where the acne used to be.  I wish I had before and after pictures to go along with this review...it really is a true success story.  The red/dark spots are all gone...I only use a mineral make-up with minimal coverage...no concealer necessary.  Since I have \\&quot;maturing\\&quot; skin, I simply use a make-up and daily moisturizer that contains sunscreen, and a night cream with anti-aging properties along with the Exposed system.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re struggling with acne, you will not regret purchasing this product...it literally changed my life by helping me regain my self-confidence and self-esteem by clearing away the awful acne, controlling oil, and balancing my skin back to normal.  Not only is it wonderful, it&#x27;s very reasonably priced...especially when compared to the products I was purchasing from my doctor.  Auto-ship helps ensure I never run out of any of the products, and each time you receive a shipment, there is a coupon for $5 off an individual product...you also receive a discount on individual products when you&#x27;re a member.</li>
    <li> This system is amazing. While it didn&#x27;t entirely clear my skin, within several weeks of use it has drastically changed the appearance of my skin. I have less redness, less drying, less acne and a whole lot more confidence. It has improved my skin to the point of feeling comfortable without makeup on. Something I&#x27;ve never had before. I would definitely (and have) recommended this system. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try, and I hope it works for you as it has for me!!</li>
    <li> I can attest for the awesomeness of these products! I have always struggled with acne, and you would think that now that I am in my 30&#x27;s, I would no longer have a problem, but apparently my hormones disagree. Anyway, I have tried lots of products, and this really does work. It is more effective than Proactive, but does take some time to work. It took about a month before my face started to really get clear, but as long as I am consistent with the cleanser, the toner, and the day and night creams, my face is completely clear. I am grateful for the time NOT spent putting on lots of foundation every morning!</li>
    <li> I have used many products to clear up my adult acne with not much success but a lot of money spent! The doctor prescribed tetracycline and I was on that for years, they kept upping the dose to keep it under control and then that quit working altogether and who wants to be on that forever??? Then I was prescribed another product that I later found out was another line of Proactive at a lot higher cost and that my new doctor was one of their dealers!! so of course she prescribed it! I should have had miraculous results for the money but NO! I was frustrated and still had acne! So I some research for something more healthy and natural and found Exposed! Half the cost and with the money back guarantee, Why not? I tried it and Yes within 30 days Awesome results and I feel like I can use the products safely without all the harmful chemicals. It&#x27;s gentle and it worked!! I love it! Thank you so much Exposed for saving my face! I am 46 and acne just doesn&#x27;t fit in the lifestyle of a new Gramma!  I have been recommending the product ever since to many women young and old because it saved me! PS The ordering is great, pick your date for your product to be sent out to you and change that at anytime- NO HASSLE - and/or order individual products as you need them! It has been a very good experience for me all the way around! [[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
    <li> My skin was freaking out before my wedding and nothing would make it go away. I tried this and within a little over a week and my skin was clear. Exposed skin care saved my wedding skin!!</li>
    <li> For the past 8 years or so I have had moderate to severe acne. I tried virtually everything on the market including proactive and natural remedies. None of these worked for me. I found Exposed Skin Care being discussed on a couple of blogs and decided to try it out. First, let me say I think this is way overpriced. I payed $49 plus shipping on their website, and was disappointed to find that the bottles and tubes were quite small. However, I decided to continue giving it a shot. At first, it seemed to work. My skin was beginning to clear up and I was feeling very optimistic. Unfortunately, after maybe 3 weeks, my face started breaking out again like it did before. I decided to make some minor adjustments to the system, and they seemed to have worked. I use every morning and every night Cetaphil to cleanse my face. In the morning after cleansing, I will put on some generic over the counter benzyl peroxide (Kroger brand). At night after cleansing, I use an exfoliant (apricot scrub also Kroger Brand). Then I apply the clear pore serum and the acne treatment serum. I have been doing so for about two months now, and though my face is not completely cleared up, it looks a whole lot better than it ever has over the past few years.</li>
    <li> This product definitely helped clear up my skin. I&#x27;ve never had severe acne before but for the past 6 months my face has been out of control. Based on reviews I tried this and it cleared up my face within a few weeks. I didn&#x27;t have an issue with the tonic like some other reviewers and my only problem is dryness. I just skip using the acne treatment serum when my face gets too dry. I only gave this 4 stars because although most of my acne is much better or gone, I stil have some problem spots and stubborn ones under my skin that haven&#x27;t been affected and have formed. Still maybe that will change with continues use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much great than what I expected, my skin looks better, clean acne&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;great deal, but little volume however still great product</li>
    <li> Tried it for my 13 year old daughter and it worked great.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I would honestly give this s*** zero stars if I had the option to. I just received mine today, and I was excited to give it a try since I had heard so many \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews about it.. Well, tonight I decided to try it, but when I opened the cap, nothing came out of the bottle. I squeezed the bottle, since I could see that the face wash was stuck. And when I squeezed the bottle to see if anything would come out, something hard shot out at me and hit me directly in my eye! Now I&#x27;m completely blind in my left eye (the eye that was shot at), my eye is completely black, blue, purple, red, big, puffy, swollen, and I can&#x27;t even open it. It&#x27;s sore and watery, and I look ridiculous. I will never recommend this stupid excuse for a face product to ANYONE. I recommend that nobody EVER purchases this this thing (unless of course if you feel like losing an eye) and this product should be removed from the market permanently.</li>
    <li> Keep in mind that nothing is full-proof, use this product as directed, and Exposed Skin Care will provide positive results. Topical treatment is only half the battle. ESC recognizes that so follow the advise on the \\&quot;five rules\\&quot; card, especially #3 Avoid sugars and dairy. The Basic Kit and Probiotic Complex are essential. Try Exposed and be amazed!</li>
    <li> I do not have bad acne, but I have not seen any improvement with this product. Looks like I&#x27;ll be going back to ProActive which seems to work much better for me.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but overall not too shabby. What I really like about it, though, is how it is not very harsh on my skin, which is little sensitive. Thankfully this product has fewer chemicals than most.</li>
    <li> Best results! Worked right away and has continued working over a year now.  Tried all the other brands over the the last 20 years nothing worked as good.</li>
    <li> It was an ok product,  didn&#x27;t really get my monies worth. I would provide a higher rating if it cost less.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every product out there.... Cheap product, extremely expensive product, product with celebrities, etc.... nothing worked! I have an extremely sensitive and oily skin... Exposed SkinCare is the only product that works!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  I really wanted to and I tried to for two weeks even after it was driving me insane.  At first it was fine.  I used the products as they recommended.  After about three weeks my skin started to dry out.  It got so dry that after I washed my face I couldn&#x27;t smile because my skin would crack and it would just look like a bunch of white dry skin.  That&#x27;s been happening for three weeks now.  I stopped using the serums and just use a very diluted bit of clearing tonic and moisturizer. I&#x27;m probably putting moisturizer on about 5 or 6 times a day just to keep my skin from flaking and cracking.  It&#x27;s been a total of about 5 or 6 weeks and all it&#x27;s done is make my skin terribly dry.  I still break out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> After visiting the dermatologist, multiple spas and estheticians and buying hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, worth of products, I determined Exposed Skin Care is by far the best product on the market. The product helped with my skin that I&#x27;ve had problems with since I was a young teenager. Try the product, and if you&#x27;re not happy, simply return it for a full refund. Zero risk.</li>
    <li> I have moderate acne and this has done nothing after about 6 weeks of using. I&#x27;ve followed the instructions and continue to experience breakouts. This has done nothing to improve my skin.</li>
    <li> My sister used it for 2 months and still the same, we were really hopeful but let down. My sister is currently looking for a new solution.</li>
    <li> My daughter says it OK</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a gift. Recipient says &amp;#34;It&#x27;s way better than Proactive&amp;#34;. It didn&#x27;t dry out her skin and results were significantly noticeable. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried for a long time to find a product that clears up acne and keeps acne away. I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv and Skin ID, I&#x27;ve even dabbled with so called home remedies, but none of these items could keep acne away. Proactiv would clear up my skin but sure enough acne would come back up - not to mention this product bleached everything I owned, more or less. Skin ID, I don&#x27;t know why I even bothered - it was a good sales pitch but there wasn&#x27;t even a single positive result from using this product. I heard about Exposed and decided to give it a whirl since I really had nothing to lose at this point. Ever since I started, I haven&#x27;t looked back. This system not only gets rid of acne in a couple weeks but actually keeps them away. I&#x27;ve found that taking the supplemental pills really help - not only do I use the facial wash system, but regulating my hormones/facial oil from the inside has shown great results. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s desperate for a system that works, or is in the market for the first time.</li>
    <li> It made my cheeks feel dried out and rough. Does not help with breakouts at all and i don&#x27;t have heavy breakouts. I&#x27;m so disappointed in wasting $59 on this crappy product.  I bought it based off of the so called great reviews but I don&#x27;t see how people are rating this crap so highly. If its not working for someone with normal breakouts... I don&#x27;t see how this would work for some one with acne problems. Two thumbs down!</li>
    <li> So I am a teenager who has pimples here and there around my face and forehead. I have tried a lot of products and have finally decided to try at exposed. I have seen the accusations of people making false reviews so I decided to give a completely honest review with weekly updates. I will be using the product once in the morning and once at night as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1- Week 1 started on January 6th and ended on January 13th. The products were not too harsh on my skin. People complain about dry skin but I felt no problems. I have taken pictures and compared them and noticed my pimples were still noticeable, and have yet to go away. My skin is softer though in case any one is looking for softer skin. I was not expecting too much out of just one week, but as I continue to update my review, I hope to have clearer skin by the end of the month if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2- So it&#x27;s time for the update, week 2 was from January 14th to January 20th and I have seen much better results finally. I use to have a high concentration of acne at the side of my forehead but now it has significantly reduced. I am hoping that within the next two weeks it will be completely gone but we will see. My skin continues to stay shiny and vibrant, the breakouts are less often, and my self esteem is getting much better about it. I also would like for it to get rid of my black heads around my nose but I&#x27;m not sure if it will, I will keep you updated on it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Month 8- Now that I have tried out Exposed for this long, I must say that it sort of, kind of, works, if you know what I mean. I can say that it really makes your skin clean, clears your pores, and makes your skin vibrant. As far as getting rid of acne, it is no miracle treatment. The truth is, you&#x27;re going to have acne whether you use this or not. If you want to buy this, buy it to improve your skin, not to cure your acne.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit about six months ago and have used it religiously since! I will not go a day without it. I am a female of about 20 years of age and have always struggled with acne. I have tried all the products you can think of (Proactiv, different Clean and Clear lines, Neutrogena, different topical and oral medications prescribed by my dermatologist and regular family doctor) and Exposed is the FIRST product that I have ever received GOOD and LASTING results almost immediately. I would recommend it to anyone! The only downside I can think of is the fact that you must order it online and it takes at least a week or so to get to you, and I can never seem to make the face wash last until the next month&#x27;s shipment (you can buy individual bottles whenever though so I just stock up). Otherwise, GREAT PRODUCT and worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I have been struggling with adult acne starting in my early 20&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve tried lots of topical treatments, face washes, and even tried some natural remedies to try to get it under control. I started the Exposed Skincare line with the basic kit last year and have seen significant improvements in my skin ever since! My skin has been clear and not too dry or too oily since using this product. I really like that it is a blend of natural ingredients (i.e. licorice root, green tea extract, and tea tree oil) as well as the salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. My skin has responded very well to these ingredients in these products and I am finally enjoying clear skin on a regular basis! I would recommend this skincare line to anyone struggling with acne as I have found it tremendously helpful.[[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
    <li> this product is amazing. I have used exposed for 2 years now and I think its the best product out there. way better then proactive. You have to use it everyday to keep a healthy and pimple free look but its worth it. I love this product and wouldnt buy anything else.</li>
    <li> It feels good to use. Does not hurt my skin. Great for taking care of acne that is minimal-moderate in severeness. I would recommend this over proactiv.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have had spurts with battling acne.  I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of products and gave many of them plenty of time to see results.  It always broke my bank account but I was determined to find something that worked for me.  Even the products my dermatologist recommended and expensive facials.  I have never been as happy with my clear skin as I am now! It only took until I was a middle aged mom to finally feel satisfied.  Exposed skin care has refreshed my skin and provided me with a younger and healthier glow.  It is easy to follow, extremely gentle on my skin and affordable.  I also used the Exposed Skin Care Mask.  My dermatologist noticed at my previous appointment and asked me what product I was using.  There is no better compliment than from an expert in the field.  I plan to stick with Exposed Skin Care and am very comfortable recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading the reviews.  But found that it did absolutely nothing for my acne.. I know that it says to give it a while and that you will break out before it gets better.. It has been over a month and I have seen no difference in my acne other than more break outs.  So unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased the first kit for my younger child. She had been using benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid products that had worked in the beginning but then stopped.  Within approximately a week, we saw improvement with the Exposed products.  The kit is still working after five months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another kit for my older child.  We saw improvement after a few weeks.  There were also  patches of dry skin in a couple of areas so we had to take a break for a few days.  Applying the Exposed moisturizer helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exposed products are definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> My daughter had problem skin, we tried several acne remedies from the store, then proactive for several months with no results from any of these, I ordered her exposed acne treatment and right away she had great results  people started noticing. Now she is almost completely clear with only a few outbreaks occasionally! Thank you Exposed skin care!</li>
    <li> There are so many insanely expensive products out there. And with all the choices of different washes, different tonics, different, serums....There are too many options and I don&#x27;t have the time or the money to experiment with countless brands. I was getting really frustrated with my skin and nothing was helping. I did a TON of research and saw Exposed coming up really frequently as one of the best lines out there. I can honestly say I am so pleased with these products. The system works well as a whole, and each individual component does the work it is supposed to. The active ingredients are exactly what should be used to fight acne, but the great part is it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like crazy because of all the other good stuff that works to moisturize and improve the quality of your skin. I will not be experimenting with any more acne products lines. There is not miracle product out there, and I am not claiming that Exposed is one either. But it has been by far the best acne system I have used.</li>
    <li> This treatment is wonderful! it works fast and leaves skin feeling clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> No effect at all, big waste of money. I had high hopes too.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Made me break out even more, followed all instructions from the pamphlet. Did not work!</li>
    <li> I am only one week into this regimen and the difference is remarkable already. I have tried other systems and this one is gentle, yet effective. Trust me, I was skeptical as many other products I have tried have failed. I hope it continues to work well and be my own personal miracle cure for this stubborn hormonal acne!</li>
    <li> I had beautiful skin until I was a senior in high school. Then, I begin to have really bad acne and tried every product on the market. I visited a dermatologist and tried over the counter medicine as well. I have VERY sensitive skin so I always had to be careful what I chose. I happened upon Exposed Skin Care after Googling the best reviews and decided to give it a try. I bought the starter kit with the cleanser, toner, acne treatment, clear pore serum, and moisturizer. I also started taking the probiotic and WOW!! The results I have from this product are better than I have ever seen before.  The price is kind of high but they last a good amount of time, they offer coupons and special deals, and you can buy any product individually if you use one faster than the others. I recommend this product to anyone that knows me because they know how much I struggled before and now I have the pretty skin that I used to have.</li>
    <li> Have used proactive for years and ended up with the worst breakout off all time so i switched to exposed skin care and literally have perfectly clear skin in two months with no breakouts! I get compliments constantly and could not be happier</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cleansing system ever. This is the only thing that works for me. I still have breakouts but that is because i just have really bad skin.The acne gel gets rid of that with no problem tho its completely gone within two days. i am a female i will have breakouts certain times of the month but they are nothing like they were. I use to get welts thats how bad my acne was now it just a regular lil pimple when i get one. i would recommend this to everyone. My daughter gets breakouts on her back and she puts this on and two days later her back is almost completely cleared.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have ordered this, my 1st order was in March 2014. This is supposed to be a 1 month kit but it has lasted me much longer. This works very well if you use it at least once a day, although the directions say to use it twice a day. I find that my skin gets too dry if I use it twice a day so I just use a milder cleanser at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price may seem steep but it is worth it. Especially since it lasts much longer than just one month.</li>
    <li> I am a 25 year old academic advisor at a small college in chilly Western, NY. Since I was 10, I&#x27;ve always had acne to some degree, but the last year has been terrible (by my own standards). It could be the pressure of my first job out of grad school, planning a wedding, pressure to have kids like yesterday, and buying a house, but I refused to have pimples all over my chin on my wedding day (7 months from now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost 2 months ago I took the plunge and bought Exposed&#x27;s Basic Kit after trying everything over the counter since I hit puberty. I will never buy anything else again! Exposed has completely cleared my skin without the &amp;#34;getting worse before it gets better&amp;#34; side effect. My chin and neck are a little itchy, but nothing severe by any means. The kit is easy to use and since everything is used sparingly it lasts for ever. I am about half way through this kit and have ordered the extended kit with the moisturizer (since it&#x27;s only $10 more and I&#x27;d like to try it). I have normal skin (not oily or super dry) so this product hasn&#x27;t done anything to my skin but clear the acne which I&#x27;m so thankful for!&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve never used proactive, but all my friends have and they have not had results like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PURCHASING NOTE: If you are skeptical, buy from the official website because they will refund your first kit in full if it doesn&#x27;t work for you. It is about the same price as Amazon, so if you&#x27;re going to take the plunge, cover yourself with the refund policy of the manufacturer. Now that I know this works for me I can buy from Amazon which I like. Be aware of the subscription that the Exposed website enrolls you in automatically. If you don&#x27;t log back on after ordering to cancel your subscription it will charge your card/account every 60 days and send you a new supply. This is fine if you know you want the same product and need it after 60 days. I&#x27;ll probably be good for another month at least, so I unsubscribed (plus I&#x27;m always short on money and need to plan ahead for a $50-60 purchase).</li>
    <li> I have tried Everything to help clear up my acne. Prescription, over the counter; nothing worked until I found Exposed. My biggest problem is my nose. Every pore was visible, but Exposed help get ride of the black heads that I had been fighting for years. The fact that they use both salicylic and benzoyl peroxide, means that my face is truly getting the deep clean I need.</li>
    <li> It accomplishes what it sets out to. It&#x27;s about the same as Proactiv&#x27;s system but the problem is it is twice as expensive.</li>
    <li> I used to have mild to the occasional severe breakouts. I tried just about everything from proactive to this crazy all apples and enema fast thing... DON&#x27;T DO IT!! You&#x27;ll never look at apples the same! I even tried a powerful prescription medication that was later banned 😳😳!! Anyhow, it&#x27;s no secret how to get clear skin, eat healthy, drink ALOT of water, and use a quality topical system like Exposed.</li>
    <li> After trying almost everything, even prescription, we finally found something that works. Way better than pro activ. Saw a huge difference after a week. Was worse at first, they said that would happen, then all clear. We will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> SCAM!!! I believe the following email I sent their customer service department succinctly proves my point,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Exposed Skin Care Customer Service,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 13th you charged my credit card in the amount of $66.90, without my consent. I have alerted my credit card company of the fraudulent charge. I did not elect auto renewing service at the time of my purchase, nor did I wish to purchase additional products from you. You will dis enroll me from your &amp;#34;membership&amp;#34; plan immediately, as well as supply me with the form to receive my money back for my original purchase; as I found the products were ineffective. I will also require the address to return the unordered products for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally after calling your customer care number and being directed to an empty message system which automatically disconnects the call, and selecting your &amp;#34;Customer Care&amp;#34; link on the web page; which redirects you to the regular home page, I assume you are purposely evasive. The only reason to evade your customers would be if you knew you were selling a subpar product. If you continue to avoid my requests for dis enrollment and a refund I will lodge a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, as well as have my credit card company pursue the charge as theft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be expecting a reply imminently with further instructions. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away!!!!!! They have yet to acknowledge my email or attempts to contact them!!! The products themselves will make your skin look nicer and more even, but it does nothing to heal acne. I still have just as many breakouts as I did before, And for $67.00 I need more than just nicer, but still broken out, skin. I ordered the kit initially from Amazon and then 2 months later was automatically charged for another kit and sent a product I didn&#x27;t order. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
    <li> I ordered directly through the Exposed site so this is not a review for Amazon&#x27;s customer service but I will share a review for the products itself.  My child went through the gambit of products both OTC and prescription medicines for teen acne and nothing helped. It was bad acne too. some would help while on it but then when off the meds, acne would come back. When I say everything I mean pretty much all the ones you see in the aisles then we went to prescriptions like Epi-duo and other antibacterial creams and pills and even the serious meds that had me sign a booklet of waivers but nada.  Then I was just randomly searching the web and found Exposed. Because it is a combination of some natural remedies, I thought why not? can&#x27;t hurt at this point.  OMG! it worked!! just around 30 days of using it, face cleared up. She still has some redness but that is so ok compared to before. very happy with the product.  The company&#x27;s site is also great on their customer service, quick, helpful and was easy to order it.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT this made my skin break out and I had a horrible skin reaction to this product. I read all those positive reviews and saw those youtube videos that praised this product but I just fell as a victim to this product and now my skin is worse then ever. Before using this product please ask your doctor because this product could seriously mess up your face. After I stopped using this product my skin improved but it took me a whole week for my face to die down because I had red itchy bumps all over my face. Trust me those reviews are probably fske think about this product at first sounded too good to be true and now I know after using this that this is probably a scam. I&#x27;ve never had skin reactions like this before and my skin is not sensitive. My skin wasn&#x27;t even like this when using proactive. Save your money and look for a different product or ask your doctor before using this because you will seriously mess up your skin</li>
    <li> I have horrible acne, and have used everything, including prescriptions. This did nothing for me. I should have stuck with Proactiv!</li>
    <li> So... In July it will be a year that I have used these amazing products.. I was very skeptical at first because like every other acne product out there.. It promised me results. Now, let me say that I do suffer from acne, cystic acne to be exact. And although it&#x27;s a slight problem (I have them pretty much under control and they occasionally appear) What I suffer from the most and is my MAJOR problem are the red/purple marks that the cystic acne leaves behind. These marks were so bad that I would never leave the house without Makeup! Completely destroyed my self confidence. I have tried everything. &amp; When I say I have tried EVERYTHING. I mean it... I have tried EVERYTHING! Proactive, Retin - A, Benzoil Peroxide, Murad, Paula&#x27;s Choice (amazing products, just didn&#x27;t work for me), Chemical peels, Neutrogena, The Regimen from acne.org, Michael Todd&#x27;s Light Therapy, seriously.. The list goes on and on.. And I can honestly say that nothing has worked on my red marks as much as these little gems! I was skeptical because some of the reviews claim to be &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;. Well listen here, I am certainly no fake and although my marks are not completely gone. They have faded dramatically by 80%! I&#x27;m confident that within a year of using these products my face will be healed! I recommend these products to everyone. Out of all the products I have used none were as gentle on my skin as EXPOSED. Great products! Definitely worth a shot. &amp; remember, give it time. Your skin needs proper time to recover and heal.</li>
    <li> Exposed Skin Care was the best solution to my acne problems that I had been battling during my younger years, and trust me I&#x27;ve shed many tears over it. I&#x27;ve tried several different products in the past - drugstore and prescription products - and Exposed Skin Care is by far the most gentle and most effective acne-fighting product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years now. I also love how reasonable the prices are for all the products. The package deal is even better. I highly recommend this product to anyone whose frustration level has reached the roof on acne problems.</li>
    <li> I used to get sporadic acne that would leave my skin looking less than perfect.  About 8 months ago, I started used Exposed Acne Treatment, it was a miracle.  I had tried every other acne product (Proactive and kits from the local drug store), but nothing worked the way Exposed does.  I haven&#x27;t had a single break out since I started.  Additionally, the products do not smell like medicine and they are extremely gentle.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and have mild adult acne.  The product, like some other negative reviews here, did not clear up my acne and in fact seemed to make it worse.  I did try the product for 1.5 months before giving up on it.  I am returning the product for a full refund minus shipping and handling.  I hope the return goes smoothly, but if it doesn&#x27;t, I will add to this review letting others know.</li>
    <li> This treatment kit is AWESOME! I have used a few different treatment kits before (Murad &amp; Proactive) and have found that Exposed sincerely has the best results. Other treatment kits I have used would work at first, but after a given amount of time, my skin would either get used to it or suddenly react to it in a negative way. With Exposed, I have been using it for quite some time and haven&#x27;t had a problem. At FIRST I thought it was making my skin dry; however, I think I wasn&#x27;t used to the non-oily after effect that I&#x27;m used to with other products. It only took about a week and half for the product to noticeably start to work for me. Everything in this basic kit does not need to be used in excess to work, which is great because one bottle of each product lasts a few months, believe it or not, and it is still effective. The cleanser is very clean feeling, especially with the derma-cloth afterwards. The Clearing Tonic really removes anything left that the cleanser didn&#x27;t get the first time around while the Acne Treatment Serum I use in the mornings is very light weight and can be used at night as a spot corrector. The Clear Pore Serum I use before bed after the first two products and leaves my face feeling clean in the morning when I wake up, not oily like other nightly products. All in all, Exposed is the real deal and I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> My daughter is fourteen and she was breaking out on the forehead and both sides of her face. Tried every product in the store Neutrogena, Clearasil, Oxy wash, etc.  I looked online and was considering ordering Proactive and saw a website about skincare and it said Exposed Skin was a better product to use.  Never heard of the product and I thought I would let her try it since it had a 100% money back guaranteed. Since my daughter has been using the product (December 2012) her forehead and left side of face has completely cleared the right side she still has some blemish but not like it was before she started using Exposed.  She washes her face twice daily and during the day she is using a light concealer for the few blemishes and for a teenager her complexion looks great!</li>
    <li> I have been using Exposed for about 2 years now.  It&#x27;s the best acne product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I think the Clear Pore Serum may be the key to this product working so well.  If I haven&#x27;t been using the system consistently, I can always count on the Clear Pore Serum.  I deal with all the white heads I have, then wash with the Facial Cleanser and apply the Clear Pore Serum.  In the morning, all my blemishes have shrunk, and I&#x27;m already looking great.  Over Night!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to write a review (because I am lazy), but it pissed me off seeing people rating this product so low. I have severe acne and I have tried many different products for over 4 years. Needless to say, nothing ever worked, except for one which came close for a while (neutrogena). Anyway, I had little hope when I bought this product from its main website after reading many review online (49.99 + free s/h). For the entire first two weeks, it did not work. Yes, it did not work on my face for a whole two weeks. But since it costed me $50, I decided to keep on using it (as nothing ever worked for me anyway). Two months later, my friends asked me what products I was using!&lt;br /&gt;This is not a product for people who are impatient or can&#x27;t follow direction. Don&#x27;t eat too much dairy. Change your pillows every few days. Drink plenty of water. Wash off your sweat. Do not touch your face with bare hand. Etc.&lt;br /&gt;Follow all of the above for at least two months (1 kit), then shout in my face if it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Once again, for heaven sake, follow the directions before dumping this product.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;p/s: This product has given me back my confidence and saved my freaking face.</li>
    <li> I love this treatment kit. I see some people posted they saw no results in 2 weeks. I will say it did take some time to see improvement, about a month, but I am so pleased with the results. People need to understand it takes time for any treatment to begin working, it didn&#x27;t take just 2 weeks for the acne to become bad. Beginning this skin care regimen was the smartest decision I ever made.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has tried every product out there for her acne and finally, we found Exposed Skin Care.  It has completely cleared her face up and shes no longer embarrassed about her acne because its gone!  Amazing products![[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
    <li> I have had mild acne since I was a teenager.  I recently tuned 30 and out of no where I&#x27;ve started getting horrible cystic acne on my chin.  I have always used ProActive, and since my acne was never severe, it seemed to to the trick just fine.  But since getting this cystic acne, ProActive hasn&#x27;t helped at all.  I found Exposed when looking up new alternatives online and made the purchase.  I cannot believe how much my skin has improved from this line!!  It&#x27;s not harsh on your skin at all and it&#x27;s really hard to pick just one favorite product, because they all seem to be equally as great.  But, I am particularly fond of the moisture complex- It totally moisturizes, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, and feels weightless on your skin.  I also am a big fan of the Probiotic Complex capsules.  I credit a lot of my clearing up to these, as I feel like my body is getting healthy from the inside out.  Exposed is amazing and has been a huge life changer for my skin!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a much better product than Proactiv.  My daughter has been using it for a few months now and her acne has greatly improved.  The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it five stars is because her skin isn&#x27;t yet perfect, but it is the best it&#x27;s been for over a year.  If you have moderate to severe acne, certainly give this a try.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different acne products in the past including prescription from the dermatologist, this product definitely worked the best. I bought the basic kit and the products lasted me longer than a month. My acne did clear up however this did dry my skin out quite a bit, they do offer a moisturizer though, which I did not try, I would recommend maybe trying this too. I liked all the products, however sometimes I think the clear pore serum clogged my pores so I did not use that everyday. Overall, this product was the most promising I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that is easy to use and comes with all the basic items you need to get great results, the little towel is awesome and you get a fresh one with each order. Glad I stumbled accorss this product has been a life saver.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great skin care system.  My skin feels so healthy and has stayed clear for the past 3 years that I&#x27;ve used it.  I highly recommend that you give it a try![[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
    <li> I have suffered with acne since I was in 3rd grade. I have tried more products than I can remember including Proactive, Accutane, tetracycline, and as many home remedies as I can find. At last here is something that works for me!! I&#x27;ve never written a review but felt compelled to do so based on my results. I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Skin Care for about 6 months and currently have the clearest skin I&#x27;ve ever had. I have recently been able to go out of my house without foundation which for me is truly amazing. I feel great about my skin for the first time in my life - too bad its taken is long. Would&#x27;ve been nice in my twenties.....</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne for 6 years, and I am now 25. I came across Exposed after no luck with Proactive, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Neutrogena, Clearasil, dermatologist&#x27;s creams and pills... and I figured another $60 would be a worthy investment considering all that I had already spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut out gluten, cut down on sugar, dairy, and starches, increased my water intake and followed the Exposed instructions religiously. Within 2 weeks my skin made an 80% improvement, and by week 4 my skin was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year after using Exposed I thought I could do without it. Let me tell you I WAS WRONG. My skin broke out worse than ever 4 weeks before my wedding. Exposed had worked for me in the past and I figured it would work again. Within 3 weeks my skin had cleared up completely again, just in time for my wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear by Exposed. I will use this until the end of time if I have to. It has been a miracle for me. To get the best results from Exposed you have to USE the product as instructed, and follow the tips included in the quick start guide.</li>
    <li> I used this product as often as it says you should and I would use the serums and Id find my skin to be very sticky and greasy for long after using the product. Plus, I didnt really see any results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old andI just bought my second kit after 60 days, so i think I&#x27;m ready to leave my review. My skin suffered a lot 18-22. It just left me with big pores occasional pimples and a lot of blackheads. I did proactiv, and beside burning my skin off it just made my skin red and ugly. I randomly came across exposed when i googled SENSITIVE SKIN ACNE SOLUTIONS. I ordered the $100 kit, but it was so worth it. My skin got red for like the first three days, then it was like most of my blemishes blackheads and uneven skin tone got flushed out. I didn&#x27;t expericne dry skin, although I&#x27;ve seen some people have, I guess I got lucky. I noticed like actual results in less than 2 weeks. It&#x27;s been 2 months now and my skin looks so good, I still have a few minor black heads,but have not broken out in like a month and a half. And my skin doesn&#x27;t turn tomato red when I touch it or walk outside. Another great thing I noticed is my skin doesn&#x27;t look like a bucket of grease was thrown on it anymore. Some oil is natural, and I get that. At the end of my day my skin still looks so good. I 100% recommend it. I also bought a clarisonic and use that with the facial cleanser 3 times a week. Ok one weird thing, the clear pore gel serum seriously smells like a whopper from Burger King haha. So watch out for that.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon but wanted to write a review since I find them so helpful!  I have been so happy with this product!  I am 30 years old and have struggled with pretty constant breakouts for most of my 20&#x27;s.  Once I started having babies, it seemed that nothing I used/did made a difference.  I am about 5 months into using the basic kit - within 5 weeks my regular breakouts had cleared up and new ones stopped occurring (other than the occasional tiny zit), and at this point I still have nice clear skin that is only getting clearer as my scars fade and are not constantly replaced with new ones.  Using a LOT less concealer &amp; lighter makeup these days!  So happy I tried it!</li>
    <li> I was happy to get to try this 60 Days to Clearer Skin with Exposed Skincare. The steps are pretty easy to follow.  I like the cleanser because it does not over dry my face. Some I have tried have been so harsh that they really dry out my skin.  The tonic absorbs quickly and does not leave my skin feeling sticky.  I like that it makes my skin feel refreshed. I like the serums because they keep the new acne from starting and its nice to apply at night.  The cloth is one of the best cloths I have ever used.  It is really nice and it works very well with this skincare system. It is a program you need to stick to and follow daily. I really like that this works to clear my skin without being too harsh. So far so good! I like what it is doing for my skin and I am going to continue to use it. I received this product in exchange for a review. I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.</li>
    <li> I tried numerous treatments, none worked. I was skeptical about EC when I read the reviews but gave it try. It&#x27;s amazing, my skin is clearer and improving all the time. I&#x27;d recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I tried every product out there for my son from tablets from the doctor  to every wash out there and nothing worked. I saw this product and it guaranteed to clear his skin.  Im in the uk and had to send to america.For it. Which made it more expensive  but It did clear his skin and now his skin looks great  So to me it was worth every penny&lt;br /&gt;  beware  thou This product will ruin any towel it touches</li>
    <li> Life savor ! Seriously worked for me ! I suffered with acne for years until I finally stumble across this . Till this day I still use it and my face its cleared !</li>
    <li> We have two daughters who have tried countless acne products and were treated by a dermatologist to help clear their acne as well.  It seemed like each product promised results, but we saw very little.  Struck by the reviews for Exposed, I decided to buy it.  I started it with one daughter and the results were almost immediate!  Not only did the acne begin to clear up, but her skin was so much more healthy.  And, she loved how it felt.  Then, the second daughter tried it and also loved it.  They have two different issues but it worked on both!  We are sold and it&#x27;s the only skin care system we will use.  And, their customer service is fantastic!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son. My son realized that the acne treatment serum was not in the box. Disappointed</li>
    <li> My grandson used the product for only a few days.  He broke out in a fine rash all over his face.  Clearly he is allergic to something in the cleanser.  If you have sensitive skin, this may be an issue for you.  He&#x27;s &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; and fair skinned.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find the tube of moisturizer and haven&#x27;t been about to return it yet to the company to see if I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and I can&#x27;t wait to see more results!</li>
    <li> I have tried several different acne treatment systems and this one seems to work the best for me. After a disappointing experience with Proactiv, I decided to order the Exposed Acne Treatment kit. It controls my acne really well and does not dry out my skin like other similar products. I&#x27;ve been using it for six months and have not had any breakouts, which is really amazing for me. My only problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t control the oil on my face as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product for my daughter, who has a moderate case of acne. She tried different products and not much had worked for her. I have read reviews about this treatment and was hopeful .. Unfortunately, it did not work great. The product had dry up the skin severely, and was not overall improving the appearance of the skin. I did have a great experience while returning the product. Amazon had been great in processing the refund.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Exposes Skin Care treatment for about 5 months now and all I can say is wow (and no I am not exaggerating) unfortunately like a lot of people out there I suffer from Acne, I have no control over Acne and despite what I do or eat Mr and Mrs Pimple always seem to form at the wrong time, I have gone from Over the counter (OTC) products to antibiotics and still no luck, considering we live in this day and age there is still no cute for something as small as Acne but the good news is there is a product that is the closest thing I have experienced to a cure and that is Exposed Sin Care, this is such a great product, my face is ten times more clearer, my face glows and my confidence is just booming. I urgly recommend ANYONE with Acne to give this a shot, this will do such a great job as it is Science and Natural ingredients combined, I normally just prefer scientific products as Natural products I find them to be very slow or the usual saying \\&quot;it gets worst before getting better\\&quot; now as an Acne sufferer I can pretty much say this on behalf of every other suffer that WE are not patient and hate that saying as we don&#x27;t want to break out, Exposed Skin care gas not done this and from week 1 my Skin was amazing, the Customer Service team is one of a kind, their services are really great and if I could say one thing the only thing I can say is this......... BUY IT!!!! :D</li>
    <li> Exposed worked great for me! It cleared up my skin really fast and left my skin nice and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 months now and I love it!</li>
    <li> After reading so many excellent reviews about this product on Amazon and other places I was enthusiastic about trying Exposed! I am 25 years old and still have moderate acne. I have tried Proactive, Skin I.D., Clean and Clear&#x27;s advanced kit, Clinique Skin Care kit for acne, and was willing to try a new product that received so many rave reviews. However I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and decided to purchase the 30 day trial kit. This kit worked wonders, I could see a vast improvement in those 30 days. I also could tell by the smell that it was the same facial wash, toner, etc. that the spa where I once received microdermabrasion used...so it must be a great product! Or so I thought, until I ordered my first basic kit. When I opened the bottles to wash my face the first thing that I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t have the same smell as the 30 trial kit. None of the products smelled the same which leads me to believe that they must water down the bigger bottles of the products, which would also explain why they stopped working. I would recommend using the basic kit first to see if it works rather than wasting your 30 trial return period on the small bottles that contain stronger products.</li>
    <li> Did wonders for my 17 year old&#x27;s acne.  Once he started using the products, his skin has cleared up and it&#x27;s the clearest it&#x27;s been since he began to experience break outs.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with acne on and off for years. I thought it would be a thing of the past when I became an adult but I guess not. I tried all acne products from neutrogena to Proactiv but nothing worked. I have been using exposed for 4 years now and my face has been clear since then.  Today I decided to post a review since one of my students asked me \\&quot;How do you keep your face so clean?\\&quot; to which I replied \\&quot;I wash it\\&quot; lol but she said \\&quot;No I mean with no pimples\\&quot; and I told her about exposed.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. helped with my skin problems. I didn&#x27;t have to sign up a contract where they keep sending this stuff every couple months..unlike pro active. I can buy it whenever I need it and that&#x27;s why I chose this over pro active! pretty good price too</li>
</ol>
