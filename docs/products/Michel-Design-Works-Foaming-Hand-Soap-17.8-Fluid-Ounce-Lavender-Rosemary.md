      <li>YOU ARE GETTING A BETTER QUALITY SOAP FOR YOUR HANDS.&lt;br /&gt;IS</li>
      <li>We love all of the foaming soaps in this collection.</li>

      <li>Lavender Rosemary is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I would not pay more than $10-11 for this soap.  </li>

      <li>the packaging is lovely.  </li>
      <li>Excellent foamy soap dispenser, it lasts for a long period because of the foamy nature of the product.</li>
      <li>YOU ENJOY PAYING MORE AND CHANGING SOAP MORE OFTEN???</li>
      <li>This was received on time, well packaged and has the most pleasant fragrance, light works quite well am very pleased with this product and have already ordered in other fragrances</li>
      <li>Smells great, gentle on hands, and pretty sitting out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfect little gift for friends.</li>
      <li>I think you will agree, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Clean, yet moisturizing and I have eczema.  </li>
      <li>Thick, rich and delightfully fragrant.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and gentle on the hands.</li>
      <li>Thanks for such an amazing product!</li>
      <li>Seems pricey, but in the end I get many more hand washings from a single container vs method foam bottles, so I call it a wash.  </li>
      <li>IT WORTH IT</li>
      <li>but also I have eczema and this soap is very gentle on my hands - so no burning/stinging</li>
      <li>and I also love the container because it matches my powder room decor, I will definitely purchase again!</li>
      <li>THE EXPENSE OF USING SOMETHING THAT WILL BE MORE EXPENSE IN THE LONG RUN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as harsh on hands as other foaming soap and smells wonderful.  </li>
      <li>This is a large container with nice-smelling soap.  </li>
      <li>AS MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO REFILLING</li>
      <li>It leaves my hands soft, smells lovely, and because of the foam you only use what you need.</li>
      <li>I would rather pay a little more for a high quality product!  </li>
      <li>This is my third purchase from this company (all different scents) and I love them all.</li>
      <li>I ordered several other Michel Design Works as well, and I have enjoyed them all except for one thing--the pump points to the far right on some of the soaps I ordered.</li>
      <li>WOW MICHEL DESIGN WORKS</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m normally not the person who spends money on special soap - especially non-refillable soap like this.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey for hand soap, but there&#x27;s no waste like with regular liquid hand soap.  </li>
