<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was super excited to try this nail polish out because there were so many good reviews out around the time I purchased it. Initially, it was great. It goes on and turns my nail color matte. Awesome. But it doesn&#x27;t stay matte. I expected a flat or even sort of an egg shell finish but it ended up being pretty satin-like. It also, for whatever reason, makes the nail polish chip easier, even if I used a quality base, color, and top coat before applying. I will have to continue my search to find a truly matte finisher. I purchased one by Butter London but have yet to try it. Fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it&#x27;s cool. Even changes sparkly or shiny polish into matte. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> This matte finish top coat is totally awesome and looks really cool.  It does kind of wear off quickly but it is so easy to just reapply the top coat after a few days because this stuff dries really really fast!  What worked best for me was to do a regular manicure with the shiny clear top coat and then once that is completely dry I put the matte finish on.  That way my nails don&#x27;t chip as quickly!</li>
    <li> This topcoat is great. It has doubled my nail polish collection since I now have a matte version of every color.</li>
    <li> This is great and does exactly what it advertises.  I love being able to make any of my nail polishes matte! As another reviewer mentioned it does wear off after a couple days, so plan on reapplying it to keep the lovely matte finish.</li>
    <li> Love this! Turns any nail polish to matte finish!</li>
    <li> So glad this is back in style...not eveyone wants the shiny glossy look on your nails all the time. Nice alternative and it doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
    <li> Before buying this matte coat I read the reviews and I almost shyed away from buying it because everyone was saying how easily it chips off so fast. But after reading more reviews people said to put a top coat on too then the matte coat. It was only $3.00 at the time so I figured why not give it a try. It came quick and I tried it right away. Painted my nails black, added a top coat, then the matte coat and it dried very quick! Could tell it was matte right away. So happy I purchased this!</li>
    <li> I love it  Exactly what I was expecting.  Great!  I recommend getting this!  Essie is the best nail polish brand!</li>
    <li> I love the matte nail color look, and I&#x27;ve been waiting patiently for the mail to arrive with this! It&#x27;s the perfect matte top coat, I just used it on my chinaglaze nail color and it turned out beautifully!</li>
    <li> Turns dark colors a lovely matte, gun metal finish.  It seems to wear off after a few days but another coat remedies the issue.  I love the different look it gives my nails.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Makes any polish into a matte, even glitter.  Pretty cool effect.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I was almost hesitant to purchase this product, but I&#x27;m glad I did. It was so much fun to turn all my other colors into matte finish. About four or five hours after the initial paint job, I hand washed dishes and I figured that would be the end to my good looking nails, but the polish held up! It didn&#x27;t chip until about two days later. Good enough for me!  As a side note, I used it only with better quality polish (OPI, Essie, and China Glaze). Maybe it doesn&#x27;t last as long on cheap polish?</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how much I love this polish! You can do so many different things with it. It stays on a long time and doesn&#x27;t start to fade away fast (and I am hard on my nails).&lt;br /&gt;When I get close to running out I will definately be buying this again.</li>
    <li> The Essie Matte is great! I ordered it and it is exactly as described! Makes any nail polish matte quickly.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for my essie matte finisher to come by the mail today &amp; once I got it I used it with the essie real red polish. Well in seconds, before your eyes it turned completely matte. Good side was you just need one bottle of essie matte finisher to turn any bright color completely matte. The down side was that it chips easily &amp; you need to do your manicure perfect so it won&#x27;t look all messy. This polish is not forgiving.</li>
    <li> I uses it on the top, and it&#x27;s really interesting to see the difference before you use it and after. Nice product.</li>
    <li> It worked exactly like I expected it to. I have always preferred a matte finish than a shiny one, so I was pretty excited when I discovered that you could mattifying nail polish! It took me awhile to try this after finding out that it existed, but I love it. I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run out of this one.</li>
    <li> I love this polish! Unlike other matte topcoats I&#x27;ve tried, it actually works and looks just like a matte nailpolish would&#x27;ve looked. It does tend to chip pretty quickly, but perhaps applying a new coat each day will help with that.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. In regards to the reviews that say it chips...this isn&#x27;t a top coat, so i use an OPI clear top coat after i paint my original color. if you do color, matte, top coat then then it undo&#x27;s the matte.</li>
    <li> I love that I can have a flat nail color or nude nails with strengthener without having such a glossy finish.</li>
    <li> So you use this product as a top coat and it goes on easily over any nail polish which is lovley. I really like the way it looks right after..sometimes I just get sick of shiney nails! Anyway, The first time i used it i only used one coat and by the end of the next day it was almost completely rubbed off and my nails were chipping. Granted, I wash my hands like a fiend but my nail polish ususally at least stays on 3 or 4 days before chipping. The next time I tried it I applied 2 coats and it lasted almost 2 days before it started to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fading wouldn&#x27;t really bother me except it doens&#x27;t fade evenly..it kind of leaves your nails looking half matte half shiny half chipped. Ill probably still use it but only for special occasions.</li>
    <li> I love it and it&#x27;s cheaper than in stores. Meets the matte expectation and my nail polish standards. I recommend</li>
    <li> This goes matte the second you put it on your nails. Not clunky, just a smooth finish. I&#x27;d def recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really streaky.  I&#x27;ve only tried it a couple of times, but I do a LOT with nail polish so I think it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s not just me.  It does make the polish underneath matte, but if it&#x27;s going to look blotchy, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, however, after a few days of normal activities, the matte finish wears off on the tips, making them shiny again. To maintain the matte finish, I needed to keep applying coats every two days.</li>
    <li> Great matte nail polish! Cheap, dries quickly and looks amazing! Once im done with my first bottle i wont hesitate to buy another! Very great formula! Love it</li>
    <li> Good product, I would buy it again. Worth the money and does its job. Not much else to say here.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I had tried a matte nailpolish and this stuff is amazing. You use it as a top coat which is great because then you dont have to commit to buying an entire bottle of matte nailpolish. You can turn any nail polish into matte no matter what brand it is. You only have to use a thin layer too on each nail so this bottle is going to last me a while! Way to go Essie!</li>
    <li> I love this so much. I&#x27;m wearing it right now over Bikini So Teeny nail color from Essie and I absolutely adore it. It&#x27;s a lot more fun than a basic shiny topcoat and it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully...leaves a cool matte finish! Looks better with certain colors...like solid colors. Not so great with the sheer colors or glitter/shimmer colors. I use this stuff often, I like the matte nail finish look.</li>
    <li> After trying [[ASIN:B0002RUM9U OPI Treatment, Matte Nail Envy, Natural Nail Strengthener]] and [[ASIN:B003ZT2JGG CND Super Matte Top Coat .33oz.]] and being disappointed, I am in L O V E with Matte About You. The top coat actually works and makes your nails matte, not a cloudy white like other products. You can see it instantly turn you nail matte. It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this polish, my one dislike is it chips easy but it makes each color a little different. I love it.</li>
    <li> Mattes out any and all brand polishes including gel! Use over top coat for a longer lasting Matte and make sure you cap.</li>
    <li> This surely makes any nail polish underneath appear matte. However, the look doesn&#x27;t last me more than two days. It becomes a little shiny after a while and ends up cracking and making lines on my nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this polish will illuminate any imperfections of the polish under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because it works well if applied well. It also dries fairly quickly and shows results right away.</li>
    <li> Great things come in little packages sometimes. Loved it! I&#x27;m so happy I finally got it! All matte everything! Lol...</li>
    <li> This is the best matte polish I&#x27;ve tried by far.  You use it as a top coat after you apply your color.  The color goes matte almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I got Essie&#x27;s \\&quot;Matte About You\\&quot; after picking up a black from China Glaze. I&#x27;ve long wondered about the product and finally decided to splurge at Ulta. I&#x27;m so happy I made that decision. I applied the polish as normal (which means I type at the computer while waiting for it to dry) and then applied the top coat. It&#x27;s so fascinating to watch the polish go from shiny to a real matte. It works really well and super quickly. I waited another minute or two and then went on with my day.  The \\&quot;matte\\&quot; effect lasted four or five days before it became what I think is more like a \\&quot;Satin\\&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t really a gloss and wasn&#x27;t quite matte anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more coat later and they looked as good as new! The polish and top coat really seem resistant to chipping, as I only just now (six days later) applied a quick touch up effect to the tips of my index fingers. China Glaze makes really long lasting colors and the matte coat just made it even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try this with another sparkly polish and while the effect worked, it definitely didn&#x27;t look very good. So, great product but it doesn&#x27;t look good on all types of polish!</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described. I love this stuff! It smooths any blemishes in the polish and dries quickly! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I feel like such a nerd, but this stuff is SO COOL!!  Just tried it for the first time, and you can see the polish change from glossy to matte as it dries!!  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This matte finish top coat looks great and dries really fast. Unlike what some of the other reviewers said, it didn&#x27;t wear off quickly for me. I used it with black, and it did the &amp;#34;dull shiny nail thing&amp;#34; only after a week. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with it chipping until after a week, either. Then again, I don&#x27;t regularly use hand lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this topcoat! It makes my whole collection of polish or polish strips double options! Instead of shiny, I can take this matte coat and change the texture and the visual impact of my nails. I love it! Dries quickly so you can see the results almost immediately.</li>
    <li> got it for my daughter, she loves it!!! Says that it gives a really good texture to the nail polish.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what its supposed to do.  Apply 1-2 coast and it turns your polish matte.  Looks great and possibly the best matte top coat Ive ever used.  On a downside, it doesn&#x27;t last.  Within 24 hours, the matte was no longer matte.  It was shiny again.  On top of that, it chipped, so easy.  I&#x27;ve been spoiled by OPI having my manis last for a week or more with  no chipping, so when I had chips the next day, I was very disappointed.  I was really looking forward to trying this after all the rave reviews I&#x27;ve read and was quickly let down.  I&#x27;ll be trying OPIs matte to see if that last any longer.  Giving a three star because it does matte very nicely, but does not last.</li>
    <li> I mostly bought this nail polish because of the price whereas at the drugstore it costs about 8.79 but I love it and I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this top coat. It works very well with any polish and dries quickly. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> The finish on this is beautiful, but apply quickly and liberally because it sets up quickly and any spots you miss will be pretty glaring. Don&#x27;t expect this to last through workouts or housework, but while it does seem to fade fast, it&#x27;s also fast to reapply. Works just as well with other brands as it does with Essie.</li>
    <li> i was afraid of knockoffs but its perfect awesome color it is true to its pictre and totraly worth the money vs in store here paying 8-10 a bottle!</li>
    <li> This works well to provide a nice matte finish. Dries fairly quickly too. Worth buying if you want a matte finish.</li>
    <li> I really like this - I use it in between coats of polish to get rid of streaks and keep it even. I use less polish that way and it dries faster. I&#x27;m not really into matte nails, but this works for other things too.</li>
    <li> It works! I can mattify any nail polish. It just takes one quick coat. Let the first nail polish dry first though, or you&#x27;ll just paint it right off. Not all nail polishes look good in matte, let me tell you!</li>
    <li> It never dries completely or doesn&#x27;t let the polish underneath dry or something. It just stayed gummy and gluey and then it peeled my polish off when I hit something hours later. I like Essie products but not this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so awesome. It does what it says and although it only lasts a couple of days, it looks great after the initial application. I&#x27;ve tried it on several colors and it actually changes the appearance of all shades as I wanted. It&#x27;s allowed me to reuse some of my old polishes that I really didn&#x27;t like and transform them into beautiful matte colors. I really wish they could increase the life of it but for what it does, I can totally overlook that. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Does the trick - makes your nail polish nice and matte</li>
    <li> I love using this matte lacquer. It adds instant class and subtly to ANY color. It applies really well and has lasted me a while. The shipping was relatively quick and it was packaged properly.</li>
    <li> This is the first matte coat polish ive ever tried and it works awesome. It lasts a very long time and I do my nails every week. The only weird thing was that the more I used it, I would notice small white chunks that would dry on my nails and I would have to paint over it a bit. (Not sure what it is because it hasn&#x27;t gotten chunky or anything)</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to buy this product for a while but didnt want to spend $12.00 at my local store.  I found it here for a fraction of the cost with shipping and was very happy!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT .i ordered it a couple months ago and i still have it , too bad i cant do my nails bc work.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical of buying this since Essie polish is $8-$10 a bottle but i figered at less then $2 if it wasn&#x27;t right it wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal, I was stoked when it arrived and was exactly what I wanted at a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery !!! Everything was perfect!!! Zhang You</li>
    <li> I really like this top coat but because of it&#x27;s chalky texture it peels rather quickly. It was the first matte coat I tried but will probably try other brands before buying this again.</li>
    <li> makes everything any anything truly matte- put it on all sorts of colors and they all come out fantastic. I&#x27;ve used it a crazy amount of times and still have plenty, definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> The matte has the look I wanted but it rubs off in just a couple of days.  Reapplying works without making the overall polish looking too bulky but in the end, I&#x27;ll use more polish and therefore more $.  I think I&#x27;ll have to go back to mixing cornstarch and clear top coat once I&#x27;ve used the rest of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with other reviewers that it&#x27;s great when you first apply it but after a few days the matte effect fades. My nail Polish did not chip so that was good.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed is that the actual bottle of Polish is SLIGHTY different from ones at the store, so I have to question if it is real. It could be fake but for 6$ I can&#x27;t really complain to much</li>
    <li> This product came in a timely manner. I love the way it looks I just have to use it a few more time to see which nail polishes it works best with.</li>
    <li> The product is good and actually better than all the mattifying nail polishes that I have tried. The only con,that I can think of, is that you have to reapply every two days to maintain the matte look</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely matte and it quickly dries. However, I only give 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t work as a top coat and chips fairly easily. I would recommend using your regular top coat with a coat of Matte About You on top.</li>
    <li> I have been looking at this polish for a while and kept contemplating if I should buy it. After I read some reviews I figured that I might as well jump the gun and get it. I am so glad that I did because this is probably the best top coat ever. As soon as you apply it, maybe about a minute later you can definitely see the results and it dries up pretty quickly also. I got some of my friends to buy it too because they loved the look of it!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS! Nothing to complain about! It matifys my nails like it said it would</li>
    <li> Finally, a matte coat that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! I really love the effect this has on my nails. I&#x27;ve always felt that shiny red nails were too garish to wear unless it&#x27;s a special occasion, so this matte coat does a great job of subduing them and making them more casual. I tried Matte Nail Envy by OPI and it didn&#x27;t do anything to make my nails matte at all. I just use it as a base coat now, which I believe was its main intended purpose anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yes, two thumbs up for this!</li>
    <li> I was super excited to finally get my essie matte top coat... I&#x27;ve been using others, and expected a lot from this product... as most of my colors are essie and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the matte was way more tinted/opaque than the others I&#x27;ve tried... which REALLY distorted the color... as well as not lasting long... becomes shiny in a short period of time, and chips easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better luck with the cheap NYC matte top coat.</li>
    <li> I love this polish! It is fast drying and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it chipping. Love the look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this matte nail top coat over two different colors, and it looks fabulous when you first apply it.  However, within 24 hours the matte fades away and you are left with a dull shiny nail.  It doesn&#x27;t last at all.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem with it chipping, it just seemed to disappear.  Good for a single night out, not good for a real manicure that you want to last.</li>
    <li> This achieved a matte finish for about a day or two then faded away. The product isn&#x27;t that effective, not that matte. I definitely never used again and I&#x27;m a big essie fan. Just not for me...there are better matte products out there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected great product! I had lots of compliments and am going to buy more for some of my friends</li>
    <li> Great buy! Takes a little longer to dry thouroughly but well worth the cost! Like using it to make different subtle changes to my style and remaining professional.</li>
    <li> I Loved it, might get another one</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Fast shipping. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The price, quality and shipping speed are extremely satisfying&lt;br /&gt;The products take less than 5 seconds to dry out and give the best matte look.&lt;br /&gt;It is a must have product</li>
    <li> This stuff is Awesome! You can put it on over clear polish and it looks like your natural nails.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it promises-turns any manicure matte.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Easy application&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect matte finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Chips easy&lt;br /&gt;-After a few applications starts leaving white specs on nails&lt;br /&gt;-Needs re-application every few days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several matte top coats before and none of them have ever achieved the full matte look I was going for. They always maintained a level of shine that I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with. After browsing Amazon for other options, I chose this product because of the good reviews I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DEFINITELY reommend this product. It achieves a true matte look. Even one coat works, but 2 coats makes it super matte and gives me just the look I am going for. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product works great!! You get the matte look you&#x27;re going for and it goes over any color!! Really neat!</li>
    <li> fast delivery love it</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective, you can actually WATCH the polish go matte in a matter of seconds. Just... make sure you&#x27;re using it on DRY nail polish, as it has a tendency to smudge/smear anything not 100% dry.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does and that&#x27;s 5 stars for me.</li>
    <li> The nails will look matte for a few days but will need to be reapplied after that. The nails will then look dull and weird.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this polish it makes my nails look different and Matt .</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do - dulls the finish on any polish you put it over; that&#x27;s why it gets 4 stars.  But I absolutely hate the kind of powder-y finish that it gives your nails.  It&#x27;s really weird, since I&#x27;m used to the high gloss of nail polish past, and thus I selfishly deducted one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware the touch of matte.</li>
    <li> I love the way this top coat makes all my nail polish look!! Definitely not for everyone, but if your a polish enthusiast this is one to add to your collection. Love this over black too! Came packaged safely.</li>
    <li> This does its job well, just allow it some time to dry to get the full effect as it looks glossy when wet.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this out. It&#x27;s such a cool product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the matte doesn&#x27;t last for very long. Only a couple of days. However, all you have to do is reapply it and you&#x27;re good to go. It isn&#x27;t exactly for long-term wear. More like doing your nails for a special occasion. I really really love this product!</li>
    <li> Dries pretty quick and looks great for the shiny/matte contrast - better with darker colors though. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely  amazing....at first. I put the Essie Matte About You on top of my black nails 2 days ago and it was purely amazing but now 2 days later and it&#x27;s already fading, They need to fix the formula for this nail polish to make the effect last longer. I guess i&#x27;ll just redo my nails every 2 days.</li>
    <li> Nice matte finish but it only last a few days, have to reapply.</li>
    <li> I feel it may make your manicure chip more than normal. When I put it over my existing nail polish, it seemed to chip much quicker.</li>
    <li> This turns any nail polish into a matte finished polish. It&#x27;s fun and looks great. Saves money too. No need to buy matte polish in many colors.</li>
    <li> I love the matte look, and I can now use this top coat on all of my favorite polish I already own! It is extremely matte, very easy to use, and takes less than a minute to turn completely matte! I would buy this again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I love how it turns all colors matte! Arrived just within days of ordering it.</li>
    <li> I first I was skeptical that anything like this could really exist. (I found some awesome nail art on tumblr using this.) And to be honest I thought I was right the first time I used it. It wasn&#x27;t until I tired it the second time I tired was what really amazed me! I works really well on dark colors. You can still use it on light colors but make sure it isn&#x27;t cheap nail polish. Otherwise it&#x27;ll look really faded. (which happened to me the first time I used it.)</li>
    <li> looked great when I first applied it but then the matte fades away and nails are glossy. it would have to be applied daily if you wanted to keep the matte look. good thing about it is that it dries almost instantly</li>
    <li> I bought the &amp;#34;Matte About You&amp;#34; finishing top coat and it arrived over a week early! I was delighted! I used it for the first time a few days later and after applying you wait a few seconds and bam! You have matte nails. Another bonus is that it dried within a minute of application. Very nice for the price I payed but the only thing I&#x27;d like to point out as a tip is that when you apply it make sure you have very nice and even streaks because after it dries any mistakes or uneven lines will be noticeable. I&#x27;d recommend this for sure though. I hope you found this helpful! :)</li>
    <li> I read and saw some reviews about the mattefying (I&#x27;m not sure if this term exists) coats and I found that the Essie one was great. It is true, indeed. I loved it! I love that it gives ANY nail polish a matte finish! I really recommend this one!</li>
    <li> I really liked this polish, and it turned matte in about 10 seconds. It looks really cool, but the only thing is, the matte wore off after only a couple days! Couldn&#x27;t believe it! Essie, you let me down :(</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to this product only to be let down. The polish does in fact create a matte finish to the base color of nail polish but does not withstand normal daily activities. Hours after applying nail polish it chips and peels. In my opinion, basically not worth the effort of doing your nails.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as if I bought it in store. It works great and was $3 less than it is in store!</li>
    <li> This is the 1st matte nail polish I have tried so I do not have others to compare it to. I think it does the job, was just hoping for even more matte.</li>
    <li> Very subtle matte top coat. Looks very cool on dark colors as a polish or as an accent on the tips!</li>
    <li> This product is not available in my country which sucks. I have to order this online and as shipping cost me more than the product, i bought two of these..and geeezzzz...im so happy that i did. If you can&#x27;t get your hands on China Glaze matte top coat, this is the product that works as great if not better.</li>
    <li> Anyone who loves polish needs to have this in his or her collection. Its a great way to make polishes you already own more exciting.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about this, but Essie is a great nail polish brand and this gives such a cool look to nails. I use it over metallics all the time and it has a really cool effect. I recommend trying it. Lots of fun.</li>
    <li> this is so  cool and it makes your nails look awesome.It also really looks good on black nail polish :)</li>
    <li> This was worth every penny I paid. Perfect, not a bummer like the other matte polishes. I&#x27;ve gone real deep for my nails, and I wanted an &#x27;effect&#x27;. After seeing a few pictures of matte nail polishes, I decided that I should buy it. I found the this, an Essie Amazement, I knew it was just perfect! I even saw the China Glaze one, but since my friend named Khadija bought that one, and she said it was a TOTAL BUMMER, I knew I shall say goodbye to China Glaze. After I bought this, I tried it, and after it dried (which took SECONDS because it&#x27;s fast drying) I was like- Oh la la! The effect I wanted! And the cool thing, This works perfectly fine for a base coat. Thank you, Essie,  To get my nail rescue!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I use this all the time! I would buy them again and again! Also it shipped quick! Great product! Love the matte color!!</li>
    <li> This was great! Neet effect.  To stop the chips I created a matt nail and tipped the ends with a clear gloss.  It looked like a matt/gloss french manicure... make sense?  The matt/gloss contrast was very cool and it got many compliments.</li>
    <li> It takes a minute to actually notice the matte finish on a DARKER nail polish (which looks better matte, in my opinion). This is actually back-ordered nearly everywhere, so if you are reading this and it is available.. get it while you can!</li>
    <li> This polish works exactly as it says it does. It will make any nail color matte. The ONLY thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was the feeling of it after it was on, I like to feel my shiny smooth nails but with this on top of your color it feels dry.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Really works well. But the only thing that after a while(five days) it starts looking like regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> I have several favorite colors that I had often wished I could find in matte... this solved that problem perfectly! I love Essie and this is just one more great product from the Essie line!</li>
    <li> Before buying this item I did some research and everyone said this was the one to get. I was not disappointed at all. When I went to the nail salon people were in awe of the product and asking where to get it. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great but I wished it&#x27;d dry faster and I wished it lasted longer than a few days. Overall, I love it and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered and I got it on time. I love the look of matte vs. shiny. It adds something unique to your nail polish. It also makes it dry SUPER fast - which is always a plus in my book.</li>
    <li> Chips within a day or two</li>
    <li> Works just as expected.</li>
    <li> I have fun using this product. I love how it can change any color polish I have into matte! I saw other reviews that said it chips too easily. I have not had any issues with it chipping right away. Sure, it does by the 4-5th day but that&#x27;s to be expected since you can&#x27;t put a top coat on it. The only negative thing I have to say about this is that sometimes when you&#x27;re putting the matte on your nails it strips the color from your nail. It doesn&#x27;t happen that often, I think I just had it a little too thick when I went to put it on my nail after taking it out of the bottle. Just make sure you don&#x27;t have too much on the brush otherwise your nails will get somewhat messed up!</li>
    <li> I love how quickly it turns the shine to matte! Its like magic! I put it on and watch my nails go from shine to matte.</li>
    <li> Go out and buy ten cause the matte top coat is the coolest thing you&#x27;ll ever buy...Bonus, it even gets your nails dry way faster than any other top coat i&#x27;ve ever used! BUY BUY BUY</li>
    <li> it works! and it&#x27;s really nice. i love the versatility this gives to every nail polish you already own, and it dries super fast.</li>
    <li> Love the look but I noticed using the matte, the nail polish is easier to come off</li>
    <li> This does what it says, and looks good. The downside is that it oil-spots more easily than my other matte coat (OPI by Sephora). The oil from your hands and fingertips can spot up this matte coat and give it a weird sheen/glow. So keep that in mind if you normally have oily or sweaty hands.</li>
    <li> I ordered this the day after Christmas 2913 and they told me to expect it to arrive late January to Early February so I did, but it came 5 days later on New Year&#x27;s Eve and I was so happy. The box it was in was a little crushed, but the product itself was fine, so I wasn&#x27;t upset. It dries quickly which is a plus, but I noticed that if you wash dishes without gloves, the soap makes the nail polish lose its matte finish and become somewhat shiny. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have wanted to get this for so long but after using other matte polishes that were horrible I decided to give it a try.  So mad I waited this long to try it! I absolutely love they way it makes my polish look!</li>
    <li> I love this polish, I used it with a bright bright pink and it makes it look amazing. I am very happy with my matte product</li>
    <li> Essie nail polishes are always great. Product came fast and was packaged well. No leakage. Polish goes on smooth, will suggest to my friends.</li>
    <li> amazing product, makes my nails look like a salon matte finish.</li>
    <li> First time ever using matte finish. Definitely does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Great nailpolish, makes it really matt, as expected... + delivery was really fast, props! Buy it and boost up your nailpolish collection.</li>
    <li> Great base coat if you like a matte finish to your nails.  It&#x27;s definitely makes any nail polish last long, especially when paired with the base coat!</li>
    <li> for about a million reasons, you NEED this matte top coat. It&#x27;s affordably priced, shipped immediately (I received it 2 days after I placed my order), doesn&#x27;t streak and goes on perfect in one easy coat. It look amazing over EVERY color, I have used it over everything from chromes, neons, pastels, holographic, translucents, even ombré nails. I&#x27;ve used it over all different brands and it works the same awesome way with all of them. It&#x27;s long lasting, doesn&#x27;t chip and drys quickly. Buy this, do it now. You NEED IT. The manicure possibilities will be endless.</li>
    <li> This product works great for the matte effect on any polish. I&#x27;ve found the effect works best with creme polishes as it is most obvious. It&#x27;s smooth and drys super quickly. It usually last me about 5 days, which is typical for one of my manicures since I use my hands so much. If you&#x27;re looking for a matte top coat, this one works great!</li>
    <li> So I ordered this product for my 18 year old daughter, because she is into doing nail designs and she has been wanting it. This is the first product I have ever ordered from Amazon so I was a little skeptical at first. The package was received ON TIME, and she was SO excited! She opened it, cleaned off her design from her current nails and applied a design and the Essie Matte Finish on top. She LOVED it!She is absolutely amazed about this product and i could not be more happier myself. I really think this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I really like the matte finish, but it always chips within a day or two unless I use some kind of clear top coat (usually glitter) before using the matte top coat.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! it gives any nail color a different twist, and I even put it on over my gel nail polish to give it a different effect....</li>
    <li> Ordered it for a friend and she was satisfied.</li>
    <li> Some things though... The matte is nice, but if your hands get dirty at all, it looks shiny (like your natural nail shiny). The other problem I found is that it chips rather easily. But if you&#x27;re looking for a fun effect, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Helps nails dry a lot faster than normal. I love the matte finish. Really changes up the colors you already own to make them appear a little different. Would totally recommend to people who are constantly changing up their nail color! Great product</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Essie polish.  This &#x27;matte&#x27; polish, however, not only takes out any shine but makes the nail polish look very dull and odd.  Probably won&#x27;t use it again.  But that wouldn&#x27;t stop me from buying Essie polish always !</li>
    <li> This Matte Finish is so cool. I went to the nail salon and took it with me. The manicurist was skeptical and did not want to use it but she did. I had her put shiny black polish on my nails then coat over it with the matte finish, leaving the top edge shiny like a french manicure. Everyone in the shop admired it and was saying how you could do it with any color really.</li>
    <li> This can make any color matte. I like it because it gives my polish something unique and extra. Suggestion... Looks great over blues.</li>
    <li> I saw this black French manicure and wanted to try it. Well the matte isn&#x27;t what I thought it was going to be and it never really dried.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone, it is just amazing a  light coat covers the entire nail and turns matte any nail polish you want!</li>
    <li> This matte topcoat is amazing! The quality is super and it dries rapidly! I would recommend two coats.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has an interest in nail polish.</li>
    <li> It looks cool but chips off really easily.</li>
    <li> The nail polish came super fast! It works perfectly, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will also protect your polish from chipping, this isn&#x27;t the polish for you!</li>
    <li> fun and easy to use to add a little spice to my  nails in a subtle way. also, it dries VERY fast so that is a huge bonus that i love :)</li>
    <li> This is the best that I have found so far! Make sure your first coat is dried completely before adding the matte.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I usually do a regular shiny topcoat for a day or two, then mattify it with this topcoat for something different.  I can&#x27;t speak to it wearing off, I do a new topcoat every day generally, and it&#x27;s worked out fine.  I use OPI In a Snap topcoat and this works well on top of that.</li>
    <li> I love the matte look and essie but this does chip easier than other matte polishes I have used.</li>
    <li> came a day late and was given a free polish for the inconvenience which was nice. love the matte finish, gives an understated and classy appearance to any manicure. only downside is it gets less matte as it wears.</li>
    <li> The matte topcoat takes forever to dry. Make sure your color underneath is completely finished drying before applying this matte on top, or else it will just smush right off. Also, no water or manual labor for maybe an hour after application, because it seriously takes forever to set. Beyond that, it looks fantastic and I haven&#x27;t really had any of the chipping problems other people described. Once you make it through that first hour or so it stays fabulous for days.</li>
    <li> works beautifully, leaves nails matte does what it says. came very fast in the mail in bubble wrap. would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great mattifier, worth every buck</li>
    <li> Is the brush supposed to be two different lengths? I thought that part was odd, but the actual formula is great!</li>
    <li> This matte top coat is beautiful. I had a hard time finding the matte top coat in O.P.I so this is the next best thing! It does start turning shiny at the tips after a couple days, but i work a lot with my hands. I recommend this polish!</li>
    <li> I have had the matte nail polish for over a month now and I use it with every nail polish color I have. Works great! Make sure to use a base coat, top coat and then the matte. It seems to last longer that way! Enjoy :D</li>
    <li> works good, no chipping for a couple days &amp; I usually chip the next day. I heard it was the best matte top coat so I tried it &amp; it definitely makes the nail polish underneath matte.</li>
    <li> True to its definition..much cheaper than in stores. Loved it!</li>
    <li> very good product but you have to put another coat every other day so that it stays matte</li>
    <li> Recv&#x27;d my package early and the nail polish mattes any other polish I use. I would recommend this polish. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched every store in my area for Essie&#x27;s Matte About You and have not once been able to find it. Thank goodness I was able to find it on Amazon, (I&#x27;m not sure why I waited so long to check here). I love the look of matte nail polish, but I&#x27;ve always hated how quickly it chips off. Essie&#x27;s Matte About You takes care of that. You can turn any of your regular polish colors into a matte, like magic.</li>
    <li> very good, makes any nail polish look matte, making it look more interesting than just the regular shiny color. very good product, i love essie</li>
    <li> If you are into polish, this is a MUST HAVE! Get iot and all of a sudden you can change so many polishes to a whole new look.</li>
    <li> I love this! Mattes nail polish right away and doesn&#x27;t chip/fade for at least 4 days. Only thing was that it would sometimes run the nail polish if there&#x27;s more than 1 color painted. But I think that happens with most topcoats anyway. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I purchased this matte and brought it to my nail technician. They gave me a full black French manicure with matte body and shiny tips. The matte turned my nail polish blue, and after two days it looked glossy. I will not buy this product or design my nails that way ever again.</li>
    <li> Love the matte look.  But it cracks.</li>
    <li> This nail polish works! I was skeptical at first bit it makes your nails totally matte. You can use it over any color and it doesn&#x27;t chip very easily.</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff! It works so well and I love the look of the matte polish. Looks great over any polish</li>
    <li> I love the matte look and it works great. Just make sure you make sure your current nail polish is completely dry! I would recommend waiting an hour or two after you paint your nails just to avoid screwing up your nail polish.</li>
    <li> Perfect matte top coat polish. It will &amp;#34;mattefy&amp;#34; any polish. I am very pleased. Thank you for this amazing polish!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, looks great, and dries in minutes! Made an amazing french manicure with black polish by covering the tips with stickers and applying this top to the rest of the nail.</li>
    <li> So, this stuff is awesome! I was skeptical, but it really does turn any nail polish into a matte finish. My only complaint is that as a top coat, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. But, perhaps if a better topcoat were used underneath that would extend it? You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> This works beautifully when you really want that matte finish to your nails. I prefer it best with black :) It does its job well, its a must have in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Drys very fast and holds up very well.  Love it that i can use with any color. Do think it is a little too expensive.</li>
    <li> When I got this I tried it out immediately to see if this product works and it does! The product description says exactly what the product is suppose to do. I waited about one minute before applying and that seemed to work better for me.</li>
    <li> My Niece couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how much she wanted this polish. Suprised her and had it sent to her. As soon as it arrived she did her nails.</li>
    <li> This product works well.  I did notice it chips VERY quickly. By the end of the day, a had a few chips on my nails, which never happens. By the next day, my nails were pretty much gone. I made sure I got a polish change at a nail salon, which normally makes my polish be intact for almost a week.</li>
    <li> I liked how I could see it transform my polish instantly!  Very good product... I always love Essie products. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Personally, I prefer the OPI matte topcoat, when I use this Essie one, it doesn&#x27;t have a smooth, top, it follows the ridges of your nail art and nail polish, which gives it a not-so-clean look</li>
    <li> I think this top coat is a money saver with you having not to buy matte polishes.  This product can be used with any nail color and instantly works its magic on turning shiny laquer to a dull matted look, which is currently the style for nails.  My sister has mentioned working with matte nail colors and how brush streaks can be visible if you don&#x27;t do a good job.  With the matte top coat, I didn&#x27;t have that problem so another plus for this product!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended the mate polish and so I got this one and it does the job.  It looked really nice on a design that I did.</li>
    <li> i like it a lot. Definitely lasts longer than other matte nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Really nice I love it . Right when you put it on it is instantly matte. It soo cool if you put it over sparkle: - )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks soo much</li>
    <li> Not as good as I was hoping for. A lot thicker than I had anticipated.</li>
    <li> Love this, it&#x27;s so different.  It&#x27;s very matte if you use it with a cream-type polish, metallic polishes tend to look more satin than matte.  Really cool with dark polish and some rhinestones.</li>
    <li> Came in one day! !! Wonderful service - fun to use if you are onto nail art a lot . I am a cosmetologist and nail tech.!!! Cant wait to use!</li>
    <li> Awesome formula love it!</li>
    <li> This is soooo awesome! I absolutely love how quick it works, and the results are incredible! I have become addicted to using matte with every color I own. it dries really quickly. At first i was a little hesitiant because of the cost but, i find that I use it so much and that it works so well, and i&#x27;ve barely used that much of it because it only needs one coat! i would recommend to any one. except for my friends, don&#x27;t want their nails to be as cool as mine &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> like STUPID FAST! i tried it on top of OPI, sephora brand, nailtini, any expensive nailpolish i owned. it all still chipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i mean, it chipped within the same day!</li>
    <li> This was my first time using matte polish and I we blown away! I thought it would have been ruined after dishwashing but it held up and was strong.</li>
    <li> my only concern with this (probably something essie is working on) is the durability of the matte top coat. after a few days of being very careful, the tips have worn down to show shine again.</li>
    <li> A MUST HAVE! Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish. I can do many designs with it. I am looking forward to seeing what else Essie comes out with.</li>
