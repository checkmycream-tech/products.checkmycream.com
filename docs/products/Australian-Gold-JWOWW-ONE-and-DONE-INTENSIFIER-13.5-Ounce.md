<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I  liked this product. It smells nice and it doesn&#x27;t smell gross after tanning. I don&#x27;t tan well and this has helped me get some great color to my fair skin that takes a LONG time to have the slightest tan. I don&#x27;t like the way bronzers look on my skin so intensifiers are what I go for and this has given me a great, natural tan in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> I really liked his tanning lotion. This is the first year I&#x27;ve decided to try a lotion without bronzer and I am very pleased. I feel like I am shades darker after only using it 3 times. The scent is really nice too. It has a pear/coconut smell and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all after tannig either!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet but I&#x27;m super excited to. The shipping was super fast! Like 2 days. The lotion came completely sealed, not just the lid but the whole thing was sealed. Perfect condition and smells great. 5 stars!! The picture I attached is after I took the seal off.</li>
    <li> I only use JWOWW tanning creams.  This is not my favorite, but I do like it.  All her tanning creams are top of the line and they ship within one day of ordering, I love that about them.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> The lady at the salon introduced me to this lotion but it was $65! So I Ordered this lotion THINKING I was getting a great deal. WRONG!!! This lotion is supposed to have no bronzer but.....it does! The one at the salon smelled absolutely amazing! This one has that god awful rotten bronzer smell. I have just rubbed it on my arm to see if the smell was as strong as it smells in the bottle and it was WORSE! Also, the lotion expired over a year ago! I&#x27;ve contacted them about the issue and no help, no refund, nothing! Do no buy! It&#x27;s worth it to buy from the salon.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great.  Leaves my skin feeling soft after tanning, noticeable deeper color after one use.  Well worth the cost</li>
    <li> The lotion smells great and is very thin so your skin does not get sticky after application. The only problem is that sometimes after tanning it can smell kind of strong. My tan is developing great as my natural color is coming through. This is a great product for people who already tan well and just need to get that color back. This does not have a bronzer so I don&#x27;t have to be afraid of spots or turning brown. Great product overall and definitely recommend it for the people who are looking for something without a bronzer.</li>
    <li> Works great and got it quick, wonderful price</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to help start my base tan. When I opened it I thought it smelled kind of bad so I asked my salon girl if it smelled right to her. She smelled it &amp; over exaggerated how bad it smelled &amp; that it couldn&#x27;t be the real thing. So I bought the $5 packet from the salon. Both this bottle &amp; the packet had the correct color, texture, &amp; stinky smell. So I was gyped by the salon lady. I like the lotion for the fact that it has ink drink complex for tattoos &amp; it&#x27;s creamy texture. I don&#x27;t think it smells good though &amp; when I leave the tanning bed a smell burnt. Also I noticed more color from previous lotions like &amp;#34;Luminary&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;Adore&amp;#34;. This lotion isn&#x27;t the lotion for me.</li>
    <li> One and done is great great smell and my color is a lovely natural color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions. I&#x27;ve been using JWOWW one and done lotion for a few months now. I refuse to use anything else from now on.</li>
    <li> I went to a tanning salon and was let to smell a few of the other lotions I had been researching online. This is by far was the best smelling one. Its really fresh and fruity scented and does not smell &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; after. Also, it makes my skin feel incredibly smooth. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;m necessarily &amp;#34;darker&amp;#34; after one use, but my skin does feel hydrated and holds my tan longer. it doesn&#x27;t contain any bronzer which I also really like! Will absolutely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT***3/16/15&lt;br /&gt;Bummed! I&#x27;ve used this lotion about 4 times since I&#x27;ve received it and i&#x27;ve broken out in a rash each time! I&#x27;ve tried tanning without it and didn&#x27;t get any sort of rash.. SUPER disappointed because I thought I found a great product. The rash caused tons of blotchy areas with raised blister like bumps that were very itchy. They were all over my chest and down my stomach and lasted about 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with sensitive or fair skin. I was using this in a standing tanning booth. That type of lighting is different from some tanning beds. It may have just been a bad reaction with my body chemistry, but I would hope to spare anyone considering buying this from those uncomfortable itchy bumps.</li>
    <li> JWOWW lotions work okay for me. They smell nice and fell good on my skin. I only gave this product a 3 star rating because, it just doesn&#x27;t help me build color the way other products do. (This also has to do with it not be a bronzer.) This is not saying anything negative about the lotion. It came as depicted and arrived timely. Anyone who tans knows that some lotions work great for others while others do not. It is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  My only issue with it is that I don&#x27;t feel like it works as good as the other one and done  in the pink bottle.  I bought this for the ink drink complex.  Honestly don&#x27;t feel like it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Love all the jwoww tsnning lotions!!!</li>
    <li> I just love it.  You can see a difference after 1 tanning</li>
    <li> BEST LOTION I EVER HAD!  TOTALLY WORTH EVERY DOLLAR!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Feels so good going on &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. Wonderful scent. Next time I&#x27;ll buy the one with bronzer in it :)</li>
    <li> Smells like a pastry. Soaks in great. The ingredients list isn&#x27;t too frightening. I&#x27;m not an experienced tanner, but it seemed to help.</li>
    <li> Love it. The smell is great and it works well.</li>
    <li> Works great! First year going with no bronzer and I love this. Smells good, leaves skin soft, and results on first use.</li>
    <li> Smells nice.  Very moisturizing. I didn&#x27;t get the &#x27;burnt smell&#x27; after tanning and the date on the bottom wasn&#x27;t expired.  I have a fair complexion with tattoos, and this worked well for me.  Worth the price.  Didn&#x27;t seem like a knock off. I wouldn&#x27;t have spent 80 bucks on it at a salon,  but the amazon price is appropriate.</li>
    <li> I sampled this product and was not impressed at all. First I noticed the consistency seemed nothing like a lotion . It was more gel like, sticky, didn&#x27;t absorb well, and I didn&#x27;t feel moisturized. Secondly, the smell is horrendous . I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it, but it smells like burnt rubber mixed in with liquor. As I tanned, I literally could smell what felt like burnt skin . I normally don&#x27;t buy a lotion for the smell alone, but this smell is one I could not work through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that after tanning I did think it gave me an instant darker glow, without having a bronzer in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, the terrible smell and odd consistency totally turns me off this product.</li>
    <li> Not as hot as I was hoping for but smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Shipped fast and exactly as described. Bottle was sealed.</li>
    <li> Amazing accelerator! I am working on my base tan and all of my lotions were old or had bronzers in them. I ordered this and I am pleasantly surprised! It smells good. Less &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; fruit scent, more &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; fruit scent. It&#x27;s okay by me, but I do prefer tropical. Since I just started working on my base tan after a year of no tanning, I am at 6 minutes in a 12 minute ergoline 800. This lotion got me at least two shades darker in that short 6 minute tan time. Even my husband who is oblivious to everything noticed I was darker. Highly recommend this lotion. Very little ATO, and I can still smell the pear scent hours later.</li>
    <li> Great product! Also less than half the price compared to the salon!</li>
    <li> It did exactly what it said.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> went on like a moisturizer..but no smell at all ..it said it came from amzon itsellf ..well no tan. and hasant improved color</li>
    <li> Out of the 7 remaining. What is the expiration dates? Thank you</li>
    <li> Love love love love love! No orange finish. You smell WONDERFUL after. I cannot speak higher of this!</li>
    <li> This is just ok. I was not really impressed with the color. It leads you to believe you will notice an instant color but I didn&#x27;t really see any difference until I had used it for two weeks.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great...smells good</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion! Works great &amp; brings out a beautiful natural tan, while leaving your skin moisturized &amp; silky smooth!! I would recommend this lotion to anyone looking for beautiful color without having to deal with all the problems that come alongside using pricy &amp; unpredictable bronzers with or without DHA...Great &amp; smooth application with a wonderful scent that lasts through the day after tanning!!!</li>
    <li> Jwoww makes the best indoor tanning lotions I have ever tried! This is not a lotion with bronzers, it is a clear solution. I like to alternate using this with one of the other Jwoww lotions with bronzers (DHA) in it. I always have amazing results using this! It smells fantastic and the after tan smell is not strong or noticeable. I love this lotion, and would highly recommend this lotion to any indoor tanner!</li>
    <li> Ordered this because it had so many great reviews. I think it smells like someone threw up a strawberry banana milkshake. Also, after tanning I smelled like burnt flesh. Will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I have been using the Designer Skin black legacy with bronzer lotion.  I decided to give the bronzers a break and try out an intensifier for a while.  I could tell a difference after using this product just once.  After using this lotion I may give up bronzers all together.  I wasn&#x27;t a super fan of the smell when I first applied the lotion but after tanning it actually smelled better and didn&#x27;t leave me smelling like I had just finished tanning.  Most lotions can&#x27;t cover up that smell but this one does a great job.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!! Best so far that I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... Smells great and does really good with keeping my tattoos looking good.... I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has tattoos...</li>
    <li> Loved this the first time used it. This gave me a boost, notice an instant difference.. To me the smell is a light fruity smell. Once out of the tanning be it was the same smell just slightly stronger.</li>
    <li> I had kind of stalled out with my previous lotion. One use of this and my tan was much deeper and has continued to get darker.  Smells great going on and after tanning.</li>
    <li> On time &amp; great product</li>
    <li> It gives give a sun kissed glow very natural looking, skin feels soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, smells great and gets you dark fast!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Do not be  put off by the date on the bottom it is NOT an expiration date It is the date the product was produced.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF BECAUSE I HAVE TATTOOS AND IT HELPS WITH THAT, IT SMELLS GREAT! AND THE TIMING IS AWESOME I GET MY LOTIONS SO FAST FROM MY LADY! THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! Totally worth it! It shipped pretty fast too!</li>
    <li> Not fond of the smell of the lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and a great intensifier. I use this with the JWOWW One and Done Bronzer and I get great color.</li>
    <li> I just got this and have used it once. I could tell a difference in my color, but my husband told me I smelled like bug spray! It smells good in the bottle, but after you lay, it&#x27;s a bit much! So expect to shower soon after!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about the intesifier but than again it&#x27;s Jwoww, it gave me incredible color and the smell is very nice before and after tanning. I recommend this to anyone who wants a deep dark lasting tan without the Orange fake look. I used to swear by bronzes in my lotion but this has proved you can still get dark without it LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Works great! Love it....fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Have used this twice and can already tell a difference in color...awesome product! Very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Do not believe this is the real product.  Tested it against a sample from my salon and the smell, texture, and after effects are completely different.  The smell is not so bad, the lotion is thicker than the salon&#x27;s, but!!!!, it is an instant tanner!!!  One leg looked normal 8 hours after tanning, the other was orange!!!!!  Horrible.  Thought this was a plain, regular lotion, with no bells and whistles besides whatever &amp;#34;ink drink&amp;#34; is, but was very disappointed.  Spend the extra money at the salon and make sure you get the real deal.</li>
    <li> Had the original one and done, loved it. Figured to try this one out since I have a couple tattoos. Love it! Smells great and my skin feels very hydrated after tanning. Saw results after one tanning session!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really  and I have gotten great color in just 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, darker in one use!!</li>
    <li> Love this product, I&#x27;m so tan and it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Over a year expired when arrived.</li>
</ol>
