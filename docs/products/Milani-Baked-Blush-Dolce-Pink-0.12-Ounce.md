      <li>Almost a good dupe though</li>
      <li>however the Luminoso one is every good.</li>
      <li>Of course, luxury is usually more deluxe, but if you&#x27;re like me &amp; are frugal or broke-ish, then this is a great sub for a glow that looks good on everyone.</li>

      <li>This blush is amazing.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, shimmery blush</li>
      <li>It does well on its own for a &amp;#</li>
      <li>Brightens the complexion nicely.</li>
      <li>This blush has really nice color payoff</li>
      <li>Milani also makes matte baked blushes and their rose embossed blushes are matte too.</li>

      <li>Milani blushes are now my fav :)</li>
      <li>Love this blush.</li>
      <li>if you build up the product it will look more noticeable.</li>
      <li>but, it&#x27;s no MAC, which is what I mostly use.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite powder blush out if all drugstore and department store blushes.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this blusher.  </li>
      <li>On my skin, it looks more like a bronzer than it does, a blush.</li>
      <li>Okay I don&#x27;t get the hype about this blush.</li>
      <li>but it has more glitter in it than I prefer.</li>
      <li>Perfect pink for my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>Gorgeous color and very pigmented.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect for layering with other blushes though.</li>
      <li>Just enough sparkle and the color is beautiful.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and smoothly and adds a glow to my already applied blush.</li>
      <li>It appears to be a true pink color which is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Great product, especially the price!</li>
      <li>Too light?</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also fantastic if shimmer isn&#x27;t your thing.</li>
      <li>Dolce Pink is one of the most gorgeous looking blushes from Milani&#x27;s baked line.</li>
      <li>When you layer it heavily you are then covered with shimmer on the apples of your cheeks (not my ideal place to enhance with shimmer).  </li>
      <li>so you&#x27;re getting a brush full of sparkle and a hint of the color each time.</li>
      <li>Nice colour, but arrived completely shattered.</li>
      <li>Dolce de pink is a gorgeous vibrant rose color with shimmer.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping, well packaged....</li>
      <li>I use this product daily and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous glowy pink.</li>
      <li>The sparkles in it are very, very tiny, so this way it gives your face a nice glow.</li>
      <li>I like to use this product on top of a cheek stain to give it the soft and shimmery effect.</li>
      <li>Adds just the right amount of luminous sparkle.</li>
      <li>is really cheaply made and not too easy to open.  </li>
      <li>I regret buying this now because I have a neutral style and this is only suitable for night time events...</li>
      <li>It is more of a peach tone, not pink</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used fade away, and by the end of the day it looks like I never even put anything on in the first place - but not this one.</li>
      <li>I also apply a light dusting of translucent powder over top of it, which will tone down the shimmer a bit.</li>
      <li>Looks so beautiful but poor pigmentation for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many others in the past, but this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Nice color, a little too shimmery for my taste.</li>
      <li>Literally, the color really stays on for hours and hours without me reapplying it.</li>
      <li>So much that you&#x27;ll look like a disco ball after you apply it.</li>
      <li>VERY sparkly/shimmery.</li>
      <li>But I got a muted pink with some sparkle in it, and I really love it.</li>
      <li>You are getting more sparkle than color, tapping the brush does help but not much.</li>
      <li>The color was lighter, more translucent than I expected.</li>
      <li>But this color has too much glitter for my taste.</li>
      <li>It is a nice shade of pink with a soft shimmer factor.  </li>
      <li>My skin tends to get quite pale and dull-looking during the winter months, and I find that this blush livens it up nicely.</li>
      <li>When used in conjunction with other products it is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Apply your favorite Bronze and Illuminating Powder/Highlight to tone down and give you that dewy look.  </li>
      <li>I got my blush quickly and it was packaged in such a way that it would not break (which it did not).</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended</li>
      <li>I didn’t find the blush particularly long-wearing, but it’s such a pretty color.</li>
      <li>It gives off nice color and adds to the overall dewy look I go for when using an illuminating powder but, doesn&#x27;t really last as long as brands I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>They must update frequently!</li>
      <li>Same quality as a much higher-priced brand!</li>
      <li>Applying One layer creates the natural look.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting, drug store equivalent blush, I&#x27;d really consider giving this a try.</li>
      <li>All the shades are very pigmented and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Blush barely shows up on my skin</li>
      <li>Great, less expensive version similar to NARS Orgasm blush that everyone is talking about.  </li>
      <li>Dolce Pink is a really shimmery baby pink that looks natural after one layer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this blush. Adds just the right amount of luminous sparkle. Brightens the complexion nicely.</li>
    <li> Just the color I needed. Thank you</li>
    <li> Awesome color.... I love it</li>
    <li> Dolce Pink is one of the most gorgeous looking blushes from Milani&#x27;s baked line. It is a bright pink blush with a plum base. However, this blush is loaded with sparkles! So much that you&#x27;ll look like a disco ball after you apply it. Some people say that tapping your brush will get rid of the sparkles but it didn&#x27;t work for me the sparkles are still there. The pigmentation is also not that great so you&#x27;re getting a brush full of sparkle and a hint of the color each time. I regret buying this now because I have a neutral style and this is only suitable for night time events...however the Luminoso one is every good.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially the price! Same quality as a much higher-priced brand! Will definitely keep this on the go-to list.</li>
    <li> I got my blush quickly and it was packaged in such a way that it would not break (which it did not). Very pleased!</li>
    <li> beautiful natural color for fair to medium skin...this is my go to everyday blush now</li>

    <li> Gorgeous color and very pigmented. Milani blushes are now my fav :)</li>
    <li> This is a nice, shimmery blush but, it&#x27;s no MAC, which is what I mostly use.

    <li> Nice colour, but arrived completely shattered. Colour quality,  solid. Product shopping or stability,  not solid at all.</li>
    <li> The color was lighter, more translucent than I expected. The color is perfect for layering with other blushes though. It goes on easily and smoothly and adds a glow to my already applied blush. It does well on its own for a &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; look. I use this product daily and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Ran out of my NARS organsm blush and searched online and found that this was a dupe. Looks so beautiful but poor pigmentation for my skin tone. Blush barely shows up on my skin</li>
    <li> Nice color, a little too shimmery for my taste. Almost a good dupe though</li>
    <li> It is a nice shade of pink with a soft shimmer factor.  The staying power is not there and it must be heavily layered for the color to be apparent.

    <li> Fast delivery and beautiful color</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, great product.</li>
    <li> Applying One layer creates the natural look.  Too light? Build up th product.  Run with it!!! Apply your favorite Bronze and Illuminating Powder/Highlight to tone down and give you that dewy look.  Highly Recommended</li>
    <li> VERY sparkly/shimmery. One of my favorite blushes! however the brush it came with really sucks... it doesn&#x27;t even pick up color.</li>
    <li> Love the color and price! This is a great blush!!!</li>
    <li> This blush has really nice color payoff and I love the packaging! Dolce Pink is a really shimmery baby pink that looks natural after one layer. if you build up the product it will look more noticeable. Would recommend for anyone!</li>
    <li> Add a little glow or give a night look if applied heavier, I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> This blush is great. I&#x27;ve used many others in the past, but this is by far my favorite. It lasts throughout the entire day, no matter what. I&#x27;ve always found that other blushes I&#x27;ve used fade away, and by the end of the day it looks like I never even put anything on in the first place - but not this one. It&#x27;s also shimmery, yet doesn&#x27;t look fake. The sparkles in it are very, very tiny, so this way it gives your face a nice glow. My skin tends to get quite pale and dull-looking during the winter months, and I find that this blush livens it up nicely. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it will look on my skin during the summer when I have a nice tan!</li>
    <li> This blush stays on my extremely pale skin longer than my $30 Tarte blush. Literally, the color really stays on for hours and hours without me reapplying it. I guess I don&#x27;t mind the shimmer the blush has like the other reviewers stated, it makes my skin look luminous. I also apply a light dusting of translucent powder over top of it, which will tone down the shimmer a bit. If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting, drug store equivalent blush, I&#x27;d really consider giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Okay I don&#x27;t get the hype about this blush. You are getting more sparkle than color, tapping the brush does help but not much. I also have the Milani blush in Luminoso and that color is amazing. But this color has too much glitter for my taste. However the packaging is durable and comes with a mirror.</li>
    <li> This blush is amazing. Just enough sparkle and the color is beautiful. It appears to be a true pink color which is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite powder blush out if all drugstore and department store blushes. All the shades are very pigmented and long lasting. Dolce de pink is a gorgeous vibrant rose color with shimmer.</li>
    <li> I like it ....but it has more glitter in it than I prefer. Quick shipping, well packaged....</li>
    <li> I love this blush! I got a color from the baked collection, which again, I’m not seeing on their website – the color, not the collection. They must update frequently! But I got a muted pink with some sparkle in it, and I really love it. I’ve been hearing that Luminoso is a must-have for your collection, and I have my eye on it! I think that will be my next purchase, along with a Bella eye shadow. I didn’t find the blush particularly long-wearing, but it’s such a pretty color. One to pop in your bag on a night out!</li>
    <li> It is more of a peach tone, not pink</li>
    <li> It is very beautiful and flare that has make the skin look very healthy</li>
    <li> Great, less expensive version similar to NARS Orgasm blush that everyone is talking about.  Of course, luxury is usually more deluxe, but if you&#x27;re like me &amp; are frugal or broke-ish, then this is a great sub for a glow that looks good on everyone.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful. You can layer it for more pop or do one brush for a very light tone. The seller is very nice. I buy all my blush from him and I will not buy for anyone else.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this blusher.  Perfect pink for my skin tone.  I would have given it 5 stars but the the case it&#x27;s in is really cheaply made and not too easy to open.  Nonetheless, I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is the PERFECT blush color!!!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous glowy pink. Beautifully pigmented and lasts all day. I also use this with matte bronzer on my eyes. Milani also makes matte baked blushes and their rose embossed blushes are matte too. They&#x27;re also fantastic if shimmer isn&#x27;t your thing.</li>
