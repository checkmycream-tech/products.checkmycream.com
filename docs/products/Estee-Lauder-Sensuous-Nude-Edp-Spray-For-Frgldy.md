    <li> Love the smell! So soft and subtle! Got compliments since the first day I wore it! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love E. L. !! Never too heavy, never too light. Just love &#x27;Beautiful&#x27;, but thought I&#x27;d try this--not disappointed! Complimented on it FIRST THING when I walked into work!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the price but it seemed to have an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smell to it like it had been sitting around for a while.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  The bottle is gorgeous and about the size of my palm.</li>
    <li> Great smell feminine and fresh, my hubby loves it.</li>

    <li> Beautiful scent, I have worn Estee Lauder Beyond Paradise forever. This is a an almost opposite scent not flora or swee, kinda has a musk scent and very light</li>
    <li> nice smell, but doesn&#x27;t  stay for long.</li>
    <li> Price was great. Small bottle price for the big bottle.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very different than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve tried. It is perfect for summer because it has almost a beachy scent. It is neither floral nor fruity. It&#x27;s very different but also very lovely. Lasting power is great.</li>
    <li> When I first smelled this scent from an insert in a magazine, I immediately fell in love with it.  I love this scent.  It&#x27;s very sensuous and sexy and soft.  The lotion compliments it or can be worn alone.  I knew it was a hit when I was outside Wet Willie&#x27;s and a man walked up to me and complimented me several times about the sexy scent.  It was such a nice surprise to hear a studly man loved the scent as well.  Ladies, this is a must have.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and ordering it from Amazon was a breeze!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product.&lt;br /&gt;To me synthetic motor oil,  is more attractive.&lt;br /&gt;Motor oil lasts longer as this product goes bad too quickly&lt;br /&gt;As I say, to each his/her own.</li>
    <li> I think this is a lovely scent, soft and light and a bit sweet. It has too much of a vanilla undertone for me so I will not re purchase.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents. I get SO many compliments when I wear it. I personally think the scent is just the right strength. Not too much and not too little. It lasts throughout the day and can be a great day to night wear perfume.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ........good price.</li>
