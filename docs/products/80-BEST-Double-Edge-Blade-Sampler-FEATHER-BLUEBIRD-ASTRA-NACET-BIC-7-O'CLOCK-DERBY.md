### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>variety pack have me the best bang for my buck, with the widest variety of blades.</li>
      <li>If I had to choose best in class it would be the Feather&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>The closest shave, but not the best shave.</li>
      <li>knocked one star for this because I feel like they should include some type of Personna blade, with these it would be a perfect five stars.</li>
      <li>This is the best way to find out what brand blades work best with your razor and which feel best on your face.  </li>
      <li>This sampler should give me almost a year&#x27;s supply to cycle through &amp; learn what works best for me.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this item.</li>
      <li>Now to decide the one I like best.</li>
      <li>I wanted to mention the great customer service from this vendor (Wish4Star).</li>
      <li>Great shave, almost as close as Feather, but no irritation whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Great sample pack I found the two blades that I like from this pack and bought a 100 ct. of each</li>

      <li>A good selection to try.</li>
      <li>That is super service &amp; this a great deal on blades!</li>
      <li>Blades are really subjective so what may work for me may not work for you, so I won&#x27;t bore the reader with which ones worked for me best.</li>
      <li>Great sampler to find out what blades work best rather than buying too many of one brand only to find out you don&#x27;t like them.</li>
      <li>Overall good selection if you are trying to figure out whick blade is going to work best for you.</li>
      <li>The variety will help me hone in my safety razor to get the best shave possible.</li>
      <li>I have been lurking on many forums for DE Shaving to see what blades most people recommended.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly, better than the Platinum.</li>
      <li>years after purchasing this pack, I&#x27;m still working my way through the blades, shaving once or twice a week most of the time.</li>
      <li>the packaging was more consistent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an affordable sampler pack that combines cheaper blades (Derby, Astra) with more high-end blades (Gillette, Feather).</li>
      <li>they included more quality blades for the price and</li>
      <li>I was glad for a &#x27;duller&#x27; blade.  </li>
      <li>Okay.</li>
      <li>Great way to sample the differences between a large number of blades rather easily.  </li>
      <li>yes, though you have to work at it more and the shave is not quite as comfortable.  </li>
      <li>2 great shaves the 3rd was ok, no nicks</li>
      <li>Nice blade as well, though only really 2 good shaves no nicks</li>
      <li>Comes with a great assortment and you will definately find one or several blade brands you like in this grouping.</li>
      <li>are cheap and hold their edge for longer.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feels smooth.</li>
      <li>My expectation of any blade is two smooth shaves without nicks and irritation.  </li>
      <li>Only wish they added in some Merkur blades to try, but again, great value.</li>
      <li>This pack is a very economical choice as sampler packs go.</li>
      <li>With these blades and a good shaving soap and brush, you can get a great shave at a fraction of the cost of more expensive alternatives.  </li>
      <li>Not long after buying this, I purchased a 100-pack of Astra Superior Platinum blades</li>
      <li>And Gillette - similar to the Astras another good choice.</li>
      <li>This blade sampler is good for both beginners (can work way up from more forgiving blades to killer whale sharp blades) and intermediates (try something new!).</li>
      <li>This sampler will let you try out a large number of blades, but there is a lot of cheap filler in there.</li>
      <li>I have yet to try the Supermax blades or the Treet blades, but I do enjoy the Gillettes very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really nice to be able to buy a few from 5 or 6 manufacturers to take for test shaves.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the time and expense.</li>
      <li>more frequently help my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Feather Hi Stainless (black label, feather logo) - Great blade,</li>
      <li>Other than those 3, the others were all securely sealed in plastic so overall I am still happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(4) Blue Bird (blue label) - Really nice blade, got 2 great shaves and a 3rd decent shave, no nicks</li>
      <li>As a person who is relatively new to double edge shaving, this was a great way to try out a number of razors without buying way too many for me to use in the near future.  </li>
      <li>which I was glad for on numerous occasions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Of the part cut, it didn&#x27;t cut consistently or evenly.</li>
      <li>2nd shave was marginally better how I&#x27;m unsure.  </li>
      <li>So, first things first, the reason I&#x27;m writing this review is to provide some clarification.</li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m through with all the blades in this mixed bag I&#x27;ll try to post more details on the remaining brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This variety pack will make my recent switch to DE shaving even better.</li>
      <li>the 5 above, I&#x27;d gladly re-purchase any except the KAI&#x27;s or Derby&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>This sampler has most, if not all, the blades that experienced wet shavers prefer (blue bird, Astra, Derby, and especially Feathers!)  </li>
      <li>Being new to double edge shaving, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to go about finding the right blades for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also new to DE shaving &amp; took the advice to try many different blades.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about half way through right now and am glad I made the purchase.</li>
      <li>When I first started shaving with a double edged safety razor, I looked at a lot of variety packs of blades because everyone familiar with DE shaving recommend trying several different blades to find one that works best for a close shave on your individual face, with your individual technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>[x]&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Nacet Stainless</li>
      <li>Stainless-</li>
      <li>A bit of razorburn but not as much as Feather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also much easier.</li>
      <li>Derby blades, not so much, but</li>
      <li>[x]&lt;br /&gt;Astra Stainless [x]&lt;br /&gt;Feather</li>
      <li>Not as much razorburn either.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This sample pack really helped me figure out which blades</li>
      <li>far as they go, it&#x27;s pretty much exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>The feather is the sharpest, and I cut myself with it many times, while the platinum coated blades do not seem to be as sharp, but for a novice like me</li>
      <li>Background: new DE razor user, sensitive face with goatee, experienced wet shaver, former Mach 3 user.  </li>
      <li>I am new to DE wet shaving, and wanted to test as many quality blades as I could.  </li>
      <li>Straight razor gives the best and least raw shave, but safety razors are comparable.</li>
      <li>Feather, Derby, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock were the main ones.  </li>
      <li>Lasted a little more than two</li>
      <li>The razors were all there, looked new, and had the wax paper</li>
      <li>I am new to DE shaving, and I was told to buy a sampler pack because all blades shave</li>
      <li>First things first, I have extremely coarse facial hair.</li>
      <li>I decided to experiment with the old-style razor to see if it gave as good a shave as the new multi-bladed - and expensive - razors.  </li>
      <li>Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock Super Stainless (Green box) -</li>
      <li>x]&lt;br /&gt;Supermax Stainless Blue</li>
      <li>(I use either Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton  College or Aubrey Organic North Woods----Amazing stuff btw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>in all, I really wish they still made the Blue Bird.</li>
      <li>Pay particular attention to the Astras - my favorite due to starting out just sharp enough (and smooth) and REMAINING sharp for the longest (platinum blades last longer) and all while being reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>This seems to be a good variety of blades and I will not have to but blades again for at least a year and half.</li>
      <li>It is always extremely hard to get my face completely smooth even with multiple passes, using any blades or razor types (straight, safety, cartridge).</li>
      <li>Wanted to try out some new double edge blades from around the world.</li>
      <li>Shaves with those blades were decent for 2 shaves, no major irritation.  </li>
      <li>I have tried 1 blade from each of 5 of the brands so far with mixed results.  </li>
      <li>So far i am a big fan of Feather and Astra blades.</li>
      <li>I have only made it about 1/2 way through so far.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;BiC Chrome Platinum- Surprisingly good, but had some difficulty cutting the densest part my chin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s missing a couple of brands I&#x27;d like to try sometime, but so far this pack is really helping me figure out what I like.</li>
      <li>So far I like the Astral &amp; Derby blades, but I&#x27;m not far into the sampler pack.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this specifically because it has a few brands of blades I wanted to try.  Feather, Derby, Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock were the main ones.  I have tried 1 blade from each of 5 of the brands so far with mixed results.  Background: new DE razor user, sensitive face with goatee, experienced wet shaver, former Mach 3 user.  Prior blade experience were CVS store bought blades sometimes referred to as a generic Persona by some web sites.  Shaves with those blades were decent for 2 shaves, no major irritation.  My expectation of any blade is two smooth shaves without nicks and irritation.  I find for me changing the blades more frequently help my skin.&lt;br /&gt;(1) Feather Hi Stainless (black label, feather logo) - Great blade, 2 great shaves the 3rd was ok, no nicks/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;(2) KAI (platic sleeve, no markings on blade) - I almost threw the blade out after starting the first shave, very uncomfortable, 2nd shave was marginally better how I&#x27;m unsure.  I will try one more blade and if it&#x27;s as bad I will throw the remaining three out.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Derby Extra (green label, verticle packaging) - marginally better than the KAI for 2 shaves&lt;br /&gt;(4) Blue Bird (blue label) - Really nice blade, got 2 great shaves and a 3rd decent shave, no nicks/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;(5) Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock Super Stainless (Green box) - Nice blade as well, though only really 2 good shaves no nicks/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 5 above, I&#x27;d gladly re-purchase any except the KAI&#x27;s or Derby&#x27;s.  If I had to choose best in class it would be the Feather&#x27;s.  When I&#x27;m through with all the blades in this mixed bag I&#x27;ll try to post more details on the remaining brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Stephen</li>
    <li> I am new to DE wet shaving, and wanted to test as many quality blades as I could.  I have been lurking on many forums for DE Shaving to see what blades most people recommended.  This sampler has most, if not all, the blades that experienced wet shavers prefer (blue bird, Astra, Derby, and especially Feathers!)  I have only made it about 1/2 way through so far.  There was only one blade that I did not like at all.  So if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving, or if you are a veteran looking to try something different, pick up this pack, you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> This variety pack will make my recent switch to DE shaving even better. The variety will help me hone in my safety razor to get the best shave possible. The variety and price are great. My only complaint would be that 3 of the packets were not completely sealed, there was no plastic wrap and the boxes looked like they had been opened. The razors were all there, looked new, and had the wax paper but I didn&#x27;t want to chance it so I threw them out. Other than those 3, the others were all securely sealed in plastic so overall I am still happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am new to DE shaving, and I was told to buy a sampler pack because all blades shave differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this, but after trying out several blades I was really surprised at how different some of them are.  The feather is the sharpest, and I cut myself with it many times, while the platinum coated blades do not seem to be as sharp, but for a novice like me I was glad for a &#x27;duller&#x27; blade.  I also order a [[ASIN:B00112WRB6 Pinaud Styptic Pencil 0.25 oz pencil]] which I was glad for on numerous occasions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a better idea which blades I will order next (and in larger/less expensive) quantities.</li>
    <li> This was my second blade sampler back ordered. This pack is a very economical choice as sampler packs go. I chose this one because of that reason and because it had several brands I hadn&#x27;t tried yet, namely Derby, Astra, and Gillette. I have yet to try the Supermax blades or the Treet blades, but I do enjoy the Gillettes very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an affordable sampler pack that combines cheaper blades (Derby, Astra) with more high-end blades (Gillette, Feather). This one is also special because you get to try out the deadly Feather blades, although note that it is the black Hi-Stainless and not the yellow pack even though they are very similar (the Feathers included are discontinued and will be gone in the near future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked one star for this because I feel like they should include some type of Personna blade, with these it would be a perfect five stars. This blade sampler is good for both beginners (can work way up from more forgiving blades to killer whale sharp blades) and intermediates (try something new!). Thank you and have a great day.</li>
    <li> Overall good selection if you are trying to figure out whick blade is going to work best for you. So far i am a big fan of Feather and Astra blades.</li>
    <li> So, first things first, the reason I&#x27;m writing this review is to provide some clarification. The title says it contains 75 blades, while the description mentions it only contains 60. If it&#x27;s a dealbreaker for you, then rest assure that I received 75 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as they go, it&#x27;s pretty much exactly what it says. It&#x27;s a good variety. It&#x27;s missing a couple of brands I&#x27;d like to try sometime, but so far this pack is really helping me figure out what I like.</li>
    <li> I decided to experiment with the old-style razor to see if it gave as good a shave as the new multi-bladed - and expensive - razors.  The answer is yes, though you have to work at it more and the shave is not quite as comfortable.  With these blades and a good shaving soap and brush, you can get a great shave at a fraction of the cost of more expensive alternatives.  This pack has lasted me a long time and is still going.</li>
    <li> This sample pack really helped me figure out which blades I like and which ones I don&#x27;t.  Not long after buying this, I purchased a 100-pack of Astra Superior Platinum blades and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  :)</li>
    <li> Wanted to try out some new double edge blades from around the world. It&#x27;s really nice to be able to buy a few from 5 or 6 manufacturers to take for test shaves. Blades are really subjective so what may work for me may not work for you, so I won&#x27;t bore the reader with which ones worked for me best.</li>
    <li> I take it from the other reviews (which I failed to read before purchase) you basically get random brands of blades. I didn&#x27;t get any KAI blades, and I didn&#x27;t get the Zorrik (?) mentioned in the picture. I did get a total of 80 blades, but thought I was cheated until I realized Trig is 10 blades in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they included more quality blades for the price and the packaging was more consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gilette Silver Blue [x]&lt;br /&gt;Astra Stainless [x]&lt;br /&gt;Feather [x]&lt;br /&gt;Derby [x]&lt;br /&gt;Gilette 7&#x27;oclock [x]&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Nacet Stainless [x]&lt;br /&gt;Astra Platinum [x]&lt;br /&gt;Trig x 10 [x]&lt;br /&gt;Zorrik [o]&lt;br /&gt;SuperMax Platinum [x]&lt;br /&gt;Bic [x]&lt;br /&gt;Treet Plat [x]&lt;br /&gt;Gilette Goal [x]&lt;br /&gt;Supermax Stainless Blue&lt;br /&gt;SuperMax Vidyut [x]&lt;br /&gt;Blue Bird [x]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received no Zorrik, but I did receive a Nacet Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve managed to use a few boxes. First things first, I have extremely coarse facial hair. It is always extremely hard to get my face completely smooth even with multiple passes, using any blades or razor types (straight, safety, cartridge). Straight razor gives the best and least raw shave, but safety razors are comparable. It&#x27;s also much easier. I have really tough thick facial skin, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about knicks or cuts (unless I&#x27;m using a straight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use oil based shaving lotion, which affects the quality of my shave. If you use a different cream than I, you will have different razor feel and blade longevity. (I use either Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton  College or Aubrey Organic North Woods----Amazing stuff btw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of those I&#x27;ve used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather- The closest shave, but not the best shave. Leaves my face a little raw and it pulls when shaving. Doesn&#x27;t feels smooth. Blade might last half a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Bird- Great shave, almost as close as Feather, but no irritation whatsoever. Three shaves out of this one. Unfortunately I hear they don&#x27;t make them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gilette Silver Blue- Okay. A bit of razorburn but not as much as Feather. Close, but had some difficulty on my chin and sideburns. Lasted two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra Platinum- Terrible. Absolutely Terrible. The blade didn&#x27;t even last a few passes and maybe half my cheek. Of the part cut, it didn&#x27;t cut consistently or evenly. No nicks, but some bad razorburn in that spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra Stainless- Surprisingly, better than the Platinum. Blade lasted almost an entire shave, but it still cut unevenly. Not as much razorburn either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BiC Chrome Platinum- Surprisingly good, but had some difficulty cutting the densest part my chin. Thought I knicked myself with this one, though I guess I didn&#x27;t. Lasted a little more than two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really wish they still made the Blue Bird. But I&#x27;ll have to stick with Either Gilette Silverblue or Feather.</li>
    <li> When I first started shaving with a double edged safety razor, I looked at a lot of variety packs of blades because everyone familiar with DE shaving recommend trying several different blades to find one that works best for a close shave on your individual face, with your individual technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This variety pack have me the best bang for my buck, with the widest variety of blades. It also came with all the premium blades pictured and almost all of the exact blades pictured, which apparently is not true of some other variety packs which reportedly substitute cheaper blades for the premium ones or give multiples of some packs (less variety than advertised). To me, most of the blades seem pretty similar, with the exception of Derby, which seemed surprisingly dull given its widespread acclaim, and Feather, which was so sharp that I sliced and diced my face with every little accidental nick--minor incidents which would not have even left a scratch with the other blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years after purchasing this pack, I&#x27;m still working my way through the blades, shaving once or twice a week most of the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also new to DE shaving &amp; took the advice to try many different blades. This package is just the ticket. So far I like the Astral &amp; Derby blades, but I&#x27;m not far into the sampler pack. This sampler should give me almost a year&#x27;s supply to cycle through &amp; learn what works best for me. I wanted to mention the great customer service from this vendor (Wish4Star). There was a small problem with my order that I followed up on via email on a Saturday afternoon &amp; I received a response within the hour! I never expected anything that fast and, once I explained, I received the corrected order within a few days. That is super service &amp; this a great deal on blades!</li>
    <li> Great way to sample the differences between a large number of blades rather easily.  Arrived on time with the sample blades expected.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a good variety of blades and I will not have to but blades again for at least a year and half. Now to decide the one I like best.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to find out what brand blades work best with your razor and which feel best on your face.  Definitely worth the time and expense.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to sample a variety of blades and find one or more that are perfectly suited to you.</li>
    <li> Great sample pack I found the two blades that I like from this pack and bought a 100 ct. of each</li>
    <li> Being new to double edge shaving, I wasn&#x27;t sure how to go about finding the right blades for me.  This sample pack is just what I needed.  I&#x27;m about half way through right now and am glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great sampler to find out what blades work best rather than buying too many of one brand only to find out you don&#x27;t like them. Comes with a great assortment and you will definately find one or several blade brands you like in this grouping.</li>
    <li> A good selection to try. MUST try blades: Astra Platinum, Gilette Platinum, Derby, Bluebird, Feather. Be especially careful when first trying the Feather blades. Bluebirds start sharp, but dull quick. Derby blades, not so much, but are cheap and hold their edge for longer. Pay particular attention to the Astras - my favorite due to starting out just sharp enough (and smooth) and REMAINING sharp for the longest (platinum blades last longer) and all while being reasonably priced. And Gillette - similar to the Astras another good choice.</li>
    <li> Some blades are good, and some are bad. That&#x27;s what I want out of a sampler, variety. I would have been disappointed if all the blades shaved the same.</li>
    <li> Lot to choose from, great value. Only wish they added in some Merkur blades to try, but again, great value.</li>
    <li> As a person who is relatively new to double edge shaving, this was a great way to try out a number of razors without buying way too many for me to use in the near future.  Very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> This sampler will let you try out a large number of blades, but there is a lot of cheap filler in there.</li>
