<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My manicurist recommended I use this because I have horribly dry cuticles with all the weather changes.  I love that it keeps my cuticles looking good hours after I put it on. I put a dab in the mornings and in the evenings. I prefer it to vitamin E and cuticle oil. I&#x27;m so glad he recommended it!</li>
    <li> This is a great nail and cuticle oil. I have the small .125 oz jar and it has lasted a long time since you don&#x27;t need much. I always put it on right after I remove shellac because my nail beds are dry and this will instantly put moisture back into them. I would recommend putting it on a couple of times a day after you remove shellac and then after a few days you can go to nightly before bed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Still looking for that amazing cuticle oil, this wasn&#x27;t it. This helps, but my cuticles still aren&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> Great price at amazon. I have very dry cuticles, so this product saved my hands! They look great now.</li>
    <li> When I use it faithfully my nails are in a LOT better condition!</li>
    <li> PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good (like a yummy almond christmas cookie and dried fruit), goes on easily with a brush applicator, not expensive, soaks in fairly quickly (about 5 minutes for it to absorb completely).&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really feel that moisturizing after it&#x27;s completely absorbed. Comparable with any other oil based cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times today and so far it&#x27;s comparable to all my other cuticle oils.  Not any better, not any worse.  If it does miracles on my cuticles with my continuous use I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve used this product for a really long time now and haven&#x27;t seen any amazing results.  It&#x27;s still just an average cuticle oil to me.  Nothing super special.  I actually use Lush co. ultra balm as my cuticle oil now since it feels more moisturizing and lasts much longer.  I still give this product a B rating because it does it&#x27;s job but needs to be reapplied often for effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Great Product and does what&#x27;s expected.  Good ingredients and works great on skin and nails.  Highly recommend and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple weeks and although I liked that it made my nails looks supple and shiny, it also made my nails peel. This was especially problematic with my toenails as I keep them fairly short. I had difficulty cutting them without the nails cracking and peeling at the edges. This made my toenails look a bit &#x27;hacked at&#x27;, which is a less than attractive look!</li>
    <li> After doing some research on the net on how to prolong my shellac manicure, I purchased this Solar Oil.  I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day on top of and behind my nails since my last manicure.  Tomorrow it will be three weeks and I have no chips or flakes.  My nails look fantastic.  I&#x27;m so excited to be able to make the manicure last this long.  The oil has an almond-like scent and I know it&#x27;s good for cuticle and nail health too.</li>
    <li> Works better than I ever thought it would. I work with paper all day long, which dries my cuticles very badly. After just a few days of applying this twice a day they are back to looking normal. I still apply about every other day. Usually at night watching TV, so it has time to soak in with out my hands getting wet.</li>
    <li> Great cuticle oil. Just as pictured.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for your nails and cuticals.    Use a little every day - especially after a shower or bath - and you will see the improvement !</li>
    <li> Solar Oil is the best cuticle softener that I have ever used.  I apply it daily just to the base of my nails.  It works wonders on dry cuticles.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My review is ambivalent.  I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this.  My cuticles are dry looking, grow thick, and are jaggedy.  When I put the product on my cuticles, it makes them look MUCH BETTER.  But, if I don&#x27;t put it on my cuticles look horrendous like they always do.  Not sure if this product is designed to condition cuticles such that you only use it as needed or whether this is a product that you are supposed to put on every day so that your cuticles look great.  If it&#x27;s the latter, then I have no beef.  I&#x27;m just not the type of person to attend to my appearance every day.  I mean, I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day or do my hair every day nor do I put moisturizer on my skin every day.  I just don&#x27;t.  So having to put this stuff on every day is not appealing, although I&#x27;ve started to carry it around with me and when I remember, I put some on.  My cuticles look great when I put it on.    But, if you look at the ingredients there isn&#x27;t anything special about them.  I think when I run out of this stuff I will pour extra virgin olive oil in the bottle and use that.  It will work just as well.</li>
    <li> Love this cuticle oil. My nail bed and cuticles look better than they ever have since I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it on twice a day and it nourishes your cuticles and nail bed, I haven&#x27;t had a hang nail since I started using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it smells like cherries and almond. Yum.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change after use</li>
    <li> I use the solar oil about once a day, I like it. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to as I&#x27;ve never used anything previously. Smells good.</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly and the product is doing what I needed. My split nail is improving. A long waited surprise since it has been split for 28 years.</li>
    <li> I was given a small bottle of this and loved it, so now I got more.  It makes a huge improvement in how my nails look.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of the Solaroil.  It lasts a long time and really makes my toe nails and finger nails look and feel better.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. My nails were dry and starting to chip and crack. The oil has helped immensely. I will purchase more of this oil.</li>
    <li> I have been on high dose of anti biotics for a few months now, and probably as a side effect, my nails have been peeling, and have become weak and darker. This oil has helped change the color back to the natural color and has actually made the nail bed clear, and less ridged. the peeling hasnt stopped, i think it will take more time. I will continue to use it and i have the faith the peeling will eventually slow down. its time taking but i think its gonna happen. i use this on my finger nails and toe nails, once a day. Twice or thrice when possible.&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, i dont do professional manicures or pedicures where the cuticle of the nails is peeled off. Just simple at home manicures, when possible.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my nails/cuticles for the last 12 years and I love it as much today as the first day I was introduced to it. it works very well and stay on all day. and it smells so Good :)</li>
    <li> One word..amazing! This stuff works</li>
    <li> I must say this product works wonders on your nails. Helps repair damaged nails/cuticles and if used daily keeps them in beautiful condition. A little bit goes a long way! I am now doing my own mani/pedi at home but almost every nail salon I have been to uses this product so I figure if the pros use it then it must be good.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from Beauty It Is and received the item quickly and at a great price.</li>
    <li> The picture shows the larger round bottle, this is actually a more petite bottle the size of a nail polish bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, it arrived lightning fast, unbroken, and is the high quality product I expected. My dry nails drink it up.</li>
    <li> My natural nails have been curling away from my acrylics.  Since applying solar oil to my cuticles, I have had little to no issues with nail curling.  Yayyyy!!!</li>
    <li> swear by this product</li>
    <li> I love Solar Oil because it&#x27;s so nourishing and rich. My nails and cuticles get very dry, so this product is a miracle! It soaks in quickly and makes my hands look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I love about solaroil: you only need a drop or two to swipe over fingers or toes to &amp;#34;magically&amp;#34; repair those ragged cuticles. Looks like you just got a mani or pedi!</li>
    <li> I love SolarOil for treating the cuticles and keeping them from cuts in dry weather or from abuse inside my gardening gloves.  However, I gave it only 4 stars as I was disappointed in this product fulfillment as it did not come as pictured.  I specifically chose this company because of the round bottle.  Instead, they shipped the upright bottle design and I was specifically trying NOT to get that bottle design again.  So I felt like there was some &#x27;false advertising.&#x27;  If all they have is the upright bottle design, then they need to update the photo.</li>
    <li> Super product - rub it into your nail beds !! Healthy treat for the nails.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Great for cuticles.  I cannot think of anything else to say to get the required words into this review.  So there you have it!</li>
    <li> I have thick cuticles that grow quickly.&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t push them back twice a week they look gross and ragged. I&#x27;ve tried everything and swore by Vitamin E oil, but it&#x27;s expensive and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Seacret nail oil works okay, but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as SolarOil. I&#x27;ve been applying it to my nails once a day and pushing back every other day. There are no rips, tears, scratches or anything else. Even my toenails look great after one application!&lt;br /&gt;This is the last cuticle oil product you&#x27;ll ever need. Whether you have thick, overgrown cuticles or ones that rarely need attention SolarOil will make your nails look fresh and professionally manicured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this now!</li>
    <li> This stuff works...I purchased both the small and large sized bottles so I can always have a supply as I use this product every day.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen as much improvement yet but I&#x27;m not consistent with applying it either.  I do like the oil better than using a cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this daily since March and haven&#x27;t seen a significant improvement in my nails.  But it does soften the cuticles .</li>
    <li> On my fingernails it seems to have started shredding my cuticles, I used it twice daily on clean nails. It has done better on my toenails which were kind of icky  it has made them look better. Overall I&#x27;d give it a 3 for fingernails. A 4.5 for toenails.</li>
    <li> This smells great and seems moisturizing. I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference with my nails though that may be because if the harsh weather where I live.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for how it turns your nails yellow.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I have used it for years. I use to do nails for a living, and always used solar oil.</li>
    <li> Received this in two days from Brooklyn,NY&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is AMAZING,I was just lookin for a simple cuticle oil and felt this was a little pricy,but a little bit goes an extremely long way. I also LOVE the smell. :) I also love how you can set it up two different ways! One is the standard way and the other is another end where you can have it tilted to your advantage! Very awesome!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> Good use for my dogs paws nightly so they don&#x27;t get dried out.</li>
    <li> This oil works so well for my cuticles and smells so nice, I bought a few more so Id have one in my room, in my purse and by the tv. Really like this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great. There is a trick though, you need to use it everyday consistantly I suggest in the morning and at night. If you continually do that routine your nails will be strong and beautiful. If you break the cycle you will see a difference like your skin around your cuticles will start to peel but using it everday it wont happen. Good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Solar Oil since 1986 and love it - I&#x27;ve never found anyting better. This product uses a rice oil and is very fine and soaks into your skin quickly.</li>
    <li> This product definitely deserves its cult-classic status. I am big on at-home manicures, but I hate pushing back and trimming my cuticles. The result always looks amazing, but it gives me an icky feeling. By applying solar oil twice a day, my cuticles look naturally moisturized and neat, and don&#x27;t require much attention during manicures. A lot of people rave about the smell - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special, just the scent of almond extract, but I guess it is light and lovely. I love solar oil regardless of the scent, and it is a must-have for nice nails.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful, feels wonderful and keeps my nails looking wonderful.</li>
    <li> My manicurist uses this product and I decided to get some for myself. It works great on nails and keeps your cuticles soft and supple. Love it!</li>
    <li> If my ridged chipping peeling problem is due to dryness this did not help but did smooth out my cuticles and certainly smells good. So guess I would say it did not perform as promised.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and find it helps keep my cuticles from drying out and getting rough.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I bought this after much research on cuticle oils, and this products was made to sound like a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; tonic. I can&#x27;t see were it works any better if as good as some other oils that I have gotten at the local discount store</li>
    <li> Non greasy and really absorbs into the skin fast. I had really dried out cuticles and nails that made my nails look ugly no matter what type of poish I used. This stuff may seem pricey for some but it last a long time because all u need is a little bit. I read a review that said if u don&#x27;t use this product everyday that your skin n cuticles will begin to peel. That is true. I didn&#x27;t use it for like 3 days n the skin around my cuticles began to peek. Not very bag but enough to look ugly. Other tha that I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My nail lady introduced me to this wonderful product.  She told me to put it on my cuticle and rub in both morning and evening for a moisturizer.  I no longer have my nails manicured but I continue to use this product, especially in the cold winter when nails, skin and cuticles tend to be dry from the cold and dryness of winter.  Recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use this brand for my cuticles to help with the dryness however, was substituted another brand which I didn&#x27;t care much for. So to rate this brand that I didn&#x27;t receive although, have bought is indeed a good quality of oil.</li>
    <li> I love this oil -- I have tried a few brands and I definitely like this one the best. It isn&#x27;t sticky, it has a great scent, and the bottle closes tightly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about leaking in your purse, etc. If I am ever needing a manicure, I just use this stuff and feel like I stepped out of the salon!</li>
    <li> I use this once or twice a day after I wash my hands, or after I do my nails. I like it because it absorbs easily, and though it has a pleasant almond fragrance, it is not heavily fragranced, which is important for me especially because of my sensitive skin, though we all need to avoid irritating ingredients in skin care products--especially ones, like fragrance, that have no function for skin, nails, or hair. I intend to get more applicators of Solar Oil for locations around the house as I empty everything else, and buy in more bulk!</li>
    <li> I think this solar oil moisturizes the cuticles and nails very well. Not too oily and does the job well. I ended up buying more for my mom and a friend.</li>
    <li> I use it regularly in the evening before bed and my nails and cuticle look healthy.  Worth every penny. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many nail products because my nails take a beating on a daily basis. I wash my hands so much and don&#x27;t think about wearing gloves when using household cleaners. I saw a difference with this oil in days. Add a little Biotin to your intake and your nails will improve too. Just take care to rub this in well and add a lotion on top...I think the oil can get onto fabric.</li>
    <li> My nail looks and feels healthier from use of this product what was recommended to me by a friend.  On many medication and they have taken a toll on my nails.</li>
    <li> I started using SolarOil when I got my first Shellac manicure... the salon recommended that I apply this oil nightly.  And then I got hooked.  It&#x27;s a great cuticle oil with a nice almond scent and it doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers feeling too greasy.  Now I carry a bottle in my work bag so I can apply the oil whenever my cuticles are feeling dry.  A once or twice daily application is all you need.</li>
    <li> I bit my nails ever since I could. My cuticles were never taken care of and were very dry. This stuff is seriously like magic, and my cuticles have made a complete 180. If I don&#x27;t use it for one or two days I can tell a difference. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Good got on time no problems</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of this wonderful product.  I keep one at work to use during the day since I wash my hands numerous times.  Helps tremendously with the great condition of my cuticles between manicures.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail/cuticle oil.  It smells fantastic, like almonds.  It makes my nails and cuticles much more healthy from dryness.  I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s the only one I use.</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with weak nails for many years now.  My sister told me about this product, I started it a week ago, so I don&#x27;t know how it will do over time.</li>
    <li> Hands down, Solar Oil is the best cuticle oil on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, the blend of oils in this are the best at healing and preventing split cuticles, hangnails, dry nails, chipped polish, broken nails, toe fungus, separation of acrylic overlays, all kinds of problems. I never find any other oil, lotion or cuticle oil works as well, especially on my problem hands which really get dry cuticles and sometimes even eczema around my nails and under the nail edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked in a salon for 15 years doing skin care &amp; nails, and this was the number one product I recommended to all nail clients to buy. Not only was it good for the skin, it actually sinks through the polish and artifical nails so that these things stay on better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually buy multiple bottles at a time and keep one in each room of the house so wherever I am, I can put some on - after doing dishes, while watching TV, and right before bed. Otherwise, I get painful dry skin. Amazon has great prices on it so I can afford to store them around the house. Most people could probably just keep one by the bed and do it before going to sleep. (also a good time for intensive foot lotion, which I also keep next to the bed - right before going to sleep, I lotion up hands and feet so it can sink in during the night; Aveda makes great therapeutic hand &amp; foot lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on application: Brush on cuticles and under the nail edge, massage the oil in to the skin, the nail, and the end of the finger under the nail. It won&#x27;t work nearly as well if you don&#x27;t massage each finger/nail. Also, do the oil before lotion because the oil is applied with a brush that could get contaminated by a greasy lotion, and the lotion will seal in the healing oil.</li>
    <li> This is the best product. Love it. I use it on my hands and feet. Makes my skin around toe nails and fingernails healthier.</li>
    <li> I use this every time i do my manicure. It does moisturize my nails and softens the cuticles. My nails are looking healthier now.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes great and smells sooo goood!!! Love that cherry almond scent. Just like the jergen&#x27;s cherry almond but on your cuticles. Very happy. Try to use every day and cuticles are softer and less hangnails.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of lines in my nails and read somewhere that it was caused by dry nail bed (yeah, like wrinkles in my nail bed :|)&lt;br /&gt;This oil is really great, easy to apply, nice smell. My nails have improved a lot (new nail growth is smoother). Other products didn&#x27;t give me results like this one</li>
    <li> I bought this from a fashion magazine recommendation.It doesn&#x27;t drip and my cuticles look great! I certainly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just need to remember to USE it!  It is vital for keeping the skin around the nail bed soft and manageable.  My hands get so dry no matter how much lotion or whatever brand I use (I LOVE Philosophy products!) but for some reason my hands are not very cooperative but if I would be more consistent with this product, I&#x27;m sure I would have better results!  Thanks Amazon for having the people available to make these item accessible!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my cuticles and nails.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my cuticles soft and it helps keep my nails strong too.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry nails and ran across an old bottle of Solar Oil.  So glad I bought more.  Buy some.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for me.  After using it every night for 2 weeks, there wasn&#x27;t any change to my cuticles.  They were still as dry as before.  I would recommend you save your money on the product.</li>
    <li> One of my top picks.  Just a few dabs while watching TV leave cuticles soft.  Especially during this past harsh Northeast winter.</li>
    <li> Dryness and roughness were gone in seconds. I have 4 bottles; one at work, two at home, and one in my purse.</li>
    <li> Solar oil had been recommended by a local salon.  This is the exact product I wanted and the seller shipped it out immediately.  I had it quickly.  The price was right and I got free shipping.  I would not hesitate to use this seller again!</li>
    <li> Was introduced to Solar Oil about 15 years ago. Have used it ever since. This was a good price on Amazon along with free shipping. Hard to locate in the stores around me now. Helps keep my nails moisturized ... especially in the winter. I have thin peeling nails and Solar Oil helps make them stronger somehow. Love it!</li>
    <li> I saw a tremendous different after only one night.  Very easy to use and takes only a second or two to apply.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money, does absolutely nothing to better your nails. Does not do as stated. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product  again!</li>
    <li> Good product-Good price-Good Service! I&#x27;ll buy from this seller again and again. I like nail oil it dries the polish faster and keeps your cuticles looking good after a manicure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other oils for my nails and cuticles but this is my favorite.  It not only moisturizes my cuticles and surrounding area well but helps my shellac manicure last longer.  Plus it smells wonderful!  Will order again when this runs out.</li>
    <li> My friend turned me on to Solar Oil, and I must say, the stuff is awesome! I have the world&#x27;s ugliest hands. My cuticles are always a wreck.  Nothing has ever helped until this. It seems to penetrate and soften in a way no product ever has. Also, my nails seem to be stronger and have stopped peeling. My thumb nails had vertical ridges, and they have smoothed out, too.&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping a bottle of Solar Oil forever. I am tempted to buy a lifetime supply now, just in case it&#x27;s ever discontinued. If you have problem cuticles and nails, here is the solution. So glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> My nail tech has used this for years.  I wanted my own, a bottle at work and one at home.  I have not been dissapointed.  Same product which does exactly what its supposed to for dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> The biggest reason I am giving this a one star is I did not even get this item.  What was sent was in a totally different package and totally different bottle.  Also missing was the wonderful almond scent.  The scent of this oil is terrible.</li>
    <li> I am a dude, but I am really digging this stuff. It is a magic missile in the fight against hang nails. I have bit off or ripped enough hang nails to resort to putting on this stuff and I can honestly say I wish I had found this stuff much earlier! I recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have always had awful nails.  They peel and chip and crack constantly. I tried just about everything made to strengthen them.  I&#x27;ve use OPI nail strengthener on  them. I tried the Artificial Acrylics, which seemed to be doing well.  However everything I put on entailed removing it once a week with polish remover.  I used non acetone but my nails were awful.  They were so dry they were actually white.  Sheets of nail would peel off because I just can&#x27;t tolerate any of the polish removers.  Nothing I put on them to moisturize them helped at all.  And anything painted on them would occasionally peel and that took layers of nail with it.  I remembered my manicurist using solar oil when I had acrylics and decided to try it again.  After about 2 weeks of constant use my nails were no longer white or peeled.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a while now and this is the best they have ever looked or felt. They also don&#x27;t seem to bend as much as they used to and seem harder.  I am very pleased with this product.  It moisturizers the cuticles as well and the skin on my fingers.  In the winter my thumbs especially crack open and bleed.  It&#x27;s extremely painful and has happened year after year regardless of how much or which hand cream I  apply.  Not this winter.  That was a first. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough. And I have to say. My nails are, for the very first time ever, hard.  They barely bend anymore. I used to be able to bend them completely over and every time I bumped something, they broke.  I can&#x27;t believe that this simple oil actually made my nails hard for the first time in 54 years.  I use it after every time I wash my hands, before bed and several times while watching TV.  I keep it on the TV stand.  This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not a real cuticle oil person,But this oil has made great improvment in my nais and skin around my nail</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, but I found it too greasy to use. I suggest if you use it, apply it at night &amp; wear cotton gloves.</li>
    <li> My wife like there prices and services</li>
    <li> This has made my nails the nicest they have ever been., I ran out for a couple months and had to make sure to get some more. Definatley makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I try and remember to use this every day on the cuticles on my hands and feet.  Especially after a Shellac manicure...it&#x27;s a must.  It freshens up your nails and keeps your hands looking manicured (even when they haven&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 bottles.  I have to have one in each room.  They work very well on dry nails in the dry heat and cold winter.  I have been using this solar oil for 10 years, they work great!</li>
    <li> I use this to hydrate my nail after taking off the gel nails. Great to use around the cuticles also...and I have also used it on a few of my small scars with success !</li>
    <li> This is great, really works and smells great!</li>
    <li> I love to paint my nails but I am not crazy into adding more to my daily schedule. However, since I DO love to paint my nails, I like to keep them long and was seeking a way for them to chip less. I type on the computer all day long, and they were quite prone to cracking, breaking, and chipping. So I decided to take the plunge after stumbling upon this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months, more or less daily, and the results have been GREAT! It definitely took a few weeks to notice change, but I&#x27;ve had my current bout of polish on for 8 days with noticeable wear only appearing on day 6, and NO chips or cracks in my nails themselves at all! Usually I&#x27;d get that on day 2! I definitely recommend this product, and I consider it a permanent part of my nail care routine now.</li>
