      <li>Super rich cream that needs to be massaged in to penetrate, but once it does... Lasts all day!</li>
      <li>My dermatologist suggested this product, but I did not find that it help smooth my skin.</li>

      <li>Adding this super moisturizing cream to my routine has improved my skin&#x27;s comfort level</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an excellent hand cream overall and good for dry cuticles; but it only works if I remember to apply it.  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion for use on my body and the very sensitive skin on my face.</li>
      <li>Spend the extra money, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
      <li>I especially love to use it in winter, when my hands and feet get extra dry.</li>
      <li>It stays a bit moist on your skin all day and your makeup looks fresh and stays on.</li>
      <li>Love this product for my sensitive skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. It was recommended by my dermatologist to help my rosacea-prone skin. It is thick but absorbs well and really soothes my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream before and that is why I ordered it. I like it</li>
    <li> Love this product for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Nice face moisturizer</li>
    <li> I had been using [[ASIN:B004MUG8SM O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream :: 2 Pack]]and while that product is great, it just didn&#x27;t absorb that well for me.  This product absorbs right away and works great too.</li>
    <li> This is a generous amount of high quality cream that will help protect your skin through the winter.  It is thick and a little goes a long way.  Takes a bit to absorb, but for night time use, it is a really good choice.</li>
    <li> Working in an office with stacks of paper tends to draw the moisture out of my fingers and they split as if they have been cut with a knife!  While slathering vaseline on them at night and wearing cotton gloves while sleeping helps, it tends to be a bother.  I received a DML Forte sample from my dermatologist and after only one day of using it I was online searching for the product.  It definitely is the best non-greasy moisturizer I have ever purchased.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase of DML , love it for hands and legs, unscented too... try it..you might just love it too.</li>
    <li> I recommend it for the face, use it at night, especially if you are on isotretinoin.  Of course, it&#x27;s great for the rest of the body as well</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for people with sensitive skin.  At first it feels greasy but after it&#x27;s rubbed in the greaseness is gone. This hydrates the skin very effectively.  I was given samples at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and have used this ever since.  If you have dry and sensitive skin like I do I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for use on my body and the very sensitive skin on my face. It creates a moisture barrier and when I use this at night I wake up looking so refreshed no matter how little I have slept. I have combination dry/oily/sensitive/acne skin, and I think the products I used at night before were to harsh and drying. Adding this super moisturizing cream to my routine has improved my skin&#x27;s comfort level and I think because it is so healing my oil production is finally regulated. My skin was getting too dry from acne treatment products and my body and face were making extra oil to compensate. Now I just have very soft clear skin and only need an occasional clay face mask to keep my acne under control.</li>
    <li> Being an artist who loves gardening, my hands take a beating, but DML Forte is as good as L&#x27;Occitane hand cream, at half the price. I use this cream at bedtime every night, and it \\&quot;restores\\&quot; my hands by morning. It&#x27;s a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> love this product !!!!&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> I have used this product before ordering it on Amanzon.  I have Eczema and get sun burned really easy on my face.  Once my face is burned, everything I put on my face hurts it.  Forte did not irritate my face and helped it heal much faster.</li>
    <li> Was turned on to this moisturizing cream when I received a sample sized tube at my dermatologist&#x27;s office. Super rich cream that needs to be massaged in to penetrate, but once it does... Lasts all day! Heals any cracks/dry areas within a couple of applications. Fragrance free. Highly recommend. Do not waste your money on something you would buy at the supermarket. Spend the extra money, you&#x27;ll be glad you did! Buy multiple tubes to qualify for free shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product when my skin gets extremely dry or wind burned.  I find it to heavy for daily use but as a corrective measure it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  I use it on my face primarily but it&#x27;s so good for hands, arms and legs too.</li>
    <li> My 2 yr old daugther has eczema- we tried numerous lotions recommended by our pediatrician, however none improved her skin&#x27;s condition.  My dermatologist recommened this lotion for her and within days her skin was better!  Her skin hasn&#x27;t been this smooth since she was an infant.  She is much more comfortable as well!  I found it a great alternative to the suggested &#x27;cortizone&#x27; creams and the effects last;  We use only once a day now and her skin is still great!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a couple of little sample vials.  I was very pleased and had to hunt down a larger size. My skin is extremely sensitive (excema) and the DML Forte is moisturizing and soothing.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and there is no fragrance. I bought 4 tubes and I am very pleased with it</li>
    <li> A great birthday gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> I found out about this product from my dermatologist.  He had samples at his office.  Since I am a senior and my skin is more dry than it used to be, this product helps moisturize it much better than other products I have used at half the price.</li>
    <li> Currently on Acutane which dries out my skin like crazy--this lotion saved me... Got rid of the flaky dry skin after a week or two of use and leaves my skin soft but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have developed sensitivity to the additives in moisturizing products (my eyes burn from the fragrances or something, not sure quite why) and this product does not have any of those additives. It is non greasy, easy to use, and works as you&#x27;d want a product to - Just wish it came in larger, less expensive packages.</li>
    <li> The doctor&#x27;s office recommended this for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s great.  It never irritates; it feels completely inert and comforts and protects from dryness.</li>
    <li> My son was born with acute atopic dermatitis. This lotion is perfect for keeping him moisturized without causing him to break out. No fragrances, no allergens in the ingredients, no dyes. It&#x27;s a life saver! I wish it was stocked in local stores, though; I have to order it over the internet, and not only is it a bit pricey, but the shipping charges are killing me. But, it&#x27;s the only thing my son can use, so I willingly keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years on the recommendation of a dermatologist. Thick and creamy best for sensitive dry skin.</li>
    <li> My husband brought this back from a dermatology conference so I tried it. No perfumes. Not greasy but has a very nice feel to it. I use it under sunscreen, primers, and makep. Reasonably priced . Been  using it five years now.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I use it everyday on my face and it leaves it smooth.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and this is the one that works best for me and my psoriasis</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this cream after speaking with her dermatoligst.  I have an allergy to liquid soap on my hands in which they crack and the skin becomes brittle.  This cream is excellent in that is moisturizes while drying very quickly so you don&#x27;t have greasy hands.  I have tried many and none come close to this.  A little bit of cream goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Living in Arizona, I have dry skin.  Most products I have tried are good but not great.  This product is great.  I first got acquainted with it when I received a sample of it at my dermotolgist&#x27;s office.  Since then I have been using it regularly with satisfaction.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist&#x27;s assistant pulled me aside and gave me a few samples.  She said that they get samples of every cream under the sun and that this is the best.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got psoriasis on my fingers and palms.  This lotion has improved my condition considerably!  My dermatologist gave me a sample along with a prescription for Dovonex.  I used the DML Forte in between applications of my medicine.  About two months later, my psoriasis cleared up so much that I only needed DML Forte.    My husband does not normally like lotion, but this one really helps heal his hands after working outside all day.   The first time I bought this lotion I thought the price was a little high.  But, it is worth every penny.  This lotion is thick so you don&#x27;t need as much of it as other brands.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, meets all expectations</li>
    <li> Every time I see my dermatologist, she remarks about the dryness of the skin on my hands and again insists I use this.  Since it&#x27;s OTC, she can&#x27;t prescribe it; and for being OTC, I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my usual range of shopping.  It&#x27;s an excellent hand cream overall and good for dry cuticles; but it only works if I remember to apply it.  No distinctive scent.  Sinks into skin well.  Better that anything I&#x27;ve tried from the usual drug stores.  Contains petrolatum but no parabens.</li>
    <li> Great product. it is wonderfully hydrating with out fillers. Both my husband and I like it.  WE have used and still use your DML with sunscreen.  It was what led us to seek out the DML Forte.</li>
    <li> My daughter has acne prone sensitive skin that is extremely dry.  This lotion works perfectly for her. My skin is more on the oily side and this lotion is fabulous for me too. Its rich and creamy yet absorbs completely. I definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this product. Whatever makes her happy makes me happy.</li>
    <li> So far this is the only lotion that has cleared up our baby&#x27;s eczema!</li>
    <li> Great product. Recommended by my dermo. Have used for several years.  Only downside is no spf for day use but i apply cc and bb creams with spf to take care of that.</li>
    <li> Looking for an effective night cream that won&#x27;t break the bank?  Look no further.  DML Forte is it.  Comes in a tube (sanitary application!), great for sensitive skin, it really does the job.  I have rosacea and lots of moisturizers hurt me (are painful when applied).  Not DML Forte.  I wake up with soft, smooth, calm skin even in winter.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive and dry skin. Does not irritate. Great for the money.  I have very sensitive dry skin and it keeps it hydrated.</li>
    <li> It is the best to cure damaged skin.  When you first use it, it is a little greasy, but that quickly disappears.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find this product superior to other creams for the money.  My dermatologist suggested this product, but I did not find that it help smooth my skin.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, very moisturizing but too oily for my skin</li>
    <li> DML Forte was recommended by a Dermatologist. I have used it for a year and love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is perfect to use on your face if you have extremely dry skin. After you apply it, your makeup goes on so much smoother. It stays a bit moist on your skin all day and your makeup looks fresh and stays on. I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and was given a sample of this by her dermatologist. EXCELLENT product - great moisturizing but not greasy and absorbs well into the skin. She won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Product is the best hand cream made. Dependable supplier. Great price.</li>
    <li> My son has Ichthyosis, which is dry, scaly skin. His skin cells reproduce faster than normal. We have tried everything! From Vanicream to Aveno, to prescritions! Nothing has ever worked!! This showed a noticable difference in TWO DAYS! By the end of the week it was completly gone!</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I have ever used!</li>
    <li> DML samples were given by my Dermatologist and I&#x27;m hooked ever since. The product is perfume free and easy to apply. It moisturizes well and keeps my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Just right not heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> The cream makes the skin so smooth and is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that works wonders on chopped skin, especially on the fingers where during the winters crack and is painful. Don&#x27;t over do it, just a thin layer twice a day throughout the season will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;Also for itchy skin works well (that is if you don&#x27;t scratch your skin too much).</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisture that doesn&#x27;t dry up overnight.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, awesome service</li>
    <li> DML Forte handcream is excellent for your hands.  It restores the moisture in your skin and makes your hands look and feel much more youthful.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive and dry skin, so I use many of the DMS/DML products.  This cream is fine, but for the price, really no better than most hypoallergenic creams on the market.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  I cannot use anything on my face that contains scent or sun screen.  When I use moisturizer with either one or both, I feel as though my face is ablaze and that alternates with severe itchiness, and then my face gets these unattractive, huge, red blotches.  Even rewashing my face does not cure these ills, it can take a day or more for these symptoms to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist suggested that I try using this lotion and I am a big fan now.  It&#x27;s very thick, which is great for winter, and it is not causing me any issues.  And it is not clogging my pores and giving me acne either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review come Spring and Summer, as I am not sure how I&#x27;ll like this thick cream then.</li>
    <li> Yes, it does work better than anything that I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I had tried them all! I finally went to the dermatologist because I just couldn&#x27;t stand my cracked, bleeding, itchy skin anymore. This is what the doc recommended, and he gave me a tiny sample tube to try out. It worked great. Problem was, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, in any of the local stores. I finally went online and found it here on Amazon.  It&#x27;s more expensive than the other creams and lotions out there, but so worth it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! And here&#x27;s another thing-- I ordered it from this company, and ordered three tubes. It came yesterday and there were four tubes in the box! So I&#x27;m even happier!</li>
    <li> This product keeps the skin moisturized for 2-3 hours.  I use it on my face and it never feels or looks shiny or greasy.  I use it on my hands for dryness and after 2+ hours I can still tell it&#x27;s on my skin.</li>
    <li> best lotion we have found for our daughter&#x27;s eczema.  we had tried probably 15 different types of lotion&#x27;s, some specifically advertised for eczema, and this one has by far the best results</li>
    <li> Perfect for extremely dry, but highly sensitive skin.  It is NOT greast and does not stain clothing.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This product does not work as i expected. It gave me acne and rashes.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this stuff  - he received small tube from his dermatologist - could not find at drug store and i found it on Amazon - great great stuff !  highly recommend for those hard to get rid of rashes.</li>
    <li> Product is nice&lt;br /&gt;Like the feel of it.  Takes the fell of dry skin away.&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey..but would recommend it to friends and anyone.else.</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle for DML forte a few years ago because my dermatologist recommended it to use alongside powerful medication I was on for severe breakouts. Even though it&#x27;s all clear now I continue to use DML at nights and some days too, it is the best.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s heavy, doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  Cheapest place to get it. Will be back soon for more.</li>
    <li> This does a wonder job of moisturizing dry skin, especially if you&#x27;re allergic to glycerin and lanolin.  it has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, it soaks into skin right away and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a tacky or slippery feeling.  I especially love to use it in winter, when my hands and feet get extra dry.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used.  I have severe winter dry skin and itch itch itch.  Usually I resort to prescription ointments, but this lotion helps keep everything at bay.  It&#x27;s a little greasy so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on your hands during the day if you type on a keyboard all day (like I do), but the benefits are so great, I can&#x27;t even take a star away for that.  My only wish is that they sold it in a larger container.</li>
    <li> ok for body, too thick for face</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best heavy lotion for face I have ever used, and have been using it for literally years.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product, absolutely scent free, moisturizes well even in the dead of winter, not greasy. I buy it over and over.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for five years and I love it. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It is not expensive for a night creame and does not have alot of chemicals in it. Would recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I use this on my face, neck, and hands every night before bed. It is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t cause any irritations or break-outs. I also like that it unscented and sinks in well. I do not use it under makeup, since it doesn&#x27;t provide a good layer for the makeup to ahere to.</li>
    <li> Perfect moisture for delicate and finicky faces.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST AND I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR SEVERAL YEARSM WITH GOOD RESULTS</li>
    <li> I had some allergic reactions to a couple lotions so after a bit of research, this lotion was recommended as a good hypoallergenic face lotion. I did not have a reaction to this lotion--not even a tiny bit so for that I am grateful. However, this lotion is just too heavy for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just did a face mask and my face, although it felt smooth and tight, was a little dry. I put this lotion on and had it on for about an hour or so but then the greasy feeling became too much and I washed it off my face with water. My skin feels great. This lotion is like a deep conditioner for the face. If your face is dehydrated, you can put this on for a bit and then wash it off and your skin will feel nice and hydrated again. It is just too thick to keep it on for any length of time. Once you wash it off it does leave your skin feeling quite soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely a great moisturizer and I am sure it works wonders on any other dry part of the body but it shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as a product that can be used on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it doesn&#x27;t work as a face lotion, I will continue to use it as an occasional &amp;#34;deep conditioner&amp;#34; for my skin that I will wash off after a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you looking for a lotion to use anywhere other than your face, I am sure you will find it to be very hydrating and definitely hypoallergenic.</li>
    <li> The DML forte is a very good product for dry and split conditions on face and hands.  The delivery time was very quick and the product arrived in great condition.  We are extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Good, good, good, 17 more words required, good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,</li>
    <li> I buy one per winter. Not greasy. Prevents dry hands very well. Don&#x27;t need to use much</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry and she suggested that I try it (gave me a sample).  I use it on my face when I don&#x27;t expect to be out in the sun (when I use the DML daily facial moisturer with SPF 25).  Had been using a department store brand but when I disclosed this, I was told to throw it away ($$OUCH) as it contains alcohol which is absolutely NOT a positive benefit for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is rather expensive cream, but OK...it said not to put it near your eyes.  I also bought Vanicream at the same time and LOVE it more than this, and you get a lot more for the money!  My dermatologist recommended both this one and Vanicream...I would go with the Vanicream...</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer. My dermatologist insists this is the ONLY one to use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Prevents dry skin.</li>
