### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a good clean-feeling gel for light-to-medium hold.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Looks good in his hair</li>
      <li>Maybe its because of the ginseng keeping my scalp from drying out, but whatever reason, I love it!</li>
      <li>Also kind of smells a lot nicer than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; men&#x27;s staying products.</li>
      <li>Also has a light, pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Good clean gel.</li>
      <li>Maybe if they would have a used a jar design, it would work better.</li>
      <li>:).  </li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love about it?</li>
      <li>When will hair product companies and deodorant makers learn that many of us don&#x27;t wanted scented products?  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find many alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an excellent replacement (actually holds better and longer than B5, which was top notch).</li>
      <li>I tried this product because I wanted a gel that was more organic and had fewer chemicals.  </li>
      <li>If you want better hold, you need to use a lot of product.</li>
      <li>my husband is very satisfied with the hair gel ,the aroma is very delicate ,leaves hair soft not oily, this product is the best for hair 100% excellent .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for light/medium holds and it looks and feels very natural.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to hold up your mohawk, but it&#x27;s pretty good stuff for light to medium styling.</li>
      <li>A great natural product.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp or leave any build-up or residue, and washes out easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a more natural option for hair care products.</li>
      <li>The gel is fine, specially because you feel your hair clean.</li>
      <li>While it doesn&#x27;t have quite the holding power of some of the chemically-loaded gels, it does a good enough job for me.  </li>
      <li>But overall we are very satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>One of the best natural styling products I&#x27;ve tried, but you need to use A LOT to achieve a firm hold.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, and maybe it&#x27;s my hair type, but you need a good bit to really get hold.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>I should have tested it more before writing my initial review.</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>This stuff stays in my husbands hair the whole day and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
      <li>This is about the only Aubrey hair gel available, now that they&#x27;ve deep-sixed B5 Design Gel.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
      <li>I bought this stuff because being a male in my late 20s, I noticed I seemed to be losing more and more hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;He will only use a product that leaves his hair soft versus stiff, that smells more natural versus like cologne or chemicals, and easily washes off his hands.  </li>
      <li>Worth a shot, especially if your hair isn&#x27;t too stubborn.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The gel is so watery, that as long as you open the cap, without even pressing on the tube it, there is more than needed amount trying to find its way our of the tube.</li>
      <li>Because of this, it is not travel friendly and it is not a very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This product was diluted by water and completely unusable.</li>
      <li>Love this gel, a little bit goes a long way, quality with no flaking and all natural.  </li>
      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s a little pricey for the quantity, but then I also suppose it&#x27;s worth it for the natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not for someone who wants a harder spiky look and feel.</li>
      <li>My husband has fine, thick, short hair and this is the only hair gel he likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s organic and clean but hate that we have to lay the bottle down as the gel is really watery and starts coming out with out having to squeeze.</li>

<li> , it lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> It takes the size of a fifty cent piece to create the wet slicked back look, which he doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
<li> The gel is not strong, it is soft, so you can&#x27;t use it to design your hairstyle.</li>
<li> I have tried 2 other vegan gels and came back to this one.</li>
<li> I let it air dry and then leave it alone.</li>
<li> It only takes the size of a nickel to keep his hair from frizzing and the stray hairs down versus sticking up.  </li>
<li> Will never use any other hair gel as long as they keep making this one!</li>
<li> No plastic wet look</li>
<li> the hair looks wet but not achieved harden</li>
<li> I always wet my hands and use a nickel to quarter size amount and run it through then comb after.</li>
<li> Too bad, because the gel itself holds the hair well and is pretty much natural.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s organic without any of the other brands chemicals...</li>
<li> my hair is black</li>
<li> That being said, I decided to try hair gel for when it gets a little longer.</li>
<li> I received this product within a few days from the Amazon marketplace vendor and even with shipping, it was cheaper than buying it at a store in a fancy mall.</li>
<li> I am not satisfied with the product because every time I am about to use it, I worry how much of a mess am I going to make again.</li>
<li> Holds well; but not too stiff or sticky.</li>
<li> This gel is okay when it comes to quality, but is horrible when it comes to its structure.&lt;br</li>
<li> I usually keep my hair really short, but cutting it every three weeks can be a hassle sometimes.</li>
<li> I wish I could get my money back :(</li>
<li> I searched for this because I don&#x27;t want to put nasty chemicals in my hair that stay for the whole day.  </li>
<li> I switched to this stuff and within a week I noticed that when showering I did not have nearly as much random lose hairs in the towel/drain.</li>
<li> I came to the conclusion that this might be accelerated by the plastic base gel I had been using.</li>

    <li> The gel is fine, specially because you feel your hair clean. The gel is not strong, it is soft, so you can&#x27;t use it to design your hairstyle. the hair looks wet but not achieved harden</li>
    <li> This is a good clean-feeling gel for light-to-medium hold. It isn&#x27;t sticky or slimy and doesn&#x27;t make short hair feel like a crusty brick :).  I use it to brush my bangs back without having them look too severe, and control flyaways on the side of my head. It&#x27;s not for someone who wants a harder spiky look and feel. I have tried 2 other vegan gels and came back to this one. Also has a light, pleasant smell. I received this product within a few days from the Amazon marketplace vendor and even with shipping, it was cheaper than buying it at a store in a fancy mall.</li>

I am not satisfied with the product because every time I am about to use it, I worry how much of a mess am I going to make again. Too bad, because the gel itself holds the hair well and is pretty much natural. But the packaging simply sux.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This product has a scent</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair gel for over 5 years now. It&#x27;s great for light/medium holds and it looks and feels very natural. No plastic wet look and it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue..my hair is black so I would notice that if it did. I always wet my hands and use a nickel to quarter size amount and run it through then comb after. Will never use any other hair gel as long as they keep making this one!</li>
    <li> I goop it on my hair and then comb it. I let it air dry and then leave it alone. I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> This stuff stays in my husbands hair the whole day and doesn&#x27;t flake. Love that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
    <li> This is about the only Aubrey hair gel available, now that they&#x27;ve deep-sixed B5 Design Gel. This is an excellent replacement (actually holds better and longer than B5, which was top notch).</li>
    <li> Hold hair well, doesn&#x27;t have a smell and holds throughout the day with no issues. I will definitely buy more.</li>

    <li> A great natural product.  Holds well; but not too stiff or sticky.</li>
    <li> EDIT: It doesn&#x27;t really work at all. I should have tested it more before writing my initial review.</li>
    <li> Husband likes the product&lt;br /&gt;Looks good in his hair</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I wanted a gel that was more organic and had fewer chemicals.  While it doesn&#x27;t have quite the holding power of some of the chemically-loaded gels, it does a good enough job for me.  My hair is very short and this holds it in place and doesn&#x27;t feel goopy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I usually keep my hair really short, but cutting it every three weeks can be a hassle sometimes. That being said, I decided to try hair gel for when it gets a little longer. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, and maybe it&#x27;s my hair type, but you need a good bit to really get hold. Some reviewers didn&#x27;t like the smell, but this wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. I suppose it&#x27;s a little pricey for the quantity, but then I also suppose it&#x27;s worth it for the natural ingredients. Worth a shot, especially if your hair isn&#x27;t too stubborn.</li>
    <li> My husband has fine, thick, short hair and this is the only hair gel he likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He will only use a product that leaves his hair soft versus stiff, that smells more natural versus like cologne or chemicals, and easily washes off his hands.  This Aubrey Men&#x27;s Stock Ginseng Biotin Hair Gel does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it lasts a long time.  It only takes the size of a nickel to keep his hair from frizzing and the stray hairs down versus sticking up.  It takes the size of a fifty cent piece to create the wet slicked back look, which he doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> If you want better hold, you need to use a lot of product. It&#x27;s nice to have a more natural option for hair care products.</li>

    <li> I searched for this because I don&#x27;t want to put nasty chemicals in my hair that stay for the whole day.  I didn&#x27;t find many alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job...mildly sticky...but washes from  It would get 5 stars but they put a crappy fragrance in it.  When will hair product companies and deodorant makers learn that many of us don&#x27;t wanted scented products?  I have cologne for that.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s organic and clean but hate that we have to lay the bottle down as the gel is really watery and starts coming out with out having to squeeze. But overall we are very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> One of the best natural styling products I&#x27;ve tried, but you need to use A LOT to achieve a firm hold. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp or leave any build-up or residue, and washes out easily. Also kind of smells a lot nicer than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; men&#x27;s staying products. Don&#x27;t expect it to hold up your mohawk, but it&#x27;s pretty good stuff for light to medium styling.</li>
    <li> It works really well. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crispy or sticky.</li>
    <li> Will not use another hair gel ever again.</li>
