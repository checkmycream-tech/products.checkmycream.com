    <li> This is a fantastic perfume. It is light and perfect for everyday wear.  I usually get headaches from perfumes because it is so strong but this one is just right.  I also received really quickly! I will definitely purchase from them again!</li>
    <li> i was a little bit disapointed cos the first time i got this perfume at the macy&#x27;s store it was owsome but when i got it on amazon it smells different :( !!!so as i said its ok but have no waaaw effect</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff!  I&#x27;m not sure how to explain the smell of it, nice would be the best word to sum it up...she&#x27;s on her 3rd bottle.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I could get this fragrance online. This is the only way you can get it. It is both fresh and sophisticated. I love it!</li>
    <li> This has been a gift for my mother over the years and she just loves it....so I&#x27;m happy if she&#x27;s happy!!!</li>
    <li> Smell delish price was great. I usually use the original gucci flora but this version is definitely a great spring fragrance. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just as I remember it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen and smelled this scent in the department stores in the mall. Absolutely fell in love with the scent/ smell and decide to buy it online for much less then what the department stores are selling it for. Was deliver to me to in a timely fashion and smells exactly the same as I remember. This is my first Gucci perfume and I would buy recommend it to anyone who likes a light and fresh scent, not to heavy on.</li>
    <li> Always fast shipping and the quality of the product is very good. This time,however, the clear wrapping of the box was ripped off. Besides that everything was perfect! Thanks!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfum! So sad Gucci will put out of line to make others perfums.. so if you dont have yet you should buy it before it ran out. The smell is very fresh, its fruity and floral, it has tangerine, bergamot, kumquat, lime and peony. Also roses and osmanthus and for the heart notes: sandal, patchouli and rose pepper. I love this smell!!</li>
    <li> The smell is light and floral and it lasts long. I think best for summer season. Recommend Fragrance Net seller.</li>
    <li> Hand down one of my fans. I love the soft fruity but flora sent that this perfume has. You will be 100% pleased with this purchase. I know I was. I wear it at night when I go out.</li>
    <li> Daughter absolutely loved it!  Its fresh &amp; not too flowery.  Very unique but subtle.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance. Has a wonderful and distinct smell. Very clean and fresh smelling. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of  compliments. Try it, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s almost perfect,  but I would take a way 2 stars for the package provided to me.  It didn&#x27;t have a protect box.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Perfect timing and great price! Will def shop here again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the help!</li>
    <li> I guess they fill it with water. It doesn&#x27;t smell at all and it&#x27;s not even returnable. Waste of money. Never buying this again.</li>
