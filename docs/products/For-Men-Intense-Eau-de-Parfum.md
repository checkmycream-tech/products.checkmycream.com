      <li>Unfortunatelly spray itself is WAY TO SWEET !</li>
      <li>This is a good choice for those who want an Amouage feel and quality but can&#x27;t afford the high end price point of an Amouage cologne.</li>
      <li>It reminds  that cheap stuff you can buy at Wallmart, Meijer, Wallgreen etc... .</li>

      <li>It isn&#x27;t a big compliment getter, but where it for yourself and feel good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bentley Intense smell unique, good silage and very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It was a good price, and arrived as expected.</li>
      <li>I choosed this rating because it is a really nice perfume Bentley INTENSE Eau De Parfum Natural Spray 3.4oz / 100ml</li>
      <li>Very good, long lasting, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ajmal &#x27;Magnificent Oudh&#x27;, have mellow oud note and quite expensive anyway.</li>
      <li>Perfect but expensive.</li>
      <li>This scent is classic and powerful.  </li>
      <li>and it got here fast</li>
      <li>A very manly dark leathery fragrance sure to be noticed.  </li>
      <li>When Bentley Intense dry down it have the nearly the same tone as Ajmal fragrance oil &#x27;Magnificent Oudh&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that WOW factor like Burberry when you first spray it on</li>
      <li>Smells like an older gentlemen</li>
      <li>main difference is the oud note which is not found in Bentley Intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the nose behind this perfume is Nathalie Lorson who create more than hundred perfumes for many designer houses, some are very well known such as Boucheron , Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent , etc.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells like an old man!</li>
      <li>but when it settles it smells really mature.</li>
      <li>Long lasting masculine scent worth the money</li>
      <li>dense, complex and strong texture make it comparable to some from Amouage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not my favorite but not the worse either</li>

<li> you like heavy niche quality winter perfume</li>
<li> Is ok...not an everyday wear for me.</li>
<li> This is one of the few parfums that I have ever purchased that truly&lt;br /&gt;lasts</li>
<li> Do not buy anything from Beauty Encounter B.K.A UGLY ENCOUNTER especially this horrible  old man from the 60&#x27;s smelling cologne.</li>
<li> Then once you buy this hog juice in a bottle UGLY ENCOUNTER won&#x27;t let you return it.</li>
<li> What a disappointment !  </li>
