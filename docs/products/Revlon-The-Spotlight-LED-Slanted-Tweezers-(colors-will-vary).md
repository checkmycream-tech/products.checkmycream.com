      <li>The tweezers are great!</li>
      <li>They are wonderful and came with spare batteries!  </li>
      <li>Worked great and a lot easier than holding a flashlight and trying to pull eyelashes too!  </li>

      <li>It makes it very easy to spot even the tiniest hair stub.  </li>
      <li>Light good but tweezers not.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because it&#x27;s great idea, but it really doesn&#x27;t work effectively.  </li>
      <li>- this is no fault of the dealer,  Everything ran very smoothly.</li>
      <li>Let there be light!</li>
      <li>The perfect precision and quality of these tweezers, indeed, put head and shoulders above others on the market.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>One person I gave tweezers to was able to help the family dog.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;my favorite things\\&quot; (like Oprah) for their Christmas stockings</li>
      <li>people complain about the gripping power of the tweezers.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
      <li>I love these lighted tweezers....</li>
      <li>The battery is also replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy pickin&#x27; :)</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to tweeze easily.</li>
      <li>A regular tweezer is just as good with good lighting.</li>
      <li>Why didn&#x27;t think of such a brilliant idea years</li>
      <li>Love the light.</li>
      <li>but this makes it much easier because I can see the hairs easily with the bright light shining on them.</li>
      <li>Some hairs are easily missed.</li>
      <li>These pickers were easy to use with precision picking.  </li>
      <li>Has a good grip - light is very helpful.</li>
      <li>Good light which illuminates the areas I want illuminated with really brignt light and that&#x27;s no bull for now.</li>
      <li>The tweezers I bought work fine.  </li>
      <li>there is a led light.</li>
      <li>Fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Just opened mine, and the light does not work.</li>
      <li>I keep them even though the light quit working and the tips didn&#x27;t align, trying to power through it, since they cost almost $20.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>When you close the tweezers to pluck, the light can&#x27;t get to where it needs to be.  </li>
      <li>Some times I will use the light</li>
      <li>Having a light makes all the difference.</li>
      <li>The light has a button and stays on till you say off.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get the light  to stay screwed on.  </li>
      <li>The light has never worked, but I still like the product.</li>
      <li>so the light from the lamp or window shines right.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the light didn&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>This is fantastic.</li>
      <li>A very useful set of tweezers.</li>
      <li>I find that with my reading glasses and the bright light from the tweezers I can actually see what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do not understand how they are getting such good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Fantastic for first aid for removing items from skin.</li>
      <li>light lasted about 15 minutes (2 days of use) even though I bought a pair at the back of the rack to make sure that nobody had used the light.</li>
      <li>I think the light is a little too bright, but the idea is simple yet ingenious. :)</li>
      <li>beware you may have to replace the batteries first thing!</li>
      <li>Light doesn&#x27;t work straight out of the box.  </li>
      <li>The light on these tweezers really helps it to be a five star product.  </li>
      <li>So I thought I try a 3rd pair since I really need and liked having a light to tweeze with...</li>
      <li>I have used it more than the old style.</li>
      <li>It is worth it.</li>
      <li>The light is an extra but overall, you can find better as eventually you want an effective one</li>
      <li>Right out of the package, the tweezers didn&#x27;t align correctly at the tip.</li>
      <li>No leaning over to get just the right angle on the mirror</li>
      <li>The tweezer is high quality, but the light could be brighter.</li>
      <li>Besides that, the even-ness and the precision of the tips (hitting against each other evenly) is not that great and grasping fine, short hairs is not guaranteed.</li>
      <li>The very bright, but tiny, LED light is small but powerful.  </li>
      <li>Now the light has stopped working even with new batteries.  </li>
      <li>Might be okay for splinters, but didn&#x27;t work well for eyebrows or facial hair.</li>
      <li>(I have been plucking my eyebrows for over 40 years, and I have had many different tweezers.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s where having a directly shining LED light is critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought the item @ Walmart for $9.99 and used it for the first time this morning</li>
      <li>Actually, I might glue the top on.</li>
      <li>a difference a light that points directly to the&lt;br /&gt;spot</li>
      <li>It does the trick and is much, much easier to remove these eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been having problems with my left eye since I was 11 years old when I was playing with a can of lye (which is very strong street salt)  </li>
      <li>ended up throwing them away after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;These are pure junk.</li>
      <li>These Revlon Tweezers are pure junk.</li>
      <li>Light works fine, but tweezers were not precise.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good tweezer in stores.</li>
      <li>I did not think this would really work, but after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try.</li>
      <li>Now, drag gripping tips of the tweezers over that folded sand paper in one direction.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very disappointing quality from Revlon. I bought one of these and they only worked for a few days. I thought I must&#x27;ve gotten a defective one so ordered another pair... same thing happened. I couldn&#x27;t find replacement batteries anywhere. So I thought I try a 3rd pair since I really need and liked having a light to tweeze with... once again, the light worked for only a few hours. I called Revlon&#x27;s customer care line and they told me to replace the batteries... when I told them I hadn&#x27;t been able to find replacements, they basically said tough luck. They did offer to send me a new pair if I mailed the old ones back to them but that seems crazy since they are $9 tweezers and hardly worth the trouble to pack and ship. I asked Revlon to let me know if they improve their tweezers and they just laughed... saying it was my problem that the battery didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The perfect precision and quality of these tweezers, indeed, put head and shoulders above others on the market. Due to the fact it is lighted...you cannot miss. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Has a good grip - light is very helpful.</li>
    <li> just what the wife wanted. she is happy!</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and feel a bit sorry for those that got ripped off.  The tweezers I bought work fine.  The end prongs are perfectly aligned and the light is really bright.  Almost too bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these tweezers because my eyes are weaker than they used to be.  I use them on everything from thorns and splinters stuck in the kids&#x27; fingers, to plucking my brows.  I find that with my reading glasses and the bright light from the tweezers I can actually see what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no complaints.  Mine seem to be working like they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> Having a light makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> I bought these tweezers at a Walgreens. I do not understand how they are getting such good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The light lasted about 15 minutes (2 days of use) even though I bought a pair at the back of the rack to make sure that nobody had used the light. Right out of the package, the tweezers didn&#x27;t align correctly at the tip. Every time I tried to pull out a hair it would either slip off or break the hair. I keep them even though the light quit working and the tips didn&#x27;t align, trying to power through it, since they cost almost $20.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up throwing them away after a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;These are pure junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> These work beautifully done</li>
    <li> I hate to pluck my eyebrows but this makes it much easier because I can see the hairs easily with the bright light shining on them. I can even see the new ones coming in now when I never noticed them before. I bet they would be great getting slinters out too. I like to get my adult kids \\&quot;my favorite things\\&quot; (like Oprah) for their Christmas stockings and this is definitly going in all the girls stockings next Christmas.</li>
    <li> What a great concept! Love these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems with my left eye since I was 11 years old when I was playing with a can of lye (which is very strong street salt)  It practically burned my left eye to the point that I had to go to the hospital and have my eye checked.&lt;br /&gt;The doctor later told me that if I hadn&#x27;t come when I did, I would be blind for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;However, the only problem I have now is trying to remove some eye lashes as they are growing inwards of my eye.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since had trouble removing these eye lashes, especially the almost transparent ones.  But this product is the best tweezer that I ever purchased.  It does the trick and is much, much easier to remove these eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much. Oh, by the way, I am 70 years old.</li>
    <li> The light on these tweezers really helps it to be a five star product.  Using it with a 10x magnifying mirror I&#x27;m able to tweeze easily.</li>
    <li> They are wonderful and came with spare batteries!  ordered several and would have like different colors, but tey were apparently not offered when I ordered</li>
    <li> Great product, just like described, very good seller . Thank you</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t think of such a brilliant idea years ago?&lt;br /&gt;What a difference a light that points directly to the&lt;br /&gt;spot you want makes.  I can see again!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the light  to stay screwed on.  The tweezers are great! Just have to use them in the dark.  Actually, I might glue the top on.</li>
    <li> Product came with no good battery, however the seller quickly refunded me.</li>
    <li> batteries in inside the compartment was so corroded the tweezers were unusable, they were returned and not replaced.</li>
    <li> Light is not bright enough.  It only shines where you want it to when the tweezers are open.  When you close the tweezers to pluck, the light can&#x27;t get to where it needs to be.  It&#x27;s a shame, because it&#x27;s great idea, but it really doesn&#x27;t work effectively.  Besides that, the even-ness and the precision of the tips (hitting against each other evenly) is not that great and grasping fine, short hairs is not guaranteed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good tweezer in stores. I like that there is a led light. reece@roadrunner.com  The hard to get at areas aren&#x27;t so difficult anymore. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I really liked this tweezer - the best pair I have had to date.  They are about 3 1/2 inches long.  The very bright, but tiny, LED light is small but powerful.  It makes it very easy to spot even the tiniest hair stub.  The precision pickers easily grasp the tiny hair and do not slide off like my old pair.  These pickers were easy to use with precision picking.  A 5-star in their class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the LR41 battery is included, so you are ready to tweeze.  The battery is also replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy pickin&#x27; :)</li>
    <li> This works well for grooming purpose.  A very good idea for precision hair plucking.  I would buy another just to have a spare.</li>
    <li> I absolutely this product. A friend gave me my pair of tweezers, and I thought, &amp;#34;What a novel gift!&amp;#34; Then the very next day I found a use for it. Since I am pre-diabetic, I examine my feet every day. This particular day, I was walking in my house without my shoes on, and I must have picked up something on the bottom of my sock. When I rubbed my hand across my bare foot, I felt something stabbing the ball of my foot. I tried to remove the piece of a sticker, but couldn&#x27;t. Then I remembered, &amp;#34;Spotlight tweezers to the Rescue!&amp;#34; That sticker was out in no time because I could actually see it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few pairs to give as gifts. One person I gave tweezers to was able to help the family dog. He said the dog had something causing a sore spot on his back. My friend was able to get down into the dog&#x27;s close-knit fur and give the dog some relief. The spotlight LED was as handy as pockets on a shirt.</li>
    <li> I love these lighted tweezers....in the future I will give them as gifts to my daughters....I can&#x27;t do without mine!</li>
    <li> Tweezers came and the lights didn&#x27;t work.  I contacted the seller and was sent new batteries which worked for about two days. now the lights no longer work. I was not satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Light works fine, but tweezers were not precise. Might be okay for splinters, but didn&#x27;t work well for eyebrows or facial hair.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think of this?  Fixes all the bad lighting issues when you&lt;br /&gt;are traveling, and finds those pesky hairs in the shadows!  Can&#x27;t live&lt;br /&gt;without it now.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Where have you been all my life.</li>
    <li> Neat toy for adults who have everything!</li>
    <li> A very useful set of tweezers. I bought several as Christmas gifts, and they were well received. I love mine!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are very good and are exactly as advertised. I got them to pluck eyelashes that want to grow down instead of up and irritate my husband&#x27;s eye. Worked great and a lot easier than holding a flashlight and trying to pull eyelashes too!  My only complaint is that the product came with 3 batteries and the light did not work. When I checked the batteries I found that they were encased in a black vinyl tube and were corroded. I replaced them but I expect  a product from Revlon to not have that kind of issue. I would recommend this product but buyer beware you may have to replace the batteries first thing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who is writing the 4 star reviews on this product, but Buyer Beware. These Revlon Tweezers are pure junk. You can save money by buying similar ones at the $$ store. Just opened mine, and the light does not work. (Battery dead ???) I decided that though I was upset, I would give the tweezers a chance but nope, they don&#x27;t work well either. I am highly disappointed in these and feel like I just wasted my hard earned money. I have a pair of LaCross lighted tweezers that I have had for years that work like a dream. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t get those anymore. I guess, I will have to continue searching for the perfect tweezers, but ladies I am telling you that these are not it. (I have been plucking my eyebrows for over 40 years, and I have had many different tweezers. Too bad these are so worthless). Don&#x27;t throw away your money like I did.</li>
    <li> Love the light. I have used it more than the old style. Fantastic for first aid for removing items from skin. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this, so I can see my eyebrows!!!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery; however, item is a disappointment.  A regular tweezer is just as good with good lighting.</li>
    <li> Light doesn&#x27;t work straight out of the box.  Looks like it&#x27;s been sitting somewhere on a shelf for years...</li>
    <li> Fabulous.  They really help you see when tweezing anything, especially those hard to get just-growing-in eyebrows! Highly recommend these tweezers.</li>
    <li> The light has never worked, but I still like the product. It helps to get to those little hairs that most tweezer can&#x27;t grip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine now for 6 months.  I found I had to replace the batteries a lot (every other month), which doesn&#x27;t make too much sense as I only use it for a few minutes every three weeks.  Now the light has stopped working even with new batteries.  I think the product is a bit defective.</li>
    <li> I have never been this excited about a simple product. I was concerned about the quality of the tweezers because I am picky about them. I am completely satisfied with the quality, and the light works perfectly. I am nearsighted, so these and a 5X mirror are all I need. No leaning over to get just the right angle on the mirror so the light from the lamp or window shines right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is replacable, so I think that as long as my hands stay steady, I&#x27;ve got a lifetime product here!</li>
    <li> This is fantastic. I think the light is a little too bright, but the idea is simple yet ingenious. :)</li>
    <li> The person that requested the Tweezers was very happy and really enjoyed using them.</li>
    <li> I hold a magnifying mirror next to my chin, zoom-in on the offending boar hairs with the little light from the tweezers, boing my finger up and down on the hairs to judge their spring effect, and happily pluck away until my chin is bald..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it five stars but the battery didn&#x27;t last very long, and replacing it seems to be a challenge for me. It says it takes an LR41 battery, but all of them on Amazon look like buttons, The one I removed from the tweezers looks like a tiny, blue barrel with LR41 NI engraved on the end. I&#x27;ve posted a question on replacing the battery, and if I receive an answer that makes it simple, I&#x27;ll change my rating.</li>
    <li> Light good but tweezers not.</li>
    <li> Not the best tweezer for sure. The light is an extra but overall, you can find better as eventually you want an effective one</li>
    <li> Great product!  Good light which illuminates the areas I want illuminated with really brignt light and that&#x27;s no bull for now.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased that this product exists.  The tweezer is high quality, but the light could be brighter. Some hairs are easily missed.</li>
    <li> Light awesome but the tweezers are useless, They don&#x27;t pull out the hair Some times I will use the light so I can see and just use another pair of tweezers, get concept bad design.</li>
    <li> Have you ever struggled with the lighting in your bathroom? Can&#x27;t see the hairs you want to pluck? This pair of tweezers fixes that! No more shadows hiding little unruly hairs from your vision, just good light that shines right between the ends. The light has a button and stays on till you say off. Love this. It even came with extra batteries!</li>
    <li> This works beautifully for tweezing my eyebrows and I even turn out all of the lights to maximize the benefit of the led spolight.</li>
    <li> from the moment i open it, did not work! Couldnt grab one hair!!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, but highly disappointed when I received them the light didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> The light might as well not be there considering how weak it is, and the tweezers aren&#x27;t aligned, making them useless</li>
    <li> I did not think this would really work, but after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try. I bought the item @ Walmart for $9.99 and used it for the first time this morning and WOW it really does work......&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited because my eyesight is not very good when looking in my lighted mirror for stray hairs. This is absolutly the best product and I will go ahead and buy an extra one just in case something happens to the first one I bought.</li>
    <li> Мне казалось это что-то не нужное и не удобное.Щипчики да еще с фонариком.Но когда получила и первый раз попробовала,была в диком в восторге ,как я раньше жила без него-не знаю-;)Удобного,что светит ярко и цепляет очень хорошо,что раньше делала в салонах красоты,щас делаю сама и дома-:)Спасибо</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this type of tweezers on Amazon for a while but due to multiple unfavorable reviews I was apprehensive to purchase via Amazon. Did not want to go through a return process if the product would not work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple weeks ago I was forced to run to the local big retailer for something and to my surprise spotted this model in black for the same price. Well, since this retailer has a very good return policy I thought that if the product will be as bad as in many negative reviews than I&#x27;ll be able to return easily next day. To my surprise, the quality was good and I&#x27;ve kept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for pulling unwanted hair from my nostrils. That&#x27;s where having a directly shining LED light is critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people complain about the gripping power of the tweezers. For those of you, who would like to improve it without spending time for returns and purchasing various models, try the following simple method: take a piece of a sand paper of a common grit (150 or 220 are the most popular ones), fold it with the abrasive staying outside. Now, drag gripping tips of the tweezers over that folded sand paper in one direction. Squeeze with enough strength, but no need to squeeze too much. Do it several times until they will be adjusted and the surface will have slight texture for gripping on hair surface. Under the microscope they will look like the lips of the mini-pliers. Will improve any tweezers whether they are a $1 or a $40 model!</li>
    <li> This item was horrible. I just threw it away. The two points did nott line up and it would be impossible to use for most things you need a tweezers for.</li>
    <li> It was well defined but it was not quite what I expected - this is no fault of the dealer,  Everything ran very smoothly.</li>
    <li> i bought them as gifts and everyone loves them</li>
    <li> Let there be light! The only tweezers to use for everything.</li>
