      <li>I was pretty diligent about it, too, because although there are lots of tongue scrapers on the market, this one really is the best.  </li>
      <li>but I got used to it very quickly.</li>
      <li>Provides thorough cleaning of the tongue and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This piece makes a huge difference in a clean mouth and better breath.</li>
      <li>and you should be fine.</li>
      <li>so I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Scrapes your tongue well the first time and gives you nice fresh breath!</li>
      <li>Best little investment in oral health you can make.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few and this one works the best for me.</li>
      <li>Regarless, I enjoy using it and think it works.</li>
      <li>so I almost wasn&#x27;t sure if the right item had been sent.</li>
      <li>I originally bought it years ago in Wal-Mart, but they stopped carrying it some time ago.  </li>
      <li>Gives you fresh breath!</li>
      <li>I had to use a freaking spoon instead and spoon wasn&#x27;t fun!</li>
      <li>started to make sure that I not only rinse under the faucet, but use my fingers to kind of wipe it cleaner while the water is running over it.  </li>
      <li>I just throw it in the dishwasher a couple of times a month to keep it clean.</li>
      <li>This is sturdy, the tongue cleaner itself is sturdy, easy to clean as well as scrapes very well!</li>
      <li>Be sure to use it gently.</li>
      <li>This tongue cleaner arrived quickly &amp; wrapped well for hygene.</li>
      <li>I have tried other tongue cleaners and this one is, by far, the best.</li>
      <li>Fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit very well into my toothbrush sterilizer.</li>
      <li>Also helps with fresh breath.</li>
      <li>Everyone should have this and use right after brushing and when needed.</li>
      <li>I needed a new one as my original broke.</li>
      <li>Be sure to order extra ones (to replace after sicknesses !)</li>
      <li>BEST scraper ever, Had one from walmart, used it for years until the handle snapped off, then tried 3-4 SAD excuses for tougue scrapers until I found them here online.</li>
      <li>Has much better coverage than any of the ones I could find at my local drugstore.</li>
      <li>so it covers the area of my tongue pretty well.</li>
      <li>Anyway I&#x27;m so glad to finally have this again in my possession!</li>
      <li>My toothbrush wasn&#x27;t getting my tongue very clean and was taking very long to do so.</li>
      <li>Leaves your breath so much fresher.</li>
      <li>You can really see and notice the difference.</li>
      <li>Most now are both too flexible, and not sharp enough to pick anything up off of your tongue.</li>
      <li>This scraper is more rigid than other brands</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been using the long, flexible kind with tiny serrated teeth on each edge.</li>
      <li>Most of the time each scraper lasts me about a year, but sometimes less because mine somehow ends up detiorating and falling apart after about 6 - 9 months or so.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just thought I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
      <li>it is not sharp but cleans tongue very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why more people don&#x27;t know about these or use these but your mouth/</li>
      <li>It seems to work pretty well, like the older ones, decently sharp edge and not too much flexibility.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it is strong and firm.</li>
      <li>I finally just got used to a subpar one, but then I just happened to look on Amazon and was very pleasantly surprised to see it carried.  </li>
      <li>edges are SHARP and scrape real good.&lt;br /&gt;BUY</li>
      <li>Despite this little minor issue, the scraper is like no other one on the market, and even if I had to buy one every 6 months, it would be well worth it.</li>

<li> Despite this little minor issue, the scraper is like no other one on the market, and even if I had to buy one every 6 months, it would be well worth it.</li>
<li> Just amazing nothing else to say, if you want your tongue be clear just buy it and you won&#x27;t  be disappointed</li>
<li> It seems a little sharp at first</li>
<li> It is built pretty well for being plastic, just don&#x27;t push extremely hard on it</li>
<li> and it never came in flat out never showed I do not have it</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick plastic with not much give, exactly what you need.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s durable, just sharp enough to do the job without doing any damage, and, uh...let&#x27;s see...</li>
<li> I was worried that the price might be steep because apparently it&#x27;s not being sold in conventional stores, but the price is fair (doesn&#x27;t qualify for Amazon Prime, though, which is annoying).    </li>
<li> Anyway these things Are mad strong when you scrap that gunk off your tongue.</li>
<li> I think you&#x27;d really have to have an unhealthy obsession with tongue cleaners to give one 5 stars.</li>
<li> and they sent me a pink one</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me in this instance, but when they pull that with other types of products, it&#x27;s return-worthy.    </li>
<li> or maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough..</li>
<li> although they say (or at least imply, I can&#x27;t remember) that you&#x27;re buying a certain color, the color you get is indeed random.  </li>
<li> A few swipes, rinse it off and your done.</li>
<li> Even though its made of simple plastic it hasn&#x27;t broken or shown any wear.</li>
<li> Shipped really quickly in a small package too</li>
<li> The ones in the local stores were aggravating to use because the scraping surface was so dull that they would not remove anything from the tongue, and the shaft would bend and flex, making it difficult to use.&lt;br</li>
<li> I was a little annoyed by the fact that it&#x27;s advertised as purple</li>
<li> because, I mean, come on --</li>
<li> only bad thing I can think of is I could not select the color</li>

    <li> My husband uses this daily!  It is a great tongue scraper and does the job!  He was very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I only wish I could give 0 stars I have no idea what happend but I ordered this and it never came in flat out never showed I do not have it I order stuff off of amazon all the time and I&#x27;m always happy with what I get but not this</li>
    <li> I had one of those things before but I never knew what a GOOD one was until I had this one.&lt;br /&gt;The edges are SHARP and scrape real good.&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!!!!!!!!  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I can think of is I could not select the color so I ended up with two matching ones, one for me one for my husband, while I&#x27;d wish we had different colors.&lt;br /&gt;Othewise, this Item is the BEST scraper I&#x27;ve ever HAD&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> BEST scraper ever, Had one from walmart, used it for years until the handle snapped off, then tried 3-4 SAD excuses for tougue scrapers until I found them here online. It&#x27;s thick plastic with not much give, exactly what you need. Best little investment in oral health you can make. I&#x27;m not sure why more people don&#x27;t know about these or use these but your mouth/breathe is like 1000X better if you use this twice a day.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!  I originally bought it years ago in Wal-Mart, but they stopped carrying it some time ago.  Mine broke a while back, and I looked in comparable places like Target, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, etc. to find it, and still couldn&#x27;t find it.  I was pretty diligent about it, too, because although there are lots of tongue scrapers on the market, this one really is the best.  I finally just got used to a subpar one, but then I just happened to look on Amazon and was very pleasantly surprised to see it carried.  I was worried that the price might be steep because apparently it&#x27;s not being sold in conventional stores, but the price is fair (doesn&#x27;t qualify for Amazon Prime, though, which is annoying).    One thing, though - although they say (or at least imply, I can&#x27;t remember) that you&#x27;re buying a certain color, the color you get is indeed random.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me in this instance, but when they pull that with other types of products, it&#x27;s return-worthy.    Overall, wonderful product at fair price that you can&#x27;t seem to find in Wal-Mart, etc. - definitely a recommended buy!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites! Just wish this was on Amazon Prime for faster delivery &#x3D;)! Has much better coverage than any of the ones I could find at my local drugstore.</li>
    <li> Just amazing nothing else to say, if you want your tongue be clear just buy it and you won&#x27;t  be disappointed</li>
    <li> There are several types of tongue cleaners. I&#x27;d been using the long, flexible kind with tiny serrated teeth on each edge. Just thought I&#x27;d try something new.  Big mistake. Tossed it.</li>
    <li> I have tried other tongue cleaners and this one is, by far, the best. Scrapes your tongue well the first time and gives you nice fresh breath!</li>
    <li> I bought it in stores years ago. I needed a new one as my original broke. I am very happy I could find one online.</li>
    <li> This shape of tongue cleaner works well for me. I had a different one that was wider and it always made me gag. This one is tapered at the top so it doesn&#x27;t cause the gag reflex. The scraping surface is serrated so it does have a bite to it, but I&#x27;ve never actually injured my tongue so I think it&#x27;s fine. It doesn&#x27;t fit very well into my toothbrush sterilizer.</li>
    <li> It seems a little sharp at first but I got used to it very quickly. Does its job very good. I just throw it in the dishwasher a couple of times a month to keep it clean.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine introduced me to a tongue scraper about 10 years ago.  Before that I would brush my tongue and it was getting ripped up.  I feel that my mouth is cleaner now that I use a tongue scraper, and will never go back to brushing my tongue.</li>
    <li> This is sturdy, the tongue cleaner itself is sturdy, easy to clean as well as scrapes very well! I have used others and they have cut my tongue, this one does not. I will continue to buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> This is a simple tool that does the job.  It is easy to use and works great.  It helps keep the tongue cleaner than trying to brush it.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This scraper is more rigid than other brands so it seems to work better for me. Love these! They last a year or two before needing to replace.</li>
    <li> These work great! Everyone should have one! It&#x27;s an equally essential tool as using a toothbrush and dental floss for maintaining oral care.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Have been using these for many years. Gives you fresh breath! Fast and easy to use. I also throw it in the dishwasher every so often to sterilize it. Yippee.</li>
    <li> I tried the more flexible ones... this sturdy one is the best !  Be sure to order extra ones (to replace after sicknesses !)</li>
    <li> It works well it seems. But when it arrived in the mail it was:&lt;br /&gt;1. Not the color it said it was (states it is purple but the one that arrived was red)&lt;br /&gt;2. Not packaged like it stated (came in a thin plastic bag, not anything like the one that is pictured)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s functionality works just the same, but the product that arrived was not the same as the picture so I almost wasn&#x27;t sure if the right item had been sent. Regarless, I enjoy using it and think it works. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Since I started using a tongue cleaner I can&#x27;t be without it. I like the size of the Pureline tongue cleaner. The ones I see in the store are so much smaller.</li>
    <li> It is about as basic as it gets but it does the job.  You will be amazed at the amount of stuff you scrape off your tongue.  Be sure to use it gently.</li>
    <li> Good one to add as a part of my oral cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;it is strong and firm. it is not sharp but cleans tongue very well.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from halitosis, this could be the answer to your prayers, (and everyone else&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> I use to have ine of these whe I was a kid and I don&#x27;t know if I lost it or if it broke or what happened but after that point in out they stopped Selling them in stores and what not and I had about lost my mind! I had to use a freaking spoon instead and spoon wasn&#x27;t fun! But yeah it worked!  Anyway I&#x27;m so glad to finally have this again in my possession! Hate the color ... I don&#x27;t recall ordering a purple one I think they send you whatever they&#x27;ve got and give no option or maybe I didn&#x27;t look hard enough.. Anyway these things Are mad strong when you scrap that gunk off your tongue. Idk about you but when I brush my teeth and tongue there&#x27;s all this Gross slim dude with this Tongue scraper it takes it all away instead of having to spit .. Spit and spit. Basically I compare this to using a Spoon. Ick. Now that we covered That, you must Get this!!</li>
    <li> I great product, works really well. Everyone should have this and use right after brushing and when needed. Incredible detox tool. Also helps with fresh breath.</li>
    <li> I love it and it gets the job done. I still have it and it still does the job of cleaning my tongue. I totally hate a dirty disgusting tongue and it makes your breathe stink. It is terrible, and I am thankful for this tool, and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Provides thorough cleaning of the tongue and is easy to use.  I use it several times a day and it is still holding up.</li>
    <li> I use this every day. Won&#x27;t leave home overnight without it. I was a little annoyed by the fact that it&#x27;s advertised as purple and they sent me a pink one but it gets the job done nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Great product! I had one earlier from a different brand, that broke within 5 days. This one is stronger and keep tongue cleaner :)</li>
    <li> Every one should have one of these. Best way to have a fresh and clean Mouth. You can really see and notice the difference. It&#x27;s a Must for All ages!!!</li>
    <li> It seems to work pretty well, like the older ones, decently sharp edge and not too much flexibility. I like it. Most now are both too flexible, and not sharp enough to pick anything up off of your tongue. This piece makes a huge difference in a clean mouth and better breath.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I stumbled across this brand of tongue cleaners after trying several different ones from the local stores.  The ones in the local stores were aggravating to use because the scraping surface was so dull that they would not remove anything from the tongue, and the shaft would bend and flex, making it difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this one was absolutely awesome, as I was hooked.  Most of the time each scraper lasts me about a year, but sometimes less because mine somehow ends up detiorating and falling apart after about 6 - 9 months or so.  I am thinking that maybe it has something to do with my toothpaste (Arm and Hammer Whitening w/baking soda and peroxide) residue that might be left on the scraper when I&#x27;m done, then tends to eat away at it and weaken it&#x27;s structure.&lt;br /&gt;I started to make sure that I not only rinse under the faucet, but use my fingers to kind of wipe it cleaner while the water is running over it.  This seems to help it last longer.  Despite this little minor issue, the scraper is like no other one on the market, and even if I had to buy one every 6 months, it would be well worth it.</li>
    <li> This tongue cleaner arrived quickly &amp; wrapped well for hygene. Can&#x27;t find these in stores in our area. Came in a 2 pack which was nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was sick of brushing my tongue. My toothbrush wasn&#x27;t getting my tongue very clean and was taking very long to do so. Once I got this it was amazing. I was cleaning my tongue in a few seconds, and in the morning when I am rushing to leave home, it really helps. This cleaner is big so it covers the area of my tongue pretty well. A few swipes, rinse it off and your done. Leaves your breath so much fresher. It is built pretty well for being plastic, just don&#x27;t push extremely hard on it and you should be fine. Shipped really quickly in a small package too and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Been using this for months now and it still works wonderfully. Even though its made of simple plastic it hasn&#x27;t broken or shown any wear. Great product.</li>
    <li> Since I read these reviews all the time, I decided it was time to do my civic duty and write one, too. And what better place to start than tongue cleaners. I&#x27;ve tried a few and this one works the best for me. It&#x27;s durable, just sharp enough to do the job without doing any damage, and, uh...let&#x27;s see...it&#x27;s color brings out the blue in my eyes?  I gave it a 4 because, I mean, come on -- it&#x27;s just a tongue cleaner. I think you&#x27;d really have to have an unhealthy obsession with tongue cleaners to give one 5 stars.</li>
