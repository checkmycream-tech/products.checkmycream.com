      <li>I am the type of person who likes to use natural products on my skin and because of this I make and use my own face masks.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it is really calming towards my acne.</li>
      <li>As for the product itself--fast absorbing, great matte solution for oily skin, produces an instant brightening/covering-up/evening-out upon application.  </li>
      <li>It clears my Skin quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or light, absorbs instead of sitting on top of skin.</li>
      <li>It has a distinct scent, but it fades rather quickly.</li>
      <li>If you have oily skin, this cream really soaks up the oil and leaves your face looking smooth and not shiny.  </li>
      <li>Buying it on Amazon is so convenient, but in this case it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>

      <li>Its EXTREMELY POWERFUL yet VERY gentle for ALL SKIN TYPES &amp; CONDITIONS...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to whether tumeric really does anything special for the skin.</li>
      <li>Quite effective on minor bruises.</li>

      <li>I am on a mission to find a good skin-lightener and only time will tell if this product offers what I am looking for.</li>
      <li>Fast healing, easily absorbs, rich and lasting</li>
      <li>After the first use, I noticed my skin looked brighter and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I recently ordered another one because I love the effect it has on my skin.</li>
      <li>In the meantime...I WILL BE BACK with an update. :)</li>
      <li>It is the first treatment ,that works on his chronic disease, after trying everything ,what was recommended by doctors and pharmacists .</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I decided to give it one more try and it earned an extra star.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>It instantly absorbs to calms Your Skin down &amp; Tones it beautifully..</li>
      <li>I had some large cyst-like acne under my chin and along my neck and this lotion cleared in up in about 2-3 days.</li>

      <li>i will really recommend this product to anyone with oily skin.</li>
      <li>Very grateful that I found a reliable seller on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I got it from a Very Well Respected Ayervediv Esthetician, who&#x27;s My Mother</li>
      <li>I really like the smell, so</li>
      <li>It smells great, not very moisturizing and it seems like my dark spots are fading.</li>
      <li>Starting to feel a little more secure again</li>
      <li>and I really believe it is due to my consistent and loyal use of this product.  </li>
      <li>It really did nothing for me that calamine lotion doesn&#x27;t do, and calamine lotion is far easier to come by at 1/6 the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think its been long enough to say for sure.</li>
      <li>When I woke up the next day I was itch free and not nearly as dry.</li>
      <li>Now that my daughter is at that age, she cannot live without using this on her face.  </li>
      <li>I have VERY Sensitive &amp; NOT2MENTION Oily Skin.</li>
      <li>The first order was lost in the mail don&#x27;t recommend using the uspo as it is the second time I have had problems with orders!</li>
      <li>The swelling and redness lessened nearly overnight.</li>
      <li>But THIS Cream FAR surpasses them ALL.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed.  It helps sooth insect bites and smoothes out rosacea and acne, without smelling like a chemical factory.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Definitely recommend to anyone suffering from acne/acne scars.</li>
    <li> Great for clear skin and brown people. May be too harsh for delicate white skin. Great for acne I hear.</li>
    <li> Warning to all - this cream comes in 4 different sizes and some of the sellers don&#x27;t indicate size on purpose (like this page!). It ranges from 30 mg to 80 mg and hence cost can vary greatly. Make sure you see the cream size ( 30 mg/ 50 mg/ 70 mg/ 80 mg) and do the math with shipping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say for sure as I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. My skin seems clearer but I&#x27;m still having some issues. I don&#x27;t think its been long enough to say for sure. It smells great, not very moisturizing and it seems like my dark spots are fading. I&#x27;ll come back in a month and update.</li>
    <li> It smells very nice. I have not used it long enough to say whether or not it actually does what I need it to.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it is really calming towards my acne. I love the smell of it being that it is mostly sandalwood :) I highly recommend for bothersome skin, although your skin does get used to it from using it so much so I would get another treatment to kind of balance it out.</li>
    <li> Love the sandalwood fragrance!</li>
    <li> I saw this product mentioned in a magazine and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did. I honestly love this product. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and have had great results. I am the type of person who likes to use natural products on my skin and because of this I make and use my own face masks. I&#x27;ve bought turmeric and sandalwood powder and have made face masks with these two and essential oils. The effect of these face masks is great too but they are a lot messier than this cream. This cream is is a yellow color which is the turmeric and normally when I make my masks I am left with a yellow tint on my face because the turmeric stains it for a little bit. This product however, does not stain. When you put it on it does look yellow but once you wash it off nothing is left behind. I use this cream throughout the day when I am at home and I put it on at night and wash it off in the morning. I have best results when I put it on at night. This product takes those ingrown pimples and brings them to head. As soon as I feel a pimple I dab some of this cream on and it does not go away immediately but it does come to head and within a few days it goes away. I have tried many creams and this is my go to cream. I recently ordered another one because I love the effect it has on my skin. I still haven&#x27;t seen any effect on my acne marks and scars but with the pimples themselves I have seen a difference. If you want a cream that truly helps take out the pimples I would give this a shot. It contains natural ingredients and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> Been using for a about two weeks. Its no miracle yet. I&#x27;m noticing little differences in my skin tone. And I also use it on my boils. Those little suckers seem to be feeling defeated. I have one here and there no were as bad as before. I have had a lot in the recent months out of nowhere. I&#x27;ve never had one before. And they leave these ugly scars. Starting to feel a little more secure again</li>
    <li> very good for oily skin.  The turmeric and sandalwood oil in it is very beneficial to all types of skin.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it for two weeks now and his skin ,damaged by seborrhea  looks much better if not jet healthy at all. It is the first treatment ,that works on his chronic disease, after trying everything ,what was recommended by doctors and pharmacists .</li>
    <li> Its been two days &amp; my skin has never felt like this with a moisterizer. I have sensitive, acne prone, combination skin. This improves my tone, heals my acne, and mattifies my skin! It&#x27;s not heavy or light, absorbs instead of sitting on top of skin. The smell is of strong medicinal herbs, which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> very nice feeling after first try.  matte finish, perfect for makeup and has a nice smell to it. we&#x27;ll see how it goes with time since I tend to suffer from cystic acne.</li>
    <li> Smell is a bit strange and strong but so far am loving it.</li>
    <li> fast shipping good price... but tube not sealed.</li>
    <li> dried out skin harshly only used twice I think I&#x27;m allergic.</li>
    <li> good ayurvedic cream...suits skin very much</li>
    <li> Keeps my acne in check and fades my scars</li>
    <li> superb smell n very effective on pimples. the shipper shipped it way before the estimated date, awesome and thank u :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any changes still, has a very strong adore. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! It has a distinct scent, but it fades rather quickly. After the first use, I noticed my skin looked brighter and refreshed. I had some large cyst-like acne under my chin and along my neck and this lotion cleared in up in about 2-3 days. The swelling and redness lessened nearly overnight. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone struggling with acne problems and slightly dry skin.</li>
    <li> To date I rate the Vicco Vanishing Cream a 4 star becuase it came in well before the expected delivery date, I like the smell, the cream is non-greasy, and it seemed to blurr the imperfections that I see in my skin giving it a much more smoother appearance. I am on a mission to find a good skin-lightener and only time will tell if this product offers what I am looking for. In the meantime...I WILL BE BACK with an update. :)</li>
    <li> Stinks and stains the pillow cases. But it works!!!! I have really bad acne and pimple scars from hormonal changes when I was pregnant with twins. A friend told me about this but I was skeptical because it was made in India which means it didn&#x27;t go through regular FDA process. I thought it would burn my skin like everything else did but it doesn&#x27;t. It dis colors the pillow so I purchased a case from the dollar store and put over my regular pillow at night.</li>
    <li> The first order was lost in the mail don&#x27;t recommend using the uspo as it is the second time I have had problems with orders! with the uspo ........Your Indian shop was awesome they immediately sent another one and did a GREAT JOB! Thank you! Your Indian Shop!!!!  Terri Morgan</li>
    <li> I ordered this item from two different sellers: YourIndianShopUSA and SimplyBeautiful.  There is a 3 cents difference price-wise.  The first one was listed as 50g, the latter mentioned no size but was very similar in price and was listed on the same page as an alternative.  I received the one from SimplyBeautiful--and it is 30g.    Granted it is my fault for not paying closer attention, but the way these two are lumped together, and are nearly identical in price, and especially the way the latter does not mention size is all really misleading.  I don&#x27;t blame the seller, I doubt it was intentional, and even if so, it is ultimately the responsibility of the buyer (i.e. me) ...anyways, buyer beware!   As for the product itself--fast absorbing, great matte solution for oily skin, produces an instant brightening/covering-up/evening-out upon application.  I&#x27;m rather skeptical of it having any actual lasting effects, but it suffices beautifully as a simple basic basic basic moisturizer for the low maintenance gal.  Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> This product is OK. I really like the smell, so I might look for a perfume or something in the future with these scents, but all in all I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again. It really did nothing for me that calamine lotion doesn&#x27;t do, and calamine lotion is far easier to come by at 1/6 the price. Does not control oil; does not rapidly speed up the healing of blemishes or scars; is not a magic cure for the skin. Its best function is as a lotion or something, since it smells great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a hunch after doing some research and homework. This is good stuff!!!! Pleasant smell, non greasy and it works like a charm. Never be without it!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and would buy it again. i have the worst oily skin you can possible think of, and no matter what i do i will be oily in less than an hour. with this product i can just wear my foundation with no need to add powder and my face will still look mate at the end of my day. i will really recommend this product to anyone with oily skin. remind you that i still use my daily routine moisturizer but i use this as my base. it made my skin smoother and it smells lovely, mostly im not a fan of scent on my face but this is a natural scent from the sandalwood.a little goes a longgggg way&lt;br /&gt;if you have dry skin you can mix it with any of your moisturizer and that should work</li>
    <li> I use this as a basic moisturizer (before make-up and bed) and it does help with blemishes, but it is not a cure all. It&#x27;s non greasy and absorbs fast, and it helps with occasional acne and helps reduce pores.</li>
    <li> Having purchased this before at an Indian store I was surprised at how very different (in a bad way) this smelled from other Vicco cream with the same exact label.  It&#x27;s also a different color-  more brownish.  Buying it on Amazon is so convenient, but in this case it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to really help with minor psoriosis even after applying 2-3 times a day for two weeks. I&#x27;ll keep trying though.</li>
    <li> This is a decent cream that will leave a matte finish which I liked. I can&#x27;t speak to whether tumeric really does anything special for the skin. There aren&#x27;t that many vanishing creams available that are truly matte and this is one of them.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream for skin health.  It can be intense at first as it clears out skin impurities, but after regular application, it will make the skin seem smoother, healthier, and less prone to acne.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my spot</li>
    <li> Good and fresh quality, as usual - I liked it very much - very effective cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Geetha</li>
    <li> This product is good . I have rosacea and the  product is gentle enough to use on my skin and seems to calm my skin down.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about the wonders of this product.  I started using this when I was 14....I am not 37.  I have never had any acne issues other than occasional zits that went away much faster with this product.  If you have oily skin, this cream really soaks up the oil and leaves your face looking smooth and not shiny.  At my age, I get so many compliments and I really believe it is due to my consistent and loyal use of this product.  Now that my daughter is at that age, she cannot live without using this on her face.  I do believe it is cheaper though, at the Indian grocery stores.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! It clears my Skin quickly.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get but I&#x27;m very happy with it and will purchase again</li>
    <li> I began using this in Trinidad many years ago. It&#x27;s a great skin cream which helps me keep breakouts and my T-zone under control. Quite effective on minor bruises. Very grateful that I found a reliable seller on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love the sandalwood in the Turmeric Cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for just one week now (morning and night aplication). Huge dark spot over my forehead is getting noticeably lighter and smaller. Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> VICCO TUMERIC VANISHING CREAM is THE BEST Thing that EVER happened to My Face. I am a Skin Care Addict. LITERALLY, I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING &amp; I MEAN EVERYTHIIIIIIIIIIIING...

It absorbs into Your Skin IMMEDIATELY. &amp;#34;Vanishing Cream&amp;#34; is a PERFECT explanation.  It instantly absorbs to calms Your Skin down &amp; Tones it beautifully.. I have VERY Sensitive &amp; NOT2MENTION Oily Skin. THIS HAS CHANGED MY COMPLEXION ENTIRELY.  It&#x27;s PHENOMENAL.  I can&#x27;t say ENOUGH about it.  I got it from a Very Well Respected Ayervediv Esthetician, who&#x27;s My Mother In Laws Best Friend.  ~I just found it for My Best Friend, who&#x27;s having chronic skin issues.... on Amazon &amp; can NOT believe The Price!!! EXTREMELY AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE!!! ....Now THIS is A Company NOT OUT 2Rip ANYONE OFF in ANY Way Shape or Form. I was EXPECTING it to be VERY Expensive...BASED on it&#x27;s Performance &amp; Benefits. NEVER EXPECTED IT TO B SOOOOOOOO CHEAP!!! ....I&#x27;m absolutely dumbfounded &amp; shocked in THE MOST POSITIVE WAY POSSIBLE!!!  &#x3D;I wish EVERY Company had THESE Standards!! &#x3D;THIS CREAM &amp; COMPANY is #1 HANDS DOWN, W/O A DOUBT THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY ENTIR LIFE!!  ~YOU WILL NOT EVEN REMOTELY B DISAPPOINTED IN ANY WAY!!!!</li>
    <li> Good results.  Clean and light.  Not greasy. Heals small irritations on skin. Good scent. Does what it is supposed to do. I have sensitive skin and can use this on my face.</li>
    <li> Fast healing, easily absorbs, rich and lasting</li>
    <li> It may well have worked on my skin had I gotten that far. The scent was just too overpowering for me. It ended up triggering a migraine each time I tried to use it even though I had only used it sparingly on a spot on my shoulder and arm. I did like how moisturizing it was without being heavy and that it didn&#x27;t discolor my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I decided to give it one more try and it earned an extra star. I&#x27;ve been having really dry itchy scalp from the weather so instead of scratching like crazy I worked it in under my hair before bed. When I woke up the next day I was itch free and not nearly as dry.</li>
    <li> garbage! it stinks and doesnt help fade nothing! marks still there, this is just a waste of money and time</li>
