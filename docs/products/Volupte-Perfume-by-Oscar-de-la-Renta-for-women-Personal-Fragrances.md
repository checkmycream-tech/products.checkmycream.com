      <li>My mother really enjoy this perfume</li>
      <li>It smells like the old Volupte...which is a good thing.  </li>
      <li>I highly suggest making sure the product you buy is made in France, not the USA!  </li>
      <li>Oscar De La Renta perfumes and eau de toilettes have always been a favorite of mine but this purchase of this fragrance was a first for me.</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed at all</li>
      <li>They have a &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; smell, not the nice smooth, soft fragrance the products made in France have.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores but thanks to amazon</li>
      <li>I gave this fragrance to my wife more than a decade ago and it became her instant favorite.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s light, crisp and floral.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly what she was looking for!  </li>
      <li>This one does not have the nice smell as I had before and in addition, it does not last.</li>
      <li>This is not for teens and is not for those that like fresh, sugar or  fruity scents.  </li>
      <li>All right.</li>

      <li>The seller took the time to pack it for safe delivery, and I definitely order again once I run out.</li>
      <li>I do think it is more of a younger scent.</li>
      <li>to me it has the smell of a Spain in hot summer months-really it does-sultry.  </li>
      <li>Sadly it is no longer made.</li>
      <li>the other hand, Amazon was extremely nice.  </li>
      <li>This has been a favorite perfume of mine for a long time.  </li>
      <li>and the price I paid was very competitive.</li>
      <li>It is the real deal</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just started wearing this about a year ago.  I wasn&#x27;t sure that I really liked the smell but it grew on me and I&#x27;ve received compliments as to how good it does smell.</li>
    <li> This has been a favorite perfume of mine for a long time.  Many years.  Spicy floral aroma, not too strong.  The problem is that Oscar de la Renta no longer makes this scent, so essentially we&#x27;re buying what was manufactured ?? years ago.  Eventually there will be no more.  And eventually I suspect the remaining bottles will not be as full-scented as they once were.  That also means you can&#x27;t get the lotion or dusting powder anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get it while you can... or not, because I&#x27;m still using it and don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my mother who has always loved Volupte. The bottle is beautiful, has good heft to it, and the perfume smells amazing on just about anybody.</li>
    <li> Oh my God this stuff is awful, its hard to believe anyone actually likes this stuff!  My nose and skin rebuke this anywhere near me!</li>
    <li> I have had this perfume several times before, and it was delicious. This one does not have the nice smell as I had before and in addition, it does not last. Why? I do not know. Have they changed the way it is being produced?</li>
    <li> After looking in several stores for this perfume I decided to check Amazon. It was a requested scent and the recipient was quite pleased.  I was told the scent was identical to their current bottle.</li>
    <li> Volupte, my very favorite for many many years.  Thank you for carrying it....I highly recommend it.  it is a soft, yet lingering scent.....</li>
    <li> Excellent for its price / quality. All right.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  I always get a compliment on how good I smell every time I go out.  I use to wear different perfumes but since this came out I never worn anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume since I was in middle school. It was given as a gift to my mother but she didn&#x27;t like the fragrance on herself but said it went well with my natural chemistry. I&#x27;ve been wearing it ever since. It&#x27;s a mature fragrance that&#x27;s light, crisp and floral.</li>
    <li> I use for 6 years this EDT, I love it, when I go to somewhere, people ask me, What is the name your EDT?</li>
    <li> The smell is not strong, It is sweet and soft.  It is just enough to turn any man&#x27;s head your way.</li>
    <li> This product is sweet, fresh, light and pleasant. I have got so many compliments from a lot of people,when I wear it. I love Volupte. It has been a part of my life for 12 years.</li>
    <li> got a small bottle of the perfume in a gift boxed set of expensive perfumes and always liked it so I ordered this one at the great price and am glad. It smells great</li>
    <li> Volupte is nearly impossible to find in stores. This is my sister&#x27;s favorite and I always buy it from this seller each  year for the holidays. Great price and packaging.</li>
    <li> Great price for size fast delivery</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume a long time ago. when I saw it; I was happy to order it. I wore it and had a couple of co-workers ask me what fragrance I was wearing. It has a standing aroma and I like the way it smells on me. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff always have. Only issue I have is the cap is loose. However that doesn&#x27;t effect how it smells.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume! The seller took the time to pack it for safe delivery, and I definitely order again once I run out.</li>
    <li> it is great that i can get this perfume for $22 dollars when i use to pay $65 for it in department stores. I always get compliments on the scent of this perfume. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I Bought this perfume for my gf about 3 years ago, she loved it then n loves still</li>
    <li> Oscar De La Renta perfumes and eau de toilettes have always been a favorite of mine but this purchase of this fragrance was a first for me. I love it! It arrived perfectly packaged and smelled beautiful. I love wearing this fragrance. It&#x27;s a 5 star product![[ASIN:B000C233MI Volupte by Oscar De La Renta for Women - 3.3 Ounce EDT Spray]]</li>
    <li> em arrived in perfect condition, is what is described in the purchase, thanks</li>
    <li> Had bought this years ago and really liked it. I had been looking for it because I wanted to try it again. I finally found it. It still smelled really good. Has kind of a fruity smell. It smells like the old Volupte...which is a good thing.  Unfortunately I am also older and my sinuses cannot take the same smells it used too. I gave it to my 25 yr old daughter.  She likes it a lot. I do think it is more of a younger scent.</li>
    <li> love it , nice fragrance</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this perfume forever!  This was my grandmothers favorite and she would wear it all the time...she passed 3 years ago but now I can think of her all the time.  THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> The only cologne I wear</li>
    <li> I have worn Oscar by Oscar for 30 yrs.  I absolutely love it.  The Volupte is a nice fragrance as well.  Oscar is still my favorite, but I like the Volupte a lot and will wear it.  I purchased the Volupte, Rosamor, So De La Renta and Oscar by Oscar.  The So De La Renta and the Oscar were made in New, NY.  They have a &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; smell, not the nice smooth, soft fragrance the products made in France have.  I highly suggest making sure the product you buy is made in France, not the USA!  Sorry USA...product not as good!</li>
    <li> She says she gets all the guys with this one</li>
    <li> nice and fun My mother really enjoy this perfume</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this fragrance and the price was a whole lot less than the local stores. Plus, I have to take care of my Princess!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this years ago and loved the smell, but this doesn&#x27;t even hold a candle to what I had. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> my mom loves this fragrance  the package came in good conditions !!!</li>
    <li> hard to find in stores. old favorite.genuine. long lasting. classy</li>
    <li> This was an official Volupte by Oscar De La Renta box and bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major problems.  The scent was weak and no staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this perfume well, my wife has used it for years, so I know what the quality should be as it is my favorite for her to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, Amazon was extremely nice.  They refunded my money and let me keep the product.&lt;br /&gt;I hope the new batch of this perfume is back to standards of Volupte by Oscar De La Renta</li>
    <li> Oscar is an ole school designer..... Get with it...</li>
    <li> Buenos dias, tengo meses esperando este paquete y no ha llegado al buzon, por favor necesito que me resuelvan el caso. Muchas Gracias</li>
    <li> Loved this fragrance.  I was not disappointed at all and the price I paid was very competitive. Would make a nice gift also.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my mom as she has been looking for this perfume for a long time.  The item was exactly what she was looking for!  She loved the fact that she was still able to find her favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> I loved it!!! Will order some more soon, the soft and lasting fragrance was one that captivated everyone&#x27;s attention e</li>
    <li> This is not for teens and is not for those that like fresh, sugar or  fruity scents.  This is deep and loud and strong.  I never wore this when it came out but now I love it and was happy to find here at a good price.  I love violet notes!  to me it has the smell of a Spain in hot summer months-really it does-sultry.  Lasts on your skin.  But my guy likes it :)  And th bottle design is very modern to my eyes</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  It is the real deal and she absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> My favorite.  Great price.  I will buy again.  I recommend this item for those who have breathing problems.  The smell is very light.</li>
    <li> It smells just as I remembered it to. Haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores but thanks to amazon I&#x27;ve found my favorite fragrance. Although I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a counterfeit? But it smells great so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I gave this fragrance to my wife more than a decade ago and it became her instant favorite.  Sadly it is no longer made. Happily the product being sold by Amazon is a 100% match to the original.  This includes packaging, container and contents as a result my wife&#x27;s christmas stocking will be a bit nicer this year with this surprise in it.</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom and my mother in law, excellent product and smell so nice, don&#x60;t buy the fakes ones that some people offer, buythis one is the original Volupte...</li>
    <li> good quality, good service! I bought this as a gift for a friend, she likes it a lot! Strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> On time and Happy about this purchase. This perfume is hard to find in stores so this gift made the recipient extremely grateful.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this perfume and there is barely any fragrance.  I am not sure if they are old (I believe this is a discontinued line) or if these are imitations, but I am done with it.  It had been my favorite fragrance for the past 25 years.  No more!  Sad.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my sisters who I knew liked it. They , of course, were satisfied.</li>
    <li> Nice Perfume, Wife loves it</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. The scent is wonderful and the price is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;I dont have 5 more words to say</li>
    <li> My sister asked for this which is her favorite perfurme.  After doing some shopping around, I found the 1.7 oz at the same price that I later found this one which is double the amount.  I don&#x27;t know how it can be done, but this is a great price.</li>
