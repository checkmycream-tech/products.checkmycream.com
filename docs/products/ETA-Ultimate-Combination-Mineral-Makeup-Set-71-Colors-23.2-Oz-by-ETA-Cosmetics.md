      <li>Over all a good product for the money.</li>

      <li>its all here and clean!</li>

      <li>This is a full size makeup kit, not a compact size so it stays on her makeup table.</li>
      <li>it came quickly.</li>
      <li>So much fun</li>
      <li>Not even worth it</li>

      <li>One of the shadows has broken...but other than that it seems ok.</li>
      <li>the eye-shadow is so soft and applies very easy and lasts longer than typical eye-shadow!</li>
      <li>I am sending it right back.  </li>

    <li> I originally ordered this product as a gift for Christmas and it had arrived damaged.  The company was quick and sincere about a product replacement.  I received the replacement and the makeup arrived just how it should. A compact kit, with many different color choices. Good for use everyday or when traveling.  Over all a good product for the money.</li>

    <li> The colors are great and they go on smoothly. The case  is nice too. Reasonably priced and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wonderful kit!  This came in the mail in tact, and had many colors in it.  I couldn&#x27;t help but put the eye shadow on like a rainbow.  So much fun experimenting with make up!  Lasts a long time.  You should get your own mascara though, this one dries too quickly.</li>
    <li> I agree. My items were cracked and I would have returned it but it was messy! I will clean it off and use it . It&#x27;s pretty and very economical ,but someone should PACK it better!!!</li>
    <li> The whole thing was cracked and broken.  It was so bad that the makeup was all over the outside of the box.  I am sending it right back.  What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> it came quickly. Super awesome!  now I don&#x27;t need 15 little pieces that float around in a bag...its all here and clean! I love it. thank you.</li>
    <li> The only powder that isn&#x27;t cracked and ruined and all over the place is the layer in the middle.  Also, the case is broken.  Returning.  Disappointed, this was a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t good packagin, some of the product was cracked, and when applying it stains your eyelid, and doesn&#x27;t work well with any eye primer, looks chalky after 1 hour,</li>
    <li> Excellent seller recommend 100%</li>
    <li> Nice variety of colors, unfortunately many of them were broken upon arrival. Perhaps better packaging would rectify so many of them breaking and mixing with other colors.</li>
    <li> The make up was breaking and it was my sisters Christmas gift! I didn&#x27;t get to give it to her.</li>
    <li> its a little bit to loose  for my taste  , i love the colors case is super is you travel a lot is compact , also make-up its fine.&lt;br /&gt;good quality for this price !</li>
    <li> I received my order and it was not the same kit.  I was sent Beauty Revolution Makeup Kit 4.22oz with 1 foundation, 3 blushes, no pencils and the over all kit was much smaller and broken into pieces.  I paid what is listed for the ETA kit (much larger kit) and received a $5 kit instead.  Very suspicious of this seller.  Yes, wrong labels can be put on by mistake but the description of my order did not match the actual kit.  And like others stated...when I opened the box I heard the sound of pieces broken off and already knew it was damaged.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Mine arrived broken as well...so upset :(</li>
    <li> Most of the eye shadows were broken and damaged.  The case itself was broken too.  I am returning the product.</li>
    <li> Great make up for the price, will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> Present for wife. She seems to love it.</li>
    <li> I was going through my makeup and getting rid of a lot of old stuff so I needed to restock! I&#x27;m glad I bought this! the eye-shadow is so soft and applies very easy and lasts longer than typical eye-shadow! Everything else is okay too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my adult daughter and she loves it.  The mailing packaging needs to be improved however, most of the eye shadow was broken but still useable.  Everything else was in tact.</li>
    <li> This product is quality. when I received was beaten and damaged some pasta.</li>
    <li> BROKEN CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE you put SOCCER STUFF with a makeup case with very nice make-up. Together. And no fragile can iadd a picture please .i will no be a customer</li>
    <li> Wife has really enjoyed the different colors.  Nothing was cracked or broken.  She said it was a very nice makeup kit.</li>
