### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best headband ever.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fits me perfectly without giving me a headache.</li>
      <li>Great for working out.  </li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>and it looks cute too!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cute!  </li>
      <li>So glad we found them!</li>
      <li>However, they look very nice and are worth buying.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS HEADBAND.</li>
      <li>I suggest hunting for something better</li>
      <li>So light you don&#x27;t even know you have it on!</li>
      <li>Looks nice but didn&#x27;t fit snug to my head</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s great for throwing my hair back for work and pretending I&#x27;m more \\&quot;together\\&quot; than I am!</li>
      <li>I tried so many headbands to keep my daughter&#x27;s smooth fine hair out of her eyes while she plays soccer or swims.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite nice looking considering it&#x27;s just rubber, and it stays put very well.  </li>
      <li>Finally a headband that is perfect for my big noggin!</li>
      <li>This headband stays put unlike most other head bands and it is super cute!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty though!</li>
      <li>I purchased the Goody Flexible Fit Ouchless Hairband to wear with my half wigs so i wont have to leave out any of my hair at the front, because its wide and it covers the wig perfectly, it wont break</li>
      <li>This is a cheap looking plastic hairband and it&#x27;s  loose fitting.</li>
      <li>I still gave it 4 stars because my head is very sensitive to pressure, so others may find it comfortable even though I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Soft plastic/rubber - feels comfortable.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering more and would recommend this to anyone especially if you play sports or exercise.</li>
      <li>This headband stays right where she wants it and doesn&#x27;t dig in, she can also wear her glasses without it causing any problems with placement.</li>
      <li>Not all that pretty but VERY functional.</li>
      <li>but id of liked the black instead of the brown.</li>
      <li>This headband fits well, and is very flattering.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t know if I could stand wearing it the whole day.</li>
      <li>It stays in really well</li>
      <li>She loves it as it really does not hurt her head.  </li>
      <li>They stay in place the whole time, and my daughter decorated them a bit with gold sticker stars to make them personalized.</li>
      <li>I think they will feel too large sooner than they should because they are not as flat a fit as some others I have purchased from them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never had a headband that would actually stay in my hair without moving until this one, it is definitely worth ordering!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Beyond the color the fit is good, but a little tight</li>
      <li>However, fabric would likely be more comfortable than this somewhat stiff plastic.</li>
      <li>These fit a bit loose for brand new.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a new mom</li>
      <li>Finally found these headbands, and they are just exactly what was needed.</li>
      <li>She is very active and likes to wear her hair back, however most headbands either dig into her head or don&#x27;t stay put.</li>
      <li>It has soft teeth to grab hair and hold it in place.</li>
      <li>I like Goody&#x27;s Ouchless soft flex headbands because they don&#x27;t give me headaches.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be adding a few more of these.  </li>
      <li>I have really annoying baby fine hair and every kind of elastic headband just slips off my head.  </li>
      <li>It fits well, being flexible rubber, compared to the hard plastic that never seems to fit the contour of my head.  </li>
      <li>Definitely would recommend it for anyone who has a sensitive scalp.</li>
      <li>So I gave it to my ten year old cousin.</li>

<li> So I gave it to my ten year old cousin.</li>
<li> It just looks sloppy and cheap.</li>
<li> too small for an adult head, no adjustment possible.</li>
<li> so it has some long wears in it.</li>
<li> The only problem is that the teeth are a little too long</li>
<li> Needless to say, when I saw this product on Amazon I quickly bought her another one.  </li>
<li> I cannot wear them as long as my other flex headbands, however, this headband has little teeth on the headband which definitely keeps itself in place on my head.</li>
<li> Fits way too tight, not much give.  </li>
<li> I also like the lighter brown color in my dark brown hair.</li>
<li> The only negative is that after a few hours, the teeth start to make your head hurt.</li>
<li> Had previously bought one of these for my granddaughter.  </li>
<li> I ordered this product thinking I was getting black headbands</li>
<li> well its black</li>
<li> So black is pictured, which I would have preferred, but I got brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I ordered black and received brown</li>
<li> Not quite ouchless; they are slightly tight.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little too tight on my head, and the plastic spikes on the bottom dig into my scalp.</li>
<li> thing wrong was it came in brown not black.</li>
<li> Drove me crazy to see my daughter fussing with her headband in the middle of a game.</li>
<li> This thing gave me a serious headache.  </li>
<li> I was afraid to try this headband because usually they don&#x27;t stay on, but this one lasted all day</li>

    <li> Soft plastic/rubber - feels comfortable.  Like it.</li>
    <li> totally functionable and attractivve</li>
    <li> Not quite ouchless; they are slightly tight. I cannot wear them as long as my other flex headbands, however, this headband has little teeth on the headband which definitely keeps itself in place on my head. I also like the lighter brown color in my dark brown hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her head band. Well made.</li>
    <li> Love these! I wear them all the time. No discomfort and doesn&#x27;t slide.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too tight on my head, and the plastic spikes on the bottom dig into my scalp. Also it irritates the back of my ears.</li>
    <li> I ordered black and received brown</li>
    <li> I guess my head is just too big for this headband because five mins after I put this thing on I felt like the back of my head was going to explode from all the pressure.  This thing gave me a serious headache.  I&#x27;m sad because i love goody products.  It&#x27;s pretty though! I wish in could wear it but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. So I gave it to my ten year old cousin.,, she loves it,</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, and she loves it. She is very active and likes to wear her hair back, however most headbands either dig into her head or don&#x27;t stay put. This headband stays right where she wants it and doesn&#x27;t dig in, she can also wear her glasses without it causing any problems with placement. It has soft teeth to grab hair and hold it in place. I will be ordering more and would recommend this to anyone especially if you play sports or exercise.</li>
    <li> This headband fits well, and is very flattering. The only negative is that after a few hours, the teeth start to make your head hurt. However, they look very nice and are worth buying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fits me perfectly without giving me a headache. I was afraid to try this headband because usually they don&#x27;t stay on, but this one lasted all day, I almost went to sleep with it on because I forgot about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing wrong was it came in brown not black. But i still like it regardless.</li>
    <li> I like Goody&#x27;s Ouchless soft flex headbands because they don&#x27;t give me headaches.  These fit a bit loose for brand new.  I think they will feel too large sooner than they should because they are not as flat a fit as some others I have purchased from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that these bands come in a variety of widths, colors, and designs.</li>
    <li> So black is pictured, which I would have preferred, but I got brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the color the fit is good, but a little tight so I don&#x27;t know if I could stand wearing it the whole day.</li>
    <li> Stays well, doesn&#x27;t slide off. Works just like a headband should. However, fabric would likely be more comfortable than this somewhat stiff plastic.</li>
    <li> too small for an adult head, no adjustment possible.</li>
    <li> Had previously bought one of these for my granddaughter.  She loves it as it really does not hurt her head.  Needless to say, when I saw this product on Amazon I quickly bought her another one.  Definitely would recommend it for anyone who has a sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Goody Flexible Fit Ouchless Hairband to wear with my half wigs so i wont have to leave out any of my hair at the front, because its wide and it covers the wig perfectly, it wont break yes that&#x27;s a plus it have an elastic at the back so if that stretches out over time i can always buy some elastic and replace it. so it has some long wears in it. I wear it every day to work , going out, well its black so it goes with every thing. I love it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best headband ever.  Great for working out.  Not all that pretty but VERY functional.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS HEADBAND. It stays in really well and it looks cute too! I have never had a headband that would actually stay in my hair without moving until this one, it is definitely worth ordering!</li>
    <li> Looks nice but didn&#x27;t fit snug to my head</li>
    <li> Finally a headband that is perfect for my big noggin! Plus these don&#x27;t slip up in the back &amp; the teeth don&#x27;t dig in to my scalp!</li>
    <li> It fits well, being flexible rubber, compared to the hard plastic that never seems to fit the contour of my head.  It&#x27;s quite nice looking considering it&#x27;s just rubber, and it stays put very well.  The only problem is that the teeth are a little too long and they hurt my head and/or make it itchy.  I still gave it 4 stars because my head is very sensitive to pressure, so others may find it comfortable even though I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking I was getting black headbands and I ended up getting brown, I still use them but id of liked the black instead of the brown.</li>
    <li> This headband stays put unlike most other head bands and it is super cute! Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This is a cheap looking plastic hairband and it&#x27;s  loose fitting. It just looks sloppy and cheap. I suggest hunting for something better</li>
    <li> So light you don&#x27;t even know you have it on!</li>
    <li> Fits way too tight, not much give.  Gave it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I tried so many headbands to keep my daughter&#x27;s smooth fine hair out of her eyes while she plays soccer or swims. But, they always shifted, fell off, or required attention. Drove me crazy to see my daughter fussing with her headband in the middle of a game. Finally found these headbands, and they are just exactly what was needed. They stay in place the whole time, and my daughter decorated them a bit with gold sticker stars to make them personalized. So glad we found them!</li>
    <li> I have really annoying baby fine hair and every kind of elastic headband just slips off my head.  This is the only thing to actually keep my hair back and stay on my head.  It doesn&#x27;t give me headaches like rigid headbands and as a bonus it&#x27;s cute!  Next time I&#x27;m putting together an amazon order I&#x27;ll definitely be adding a few more of these.  I&#x27;m a new mom so it&#x27;s great for throwing my hair back for work and pretending I&#x27;m more \\&quot;together\\&quot; than I am!</li>
