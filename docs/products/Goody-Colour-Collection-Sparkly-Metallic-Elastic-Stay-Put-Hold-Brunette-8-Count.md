### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Especially good when exercising or if it is windy.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find them at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The best part is that they don&#x27;t get all tangled up in my hair, either.</li>
      <li>The color, hold, stretch of the elastics are perfect!</li>
      <li>Colors match my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>but they are perfect.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very happy to get them through amazon.</li>
      <li>I was so happy amazon had these.  </li>
      <li>You can do better, Amazon.com!!</li>
      <li>I will never buy another kind of hairband!  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re fabric, which is comfortable whenever you have to wear it on your wrist, but the rubber spiral helps it hold onto your hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>so Amazon is a good help</li>
      <li>But yes, the color match is surprisingly good.</li>
      <li>Love these!  </li>
      <li>Love these!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very fair price for 24 hair elastics that really hold your hair.</li>
      <li>These are the best hair bands to secure straight hair.  </li>
      <li>I saw a couple of reviewers complain that these eventually break at the join, and that&#x27;s true, but they&#x27;re absolutely the best pony holder I&#x27;ve found for a pile of hair.</li>
      <li>Love how they are in brown bc</li>
      <li>Perfect for Brunette, Auburn, and Red hair.  </li>
      <li>I love Goody&#x27;s Stayput collection.</li>
      <li>Very happy to seem them online, especially in the brown colors!</li>
      <li>I love these hair binders.</li>
      <li>I finally ran out of these and couldn&#x27;t find them in stores, so I stocked up here on Amazon :D</li>
      <li>they may work better for you.</li>
      <li>Glad to see these on Amazon, no longer in stores.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I love the color of these</li>
      <li>These are just okay.</li>
      <li>You will be glad you tried these.</li>
      <li>These are the best elastic bands for hair, especially fine, thin hair.  </li>
      <li>These won&#x27;t even go around my bun twice and break so easily.</li>
      <li>Great product, holds like no other</li>
      <li>Thankfully some are still available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>They have great hold, don&#x27;t slide, and the lighter color blends into my hair much better than black.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length fine hair, a lot of it, and these work great to hold it in place without slipping out.</li>
      <li>far as the color matching goes, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>I found these elastics at my local store and I absolutely love them!  </li>
      <li>These are the best hair bands for thick hair!</li>
      <li>Thanks to others who confirmed that the package does, in fact, contain THREE retail packs.</li>
      <li>Probably my fault for having so much hair, but worth noting!</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>While I love the new blonde/brunette color collection, these particular rubber bands do not hold up very well.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get these locally any more</li>
      <li>Great product last a long time and stays in place.</li>
      <li>The lighter color disappears in my brown hair, and the darker color blends well enough and even looks a bit sophisticated if you happen to catch a glimpse of it.</li>
      <li>Love how these are the only ponytail holders that stay in without ripping my hair when I pull them out.</li>
      <li>reading subsequent reviews to mine, I decided to attempt ordering the 3 packs for $12.33 again because I love these hair ties and can&#x27;t get them anywhere else.</li>
      <li>so I am willing to spend the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased these in the past and you&#x27;d think $12.30 for 24 elastics is a fair price</li>
      <li>It really does stay put.  </li>
      <li>Really bummed I opened them all and can&#x27;t return them now.</li>
      <li>Hands down these are my favorite pony tail holders.  </li>
      <li>Bought these in the store in black and haven&#x27;t been able to find them since.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of hold to keep your ponytail solid even while working out, but it&#x27;s not so much that it hurts to take it out of your hair.</li>
      <li>which is important because i have super thick hair.</li>
      <li>I called Amazon and got a terrific gal in customer service who agreed that paying $12.33 for 8 hair ties was pretty steep and that the listing was mis-leading.</li>
      <li>I was worried that the Brunette colors would be too dark for my light brown/blondish hair</li>
      <li>I have long, fine curly hair and normal elastics seem to slide right out of my hair no matter how tight I tried to make them.  </li>
      <li>This type is my favorite but has become hard to find.</li>
      <li>This specific kind and color band is hard to find.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really care if they were neon yellow</li>
      <li>Maybe if you don&#x27;t have quite as thick a hair as me, they would be okay</li>
      <li>Glad I finally found someplace that had them in the browns instead of just black like the local stores sell.</li>
      <li>worse still, this is the 4th order I&#x27;ve had problems with in as many weeks.</li>
      <li>These things just work so well for thick hair that the color wasn&#x27;t that important to me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d much rather have a darker band than a weird too light one.</li>
      <li>They stay in my super thick curly hair and they don&#x27;t stretch out.</li>

<li> They stay in my super thick curly hair and they don&#x27;t stretch out.</li>
<li> I bought several packages to last me as long as possible.</li>
<li> The thick, 4mm size with the nonslip grooves really holds my super thick hair.</li>
<li> These elastics also seem to last a while before they get stretched out or break.</li>
<li> After only one day of having my hair up they are already stretched out.</li>
<li> They are also long and stretchy enough to take out of your hair without pulling out some hair strands as well.  </li>
<li> No, apparently it&#x27;s now $12.30 for 8---yes, just 8 elastics!&lt;br</li>
<li> Initially when these &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; elastics came out they were a bonus sample with my regular Goody elastics, but when I realized that I could use them and they would just hold my hair up all day long without sliding loose or moving around</li>
<li> Matches the color of my hair and is far less visible.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve broken many other types of elastics trying to get them tight enough to stay in my hair.  </li>
<li> I think the quality on this particular product is not up to Goody&#x27;s usual standards.</li>
<li> My local stores only carried black; these brown ones look nicer and still hold with the same &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; as the generic black ones of the same style.</li>
<li> I hope they make these as long as I have long hair.</li>
<li> and they hold up for a really really long time.  </li>
<li> only drawback is that sometimes they pop open because the connectors cannot withstand the bands being pulled too tight.</li>
<li> at least not this sixpence and the smaller thin black ones break so easily!  </li>
<li> These however do not keep their elasticity very long at all.</li>
<li> They hold tight enough to secure my hair but aren&#x27;t uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> Three packs will last me a few years.</li>
<li> All the reviews I have read about these new hair bands say they are not nearly as good as the Stayput ones.</li>
<li> Just wanted to alert other buyers that you get one pack of 8 hair ties and that is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Plus they don&#x27;t lose their shape after one wear like some other styles.</li>
<li> Upon use (either initial or subsequent), these have broken apart at the plastic ring.</li>
<li> These are the only hairbands that will hold my thick hair all day without slipping.  </li>
<li> The only hairbands that can keep my unruly thick hair in place.</li>
<li> They are a little pricey, but I know they work</li>
<li> The little rubber-like grippers on these ties are genius.  </li>
<li> As a person with very very thick hair, I was hoping that these would hold my ponies up, but I can&#x27;t typically wrap them around my ponytail twice (which is what I need).</li>
<li> Hard to find in stores</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought Goody products for myself and my girls for at least 30 years.</li>
<li> I have thick hair and can never find elastics that work well.</li>
<li> I have really thick hair.</li>
<li> These are so hard to find in stores!  </li>

    <li> These are just okay. As a person with very very thick hair, I was hoping that these would hold my ponies up, but I can&#x27;t typically wrap them around my ponytail twice (which is what I need). They snap on me constantly. And it HURTS! Maybe if you don&#x27;t have quite as thick a hair as me, they would be okay, I just feel like they are not sealed well, end to end.</li>
    <li> Hands down these are my favorite pony tail holders.  I can&#x27;t find them anywhere anymore at least not this sixpence and the smaller thin black ones break so easily!  I love the color of these and they hold up for a really really long time.  I was so happy amazon had these.  Three packs will last me a few years.</li>
    <li> These are the best hair bands for thick hair! They help keep a pony tail in place without ripping out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that sometimes they pop open because the connectors cannot withstand the bands being pulled too tight. Probably my fault for having so much hair, but worth noting!</li>
    <li> I adore these hair ties. They&#x27;re fabric, which is comfortable whenever you have to wear it on your wrist, but the rubber spiral helps it hold onto your hair perfectly. It&#x27;s just the right amount of hold to keep your ponytail solid even while working out, but it&#x27;s not so much that it hurts to take it out of your hair. I finally ran out of these and couldn&#x27;t find them in stores, so I stocked up here on Amazon :D&lt;br /&gt;As far as the color matching goes, it&#x27;s pretty good. I wouldn&#x27;t really care if they were neon yellow though, they work so well. But yes, the color match is surprisingly good. The lighter color disappears in my brown hair, and the darker color blends well enough and even looks a bit sophisticated if you happen to catch a glimpse of it.</li>
    <li> This specific kind and color band is hard to find.  Perfect for Brunette, Auburn, and Red hair.  It really does stay put.  This is the only elastic band I will use - it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, it remains in place, and the color is discrete.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed. I have thick hair and can never find elastics that work well. These won&#x27;t even go around my bun twice and break so easily. Really bummed I opened them all and can&#x27;t return them now.</li>
    <li> Love these! They stay in my super thick curly hair and they don&#x27;t stretch out. The best part is that they don&#x27;t get all tangled up in my hair, either.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and need to use &#x27;stay put&#x27; hair ties to keep my hair up. These however do not keep their elasticity very long at all. After only one day of having my hair up they are already stretched out. They will sort-of stay put if I&#x27;m not running, jogging, or jumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair they may work better for you.</li>
    <li> The color, hold, stretch of the elastics are perfect! I bought several packages to last me as long as possible.</li>
    <li> I love Goody&#x27;s Stayput collection. This product page uses a picture of Stayput and uses the Stayput name, but they are shipping out the newer hair bands that no longer have Stayput anywhere on the packaging. All the reviews I have read about these new hair bands say they are not nearly as good as the Stayput ones.</li>
    <li> Love how these are the only ponytail holders that stay in without ripping my hair when I pull them out. Love how they are in brown bc I could not find brown in stores.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another kind of hairband!  They stay in all day and don&#x27;t rip out your hair!  It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
    <li> These are the best elastic bands for hair, especially fine, thin hair.  They do not budge at all once you have wrapped them around.</li>
    <li> Great product last a long time and stays in place. I have very thick and curly hair. Hard to find in stores so Amazon is a good help</li>
    <li> The only hairbands that can keep my unruly thick hair in place. Plus they don&#x27;t lose their shape after one wear like some other styles. I just wish you could still find these in stores.</li>
    <li> I love these hair binders. They don&#x27;t move at all...which is important because i have super thick hair. I was worried that the Brunette colors would be too dark for my light brown/blondish hair but they are perfect. I&#x27;d much rather have a darker band than a weird too light one.</li>
    <li> I found these elastics at my local store and I absolutely love them!  I have long, fine curly hair and normal elastics seem to slide right out of my hair no matter how tight I tried to make them.  I&#x27;ve broken many other types of elastics trying to get them tight enough to stay in my hair.  The little rubber-like grippers on these ties are genius.

I hope they make these as long as I have long hair.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair in place. Especially good when exercising or if it is windy.</li>
    <li> These are the only hairbands that will hold my thick hair all day without slipping.  I used to wear TWO of the thinner bands trying to get them to hold.  Glad I finally found someplace that had them in the browns instead of just black like the local stores sell.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair this held my hair in a ponytail all day :-)&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to all!&lt;br /&gt;Fab x</li>
    <li> Love these!  Bought these in the store in black and haven&#x27;t been able to find them since.  Very happy to seem them online, especially in the brown colors!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and these are the only things that hold my hair in place. Love them. They are a little pricey, but I know they work so I am willing to spend the money. I used to buy these at Target, but they no longer sell them.</li>
    <li> Just a head&#x27;s up. The listing says \\&quot;8 Count (pack of 3) which gave me the impression that I was getting 24 hair ties for $12.33 - the price at the time I purchased this item. I only received one pack of 8. I called Amazon and got a terrific gal in customer service who agreed that paying $12.33 for 8 hair ties was pretty steep and that the listing was mis-leading. I got a refund. Just wanted to alert other buyers that you get one pack of 8 hair ties and that is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revision July 2013&lt;br /&gt;After reading subsequent reviews to mine, I decided to attempt ordering the 3 packs for $12.33 again because I love these hair ties and can&#x27;t get them anywhere else. This time, they actually sent me all three packs for a total of 24 hair ties. I would now order again without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these in the past and you&#x27;d think $12.30 for 24 elastics is a fair price, right? No, apparently it&#x27;s now $12.30 for 8---yes, just 8 elastics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I gave the item 4 stars (since I like them and can only find them here), there is simply NO WAY I&#x27;ll make another purchase for them at this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, and worse still, this is the 4th order I&#x27;ve had problems with in as many weeks. You can do better, Amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get these locally any more so I&#x27;m very happy to get them through amazon. The thick, 4mm size with the nonslip grooves really holds my super thick hair. I saw a couple of reviewers complain that these eventually break at the join, and that&#x27;s true, but they&#x27;re absolutely the best pony holder I&#x27;ve found for a pile of hair.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair in place even during strenuous workouts.  Matches the color of my hair and is far less visible.  You will be glad you tried these.</li>
    <li> These thugs are horrible. They break at the seam every time we try to wrap a third time. And wrapping pony only twice does not hold. Don&#x27;t buy. The product.</li>
    <li> These are so hard to find in stores!  I was very happy to find them at Amazon.  They have great hold, don&#x27;t slide, and the lighter color blends into my hair much better than black.</li>
    <li> Thanks to others who confirmed that the package does, in fact, contain THREE retail packs. It&#x27;s a very fair price for 24 hair elastics that really hold your hair. This type is my favorite but has become hard to find. My local stores only carried black; these brown ones look nicer and still hold with the same &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; as the generic black ones of the same style. These elastics also seem to last a while before they get stretched out or break.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought Goody products for myself and my girls for at least 30 years. While I love the new blonde/brunette color collection, these particular rubber bands do not hold up very well. Upon use (either initial or subsequent), these have broken apart at the plastic ring. I think the quality on this particular product is not up to Goody&#x27;s usual standards.</li>
    <li> Great product, holds like no other</li>
    <li> Colors match my hair perfectly. Glad to see these on Amazon, no longer in stores. These last forever!</li>
    <li> These are the best hair bands to secure straight hair.  I have shoulder length fine hair, a lot of it, and these work great to hold it in place without slipping out.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair. Initially when these &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; elastics came out they were a bonus sample with my regular Goody elastics, but when I realized that I could use them and they would just hold my hair up all day long without sliding loose or moving around I started buying them exclusively. These days they don&#x27;t seem to be sold in stores.. have they been discontinued? I don&#x27;t know. Thankfully some are still available on Amazon. I got the brunette package because it&#x27;s what was in stock even though I&#x27;m a blonde. I don&#x27;t even care. These things just work so well for thick hair that the color wasn&#x27;t that important to me.</li>
