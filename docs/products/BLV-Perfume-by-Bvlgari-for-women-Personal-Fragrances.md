      <li>Smells baby fresh, like you just got out of the shower,&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is fresh with a bit of a powder scent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this review was written right</li>
      <li>Now, it&#x27;s easy to find the new variations of the fragrance</li>
      <li>I love this soft gentle perfume.</li>
      <li>surprised at how strong it is.</li>
      <li>very strong and lasts long too.</li>
      <li>it was a much better price than in the stores and it is just the same.</li>
      <li>I first discovered this perfume during some travels in 1999, before it was released in the US in 2000.</li>
      <li>be aware about where you purchase this product from even if its sold on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Absolutely One of my Favorites!  </li>
      <li>Thanks BLV !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough that you can wear it daily, but it is something that can be worn out for a nice evening/event.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a Classic!</li>
      <li>I first found out about this perfume from a Youtuber who highly recommended it.</li>
      <li>so I normally only wear light body sprays.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the item was packaged well.  </li>
      <li>Best Parfum ever, sooo sorry they have stopped making it!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t bought nice perfume before because I never liked one enough to warrant a whole bottle, but this one was well worth it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly a classic.</li>
      <li>It has a clean fresh scent that leaves a long lasting smell.</li>
      <li>I lke the scent very much, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
      <li>The product I received was definitely the real thing!</li>
      <li>I instantly fell in love with it and bought several bottles to last me for awhile.</li>
      <li>I like very few perfumes, but this one has been my favorite for years.</li>
      <li>Love this hard to find fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Hard to beat this lovely scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find this perfume any more.  </li>
      <li>My husband is sensitive to perfumes</li>
      <li>I have been a fan of Bvlgari fragrances for some time now, however,  Bvlgari Blv, by far is my favorite; not to mention, my other half has stated rather emphatically, that I will be wearing this particular scent &#x27;forever&#x27;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe because it is a clear, natural floral, airy musk,  creamy cool, light green ....</li>
      <li>/&gt;It lasts all day and you smell powder fresh all day and still light enough that you wont get tired of the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I found this several years ago and now cannot live without it.</li>
      <li>I tend to go back to it even after all the new fragrances that come out.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this fragrance... so delicate!</li>

    <li> Bulgari Blu for women is not easy to find&lt;br /&gt;I tried at the Duty Free shops in the airport, during a travel, but everything was solo expensive.&lt;br /&gt;this is the best price ever</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume after my sister gave me the last of her bottle to try.  I had asked her what she was wearing, because she smelled so nice and fresh.  I absolutely love it!  My husband is sensitive to perfumes so I normally only wear light body sprays.  However, this perfume is ALL I wear now, it has a beautiful clean, fresh scent that I love.
