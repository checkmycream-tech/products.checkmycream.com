### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect and just like off the shelf.</li>
      <li>I have also put powdered eye shadow over the line for a smoky look and that everything stayed \\&quot;put\\&quot; perfectly until I removed it</li>
      <li>excellent product.</li>
      <li>If they made this product in a pot it would be perfect.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST eyeliner ever!!</li>
      <li>Wonderful product, very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
      <li>In my search for the perfect liner, I&#x27;ve tried Stilla, Kat von D&#x27;s tatoo, Too</li>
      <li>the eyeliner is perfect but why does it come in a ziploc bag and not in its box??</li>
      <li>It stays put and the tip makes a perfect line every time.</li>
      <li>The tip IS perfect for the cat-eye effect, but the formula is off.</li>
      <li>Once it dries, don&#x27;t try to go over it again and try perfect your line, because it will crumble and flake.</li>
      <li>Best beauty product for eyes ever!</li>
      <li>great!</li>
      <li>eyeliner still need experienced applying technique,&lt;br</li>

      <li>I absolutely love this liner!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very nice product, but it&#x27;s not something I will be using all the time.</li>
      <li>PERFECT TOP LINER</li>
      <li>Gets to the lashes easily so there is no &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34; eyeliner by the lashes and best part it doesnt get in my eyes!!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply and to achieve the perfect wing!</li>
      <li>OHH since its water proof, best advice get a good make up remover something easy on eyes.</li>
      <li>That all being said, if you get it correct, it does not budge and looks gorgeous.</li>
      <li>It looked so good on their models and their demostration.  </li>
      <li>So while I still don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this gel liner, I can say that the seller was upstanding.</li>
      <li>I am fairly good at drawing cat eyes with liquid liner, but I messed up and could not</li>
      <li>I did get it on and looking good.  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m good till the evening.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I have woken up with perfect liner after a full day of wear...</li>
      <li>It is perfect for getting right at the lash line.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for getting right at the lash</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>

      <li>it is great for everyone even beggins because it is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>It looked great when I put it on, and it was easy to apply.</li>
      <li>AMAZING...</li>
      <li>This eye liner is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind of liner that you could wear for two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the real drawing power of this product is that it is the best (that I&#x27;ve found) FOR BEGINNERS.</li>
      <li>I started off loving this product, but within weeks of purchasing I noticed that the liner was building up in the applicator.</li>
      <li>I have never been more impressed with a product it is so simple but so effective it makes me jump for joy.</li>
      <li>:) I was very pleased with the timeliness of my shipment as well.</li>
      <li>My friend bought this product for me because it&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Love it so much , so easy to apply, staying power is amazing.</li>
      <li>make up counter&amp;#34; Please try it for yourself and you will fall in love.</li>
      <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll need to buy a better liquid liner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Okay, so maybe this is how the product is supposed to be.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>And yes, I got it from a reputable department store.</li>
      <li>so i could see how it would work and fell in love.</li>
      <li>Assuming that this is just an issue with my pen, by the end of the day the liner does smear on to my top eyelid.</li>
      <li>My FAVORITE Eyeliner.</li>
      <li>will surely purchase this again an again❤</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been a Benefit user, love their &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>You need a sure hand and no interruptions.</li>
      <li>:) :) :)</li>
      <li>If you need more liner, you can&#x27;t get it.  </li>
      <li>love this product for when I want an edge to my eye makeup</li>
      <li>I do much better with an angled brush.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>longer than most eye liners have tried over the years.</li>
      <li>I found that the more you twist out, the easier it is to make a mistake.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure somebody must like it if they made a trial size for it...</li>
      <li>many, many hours</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if I practiced every day for a month I could make this eyeliner do what I want, but who has time for that?</li>
      <li>If you can have a qtip, or whatever you use to correct your errors, ready and waiting, it&#x27;s a great liner.</li>
      <li>I love the line and definition it gives.  </li>
      <li>I love that it does not smudge off during the day and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>I have two different kinds of Clinique eye makeup remover that work beautifully for every kind of eye makeup I have ever used, including waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>It does hug the lash line pretty good</li>
      <li>love everything about this eyeliner, the precise head , the grip , the controlled dispensing system.&lt;br /&gt;But be advised this magical tool is not for beginners</li>
      <li>but the product goes on more smoothly over the primer.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and it takes forever to perform corrections to make your eyes look ultimately &#x27;ok&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>It is SUPER easy to make precise angles, in traditionally popular eyeliner wing shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>on, this dries very, very quickly.</li>
      <li>Doesnt flow easily and clumps, subpar to the quality</li>
      <li>Application is easy but takes getting used to.</li>
      <li>and I was finally able to get to the lash line and clean it up.  </li>
      <li>I wore it through 6 hours of working (and I work in food, with hot grills and constant sweating), came home and napped for four hours, and woke up with my eyeliner still perfectly in place.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and is terribly easy to use, even for a cat-eye novice like me.  </li>
      <li>this was a huge N-O-T-H-I-N-G.</li>
      <li>I had huge expectations for this liner.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>You have to run this angled applicator along your lash line, and I find it drags and skips rather than move smoothly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;can&#x27;t get a smooth think line that hugs lash line.&lt;br /&gt;getting</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely a nice option to have if your wanting a really stay put look.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m an experienced makeup veteran.  </li>
      <li>right some more natural colors would be good, like smokey brown.</li>
      <li>I bought this at Sephora and was SO excited</li>
      <li>Hard to draw a perfect line.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My FAVORITE Eyeliner. Love it so much , so easy to apply, staying power is amazing. Don&#x27;t try and buy this, because I&#x27;m going to stockpile this brand! :) :) :)</li>
    <li> Perfect and just like off the shelf.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeliner for the past month or so and I absolutely love it!  I will never go back to a pencil, ever again!  I love the line and definition it gives.  Totally worth the money.  I love that it does not smudge off during the day and lasts all day.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> If you can have a qtip, or whatever you use to correct your errors, ready and waiting, it&#x27;s a great liner. Be very careful though.....I am fairly good at drawing cat eyes with liquid liner, but I messed up and could not and I mean could not, correct my mistakes after the liner dried. You have like a 3-5 second window. Hold up the liner to the light and twist out a very small amount. I found that the more you twist out, the easier it is to make a mistake. Less is def more here. That all being said, if you get it correct, it does not budge and looks gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Great product once you get the hang of it. This is definitely the real deal.</li>
    <li> This liner has a very, very dry formula.  Reminds me of my MAC Blacktrack Fluidline that is at the end of it&#x27;s life.  I would click through the first 3-5 clicks of the gel to get rid of the crumbly dry product on the top.  You have to be really careful not to dispense too much gel and risk crumbly globs coming out of the tip, or too little and risk running out of product on your eye.  Because of the dry formula, you have an extraordinarily short period of time (read: 5-7 seconds) to get this on and get it right.  I&#x27;ve been wearing eyeliner for at least 10+ years and I have trouble getting a nice crisp black line.  Once it dries, don&#x27;t try to go over it again and try perfect your line, because it will crumble and flake. With all that being said, I really do like the design and and the rubber tip applicator.  Unfortunately, I threw away the orange stopper thing, but people say to keep it so your liner doesn&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to watch youtube tutorials to get a handle on if I want to buy the product or not and I came across a Korean girl that was comparing the Benefit They&#x27;re Real! Push-Up Liner vs. Maybelline Lasting Drama Pen Gel Liner.  The pens are VERY similar, but her review did favor the Maybelline one.  Since it&#x27;s not available for purchase in the US, I decided to order one on Amazon (of course) at a very reasonable cost.  Less than 6 dollars, plus free shipping!  We&#x27;ll see which one I like better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh---last note.  Do not waste your money on the make-up remover.  Comes off just fine with the Ponds Cold Cream Cleanser or Neutrogena make-up remover wipes.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Hard to remove after applying</li>
    <li> Hard to use when I squeeze the tip I get too much liner.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is very dry and does not line easily</li>
    <li> this product was not what I expected and I didn&#x27;t care for it!</li>
    <li> I gave this product a one star rating, because I have found that it&#x27;s quite dry and doesn&#x27;t go on easily.  After I first purchased it, it took something like 40 turns of the wand to get the liquid to the end brush.  While the directions say to give it a click or two each time you use it, I have to turn/click it several times during each application.  I agree with the criticisms that it only makes a very thick line, too.  It also flakes off and certainly doesn&#x27;t stay on for 24 hours, as advertised.  Won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product. I find it very hard to get the perfect winged liner. I do much better with an angled brush. The product is also very very hard to get off. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s a very nice product, but it&#x27;s not something I will be using all the time.</li>
    <li> excellent product. I recommend it</li>
    <li> It does have a learning curve but once you get it down its a great product.</li>
    <li> nice waterproof and last long</li>
    <li> So, I had some mixed feelings about this liner, which caused me to search for something else. I wear winged liner everyday without fail--it&#x27;s the one thing I won&#x27;t leave the house without. In my search for the perfect liner, I&#x27;ve tried Stilla, Kat von D&#x27;s tatoo, Too Faced 3 way lash liner and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I came running back to this one, because despite its flaws I haven&#x27;t found anything else that&#x27;s as deeply pigmented -and- stays on my oily lids all day without smudging like Benefit&#x27;s Push Up Liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to draw a thin line&lt;br /&gt;- liner sometimes leaks out of tip while you&#x27;re not using it, wasting the product&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to draw a perfect line.&lt;br /&gt;- The learning curve on how much to &amp;#34;push up&amp;#34; to get the look you want -- too much and you have to wipe it off, again wasting the product&lt;br /&gt;- Have to go over it a few times for a smooth line (it skips, as another reviewer noted)&lt;br /&gt;- rubber tip take a lot of practice to get the shape you want right and even as a veteran eyeliner user, I still sometimes mess up&lt;br /&gt;- Hate that I can&#x27;t see how much of the product is left in the container&lt;br /&gt;- Dries quickly so not much time to fix mistakes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- this stuff is BLACK. Extremely pigmented&lt;br /&gt;- Once it&#x27;s on, it stays on all day without smudging, even on oily lids&lt;br /&gt;- Creates beautiful, thick cat-eye/winged eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like there are a lot more cons than pros--which is why I initially looked for something else. But the reality is nothing else comes close to the final look and extended wearability of the liner, which is why this is now my go-to.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this liner!! After numerous attempts at trying to apply liquid liner and messing up always on my left eye, this liner has solved that problem for me, not to mention it stays on all day. I would stock up on this eyeliner out of fear that like many amazing products, they sometimes disappear off the market, so frustrating!!  It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Doesnt flow easily and clumps, subpar to the quality Im used to from Benefit.</li>
    <li> Benefit is a splurge item for me, so I was very disappointed with this gel pen. The liner comes out streaky and chunky and gets everywhere. Pros: VERY black, long lasting. Doesn&#x27;t work miracles, though,</li>
    <li> Omg !!! I have never had luck applying eyeliner but this definitely makes it easier will surely purchase this again an again❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Not what I expected it is very black but dries out easy so it&#x27;s not easy to make a precise line. They need to work out the formula.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite liquid eyeliner. I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and this is my favorite. It goes on smoothly and stays on all day. I rarely have to reapply. It doesn&#x27;t smudge either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d love it but for one major problem.  If you need more liner, you can&#x27;t get it.  The black It doesn&#x27;t react immediately to twisting the base.  The nexty time you open it though, it&#x27;s splooshed out, and needs to be used with a liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, great consistency of gel or whatever it is.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got an old product, but it always comes out in weird clumps and never settles into anything like a liquid.  I have never done anything with it except try to put it on, then wipe it off, try again later, and finally I threw it away.</li>
    <li> the eyeliner is perfect but why does it come in a ziploc bag and not in its box??</li>
    <li> The combination of thick creamy liner and &amp;#34;push up applicator&amp;#34; is not a harmonious marriage of product and concept ... however once you have mastered the awkward, product wasting application process, you will have a thick, cat eye, super long lasting liner... the product inside is by far my FAVORITE LINER. I have oily eyelids an tend to get raccoon eyes from all non liquid liners but I have woken up with perfect liner after a full day of wear... IT&#x27;S REALLY GREAT STUFF...If they made this product in a pot it would be perfect. I understand they wanted to do something clever and different with the product to make it easier to use and exciting to customers but I feel like the applicator really takes away from an otherwise phenomenal product.</li>
    <li> I can tell, after using it at home a few times, why people don&#x27;t like this eyeliner after a while. HOWEVER, the real drawing power of this product is that it is the best (that I&#x27;ve found) FOR BEGINNERS. I was doing HORRIBLY at subtle wings with pot gel liner and Stila felt-tip liquid liner, but this was like using training wheels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is EXTREMELY pigmented. It is SUPER easy to make precise angles, in traditionally popular eyeliner wing shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is awful, though! If I saw it on sale, I&#x27;d buy a few.</li>
    <li> This is unfortunately one of the worst products I have ever tried in the way of eyeliner. Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and it takes forever to perform corrections to make your eyes look ultimately &#x27;ok&#x27;.  And I&#x27;m an experienced makeup veteran.  It just isn&#x27;t worth the time and the same look or better can be accomplished with a less frustrating product.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used that does not smudge throughout the day. Stays on until you take it off. Best beauty product for eyes ever!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Not the easiest applicator due to the way the gel is dispensed, but it does a great job with a dark line that really emphasizes the eye. I&#x27;d recommend for occasions and not daily use as it&#x27;s difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> Seriously the BEST eyeliner I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been telling anyone that will listen about it. I wore it through 6 hours of working (and I work in food, with hot grills and constant sweating), came home and napped for four hours, and woke up with my eyeliner still perfectly in place. It took a bit to get used to the applicator but once I did it&#x27;s much easier than most liners. I would recommend buying the they&#x27;re real makeup remover though, i had a very hard time getting it off with anything else, even my estee lauder eye makeup remover. 100% worth the money, i don&#x27;t see myself using another liner ever again.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this liner.  I had high hopes because I love just about all Benefits products including the brow service.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  heavily pigmented gel.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: just about impossible to get anything but a fat clunky line.  If you click out to much, it crumbles and cakes, if you don&#x27;t click out enough liner you can&#x27;t get a fluid motion that is super important for a smooth application.  It felt very heavy on my eyelid witch I was willing to get over but after 4 hours a few spots began to flake.  I&#x27;m sure if I practiced every day for a month I could make this eyeliner do what I want, but who has time for that? It was super hard to remove too, which is okay if it was a better liner all together.  I&#x27;ve been using liquid liner and gel for over 15 years and still couldn&#x27;t get desired results with this little guy.  Sad stuff.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to makeup. The eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried in the past were both pencils, and they would either fade or irritate my eyes. This eyeliner stays on all day. I got mine at Ulta a few days ago in the Beyond Brown shade, recommended to me by one of the sales associates there. It&#x27;s so easy to apply and to achieve the perfect wing! Some of the other reviews are saying that the product is clumpy, and I believe this happens when you pump out too much or when the tip is dried out (which you are supposed to wipe off to get fresh liner each time). You only need to click it once or twice before each application. This eyeliner has never come out clumpy for me. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. Only $24 at Sephora  and one of my favorite buys. It lasts ALLDAY. It goes on smooth and is terribly easy to use, even for a cat-eye novice like me.  I did hear others say it&#x27;s clumpy, but I haven&#x27;t had that issue - maybe cleaning the rubber might help. It does flake slightly.... But not much. Definitely my favorite eye product!</li>
    <li> This eye liner is AMAZING. I have never been more impressed with a product it is so simple but so effective it makes me jump for joy. I am into the Pin up Cat eye make up. I use to wear liquid all the time but slowly the liquid i use to buy began to get cheap and it would run and irritate my eyes. I Saw this and was in Awe. I refused to buy it online until i saw it for myself. I went to Macys had the ladies apply it for me so i could see how it would work and fell in love. It is SOOOO easy to use.very soft. Gets to the lashes easily so there is no &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34; eyeliner by the lashes and best part it doesnt get in my eyes!!!! I also purchased the Mascara it is okay, but i prefer the bare minerals &amp;#34;Lash Domination&amp;#34;. If you like making small lines or thick bold lines this is the liner for you. If you have doubts and your macys has a &amp;#34;Benefits make up counter&amp;#34; Please try it for yourself and you will fall in love. OHH since its water proof, best advice get a good make up remover something easy on eyes. this does last all day i jumped in the pool with it and it did not come off at all!</li>
    <li> First few hours of application are great. Dark heavy line and hugs lashes real well. Application is easy but takes getting used to. I work 12 hour shifts and this product does not last that long. It smudges onthe sides and clumps really bad. Not sure if i can retouch it since it already feels heavy on your lids upon application. I tried to use it both with and without eye shadow. Same results. I guess it is worth a try but I&#x27;m not sure I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this from sephora after trying the tester. It looked great when I put it on, and it was easy to apply. After about an hour of wear, it started flaking off like paint would. After 3 hours, it was missing spots and flaking into my eyes. I used the one I bought about 4 times, consistently bad results wether I went out into the heat (of FL) or not. I did twist out about 2 cm worth of the product before the first use, as the store clerk suggested, so obviously this was not the issue.</li>
    <li> Im not the type to buy a $30 eyeliner, but this is fully worth it. I love it it makes it so easy and fast to do my winged eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner sucks dries fast not a smooth application and clumps worst thing ever !!</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;heavily pigmented gel that dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;good for novices trying to learn how to draw line, but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll need to buy a better liquid liner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t get a smooth think line that hugs lash line.&lt;br /&gt;getting the proper amount of product on the rubber thingy&lt;br /&gt;flakes</li>
    <li> This liner stays on really well. I have oily eyelids, which make eyeliners very difficult stay put. But this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It stays on really long, and i need just about one slight retouch in the middle of the day and i&#x27;m good till the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just had a little difficulty learning how to use the rubber tip and taking out the right amount of gel for each use. But you get used to it and get a technique going after a while.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from HSN.  It looked so good on their models and their demostration.  I found it really pulled on my eyelids so I went from the outside&lt;br /&gt;corner in.  It did not glide on.  I did get it on and looking good.  But as the day went by it flaked off onto my face and into my eyes.  It stings my eyes&lt;br /&gt;terribly when it gets in.  I like the pen idea but this was launched much to soon.  It needs a lot of improvement in the formula itself.  When they get&lt;br /&gt;it right some more natural colors would be good, like smokey brown.</li>
    <li> clumps, they sent me full refund. much prefer  Bobbi Brown or Mabelline</li>
    <li> love this product for when I want an edge to my eye makeup</li>
    <li> This is the BEST eyeliner ever!! It&#x27;s thick and glides smoothly and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Just terrible. Impossible to get the right amount of product on the tip - either none comes out or you&#x27;ll get a huge tacky clump. Sticky consistency that drags and skips across the lid.  The few times I have managed a good application, it flaked all over my face. The &#x27;tips&#x27; for use provided in the Benefit instructional video didn&#x27;t help.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews on this product. I would be honest and tell you if it didn&#x27;t work or was hard to use. You don&#x27;t need to pump a lot out of the dispenser a little goes a long way. I can workout at the gym and totally get sweaty and it Is still mainly in place.  You can use it for a more dramatic look like a cat eye or just a normal eyeliner it is not for your inner rims and I really don&#x27;t use it under my eyes but I think it&#x27;s worth every penny this is my second purchase of the product.  I wish they came in some other colors like eggplant or dark brown.</li>
    <li> There has been so much hype about this product. Photos of beauty magazine writers putting this eyeliner on without a mirror while sitting on a seesaw, that sort of thing. I have known plenty of eyeliners in my day and this one has its good and bad points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying that this liner is for drawing a medium to wide line. If you want just to draw a tiny line right at your lash line, this liner is not for you. The line that this product draws is opaque, matte, black and once it&#x27;s on, it will last forever, or until you remove it, whichever comes first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a long learning curve with this liner. The applicator is a long, flexible rubber, angled tip. The black gel liner comes out a hole at the end of the tip. You have to run this angled applicator along your lash line, and I find it drags and skips rather than move smoothly. You have to get enough product through the tip....not too much....not too little. The first amount I push through needs to be wiped off. If you don&#x27;t, the gel blobs and huge flakes of black, dried or semi dried gel can drop on your cheek while you are trying to apply it. Things can get messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on, this dries very, very quickly. You need a sure hand and no interruptions. Once you start, you have to keep going no matter what. Forget the kids, the dog, the phone.....you&#x27;ve got to finish. I find that the first line that I draw is ragged looking and I have to go over it several times to get it to look the way it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it on a naked (no moisturizer nor foundation) eyelid and with primer, [[ASIN:B004ZR9H2G MAC Paint Pot Painterly]].  I find that both work but the product goes on more smoothly over the primer. I have also put powdered eye shadow over the line for a smoky look and that everything stayed \\&quot;put\\&quot; perfectly until I removed it many, many hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liner comes right off with a swipe or two of [[ASIN:B0010XUU9M Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in an excellent, inexpensive, long lasting, easy-to-use liner that draws a very fine line, try [[ASIN:B00B1DRA94 L&#x27;Oreal Paris The Super Slim Eyeliner by Infallible, Black]].

    <li> I really like this liner! It is super black, and stays put. It&#x27;s pricey, but definitely a nice option to have if your wanting a really stay put look. Check out my video showing the product in action: http://youtu.be/_1BovPeoylg</li>
    <li> This is a great Benefit product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m such a fan of the mascara, but this liner let me down. The applicator never worked right, the pigment was so intense that the slightest misstep created a major clean up, and it ran out so quickly! Very disappointed. Back to my cheapo wet n wild it is...</li>
    <li> it is DRY not one drop comes out !  I followed the instructions  and nothing</li>
    <li> This product is awful. It doesn&#x27;t live up to any of its claims or the hype surrounding it. It&#x27;s chalky, it drags, and it won&#x27;t click up. The box says 1 click per eye, but it takes at least ten clicks to get even a sliver of product to come up. It&#x27;s no better than a cheap, charcoal liner. When I emailed Benefit directly they said that my comments were not what they usually heard from users, however if you read the reviews on Benefit&#x27;s website you&#x27;ll see that dozens of people have the exact same complaints. Also, I was told they couldn&#x27;t refund my purchase because it wasn&#x27;t ordered directly from them.  If you do buy this product, buy directly from Benefit so at least you can get your money back.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last longer than most eye liners have tried over the years. Mac liquid last is the only other product that competes with this liner. It&#x27;s the kind of liner that you could wear for two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a minor learning curve to use it but if you have been using liquid or gel eye liner you won&#x27;t have a problem with this product. Works great to do wings or a thicker line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take many clicks to get the product started but hey for the quality is amazing and worth the rough jump start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> to small for the price</li>
    <li> Waste of money. It crumbles, gets everywhere, is impossible to take off. It does stay very black which is nice but that&#x27;s the only positive I can say. I&#x27;ll be sticking with STILA stay all day eyeliner</li>
    <li> I wanted a truly black eyeline and this did not disappoint!  It does take several attemps to learn how to use it, and if you attempt to twist out too much product, it will cake and fall on your cheeks like other reviewers have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this stuff DOES NOT BUDGE.  If I didn&#x27;t rub my eyes real hard at night, I could easily walk out the door the next morning with the exact same line that I went to sleep in.  It is hard to remove, but nothing that a simple make-up removing towelette cannot handle with a little extra effort put in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very thin line is pretty much impossible with their accuflex tip, but I like thick eyeliner so this is perfect.  I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and it&#x27;s been my go-to piece of cosmetics.  It does &#x27;skip&#x27; along the tiny folds in your skin, but it&#x27;s easy to go over what you missed, just make sure you don&#x27;t sneeze or else you&#x27;ll have a VERY prominent black line across your face.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time getting the gel out. It comes out in chunks. Assuming that this is just an issue with my pen, by the end of the day the liner does smear on to my top eyelid. The main reason I bought this is I read numerous rave reviews from multiple sources that the pen allows for easy application. Uh, that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
    <li> amaaizing and very black also its has a berfect brush which is useful for begenig</li>
    <li> I started off loving this product, but within weeks of purchasing I noticed that the liner was building up in the applicator. I think that the gel was too dry and caused the applicator to bulge until it ripped through the opening. Since the product was never subjected to harsh conditions, I contacted the company, who wouldn&#x27;t take responsibility because it wasn&#x27;t purchased directly from them. This product is way too expensive to only last a couple of weeks. I would recommend shopping for another liner.</li>
    <li> Great concept.  Horrible product.  What a waste of money; I can&#x27;t believe I bought this.  You have to twist the bottom forever before it starts coming out and even when it does it&#x27;s brittle so it doesn&#x27;t work well at all because it just breaks.  It also tends to only come out when it wants to, so you may finish one eye and then you can&#x27;t do the other one because no matter how many times you click, it doesn&#x27;t want to work.  Bad product.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> easy, waterproof, very very black, Matt, My fave gel liner so far &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> If I could give it a 2 and a half I would. I&#x27;m glad I only bought the trial size...when I first opened the eyeliner I couldn&#x27;t get the stuff to come out...I clicked and clicked and tapped it on my hand...nothing...when it finally did come out it was way too much and I ended up wasting some of the product...I guess it was clogged? Applying the liner (neatly) requires some trial and error. It does hug the lash line pretty good but it doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly...and the gel is too dry to begin with...you end up with a lot of flakes under your cheeks...I find liquid liner to be easier to apply! I didn&#x27;t read any positive reviews but I&#x27;m sure somebody must like it if they made a trial size for it...</li>
    <li> Ok it lasts really long but for me it wasn&#x27;t easy to apply I thought it was like a pen but it has like a little hole in the middle that the eyeliner pumps from it might need more practice.</li>
    <li> Very expensive for so-so performance.  Clumpy and not easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure this is the actual product from the legitimate manufacturer (I have bought what was supposed to be a MAC product on Amazon before and it was a knock-off), but what I received was not what I expected.  The liner did not go on smooth at all, and was very clumpy.  I am used to a gel liner with a brush, so I thought this would be more convenient and a possible replacement.  It is not easy to apply... I removed it quickly, as it looked like a mess.  I will be returning this as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> This has a great concept, but that&#x27;s where the greatness stops. I bought this at Sephora and was SO excited&lt;br /&gt;The formula it&#x27;s too thick, and it&#x27;s SO hard to remove unless you buy the specific make up remover by benefit that&#x27;s like $20 (almost as much as the product), also, this &amp;#34;hugs&amp;#34; my lashes too much, maybe is user error but everytime I use this the gel ends up in my lashes making it IMPOSSIBLE to curl them and getting my curler all disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;Totally won&#x27;t recommend&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the next version will be better...</li>
    <li> great! the description does not lie. worth every penny. plus it has lots of product. highly recommended. it is great for everyone even beggins because it is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I know too thick and black</li>
    <li> Not all that I thought this would be. This liner flakes doesn&#x27;t dry fast and is hard to use. Save your money and buy Revlon or Maybelline.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. Had the caution that the seller absolutely, positively does not accept returns not been prominently displayed on my shipping label, I would have returned it immediately after first use. The first time I used it, the liner came out in large nasty clumps; this is either due to the fact that the product was quite old or that it is defective. I thought that this might be a problem with the first few applications, so I kept trying to use it, hoping that as I got a bit further down the tube, the gel would flow freely. That never proved to be the case. However, if you like the look of big black clumps resting on your eyelids, this is the eyeliner for you. :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the liner is almost impossible to remove. I have two different kinds of Clinique eye makeup remover that work beautifully for every kind of eye makeup I have ever used, including waterproof mascara. However, neither of these removers proved effective in removing this horrible liner, so be prepared to live with raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look elsewhere for your gel eyeliner needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: After writing this review, I decided to contact the seller simply to let them know of my concerns about this product. They assured me that the product could not be old because it had just come onto the market, and that even though their policy is not to accept returns for used product, they would make an exception in my case. The seller sent me a prepaid return label and upon receipt of my product they refunded my money. So while I still don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this gel liner, I can say that the seller was upstanding.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this along with my usual Benefit mascara.  The idea looks great, the tip is super comfortable, but what&#x27;s wrong with the gel?!  The instructions stated to turn the dial at bottom of the wand once.  I had to count - I turned it 18 times.  Finally, a big blob of hardened gel popped out and fell into the sink.  Okay, so maybe there was a dried up piece on top that was keeping the gel from coming out.  So I twisted the bottom again.  Another dried up blob came up.  Okay, so maybe this is how the product is supposed to be.  I tried spreading it along the top lash line, feeling the heavy tar-like substance dragging my eyelashes along with the tip, gluing them together and to my eyelid.  I&#x27;ve used liquid and gel liners for over 20 years.  This has never happened before.  But the fun part comes next.  THE REMOVAL!  My regular Lancome eye makeup remover for waterproof makeup did nothing but smudge the tarry mess all over my eye.  Luckily I noticed a small tube of trial eye makeup remover that came along with the push-up gel liner sample.  I tried it.  At this point the tar was finally coming off (somewhat), but my eye was burning.  It turned red on the inside and my skin was on fire.  Totally frustrated, I reached for some organic EVOO I have handy to help remove the 50% of the remaining tar and I was finally able to get to the lash line and clean it up.  Maybe I got a defective product...  And yes, I got it from a reputable department store.</li>
    <li> It works like a dream! I did have a little bit of trouble maybe the first two I used it but this beats any liquid or pencil liner I&#x27;ve ever used by a landslide!! So simple to make a perfect line as thick or thin as you want and easy to make even wings :) I was very pleased with the timeliness of my shipment as well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this eyeliner. It stays put and the tip makes a perfect line every time. I have sensitive eyes, so I can&#x27;t wear it for too many hours, but I can wear it longer than other eyeliners not meant for sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Some people love it, some hate it. I don&#x27;t like this product. It flakes, almost impossible to get a straight line. The tip IS perfect for the cat-eye effect, but the formula is off. Definitely NOT for beginners. A liquid alternative is Physicians Formula Eye Booster. Great pigment and stays on.</li>
    <li> It looks good but hard to apply and also hard to remove.</li>
    <li> I am not very good at applying eyeliner so I usually don&#x27;t use it. My friend bought this product for me because it&#x27;s very easy to apply. She&#x27;s right. I love the product and use it everyday now. It will take a bit longer to remove because it is designed to last for all day. You can not have everything. However, I only need water to remove it. Not as hard as others&#x27; reviews. Will recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> AMAZING... PERFECT TOP LINER</li>
    <li> I purchased this eyeliner at Ulta and man this was a huge N-O-T-H-I-N-G. All hype. The eyeliner formula is horrible. It clogs up the pen and makes a mess on your eye. The tip is rubber also so it doesn&#x27;t really help with staying in place. It&#x27;s bad, go for eyeliner like the Kat Von D brand, its more precise.</li>
    <li> I got this eyeliner as a Christmas present. I was a little confused on how to apply it, due to the weird rubber tip, but i watched a video and was able to do it within two tries. I have always had so much trouble apply liquid liner in a straight line, or without using a million q-tips, but this liner has made it so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little hard to get used to, knowing how much liner to twist out, but I got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely the most intense matte black I have ever worn.&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about this eyeliner, the precise head , the grip , the controlled dispensing system.&lt;br /&gt;But be advised this magical tool is not for beginners don&#x27;t let the sharp oriented rubber head fool you!&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner still need experienced applying technique,&lt;br /&gt;And it takes time to get used to it but once you do my friend, a velvety luscious curtain of insane intensity will prevail upon your lashes</li>
    <li> Crap! It did not last for more than 3 weeks,  it smudges,  the gel won&#x27;t come out,  I kept turning it and nothing so i went to work worth two different eye liners then the next day the entire gel came off and was hanging off the pen. I seriously don&#x27;t have 30 mins to wait for the gel. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I had huge expectations for this liner. I&#x27;ve always been a Benefit user, love their &amp;#34;they&#x27;re real&amp;#34; mascara. This product, however, was a disappointment. Gel doesn&#x27;t come out evenly, and sometimes I have to give it two or three turns, very little comes out, then after a few hours, all the gel has come out from those two or three turns, and dried, making application impossible. I will not be buying this and definitely, won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
