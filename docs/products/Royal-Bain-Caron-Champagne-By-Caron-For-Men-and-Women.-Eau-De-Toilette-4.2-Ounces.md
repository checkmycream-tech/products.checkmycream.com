      <li>I have loved this scent for years.</li>

      <li>But okay.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this fragrance for many years.  </li>
      <li>The price was reasonable and I am delighted that I was able to find it.</li>

      <li>However, the scent is strong enough to maintain its efficacy.</li>
      <li>The gentle, fresh fragrance has a way of keeping you going back to it and keep using it.</li>

<li> THIS CARON FRAGRANCE IS A CLASSIC FOR WOMEN OR MEN</li>
<li> A single spritz should last for hours, not recommended as a dining-out (or dinner party) scent as it would tend to overwhelm food and wine.</li>
<li> If you want to purchase it for a collectible that is fine.  </li>
<li> The &amp;#34;Chug Lug&amp;#34; occurred with extreme force, causing spillage of the liquid.</li>
<li> the fragrant is a little over powering, so use is spearingly.</li>
<li> Heavy and amber-based, this fragrance should be used sparingly, and in winter.</li>
<li> When I tried to pour the perfume into the funnels, it spilled all over the bottle because of its long and thin neck.</li>
<li> I am not impressed.</li>
<li> This smells horrible.  </li>

    <li> THIS CARON FRAGRANCE IS A CLASSIC FOR WOMEN OR MEN</li>
    <li> The perfume has too much alcohol and evaporates quickly. However, the scent is strong enough to maintain its efficacy. The problem with the bottle is that it does not have a sprayer attached, so I had to order atomizers. When I tried to pour the perfume into the funnels, it spilled all over the bottle because of its long and thin neck. The &amp;#34;Chug Lug&amp;#34; occurred with extreme force, causing spillage of the liquid. I am not impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for many years.  It has a nice fresh smell clean and not overpowering.  The price was reasonable and I am delighted that I was able to find it.</li>
    <li> El producto es muy bueno y el precio también. El tiempo de entrega fue el esperado y el empaque fue el adecuado para el producto.</li>
    <li> and never looses its allure. The gentle, fresh fragrance has a way of keeping you going back to it and keep using it.</li>
    <li> The box was torn but the fragrance is wonderful</li>
    <li> Heavy and amber-based, this fragrance should be used sparingly, and in winter. This is not a spray bottle, so it is wise to transfer to a glass bottle with atomizer. A single spritz should last for hours, not recommended as a dining-out (or dinner party) scent as it would tend to overwhelm food and wine. If you like amber and incense, you may like this. Give it a trial run, in private. Needs confidence.</li>
    <li> the fragrant is a little over powering, so use is spearingly.</li>
    <li> Smells just like I remembered!</li>
    <li> Could of been a spray on. But okay.</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent for years. It is definitely on the heavy side, but not as much as some current perfumes&lt;br /&gt;and colognes.  Also, it is distinct and distinguishable  from most other scents. I have my favorites -- and this&lt;br /&gt;is one of them.</li>
    <li> This smells horrible.  There are no returns on this item, which I did not realize, that is my fault.  If you want to purchase it for a collectible that is fine.  To wear, no way.</li>
