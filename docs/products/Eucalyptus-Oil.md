<li> I ordered the same item number I had previously ordered, which was a 2 ounce bottle.  </li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> This 2 ounce bottle of Eucalyptus Oil was a lot less fragrant than the 4 ounce bottle I bought from Wal Mart for approximately the same price.  </li>
<li> Using it in a pot of boiling water for soothing aromatherapy for treating congested sinus and chest, im near the end of a head cold that moved to the chest.</li>
<li> Just a small amount in a spray bottle with water</li>
<li> A negative is that I like the smell</li>
<li> and it smelled bad.</li>
<li> I had opened three bottle and they all smelled bad.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not all that impressed with the Eucalyptus.  It does not seem as strong as others I have received.  I also do not like that it does not have a dropper insert on the inside.  Very easy to spill large amounts.</li>
    <li> Glad Amazon has this, but I actually found this at my local CVS for $3.29. Much cheaper. Using it in a pot of boiling water for soothing aromatherapy for treating congested sinus and chest, im near the end of a head cold that moved to the chest. Works great also by adding a few drops into a wash cloth and letting a shower stream run over it to infuse steamy air in the hot shower. It make it easy to breathe, the vapors are helpful, soothing as well as refreshing an helps clear the head, sinus and mind. Invigorating product!</li>
    <li> This 2 ounce bottle of Eucalyptus Oil was a lot less fragrant than the 4 ounce bottle I bought from Wal Mart for approximately the same price.  Which does not make sense because it had the same label.</li>
    <li> The best quality essential oil I have ever purchased! U can smell it before u even open the bottle 👍 im a very satisfied customer will be ordering more soon. Also quick delivery and good packagi</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of times. The first one was good had no complaints. The most resent purchase I opened a bottle and it smelled bad. I had opened three bottle and they all smelled bad.</li>
    <li> I ordered the same item number I had previously ordered, which was a 2 ounce bottle.  I received a 1 ounce bottle - half as much (same price, or more?)</li>
    <li> Love this essential oil.. The price was great and it is just as good as other brands.. I am happy.</li>

    <li> This is new to me I am hoping it works , very strong smell though for hair,if it help growing who cares of he smell.  Amazon your package are very nice and fast keep on.........</li>
    <li> So, I have asthma and migraines. This oil has made a huge difference. My breathing is so much easier when the oil warmer is on with eucalyptus. An added bonus has been fewer migraines. I do not know why this is so, just that it is. After turning my apartment into a eucalyptus grove, migraines have decreased significantly, to the point that I no longer need the daily prescription drugs and seldom use the ones for use when I have one (because so seldom have them). Another added bonus is that it helps control the pest population. A negative is that I like the smell (guess have become accustomed), but visitors say that it is too strong. As for quality, I have bought over 30 bottles with no problem. It does not smell quite as good as another brand, but for the price difference, no big deal.</li>
    <li> This is a product that was sold at a great price for a great product. It was effective for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I use in my diffuser, smells fresh and clean and helps respiratory. Keeps fleas and ticks off dogs too. Don&#x27;t use in bathtub though, I tried once and it burnt my skin.</li>
    <li> I steam this oil several times a week to help with my sinus problems, and it clears my head and chest so I can breathe. The bottle doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper, which would keep too much from being poured, but the oil itself, the timely delivery, and the price made the purchase well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! Has a good strong scent that is pleasant to the nose. When diluted, it is great for insect bites, nasal congestion, mental exhaustion and many more great benefits! I highly recommend this brand</li>
    <li> wonderful product perfect to use on skin</li>
    <li> The eucalyptus oil is great. The bottle itself is not. It will not pour out great and will run down the side of the bottle. You need to buy plastic pipettes or get a funnel to use with transferring the eucalyptus oil to whatever you use it with. I recommend moving it to another container that pours well if you don&#x27;t have a funnel or transfer pipette.</li>
    <li> I got this because I read it helped to get rid of things like staph infections and I had a wound that was threatening to become one. I kept the cut clean and put this on it ever so often. It took a while as herbs must but pretty soon the wound had a very thick scab and then healed right up.</li>
    <li> Package arrived squashed and the delivery man said to check to see if the oil bottle was okay. So far the oil seems to be better than the last brand I purchased. The scent is lasting longer than the previous one.</li>
    <li> Wish it had a dropper so it would be easier to use.  Other than that, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I use this on my foam filter for my cpap machine.  Really opens up the bronchial system.</li>
    <li> This oil has a strong fragrance, but it is good for getting rid of fleas on pets and in carpets.  Just a small amount in a spray bottle with water and they are gone.  I haven&#x27;t had to use it again, but I still have plenty left for the summer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil to burn in my wax melter burner. In the wintertime when congestion and colds set in this stuff is invaluable.&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus is great for congestion.  It works wonders.</li>
    <li> Awesome, great for colds and stuffy noses, my family loves the way it clears nasal passages when they are congested</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Also was shipped out on time as promised.</li>
    <li> this item was very useful, thank you.</li>
