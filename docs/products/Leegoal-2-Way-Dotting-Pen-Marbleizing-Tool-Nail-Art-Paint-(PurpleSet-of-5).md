<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter and I love doing nail designs on our hands and feet with these dotting tools! They are durable for the price.</li>
    <li> Many new designs can be made with these tools, good purchase.  I really my new dotting pen.  I used many times</li>
    <li> The shipping was really fast.  The dotting pen is very helpful, a good tool for making dots.  This is my second set of dotting pen, I purchased it mainly because of its color ^0^  Also, the seller&#x27;s after-sale service is prompt and courteous.</li>
    <li> I really like my dotting tools they are soooooo coool, I showed them to my sister and she ended up purchasing some, this is a really good deal to her considering she bought one for more expensive at a store that was really cheapish looking and broke. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Item was shipped extremely fast.  I received it yesterday and couldnt wait to try it out.  They are a great product for beginners like myself.  It makes my attempt at nail art that much more professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great seller!!</li>
    <li> This is the 2 nd time I&#x27;ve purchased these dotting tools.  The first time I just stopped doing my own nail after a couple years and gave them away, now that I&#x27;m don&#x27;t my own nails again, I tracked down these tools.  They are a great variety, good quality, never break,  pretty colors.  Shipping does take couple weeks but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are very pretty and very useful to have around when your doing nail art. I have been using them for a while now and they are still in good shape! The only thing is, two of the five designs are the same. The price is fabulous though. As for care, make sure to clean them immediately after dipping them into nail polish or acrylic paint, because after its dry its nearly impossible to get it off.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Fast delivery and great product. My daughter and wife love these things, now I see and hear them tell me all the colors they have added and the designs they have made.</li>
    <li> this tool is just way too awesome. It creates all kinds of cool designs!! I love it!  I would very much recommend this..</li>
    <li> I live for these dotting tools! I use them for every nail art design I do. They are easy to use and even easier to clean. The only downside with this set is that about 2 out of the 5 tools are the exact same size on both ends, so I just gave them to my best friend to use for her nail art. Other than that these are flawless!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and work great! Makes painting your nails fun and looks like you went to a salon shop</li>
    <li> the sices are perfect for all the designs you can imagend. perfect for someone who starts making mails or try differnt designs</li>
    <li> Love it but could be bigger tools😊</li>
    <li> Were exactly what I expected. Decently made and seem like they will hold up over time, easy to use, and I love the color!</li>
    <li> Do exactly as they&#x27;re supposed too</li>
    <li> I love these. They&#x27;re super easy to use and work very well. They look nice and are very easy to clean. I&#x27;d definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I just got into nail art &amp; saw a few videos requiring a dotting tool. This is amazing and super easy to use! For like $4 you get 5 pens with different size dots. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> These are very cute! And they work wonderfully, they seem sturdy enough to last a while. My only issue us the lack of size options, a few of them are the exact same size, and I just don&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d need multiples of the same size dotting pen.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who likes changing her nail color like people change their underwear!  Everyday!  She really likes them and says that they are perfect for the job.  They arrived on time and were exactly as described.  Various sizes of &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; on the five double sided sticks allow my daughter to do amazing things!  Well worth the price and the service was great.</li>
    <li> It was the same dotting tool that in the picture, i really like it so much ,  i recommend it</li>
    <li> The price was so unbelievable low that I was a little nervous about buying this, but decided to give it a shot after reading the reviews and I am glad I did. These dotting pens are great. They are exactly what I needed. It took a while to get them in the mail but that was expected and I was aware of that. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Quality item great price. Able to decorate my daughters nails in many different designs with ease. I recommend this product for your nail collection.</li>
    <li> These are great.  They feel sturdy and are very easy to use.  I&#x27;ve used them several times since I received them and am pleased,</li>
    <li> This helped me with so much nail art that I see online and I never get to do because i don&#x27;t have the right dotting tools but now i do! What a wonderful invention. My nails look amazing and they always will! SO happy!!!</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for! I use them for nail art and polymer clay sculpting. They work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> They were exactly what I wanted and they work great  so many people want what I got so now they are going to order it</li>
    <li> for the price you cant beat it.  Nice quality  and easy to use. They are actually 6 sizes as one end is all the same size.</li>
    <li> that I&#x27;ve had to krazy glue some of the dotting metal part to the pink holder.  Other than that.  Well packaged, beautiful set, easy to use, one of the tools looks the same size as another but I don&#x27;t care.  Only problem I had was that twice the metal dotting part fell out of the pink holder while I was using it.  Had to krazy glue metal part in but that was not biggie.</li>
    <li> I love it and they are just like they are in the image, great dotting tool product. Very sturdy and long lasting</li>
    <li> Really good quality. Surprisingly well built and there are many sizing options for nail designs. Very impressed with these tools.</li>
    <li> I had bought other dotting tools from beauty stores but they never worked! I bought this product as my final attempt and loved it! It definitely works!  One of the ends did fall off but all of the ends have same size and different larger size like the picture</li>
    <li> Good quality product. They were a gift, but they seemed to be as good as any other dotting tool. yay!</li>
    <li> Finally bought these for my daughter. She changes her polish almost every other day and loves making her own designs.</li>
    <li> I am excited to use my new dotting pens!  They are really pretty and are an excellent quality for the low price that I paid.  They came with five in a pack so I even shared two with a friend of mine!</li>
    <li> Arrived quicker than I thought and they are great. Very pretty, cheap, and as described. Love them, and I hope to get many years of use out of them. Better than the local beauty store on price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still a beginner with these so I&#x27;m not the best judge. I did get one that the metal dot part was loose from the plastic, but that&#x27;s an easy enough fix.  Also one of the tips was bent but that could have happened during shipment. I do like this set. It has dots on both sides of all the sizes that you&#x27;ll need. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Make nail art a little bit easier &amp; fun! These dotting tools work really well!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are perfect for all your designing needs! Love them!!</li>
    <li> YOU GET WHAT YOU SEE!</li>
    <li> I love these! I just got mine in the mail today, much sooner than expected. After trying them out, I can very honestly say I love them! They seem pretty durable and I&#x27;m sure I will get a lot of use out of them. Also, they sent three extra tools! A very pleasant surprise, as I was only expecting five. If you&#x27;re looking for a good dotting tool, this is the one to go to. And for $1, you&#x27;re not losing a lot!</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for a friend. Really pretty, nice little tools for dotting and other nail art.</li>
    <li> I really love these dotting tools..its my first time using them and they really made my first time using them fun!!.. .</li>
    <li> Shipping took a while but the price was worth it. I use it for nails and my daughter used them for clay projects.</li>
    <li> This product was a gift to my bestfriend, and she loved it, everything was spot on, not a single flaw</li>
    <li> They are okay a little sloppy when used.</li>
    <li> They are really nice. I got them around two weeks after placing the order. Their cute, but the only thing is that they are just too small. The big and medium are nearly the same size. Other than that their okay, you&#x27;ll just need more practice in order to get a good dot:)</li>
    <li> my Daughter was very happy with it.It is just as shown and arrived in timely fashion .&lt;br /&gt;Great job thanks</li>
    <li> what a nice color, my daughter loves this set, i&#x27;m sure she will try to use it once a day, thanx</li>
    <li> They all work fine but it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re all the same size. I feel like some of them are being repeated.</li>
    <li> Another Hit, she loves to do her nails and these tools work very well</li>
    <li> Easy to use, pretty self-explanatory. They&#x27;re not fragile, the design doesn&#x27;t come off in acetone, and they&#x27;re easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and they&#x27;re inexpensive. :)</li>
    <li> The delivery was very quick, I got it within a week and actually sooner than I expected. The products were packaged well and were exactly like they were described. I&#x27;m excited about my purchase and loved that I was able to get it for a good price.</li>
    <li> It took 2 Weeks but I Love it......... I&#x27;ve already tried it on my nails and it came out nice</li>
    <li> Not only did i get it right away, everything was carefully packaged. Great product, makes nail designs easier to do on yourself. Recommended!</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, one suggested getting this set of 5 tools each with a different sized tip, glad I read that and purchased these for my daughter. They work great, she loves them and the 10 different sizes are wonderful for many nail art designs. You cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> received  product in a very timely fashion was beautifully designed and worked great will defiantly  recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I received them a short time ago. They are strong and the tools are firmly in place. I yet to use them, but I am sure they will work great! :)</li>
    <li> i like these alot i am a inspiring nail artist and these work perfect thank you so much!! I will definitely coming back for more thanks again</li>
    <li> Whether the design calls for a thick or thin line, dot, or design, these tools will not disappoint. Also great value for the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times and they work great, but they&#x27;re already starting to break apart</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s self is fine. However I wasn&#x27;t aware it would take almost 2 mths to get. I didn&#x27;t want to wait that long so I ended up buying a set from Sally&#x27;s. Now I have 2.</li>
    <li> I love these! Good price! Work very good! I highly suggest these!!! These are not just great for nails, but if you do polymer clay charms like me, these are great for making little faces!</li>
    <li> My teenager is totally into nail art.  She must own more than 100 bottles of nail polish and was using the head of a pin stuck into a rubber pencil eraser to do her specialized designs.  This set is very pretty, easy to grip, and has 10 different tips.  This was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> Very small nail pens but worth their affordable price.</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly for me. I love how there are different sizes. The only issue I had was when I received the item, one of the dotters fell out of the holder. Easy fix with some super glue!</li>
    <li> I use these doting tools to do nail art designs for my own personal use and they are very helpful.  They help to make my manicures and pedicures look more professional.  I did have an issue when they first arrived.  But, I contacted the seller and they did send me a new set immediately.  Their customer service was outstanding. I only wanted the broken item replaced and they chose to send me an entire new set.  Thank you very much! I would recommend these tools to anyone.</li>
    <li> Oh my, her nails are now bright and beautiful! We&#x27;ve have even told our manicurist about this product and the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have two toddler girls that love to have their nails and toes done and these dotting tools are thing to allow me to give them different designs all without having to take them to the salon.</li>
    <li> These are soooo pretty in person. I was so afraid what color they would be in real life, but they are exactly how they are pictured. Love the different sizes on them. I ordered them in Purple, btw.</li>
    <li> The nail dotting tool is great, and just as it was descibed. It also came a little ealier than expected!</li>
    <li> This order came exactly as described and i love it! Only thing is that i received one broken but besides that all was good.</li>
    <li> This was my first set of dotting tools and it was very easy to use it came about 3-4 weeks earlier and I would defiantly recomend and order again</li>
    <li> i like these tools. They are very easy to handle. I am stil learning how to designs with them,  I wish that there were 10 different sizes but there arent. I am still happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are as described. They&#x27;re honestly a great deal for the price. They don&#x27;t seem shoddily made, and I&#x27;ve had no problems with them so far.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because I bought this set for my granddaughter and she said she really liked the set because they were a beautiful purple color.  She also used them to paint art on her fingernails for Halloween and they looked just like a pro. It&#x27;s a really nice set for the money.  I would recommend this set to anyone who is into nail art. It did take a long time for them to come because after we bought them we were told they would be shipped from China. If you&#x27;re not in a hurry to use these, then you&#x27;re o.k. waiting almost a month to receive them.</li>
    <li> sturdy, and the sizes are awesome! dropped plenty of times and dipped in acetone frequently and the no wear can be detected.</li>
    <li> Shipping was great, and the product is really nice. It comes with as many as the picture shows you. For some of the dotting tool tips, I can&#x27;t differentiate the sizes, but it is a good bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> All I have to say I have a hard time making dots with these. A toothpick works better. But maybe I am doing it wrong, and then again I don&#x27;t know how anyone can use a dotting tool wrong.</li>
    <li> Great quality, great variety of sizes, and great place. It tool a little bit to get it because I think they ship from China, but it was totally worth they wait</li>
    <li> My manicurist will love her new set. Im giving it to her next week  for her awsome work to kerp my nails pretty.</li>
    <li> My kids have been wanting to find the tools that manicurists use to make designs on nails.  These are perfect and work great!  My daughters are having fun creating new nail designs.</li>
    <li> so easy to use for anyone! and I love the color it makes it so unique! I love it &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love it just what I wanted and very cute. better than sally&#x27;s beauty supply&#x27;s options. much more variety&#x27;s for the tip sizes</li>
