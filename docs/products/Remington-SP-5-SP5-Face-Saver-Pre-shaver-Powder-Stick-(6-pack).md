<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good price and received in good order.</li>
    <li> Is a must for dry shaving.! Have used this product for over 10 years and when it became discontinued from department stores I got really upset. Great that Amazon still carries it.!!</li>
    <li> This is a dry product that I have used for several years.  I like it much better than the liquid &amp;#34;preshaves&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this everyday for every shave. he uses an electric shaver and this goes on the face before the razor touches the skin. No irritation and a little messy but not a problem to clean up</li>
    <li> makes the electric shaver glidde accross your face and gives a close smoth shave. I have tried many other preshaves but none compare to this product.</li>
    <li> as expected. prompt. fair price.</li>
    <li> never shave without it</li>
    <li> It  is Great.&lt;br /&gt;  This is Larry her husband I use this for shaving and ordered it before. I love. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have used this product for sometime, and it provides a great shave for electric shavers. Being, it is a powder it can leave a little powder on you from your shaving, but I enjoy the closeness of my shave without a greasy feeling from other pre-electric shave lotions.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It really does save mine &amp; my fiance&#x27;s faces! Very hard to find this in stores &amp; this is a good bargain. Highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Remington product for a number of years, but recently have been unable to locate it in any of the large stores (WalMart, Target, Kmart).  I&#x27;ll continue to order it online as long as I can keep finding it.</li>
    <li> This is the only pre-shave I use and it can be hard to find.  Happy to have found it here and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I use Face Saver for almost 10 years and it is a great product. Really makes it easier for electric shavers users.</li>
    <li> I have relied on the SP-5 shaving product for many years.  Unfortunately, the local Wal-Mart stopped carrying the product and I had to rely on the internet.  The product sells for roughly the same price as retail; so a little shipping charge is OK.  However, when I purchased this six-pack I was assured that there would not be a shipping charge.  However they still charged $5 for a \\&quot;handling fee\\&quot; which added some 85 cents to each tube.  Bummer!</li>
    <li> When I was younger my dad always had talcum powder from the barber shop to use before shaving.  You don&#x27;t see that too much anymore, so when I found Face Saver I thought I would give it a try.  The stuff works great, and is in an easy to carry in the shaving kit sized package.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, and make sure to always have it on hand.  The six pack is a good deal too. If you use an electric and haven&#x27;t tried this, you owe it to your face.</li>
    <li> Great product, as advertised.</li>
    <li> Always satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Pro: I don&#x27;t have much hair on my face, so I don&#x27;t need heavy beard type shaving supplies. I use this stuff daily with my electric razor. It works good for a quick shave.  Cons: 1. I don&#x27;t care for the perfumed smell. It helps to leave the top off the stick to help it air out. If it weren&#x27;t for the slight perfume scent, I&#x27;d rate it five stars.  2. This is minor but after a shave you need to wipe the remaining powder off your face to keep the powder from showing.  ------  ** This is a good product** I didn&#x27;t want to have to buy five sticks at once to get a decent price, but it works out better as one stick doesn&#x27;t last all that long and you&#x27;ll have more handy. I&#x27;ll always buy the quantity five or more deals from now on.</li>
    <li> My Husband has used this powder stick before we were married --probably right after the Korean war when he could use an electric razor that&#x27;s why I order it for him--He will be 80 in April. He is handsome  for a real video review.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have always used an electric razor.  About six years ago, I discovered this product and have used them every day since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s basically talcum powder compressed into a stick, which makes it less of a mess than loose powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You rub the stick on your face, then spread the powder until it&#x27;s a fine layer of talc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you can shave on a very smooth surface without fear of cutting yourself or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use the little brush that comes with your razor to clean out the combination of whiskers and powder that accumulate inside the razor.  If you do this every day, it will greatly enhance the life of your razor.</li>
    <li> My husband was very pleased with these. It was exactly what he had been looking for and couldn&#x27;t find.  glad to hace found them</li>
    <li> I have used these in the past and just purchase a new razor.  I prefer this product over the liquid electric shave.</li>
    <li> I have used the Remington Electric Shaver Pre-Shave Powder Stick for 40-50 years, and don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without them. Many years ago they were easily available, but that availability decreased to the point that I could never find any. About 15 years ago I found that I could get them in Target on business trips to Denver. When Target moved east, (I live in the Washington, DC area) I was able to get them for several years, then that stopped. Wal*Mart occasionally had them, and I stocked up, but eventually that stopped as well. I was down to my last stick, and decided to do a Google search. There it was; I could get them from Amazon!!! My face is safe for another year. Please keep making these available.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband. He usually gets razor burn from shaving but with this product he is able to get a better shave without much razor burn.   I know that he really likes this product and would recommend it to anyone suffering from razor burn.  Shipping was fast and everything arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Any guy who finds his beard gives him a problem of some kind will love this stuff. Better then any other prep or pre-shave out there, an application before shaving eliminates razor pull-burn-iritation of any kind and provides the smoothest closest shave I ever get, even with my think and course Italian growth. Can&#x27;t live without the stuff. Anthony Collura</li>
    <li> Powder is best for electric shavers of all kinds, great for avoiding bumps and cuts.</li>
    <li> Grreat stuff, it make a shave easy and better looking .</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick-would purchase here again-wish I could have purchased a smaller quantity(instead of 6)though.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for years now. We used to get it at Walmart but they stopped carrying it, so when we found it on Amazon we bought six. He swears by it. It gives him a clean shave, leaves his skin soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t break him out.</li>
    <li> As promised, great price, on time! I will use this company again</li>
    <li> Works well but difficult to find in stores.  Best to order it online.</li>
    <li> This is a new batch that I haven&#x27;t tried yet but as long as they didn&#x27;t radically change it the product it great. Part of what I like is it gets into the razor head and definitely makes it last longer.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find this item in the stores.  Was glad to find a six-pack for my Dad and Grandpa.  Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I finally found this product at Amazon after searching in stores in my area. This product allows smooth functioning for electric razors. It allows the razor to glide over your skin. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Many years ago tried both the liquid and powder.  Hated the liquid because I still got the shaver burn feeling and it left a gummy feeling on my face.  Have been using this powder stick ever since.  Something like 20+ years.  Only trouble is there very hard to find in the stores in Southern AZ.  Did not need 6 but went with it cost wise.  I&#x27;ll share some with my kids.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years, but the local stores do not carry it now, so the internet is a great way for me to purchase my needs.  Howard Burger</li>
    <li> All electric razor users should use this. It helps keep skin from razor burn and makes for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected and a great price.  Thankyou  john</li>
    <li> Found this when buying replacement electric blades. I like the smooth shave it gives, although there is a drift of talc/whiskers that piles up in the sink. Better than the liquid lotions I&#x27;ve tried for shaving comfort, but messier. It would be nice if they updated the scent to something more appropriate for the 21st century. Seriously, it smells like I remember my ancient great-grandmother. I bought a six-pack and have finished three, so I don&#x27;t mind it so much now.   Oh, and this is Alexandra&#x27;s husband, just in case you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
    <li> Due to skin allergies, this is the only thing my husband can use for shaving. These are unavailable for purchase at local stores; therefore he is very happy to be able to purchase them online.</li>
    <li> He has very delicate skin easily irritated he&#x27;s type one diabetic....Remington SP-5 SP5 Face Saver Pre-shaver Powder Stick (6 pack) these where the perfect size to put in his Christmas stocking!~</li>
    <li> I have been using the Remington fase saver for 18 years it works great when you get out of the shower it dries your face, to let your shaver get a closer shave</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband, he loves this and uses it every time he shaves. He likes the product because it helps his face by keeping down the razor bumps and giving him a close shave. This item is hard to find in the stores now, so I glad that they have this here.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 6 pack of these.  I have been using this product for 10 years.  The first stick I opened was not like the others I have used in the past.  The powder was not firm and the best way I can explain the product failure is like the stick got wet and did not dry out.  The powder is not firm and tight and just falls apart when you rub it on your face.  I have not checked the other sticks so I am hoping that this was just an exception.</li>
    <li> This company has consistently provided GREAT SERVICE.  This is a subscription plan and works great PLUS provides a discount for that plan.  ALSO, the company has provided quick and effective service.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This powder stick is a must for electric shaver users.  I tried all the oily pre-shave, some creamy pre-shaves, some cheap brands and some very expensive brands, and nothing worked and my face was always greasy.  Not a pretty picture).  Found this product and the shaver just glides over your face, and no oily mess.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not having used Remington&#x27;s SP-5 Face Saver pre-shave powder previously, I relied solely on the current product reviews to make a buying decision. And am I ever glad I did! No question about it... After application of the pre-shave powder, I shaved with my electric shaver. And the result was a very close shave. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a more comfortable (and close) shave with an electric shaver. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I have been using Face Saver powder sticks for years, and have always been pleased with their performance.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and these powder sticks really help give me a smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> great value.  this product is becoming more and more scarce in stores - I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available here, and at a good price.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as it used to.  The current product deposits too much powder and it just falls off.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington SP-5 Face Saver pre-shaver powder. It is very smooth on skin and gives a great shave. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  leaves not bumps and is a smooth shave.  I looked all over for it after walmart stopped carrying it.</li>
    <li> The FaceSaver pre-shaver powder stick works great with my Norelco electric shaver.  I could not find it in local stores, so I went to Amazon.com and found it and at a much lower cost.  Thank you.  Howard  Fresno, CA</li>
    <li> I like these sticks. Been using them for years. Does not gum up my razor. I would recommend these to my friends</li>
    <li> WalMart stopped carrying this. I&#x27;ve used it for years. Now I get it in 2 days with Prime and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> For me, the powder stick works better than any liquid pre shave I have tried.  The Stick arrived very quickly and in good condition.  I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> the powder keeps the shaver from chafing and gets a closer shave at a modest cost without strong cologne odor</li>
    <li> Quality product, quality service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve yet to buy a multi-pack of this item and not find that one or more of the powder sticks is defective. By defective I mean that the powder doesn&#x27;t deposit itself on my face very easily. I can still make it work but it requires considerably more work. However, given that it&#x27;s almost impossible to find these things in stores these days and given the fact that when they work they make shaving with an electric razor far less-irritating I still buy them like this. Once you&#x27;ve shaved with a powder stick you&#x27;ll never go back to any other method.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick.  I have used this product for years but have found it impossible to find in local stores recently.   Remington Face Saver does just that, it keeps my face from razor burn and allows the shaver to glide over my face instead of dragging. It is not as messy as pre-shave lotions since you rub it on from its holder. It has a pleasant scent as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a number of years and was concerned for a while when I could no longer find it.  It makes shaving with an electric razor much easier and less irritating.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 25 yrs this powder sticks work miracles!!!! Will not shave withouth them.</li>
    <li> I purchased a powder stick oh about 15 years ago and used it sparingly.   So I thought it was time to get a new stick. I purchased the 6 pack from Amazon. Within 3 weeks of using a stick my 5 month razor a -Remington MS 280- was having a hard time cutting anything. I cleaned the screen, blade assembly after every use.  So I thought the screen or blade was dull. So I went out and bought a new screen and blade set. Still wasn&#x27;t cutting. Long story short, I went and purchased a new razor. Took the old one apart and found the inside motor assembly PACKED with powder from the powder stick. I cleaned it out and reassembled it. The razor works but not as well because some of the plastic motor parts where warn a bit.  All I can think is maybe that is way the SP-5 Powder Sticks are so hard to find.  Anybody have any ideas on how to use it without killing your razor in 3 weeks?</li>
    <li> Use an electric shaver? Want the most out of it? You should be using a powder stick. Get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Really helps an electric shaver do a better job.</li>
    <li> Very Hard To Find Product. Works Great! Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> It &#x27;s the only product to this kind that I can use.&lt;br /&gt;Time to order more.  Online has made it easy to find this product.</li>
    <li> How can I not be delighted by being able to order this item from the comfort of my computer when Wal-Mart, who was the only retailer in my area who sold it as a seasonal product, no longer carries it?!</li>
    <li> When i was young I used to watch my father shave with a small powder stick. That was 50 years ago. I discovered Remington Shave stick about 10 years ago when Mennen discontinued it&#x27;s shave powder. The FaceSaver stick is a compressed powder with medicated additives. You rub the stick over your face and use your fingers to spread the powder. The powder removes the \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling of damp skin and lets stubble stand up. I find my razor glides over my skin with less irritation than pre-shave liquids, and I shave just as close. When I am finished I just wipe my face with a damp cloth. The medicated part of the stick is just enough to leave a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; feeling to the skin, with no razor burr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the seller, the delivery was quick. I was surprised how rapidly the shipment arrived. I am no longer able to buy FaceSaver at Wal-Mart or other big box stores. The price I paid brought the price per to just over $4.10 apiece, much lower then I was paying. That is a good deal, especially with Super Saver shipping!!!</li>
    <li> Works fine. Been using this product for many years.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product since I started shaving as a teenager in the 80s. In those days, you could find this product at most every drugstore or variety store. Nowadays, the only place to find this is at a local shaver shop or on the internet. I have no idea why it&#x27;s so rare. If I ever open up a store, I would stock this Face Saver product on my shelves and make a small fortune. People that use this product swear by the results and are very loyal to it. This product is essential in preventing shaving knicks and marks on my face when using my electric shaver. Basically you remove the cap and rub an event amount from the powder stick onto your face and neck and then shave. Be sure your face is completely dry first. It does an excellent job by acting as a thin, smoothing barrier between face and shaver to provide an even and clean shave. Some people use liquid Electric Shave but those bottles don&#x27;t last long at all and are pricey. One Face Shaver powder stick lasts about a month or so for me. Face Shaver is well worth your investment and works with any dry, electric shaver.  I always buy a 6-pack per order as it&#x27;s the most economical.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years with great results. Delivered as promised at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Have used the product for years with my Remington shaver.  I use it right down to a sliver.  Buying the six pack drives down the price as a single unit is over $8.  One unit should last a few months.</li>
    <li> If your a Barber or you use electric razors get this it will save your skin and your beard  trimmers  screen,  because of the powder it helps the trimmer glide over your skin with less effort and pressure  still  giving a close shave with less irritation..love it</li>
    <li> the first time I attempted to use the shaving stick it just broke in half. I have been using the top half (the bottom half was useless) I hope that this was just a fluke. I will be trying another shortly. If the other shaving sticks are the same , then it would be a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Had a good experience with it but 4/5 coz i still have my skin irrational to shave but not much when compared to other products i have tried.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping thanks good product!!!</li>
    <li> Works great to do a dry shave with electric razor when in too much of a rush to do a wet shave with shaving cream.</li>
    <li> By using this pre shave powder, I find that the hair seems to come off more easily and quickly. I would highly recommend it to anyone who uses an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I never used a DRY pre shaver before &amp; it works fine I think this amount will last me for EVER!</li>
    <li> I have been using these Remington Pre-shave powder sticks for many years. Just rub over your face before shaving with your electric shaver for a clean shave. I cannot shave without these powder sticks. GREAT PRODUCT AND GOOD PRICE from Amazon.    Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> Remington has done an awesome job making such a product for all those guys who use electric razors like myself. The difference is major when using the Remington Pre-shaver powder, unlike regular powder, or even baby powder, particularly, for those guys with sensitive skin. The product is made just for that: A Man&#x27;s Face. The Remington Pre-shaver can be felt instantly when shaving for the first time. You feel the electric razor gliding smoothly on your face, no nicks or cuts, no hair pulling, no scratches, no nothing, just perfect....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon08</li>
    <li> I have been using this powder for many years.  Over time, they have made the formulation of this stick powder softer and softer, so it is consumed faster and faster.  The latest batch I received was so soft that they arrived fractured in two.  Then, when I GENTLY rubbed the half-stick onto my face, the powder just poured off -- WAY more than required.  It&#x27;s not like you could say these things were cheap either!  I purchased this product at Amazon, and Amazon did their job admirably -- product was shipped immediately, arrived sooner than expected, and billing was clear without any confusion (multi-product order).</li>
    <li> It is nice to be able to buy 6 of these fave saver sticks at one time. Stores don&#x27;t always keep this many in stock, so sometimes we couldn&#x27;t find them.</li>
    <li> I had recently purchased an electric razor to shave my head. Prior, I had been using the standard razor, but was periodically cutting the back of my head. Often not even realizing it until I saw the blood on a towel, or shirt collar. I knew there was a period of adjustment when switching to an electric razor, but I also knew I needed a pre-shave routine. The only items available at Target or WalMart were the liquid pre-shave, if they even carried it. I wasn&#x27;t too keen on this method as those products tend to stink to high heaven.&lt;br /&gt;So I saw the Pre-Shave Powder Stick here on amazon, ordered the 6-pack.&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say, using the pre-shave powder stick made a big difference. Until this product arrived I was using baby powder on my head, but was worried about it clogging the electric razor. It worked ok, but once the Powder Sticks arrived, there was NO comparison!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using an electric razor, i totally recommend buying this. It&#x27;s very simple to use, goes on smooth with no smell, and the razor just glides over your skin! And YES, it even gave me a closer shave!</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving sticks</li>
    <li> I have been using Face Save for years.  I know it helps keep the blades from dulling and I have smooth shaves.  Best of all it does not burn or smell like those liquid pre-shave and after shave products.</li>
    <li> I have used powder sticks to shave for many years they work well.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the same shave sticks for many years and the sticks work great for pre-shaving.  They last a long time and allow my electric shaver to glide with no friction.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed...good price.  Long lasting talc stick. Retail packaging for rack stick.  Use it everyday.  Good stuff for shaving.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this same product from Walmart for my son when I gave him a nice electric shaver.  Walmart stopped carrying them.  When my younger son began shaving I knew I had to find these for him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for Amazon!  Not only did I find what I was looking for, but I found  a six pack of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stick makes it so easy to use your electric shaver!  It easily glides on, makes your whiskers stand up and your shaver glides over your skin.  My oldest is a personal trainer so he shaves a lot of his body and this makes it easier.  Your skin feels silky smooth and you don&#x27;t get irritation anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST PRODUCT FOR SHAVING EVER!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended...this product really helps get a better, closer shave out of your electric razor.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent alternative to liquid pre-electrict shaving solutions. Your face is soother and the electrict shaver runs easier. There is no pull at all. I have been shaving for 40 years and I will never go back to the liquid form.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. The 6-pack at Amazon is an excellent value.    My only question: Why does this product have to have perfume? I put this powder on to shave, then wash any residue off my face afterwards. Why do you have to inflict a stink on me while I shave off my stubble?    Adding stink increases the product&#x27;s price without adding functional benefits. An additional manufacturing process must be designed, tooled, installed, manned, and maintained...all to make a temporary stink. This is neither environmentally nor economically sound...except for those profiting off stink.    As soon as I find a competing product without stink, I will buy it instead.</li>
    <li> He will have enough to last for his entire life. We can&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer.Oh joy.</li>
    <li> I have a handicapped son that I need to shave and this helps so much with the razor gliding over his face.  Helps the caretakers also.</li>
    <li> I tried Remington Face Saver after being a Williams Lectric Shave user for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was no improvement  -- in fact I found it far inferior to Lectric Shave.  First of all, because it&#x27;s a compressed powder it was messy.  It wasn&#x27;t terrible but the powder does have to go somewhere when you run over it with an electric razor and it tended to end up on my t-shirt, towel and sink.  I&#x27;m not sure it was doing my razor any good either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it had a tendency to fall out of the tube if held upside down briefly... that made a bit of a mess too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was more time consuming than a pre-shave liquid and finally it did a worse job of beard prep than the Lectric Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe for some people this stuff works... for me... it didn&#x27;t.  I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works great and yields a closer more comfortable shave with my old Norelco.  I can step out of the shower, dry w&#x27; a towel, and shave because this stuff works so well.  The scent is very very mild which is important to me.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I orderd this for my father who canot find this in local stores and he loves it.  I also tried the shave stick and like the close shave it gives. I will continue to use this product and keep ordering it thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin this is a great pre-shave stick. My husband has used it for years so we order six at a time and it lasts for a long time. Hard to find in stores so thanks Amazon for keeping track for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband based on the reviews I had read here. My husband was skeptical about the need for such a product but after a few uses decided that although it feels strange to cover his face in powder, he likes the results and that it does provide a closer shave with his electric razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. Occasionally, I&#x27;ve been unable to find it in stores (this was before I found it online) and have tried other things (e.g., baby powder). Other things have not been satisfactory, and I&#x27;m just glad I can get it online.</li>
    <li> Works great for electric shaving. Bought this for my father who has used this product for years&lt;br /&gt; And he loves having a years supply. Now</li>
    <li> For those of us that still use Electric Shavers this is a must have product, especially during warm and humid months.</li>
    <li> It makes shaving a much better experience. Granted, you will have to clean the shaver more often but it makes my Norelco glides in my face.</li>
    <li> I have used electrical shavers now for a Loooong time, Face Saver is a Super simple and easy to use product.</li>
    <li> My husband cannot live without these things.  Works for him so works for me.  He&#x27;s happy with the product and uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> I use the Remington Face Saver pre-shave powder stick every day and I am happy with the results.  It drys my skin so the shaver works smooth.</li>
    <li> good product for shaving and also used last year when going out in the cold it would keep my face from getting wind burned.</li>
    <li> Sure glad I found this product. Makes your shave so much more comfortable. I am spoiled now. I will always have some on hand. Buy the six pack, it is a lot cheaper than buying one at a time.</li>
    <li> really helps when humid out</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, the Face Saver Pre Shave stick is what you should use with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> Best powder to use with electric shaver.  Makes shaving much smoother and easier on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great shaving stuff, works great!</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple of years now for a pre-electric treatment. Excellent</li>
    <li> Provides the best shaving surface.  Have used it for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;Have never found any other product that produced such great results.</li>
    <li> These are the only way to electric shave? Eliminate bumps, burn, makes elec shaving much easier. A little messy but worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff over 20yrs ago when I switched to electric. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried &amp; I&#x27;ve tried others but they can&#x27;t compete w/this stuff</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great close shave, No burning,No extra hairs left over. And when it&#x27;s humid outside it absorbs the moisture on your face,And still a close shave. Also a great deal on 6 of these.A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is another product that I have used for a long time that works great for me.  It is not easy to find in stores anymore so finding it on Amazon was also great as even the manufacturer&#x27;s site was out of stock.  It is a talc based product which can be a problem for some.</li>
    <li> I could not find \\&quot;Face Saver\\&quot; or any similar product in town. I have used this for over 10 years. Now, all of a sudden, it is no longer available in Wal-Mart, Rite-Aid, CVS, Walgreen, Target; I could name every store in Montgomery as I have tried them all. The only place within 25 miles of here that sometimes carries it is the BX on the other side of town. I ordered these for about $4 each. Not only do I get the best, cleanest, comfortable shave from using \\&quot;Face Saver\\&quot;, the product also dry lubes the cutters during the shave. I don&#x27;t shave in the shower and I detest the oily pre-shave products. I recommend this product above wet , oily pre-shave products any day. It&#x27;s a talc stick you can easily pack or take in the car. The only negative comment one could give is, apply it sparingly because the more you apply, the more \\&quot;talc dust\\&quot; you will have. It cleans up easily and does not stain clothes or furniture.</li>
    <li> Try this Pre-shave powder when you shave with your electric shaver. You car experience a closer shave. A better electric shave.&lt;br /&gt;Chef Taurus</li>
    <li> My husband just loves these. Has been using them of a few years now. He would never shave without them!</li>
    <li> Yes, I should have noticed when I bought it that it is a powder... and if that is what you&#x27;re looking for, you may really like this product. Personally, I find that the powder ends up creating more cleaning work on my electric foil razor, and isn&#x27;t as effective at giving me a close shave as other alcohol based pre-shave lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, on humid days, I prefer shaving with this product than shaving without any product at all.</li>
    <li> Like this because it gives a smooth shave without all the perfumes or oils of most pre-shave lotions. Just lightly rub on and rinse off when done. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> have used these for years and they continue to deliver buying by the six pack is a great idea for keeping the cost down and not being in the uncomfortable position (not to speak of un-shaven) of running out, BTW I use another brand of electric shaver, first letter is a B and with that brand when it is run through the cleaning cycle all comes out squeaky clean for the next shave</li>
    <li> This is the best pre-shave concoction ever.  If you use it, your shaver will not drag and you won&#x27;t get razor burn.  It&#x27;s great when the weather is humid, because it helps the shaver just glide on your skin regardless.  And it&#x27;s compact so that it travels well wherever you go.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as I expected it. Saving money by buying in bulk.  It gives me a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and gives a much better and closer shave.  It is not as powdery as other kinds.</li>
    <li> Super product.  Look everywhere for the Face Saver.  Quality product for shavers with shaving problems plus speeds up the time required to shave.  Glad to find it was in stock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this product for years. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. My beard is like a wire brush,which makes my razor heat up. Face saver helps to keep the heat to a minimum, which means little to no irritation for me. Great product!!</li>
    <li> As far as I can find, FaceSaver is the only talc-bar available. I&#x27;ve been using it for decades and I will continue to do so. However, it seems this last batch -- it&#x27;s been about five years since I bought a stock -- is softer than previous versions. That is, it seems to be wearing faster.</li>
    <li> Use the pre-shave power stick before each shave. Helps give me a smooth and close shave. Wouldn&#x27;t shave without putting the pre-shave power stick.</li>
    <li> This made a big difference originally, but I did start with irritation in my neck. Might be my blades and I will replace it before I make a final comment</li>
    <li> I have been using this ever since the 70&#x27;s Getting harder and harder to find at any local stores.  Is an absolutely great product for electric shavers.  Really give a quick close shave.</li>
    <li> Got these for my son. They work ok but are sort of messy. My dad always used the Old Spice version which I cannot find. This is softer and messier. But he uses them anyway.</li>
    <li> Been using this powder for years......great stuff!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I really get a smooth shave and very refreshing to the face.  I Never experienced this with liquid pre shave.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to buy these shave sticks at several different stores, but now it seems they&#x27;re only available online. This is my second order for the 6 pack of these shave sticks from Amazon and I will continue to shop Amazon for this product.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Excelln product!  It works well with the Remington Shaver and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving prep for electric razors I have found. It works great even in the most humid climates.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002SJ4ADO Remington SP-5 SP5 Face Saver Pre-shaver Powder Stick (6 pack)]]- Good Product, and arrived quickly to Thailand</li>
    <li> Great product for shaving.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving especially in a hot summer</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find in retail outlets in the United States and impossible to get in Jordan.  Makes electric shaving so easy and without the mess of a liquid.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product with a pretty decent price. Use it often nod works great! Will purchase again because of the reasonable price</li>
    <li> Helps with a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of switching from manual razor shaving to an electric razor and it was a tough start.  Have a very good electric razor but it was irritating my face and not giving as close a shave as I would like.  Did not glide over skin easily.  Started using this powder stick and my shaving experiance has improved dramatically.  I am now sticking with it and have little to no irritation now and the razor slides smoothly across my skin.  A little goes a long way as well so it seems that each stick will last a while.  Probably could do the same thing with normal talcum powder but this stick form is very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> After trying this product a few days, I decided to dump it. It is unbelievably messy. It gets all over the place and really makes a mess of the shaver. I used it with my Remington and my battery operated travel shaver. I have managed to mostly clean up the Remington because I can wash it under the faucet.  I haven’t finished cleaning up my battery powered travel shaver. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was just what I wanted to go with my new electric shaver. I have very comfortable shaves with little mess.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Have used it for years!  Great on the face, no razor burn when using it. This is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it in my area over the last 4 yrs.  Why??????</li>
    <li> I originally found this stuff at a walmart.  I live in Arizona and spend time in Michigan. The powder sticks provide a smooth shave that the other pre shaves cannot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Remington Face Shaver product for a number of years now.  Helps me get a much closer shave while avoiding skin irritation.  Much to my dismay, most area stores stopped carrying the product earlier this year.</li>
    <li> I have tried some other products but Remington SP-5 Face saver is outstanding. I have been using this for 25 years. I use to buy them at the stores but now a days they do not seem to carry them. Do not know why. Thumbs up on this one  ANM</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that keeps my husbands face safe from the electric shaver!  It is extremely hard to find in stores so Amazon is the best way to get it for me.  I was thrilled to see that you could order 6 sticks for only $28.  Great deal and this means you only have to buy it once or twice a year at most.  Being in the military my husband has to be clean shaven all the time and that can lead to a very irritated face, but with facesaver he has no problems at all.  It&#x27;s just a powder stick that you rub onto your face before you shave.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised and was delivered when promised.</li>
    <li> Much better than expected. Tested with Philips PT877 electric razor, I got a much better shave using this powder. Easy to apply on my face, no mess, no fuss. I recommend this to anyone who shaves with an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I like using this product it&#x27;s very good&lt;br /&gt;It prevents razor burns and it&#x27;s easy to put on. Would recommend it</li>
    <li> good price compared to CVS</li>
    <li> It works fine.  I tend to have a \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; face and this product keeps my face in shape for an excellent shave.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I am glad that I was able to make this purchase thru Amazon since I have not found it in local stores for some time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for those of us that use an electric razor. This product really makes it effortless to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more messy gels, alcohol based liquids, none of that. Gets you a close shave and does the job extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a electric that you can wash under the faucet, this will come right out without caking also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one of the best shaving products I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> I always rely on this product for shaving with my electrical shaver. It´s a soft non scent powder. Shavng is smoother with it, cant shave anymore without it!!!. Only downside is electrical shaver gets more dirt.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Gives me a great smooth shave. No razor burn or irritation.  Goes a long way unlike any other preshave.</li>
    <li> Best for the price. Better then ones from other manufacture..</li>
    <li> this is a staple so not much more to say here</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Use it daily to enhance my shave.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years, these things do a fantastic job preparing you face before you shave with an electric shaver. They absorb all the moisture that can cause the shaver to miss spots or cause ingrown hairs. The powder helps the razor slide over your skin better making for a much smoother and quicker shave. I hate shaving with out one.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for years and it works very well for him.  He will buy nothing else to use for shaving.</li>
    <li> Has used for years and really likes the face saver before shaving.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was very messy to use as it became a powder once applied.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my husbands sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Been buying these shaver sticks for years for my dad. They are getting hard to find. I&#x27;ve been purchasing them on Amazon for the past few year. They always arrive on time , and it makes my father very happy .</li>
    <li> No cracks noted yet.  word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word. asdf  ;lkj asdf ;lkj</li>
    <li> Love the powder much better than any of the liquids.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and a very thick beard.  Obviously, this is a bad combination.  I have tried everything from skin lotions,  after shaves, different razors and nothing has worked.  Until Face Saver.  This pre-shave powder has given me my face back!  The powder gives you a thin barrier between your face and the electric razor, allowing you to get a close shave without the razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.  The only con I have found is that you must be vigilant in cleaning your electric razor.  In the beginning, I wasn&#x27;t too particular with cleaning and it resulted in the blades dulling prematurely.  Currently I use a Braun Series 7-790cc that has auto cleaning station that does the dirty work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  A must have for sensitive skin and thick beards.  But you must be vigilant in cleaning your razor.</li>
    <li> I have told many people about this wonderful product.  I have had an excellent experience using this product.  I plan on continuing to use this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  They are hard to find and this is the only place where I can find it. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not been able to find this products at any stores in my immediate area.  This purchase will set me up for several years!</li>
    <li> I Use it on my head for the close razor burn free shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use with norelco phillips QC5550 head shaver.</li>
    <li> I like this product much better than the liquid pre-shavers that are out there.This product lets my shaver glide over my face and lift my beard for a nice close shave. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over thirty years.Walmart,and other stores dont stock this product anymore.I was bummed!Found it on GOOD OLD AMAZON,and hey,back in business!Just rub across face a little bit,and rub in with fingers,and this product provides an easy smooth electric shave.Zero irritation.Suggest  use with electric shavers that you can rinse after use,to avoid build up,and longevity of shaver heads.Buy in bulk,for best price!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco razor for many years. I used the Norelco shave Goo for a while, but was unimpressed. I had some of the Remington Face Saver in my medicine cabinet that I had bought and not used due to use of the Norelco product and upon using it I had great results. My shaves became rash free and closer. I was down to very little of the product and was holding the remnants to apply the product and was beginning to get concerned as I could not find the product in any store. Thankfully, I found it here at Amazon and bought a 6-pack. I also bought the Remington razer cleaner and lubricant spray. Thank you Amazon. I would recommend this product to all that use an electric razor of any make. HAPPY SHAVING ALL!  ,</li>
    <li> It saves the most money and is more convenient then running out to look for these hard to find items in the local stores.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product having used it for many years - but now I find it is impossible to find it in my area - no stores carry it and it is a Toronto based company - 60 miles away from me - and unavailable for purchase! I was extremely thankful for Amazon carrying it, butit is  also at 1/2 the original cost here,  in the Niagara Falls area. Makes for a great electric-razor shave ; better than the liquid shave products.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for several years.  A perfect addition to shaving with an electric razor.  Unfortunately, over the years, it has become increasingly more difficult to find this product, until now.  Ordering over the internet from Amazon has stopped my quest of searching for this product.  Now with the click of a button, I can enjoy my pre-shaver powder sticks whenever I need them.  There is no other similar product, that I have found, on the market.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE GREAT, AND I NOW HAVE  A SEVERAL YEAR SUPPLY.  I SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND THEM FOR LESS MONEY AT FRY&#x27;S.</li>
    <li> This is the only pre-shave I use and it can be hard to find. Happy to have found it here and at a great price.   Will order more soon.</li>
    <li> Face shaver smooths my face without wet, smelly liquid.  A nice bonus is that the powder cleans out of my razor easily, just dumps right out.  I give it at least a 4 for usefulness and convenience.</li>
    <li> this helps your electric razor glide over your face.  it really does give you a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Always get a smooth shave with this product.</li>
    <li> It is the best product on the market.  I have used it for years and it gets better each time I buy it.  I can not imagine shaving with my electric razor without it.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and shaving has always been a problem for me. I use a Braun electric and have for years, this just makes it glide and I rarely get razor burn.</li>
    <li> Item as described, prompt delivery, satisfied</li>
    <li> Item was for my husband. He just loves the stuff. Ordered a second batch. Hopefully item will be available for years to come.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have found for a pre-shave with an electric razor.  It eliminates all the natural oils on your face and allows the electric razor to flow very smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is the only pre-shave that works for me.</li>
    <li> This product replaces the pre-shave liquid that I had become allergic to.  FaceSaver works better the the preshave liquid did.  I am very satisfied and have recommended this product to friends.</li>
    <li> I have been cursed with sensitive skin on my face, especially my neck....I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of $ on different shaving products trying to find something that works.  Pre-shave oil, post-shave lotion, different razors, shavers, blah, blah.  The only thing that seems to work for me is this pre-shave powder and my Panasonic electric shaver, without the pre-shave powder I&#x27;d have to take on the Grizzly Adams look and my wife would likely kick me out of the house.  This product is hard to find and I fear the day it is no longer available, until then I can have the clean shave that I (and my wife) prefer.</li>
    <li> quick delivery; no problems.  highly recommend</li>
    <li> my whole family uses it for years now.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for nearly two years.  It&#x27;s amazing how close my electric shaves, compared to liquids like Aqua Velva.  Wife says it smells better too.  Works just like talcum powder, but glides on like stick deodorant.  No muss no fuss, just a clean, close shave!</li>
    <li> I have used this as a face prep for years with Norelco shavers.  It provides a smooth surface for the cutter blades.  And, yes, there is extra materials in the shaver that I clean daily when I&#x27;m done.  I found liquid preshave product was not as effective.</li>
    <li> The Face Saver sticks are very easy to use and do not cause a mess.  Hands stay clean and the powder wipes off easy after the shave.  Remarkably good at providing a nice glide for the electric shaver.  They last a long time and are a good value.</li>
    <li> Every day for at least the past 20 years, I have been using this Remington pre-shaver powder stick after it was recommended to me by my father. As many other reviewers have noted, this powder is odorless, goes on smoothly, provides a clean shave, and essentially eliminates irritation resulting in a nice smooth shave. Just out of curiosity, I have tried using pre-shave oils but they have simply been no comparison to the close shave I get when using this powder stick. Similarly, whenever I have tried shaving without this powder or any other pre-shave, I have always been disappointed with the result. My facial hair grows quickly and I have quite a bit of stubble each morning. That being said, I would estimate that one of these sticks typically lasts me about two months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to purchase this stick at Walmart until they stopped carrying it at my local stores. For some odd reason, many other retail stores stopped carrying it as well. Thankfully, I can still purchase it through Amazon at nearly 20% less than what I was paying for it in the store because of this 6-pack&#x27;s low per-unit price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything else my entire shaving life.  It fact, I&#x27;ve never shaved with a regular razor.  This stuff is smooth, and makes using an electric shaver comfortable and a breeze.</li>
    <li> this is a must if you use an electric shaver. and it is hard to find, so buy it up on here now!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am not able to use beard preparation lotions becaues the burn my skin. The powder stick makes shaving much more pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have always avoided close shaves. An irritating rash appears around my upper neck, sometimes so bad, it is embarrassing. Sure, it only lasts a day, but it looks bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my decades old shaver, finally needed to be retired. I bought an average, every Joe kind of electric shaver, and I could not avoid the rash, no matter what I tried. Less pressure, shaving with the \\&quot;grain\\&quot;, pre-shave lotion, warming the face before hand, cooling the face afterwards, and rinsing with rubbing alcohol. All failures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an Internet search, I found these sticks. Honestly, using powder doesn&#x27;t even make sense, but I tried talcum powder to see if it helped. There did seem to be a difference, but it is hard to apply powder to your neck, talcum powder stinks, and there is the question of what it will do to the blades on the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also questioned why this stuff is not in every store, if it is so great. I still can&#x27;t answer that one, because Remington Face Saver IS THAT GREAT. It has never failed. It smells good, even though you wash it off afterwards anyway. It is easy to apply to those trouble areas. The container is small, but packs a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question needs to be asked again; why isn&#x27;t Remington Face Saver in every store?</li>
    <li> I used to have a terrible time shaving my face, either with a traditional razor or an electric shaver.  I have sensitive skin, and even a \\&quot;top-of-the-line\\&quot; electric shaver would irritate my skin and leave large red blotches all over my face for several minutes after shaving each day.  The Remington SP-5 is a compressed powder stick that easily rubs on and provides for a smooth, soothing shave.  No more red blotches on my face after shaving!  Recently, I found that my local store stopped stocking this item, so I was relieved to find it being sold on Amazon.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!  The only thing I would caution you about is to make sure that your face is completely dry before applying the powder.  The powder stick will absorb moisture if your face is wet, and then it becomes difficult to apply in the future. (It is not as \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; if you get it wet.)  Overall, I highly recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought it!</li>
    <li> This product, IMO, is the very best pre-shave product on the market for electric shavers.  I have used this and similar products for many years and will continue to do so and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Gives him a smooth shave.  He doesn&#x27;t feel the shaver.</li>
    <li> great for a smooth shape.</li>
    <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered on time!!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> First of all I want to say that I never write reviews even though I rely on them when I make 95% of my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a life changer, I used it for the first time today and I will never shave without for the rest of my life. For people with sensitive skin this should be #1 on your list of items to buy. For the first time in my life i shave my face and neck and don&#x27;t feel any sense of a burn. I applied it to my face once shaved and it came right off with the shave and then just reapplied it to place where i missed and I was done. Also, one last thing is i barely used any of it so although i&#x27;m not sure exactly how many shave it will last, it looks like it will definitely go the distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, i just bought another 6 pack so I have a stock of 12 right now just to make sure.</li>
    <li> I always use it for my electric shave. It helps the electric razor run over your face. I love it</li>
    <li> My husband uses this each time he shaves. He says there is not as much razor burn with it and less pulling.</li>
    <li> I have used these pre-shave powder sticks, with my electric razors, for years.  They have always provided for a smoother, more effective shave.  The powder helps dry the skin surface and isolate the hairs, which helps the razor cut more comfortably and closer to the face.  And, importantly, one of these powder sticks goes a long, long ways --- lasts for many, many shaves.  Well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Just tried this stuff out and had to write a review. I haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days so I really got a good feel for the product. My face is very sensitive, I have an awesome Panasonic electric shaver but I still seem to have irritation and red bumps on my neck after shaving.This has always been the case for me. I wish I would have found this stuff a long time ago! I put some on (doesn&#x27;t take much, I can tell this product, especially getting it in a 6 pack will last awhile) and boy what a difference in shaving! No irritation, no red bumps, and I think I got a much closer shave than normal (sometimes I have to use the trimmer to get a few spots on the neck, not this time!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that you definitely need to clean the razor out more frequently (I could see this easily getting clogged if I didn&#x27;t) but my razor is waterproof so no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this stuff and will definitely use it for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> I use these regularly and they are hard to find in the area  that I live in.  This is the second purchase of a product like this in the past two years.  As I use this item often, I can justify the purchase of more than one at a time.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this since he had to use and electric razor now.  His skin always broke out when he used an electric razor. Now, he can use it and has not problems</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and product was a great price!</li>
    <li> If you have an electric shaver, you have to buy this stuff.  It makes shaving so much easier, smoother, quicker, and softer on the skin.  I have been using this stuff for years and will never shave without it again.</li>
    <li> Item delivered fast....husband &amp; son really like using it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Used something like this many years ago and it went away.  Sooooo happy I found this again.  Don&#x27;t like the wet per-shave because you have to wait but the the powder you just put it on and shave away.</li>
    <li> Works great. Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I like it, and my wife likes it because I had been using baby powder as a pre-shave.  However, baby powder tended to find its way all over the bathroom counter, etc.  With the solid Face Saver this does not happen.</li>
    <li> Using this product on your face before shaving with your electric razor is certainly better than using nothing at all. The powder is very easy to apply and has a nice smell. It can be a little messy because the powder will fall from your face while shaving. I simply lean over the sink while shaving to remedy that small problem. All in all I like this product and recommend it to others. I purchased a 6 pack because the price was much better. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and still have not finished one of the six, so at that rate it may take me a few years to run through all six of them.</li>
    <li> Having used these for several decades, they became either hard to find or outrageously expensive, even in a major metropolitan area.  I appreciate being able to find these on-line and will be a repeat purchaser in the future.</li>
    <li> This product improves the closeness of an electric shave, no matter what razor you use.  I have used it for years, and am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this initially in October 2010. It is now March 2012 and I still have at least one left so now I need to reorder. I initially bought these because I was tired of dealing with the pre-shave lubricants that seemed like a lot of mess and took too much time to clean off my face. I wanted something that I could put on quickly and shave without wasting a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying these, I have had no problems shaving on a daily basis. I would definitely recommend this product to those of us who are stuck with shaving with an electric shaver but are annoyed by the burning sensation after shaving. It also helps me gets a closer shave with my $40 norelco electric shaver (sorry i dont have the model number on me) that I bought 5 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also recommend this to those who were hestitate to try electric shaving and do not want to spend $250+ on a fancy shaver that can handle shaving foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do notice is when I put it on and shave, I have to make sure I&#x27;m leaning over the sink so the powder doesn&#x27;t get on my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I hope this was helpful to those looking into this product.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for a smoother more comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; facial skin, so I have to use an electric shaver.  I heard about this product and gave it a try many years back and have been using it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why more people do not use this.  It is difficult to find in stores around me.  FaceSaver works as advertised.  You smear it around your face, work around with your fingers, and then shave.  It makes shaving a much more pleasant experience.  Plus, this is a powder, so it goes on and off easily without a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave some to my dad and he now loves it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  Uses it everyday for a close and smooth shave.  Highly recommend because my husband doesn&#x27;t get excited about many products!  Gotta love one that he does, and it works!</li>
    <li> Work great with New Norelco Razor previously purchased. I doesn&#x27;t matter if it is very Humid, Like in Panama, Or Dry, like in San Bernardino, CA.....this pre-shaver Powder WORKS !!!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this all the time to prevent irritation to his face. It is a very helpful product.</li>
    <li> Powder is great at drying the oils in your face for a smooth shave.  I don&#x27;t shave without this stuff anymore.</li>
    <li> The Pre-shaver Powder Stick is very hard to find in local stores.  My husband really likes using it and this is not the first time we have ordered it.  It is very convenient to order it online and I appreciate being able to get it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> These are the greatest things ever for shaving every day with an electric shaver. Yes, you will need to clean the shaver, A LOT if you want to keep it from cloggin up, but it&#x27;s worth it believe me. I&#x27;m in the Military and I have to keep clean shaven and this helps out in the desert a lot as well keeping things dry and cutting fast.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for any type of electric shaver. Allows the razor to run smoothly on the face and give a close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used FaceSaver off and on since I began shaving---that&#x27;s a long time. sometimes, I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding the right product. Amazon is very helpfull.&lt;br /&gt;I like FaceSaver because it doesn&#x27;t clog my razor as fast a  the liquid pre-shave .&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone willing to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love using FaceSaver. It really works on my sensitive skin. I recommend it to anybody, I believe you will like it also.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This powder makes shaving a fun thing to do great product I will never be with out it</li>
    <li> This product works great on my face for pre-shave conditioning.  Other electric pre-shave conditioners irritate my skin, but not the Remington Face Saver.</li>
    <li> Reduces wear and heat on face and neck and helps to keep skin dry, too.  I think it helps lubricate in the razor head also and helps to reduce wear on the foil and blade.</li>
    <li> I have been using it now for at least 15 years. it works great with my electric razor, great stuff</li>
    <li> Works well as a pre-shave.  For the past few years, this product has become &amp;#34;softer,&amp;#34; meaning it dispenses substantially more powder than before.  That means a stick doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as in the past (a couple of months vs. 6 mos+).</li>
    <li> I watched my dad use these when I was a kid in the 60s.  I&#x27;ve bought them all my adult life and one day realized that I should probably buy them in bulk.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get a good shave  without it. It dries my face and readies my face for a shave with no pain or scrapes</li>
    <li> I like this product but a little disappointed with recent price increase</li>
    <li> Best product for electric shaving....smooth and comfortable .</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best pre-shave for electric shavers on the market.  Especially if one lives in very humid climate as I do.  A more faithful cleaning of the shaver after usage may be necessary, but it&#x27;s worth it.  No more shaver-sticking-to-the-face ... just a smooth action where face meets shaver.</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent alternative to liquid \\&quot;facial preparations\\&quot; commonly used with electric shavers. It&#x27;s a dry stick that works very well especially for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> second time I bought. gave to friends.</li>
    <li> Used this stuff for years. Love it</li>
    <li> I like this product because it allows my razor to grab and cut the hairs on my face. Creams and lotions only matt the hairs to my face. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a scent, so I choose what aftershave scent I want.</li>
    <li> This powder stick is very easy to apply and works well as a pre-treatment before electric shaving. This 6-pack had the lowest per unit price I could find for this item.</li>
    <li> My husband has used a liquid pre-shave for years and was a little skeptical trying something new.  He loves it - no pull, no burn, and gives a superb shave.</li>
    <li> Great stuff ---- great for after the shower when you need to shave a damp face that will NOT dry itself off!!!!  OR any time at all!!!  Smooth face quick!!!!</li>
    <li> I use both a rotary and a foil shaver, and this product definitely reduces the irritation and post shaver burn . I  previously used my shavers wet with shaving gel, and now have the convenience of electric shaving dry thanks to this.</li>
    <li> This is impossible for me to find locally.  I&#x27;ve looked.  This products works great with an electric shaver providing a smoother surface on which the razor glides.  Make sure that you wash or brush your shaved after use.  The powder does build up a bit in the shaver.  I can rinse my shaver under water and that does the trick, along with an old toothbrush for tougher areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them years.  Only negative; totally over priced for something made of baby powder and wax.  Some company should make a generic one.</li>
    <li> Makes every electric shave easy and smooth.  An absolute necessity in humid environments.  Easy to rub on and shave immediately.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. When I could not get it at any store, including Walmart, I was really bummed. When I found it online, I have been buying six at a time. Each one last me about 5 or 6 months using it daily. I will continue to buy it until it is no longer available, gets to expensive or I quit using electric razors.</li>
    <li> Without this product I would have to do at least 3-4 passes to get the kind of close shave I prefer.  Using this product reduces the shave time to one good pass and not leaving my facial skin irritated.  I switched to an electric shave because the soaps with the straight edge started to irritate my skin.  I never though I could get a real close shave again.  Well this product helps.</li>
    <li> This is a product that most stores do not carry.  The product works well and saves your skin, making electric shaving smooth and quick.</li>
    <li> The Remington Pre-shaver powder stick is easy to use,just smooth it on.  It absorbs excess moisture and sets the beard up for a smooth comfortable shave.  I&#x27;ve used the product before, so I was familiar with its qualities at the time of purchase.</li>
    <li> The Remington SP -5 Face Saver Powder Stick allows an electric razor to smoothly cut facial hair and provide a clean shaven faced. I have been using this product for years and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Great product - my husband loves the Face Saver power.</li>
    <li> These little buggers can be hard to find, and they&#x27;re (in my opinion) outrageously expensive when you locate them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This six-pack is perfect, and will last a long time. A very nice item for the man who uses an electric razor. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended without reservation! :)</li>
    <li> I tried one cannister to see how it would work with an electric razor. WOW..........what a much better and closer shave than the wet goop I had been using. I then ordered a case.</li>
    <li> The other reviews led me to purchase this product.  I use a Norelco razor and this powder stick has really made shaving easier.  I was using cream or nothing and I have now moved to these exclusively.  I love how it dries your skin so that the razor does a good job.  It is perfect for the traveler.  Not liquid!</li>
    <li> These talc face savers are so much better and easier to use than the those that are liquid, i.3. alcohol and oil based.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this all the time easy on the face and on the razor. does a good job. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are great for me.  I&#x27;ve been using them for many years...</li>
    <li> My husband was happy to receive the Pre-shaver Powder Sticks. When he needs more power sticks we will not hesitate to reorder from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My husband has used these for years.  They&#x27;re really hard to find in our local stores so that&#x27;s why I order them online.</li>
    <li> Does what it says :) very satisfied, no complaints (just trying to fill the words requirement for the review) :)</li>
    <li> My husband has pretty sensitive skin. He uses this before shaving with his electric razor, and it makes a big difference in the quality of his shave, and drastically decreases the irritation. We can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, and this is the best price I&#x27;ve found it for.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 30+ years.  Works great for me, preparing my skin for panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> Great price for a six pack.  Have used the Remington face Saver for 15 years.</li>
    <li> My son uses this all the time he loves it</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Come to think of it, I needed to be reminded to use them as I shave with my electric shavers. They do seem to make the razors glide across my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years.  I have very sensitive skin and this works great.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> What can one say about shaving powder?  It works, face is happy, I am happy.  An excellent product shipping is timely and it is properly packaged.  This was my second order of this product.</li>
    <li> in hot humid weather it makes shaving a breeze.</li>
    <li> Would like a big and tall shirt to be a little longer.</li>
    <li> Works as described, but fills my razor with a lot of powder that needs to be rinsed out after each use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product and it was on time. I recommend it a lot</li>
    <li> Only pre-shave i would use. excellent price and good performance</li>
    <li> It makes shaving much more comfortable. Reduces irritation considerably</li>
    <li> 100% satisfied, would hate to be without it.</li>
    <li> My morning shave is much more pleasant. The  razor just glides over my beard.  I&#x27;m  real happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff - Been using this for years. It simply makes the shaving process so much easier and smoother.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
    <li> Makes shaving easier.</li>
    <li> Humidity is your worst enemy when using an electric shaver. I live in a hot and humid climate, therefore this product is a necessity for me. The product works great!</li>
    <li> Used the old version and it was great. The new pre shave is wonderful.  Smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Great price great product would buy again, the best there is when it comes to electric shaving, I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I cannot find this in any local store anymore..  Glad it is still available on the internet.  Works great!.  Pat Kelly</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  My son talked him into using it...a good buy</li>
    <li> great price, 1/2 of buying in store</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Buying in bulk saves money.  This powder is great for electric shavers I&#x27;ve used it for many years for a clean, smooth, close shave.</li>
    <li> Used the Powder stick for a long time (when made in Israel) this is similar but runs out faster and more expencive.&lt;br /&gt;Could not find it locally but is worth having it.&lt;br /&gt;A must use for thoes using electric shaving daily. Keeps the skin cooler, less friction to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and it is hard to find in stores sometimes. I like ordering lareger quantity and having sent to my door.</li>
    <li> Great Item for Electric Shavers........</li>
    <li> just what i was looking for.  hard to find now</li>
    <li> Best shaving powder. It can improve shaving with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> These little shave sticks are expensive buying them one by one.  Purchasing six at a time is cheaper and my husband always has one on hand.</li>
    <li> I have now purchased three of these 6 packs for use with my Remington.....pop the top and shake out the excess powder; definitely not &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; like the liquids...JimMc</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Powder sticks for 30+ years.  When using an electric razor, I find it much easier for the razor to glide over my face with ease.  Even with very humid weather where the razor might slow or stick to my face a bit.</li>
    <li> It keeps my face dry and makes shaving easier. I knew exactly what I was ordering and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is too strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and like it.  However, there are two formulas I come across, and I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re just screwing up or doing it intentionally. The traditional formula was more solid, less powdery, and a single stick would last me about 9 months.  The other formula, which this batch and some occasional earlier ones were too, is way more soft and talc&#x27;y, makes a mess such as getting on to my shirt collar easily, and the sticks last about 3 months because so much is wasted.  Both work, one just works far better and cheaper.  My suspicion is that they want more $$ and so make it softer intentionally, hence 3 stars given for greed over common sense.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this stuff for shaving and its hard to find in the stores, so we bought a 6 pack of it and now we have plenty as it lasts a while.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. The price is good and I recived them on time.</li>
    <li> Seems to help as a pre-shave application.</li>
    <li> Loved the delivery!  Very fast.</li>
    <li> My husband was looking for a product that would minimize irritation from his electric razor. I bought this product along with others to try and now he won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Glad I found this product in bulk Smooth shave with the electric shaver no rash</li>
    <li> perfect for shaving without irritation</li>
    <li> A powder stick has long been due.  Glides on easy with no spills or drips.  Words extremely well on the face as well as other body grooming areas.</li>
    <li> my fiance uses this every day and since we can no longer find it in stores here in w.pa buying it by the case was a smart move. now he has unlimited supply for now.</li>
    <li> It was good and was so glad to be able to get it.  Still have a couple but happy to have it.</li>
    <li> Use both rotary and foil shavers (depends on my mood) seems to help for both</li>
    <li> Until VERY recently, I used the SP-5 every day.  I have naturally oily skin, and incredible thick hair.  Shavers would cry after an attempt to get my whiskers down to the skin and screens would disappear in weeks.  But, for the last fifteen years, Remington has had a good solution with the Face Shaver.  Makes shaving smoother, makes the face smoother, and makes your screen last longer.  That said, it also means a bit more cleaning....not just of the shaver, but your sink too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in a battle with your razor, definitely give this a shot.  If you like it, it&#x27;s also available in &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;....save some bank and take the worry out of running out of it.  :-)</li>
