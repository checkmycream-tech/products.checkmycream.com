    <li> Too expensive. Why is hydrogen peroxide this expensive?!</li>
    <li> !/2 the price @ my Dentists office</li>
    <li> Came quickly and hope it helps with canker sores.</li>
    <li> Why I purchased this item: I left a review on Verve toothpaste, explaining my chronic struggle with canker sores.  Please refer to that for information about my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Opinion of the product: OUTSTANDING!  This stuff works fantastic in combination with Verve toothpaste.  I doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth, keeps it feeling clean, and helps with any irritations your mouth might experience with daily foods.  It has been a week since I used this product and I can tell you I will definable be purchasing it again!  I recommend buying this along with the oncology prevention mouthwash.  I use the oncology mouthwash when I am experiencing some painful sores, which is a stronger version for sores. Both are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: I received this item, the oncology mouthwash and the verve toothpaste immediately which was very exciting considering I had a mouth full of painful sores and a fever.</li>
    <li> A great product.....helps with tartar control and kills mouth bacteria....i have used it for 15 years....i would recommend it for anyone</li>
    <li> The mouth wash rinse is really good for people who suffer from canker sores.  It helped heal a recent outbreak.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have an immunity disorder, am prone to yeast. This keeps everything clear, healthy. And I don&#x27;t get sick as much.</li>
    <li> It works really well. keeps canker sores at bay.</li>
    <li> The only mouth wash that does not damage my mouth (blisters and burning) when used as directed. So grateful!</li>
    <li> I did not see any change. Over priced for the placebo effect it delivered.</li>
    <li> I am not fond of it but I was asked to use it by my doctor... does solve the problem</li>
    <li> Just bought a second bottle! Great for my husband&#x27;s thrush and great on my periodontal issues!</li>
    <li> I chose this mouth wash because I liked the taste and the feeling in my mouth after using it.  It seemed to help my breath stay fresh.</li>
    <li> My only con about this product is that there&#x27;s no top cap once I opened the bottle. How can you not sell a product without a top cap??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing works but no top cap is a downfall.</li>
    <li> Really good for mouth sores.</li>
    <li> I use this product mostly because my entire family can use it. It doesn&#x27;t have that harsh after taste of most mouth rinse&#x27;s and it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so I feel a lot better about my kids using it. I saw the reviews for the companies oncology product so I know they make a quality product. Have been using it for about 6 months now. Very happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  Pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> Good product. Seal sometimes falls into the bottle...very frustrating and difficult to retrieve.</li>
    <li> We love this mouthwash. Our hygienist recommended for it&#x27;s bacteria killing properties so we tried it. It has no harsh taste, and we have noticed a decrease in mouth problems such as canker sores and inflammation of the gums around crowns. We think it works and sometimes is hard to find in the stores, so when I saw it on Amazon, I stocked up! Thank you for having this product.Safe for children of all ages.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with my gums for as long as I can remember... this is one of the only products I have found that quickly relieves any sore or tender spots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time. Prevention keeps my mouth clean, fresh and bacteria free. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this to me. This is used for cancer patients to reduce the period of time they have mouth sores by 1/2. I use it every time I get a sore and it works wonders. I just wish there were a travel size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this, and it tastes nice and minty. Can&#x27;t say how effective it is though. No discernible difference to me.</li>
    <li> Whenever my children get canker sores I have them swish some of this around in their mouth at the sore.  Within a day or two, the canker sore has stopped hurting and mostly on its way to healing.  So far, this product is the best and easiest to use for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash.  Not sure if it is &#x27;better&#x27; than store brands, but it is a good medium strength mint that certainly seems to have less processing than Scope, Listerine, etc.  Definitely recommend trying.  Even my kids like it (though they water it down to lessen the mint flavor).  It also definitely helped heal a canker sore quicker than with out the mouthwash.</li>
