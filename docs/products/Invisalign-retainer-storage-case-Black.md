    <li> Great product. Just wish it would have small holes for water to drain from</li>
    <li> Bought for use with retainers.</li>
    <li> Much better  than my old one. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I like being able to pick the color of my container. I understand the nature of plastics. However, even though this is a cheap little thing, I really did not appreciate the condition it arrived in, scratched on the top surface. It would cost more than the product to return it.</li>
    <li> Good little night guard cae.  Has ample room in it for upper and lower  I like the black color as it doesnt show dirt.  Opens and closes easily.  Works just fine.  I bought one for my whitening trays as well :)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a spare case to hold my invisalign braces and it does what it is supposed to do.  Snaps shut without issues and isn&#x27;t hard to open either.  Bought another for my mom.</li>
    <li> Does the job of keeping your aligners but could use a few small holes for ventilation</li>
    <li> this product was very useful for my needs and would strongly recommend to anyone who shares the same interest for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this so my son would have a spare case for his retainer. It is a very good case and fits well in a pocket.</li>
    <li> this things is great i last very long just keep in mind that you have to clean it frecuently</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t real expensive but not well made. Considering it looks like it probably will last about 2 months or less.  Maybe I will be pleasantly suprised.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I needed to protect my retainer when I am not wearing them. The retainer fits in well. Appears to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> I got this case to replace an old retainer case...It is nice and cheap, which is all I really needed.</li>
    <li> I have Clear Correct which is similar to Invisalign.  I was given two containers by my dentist, but didn&#x27;t like the rectangular shape.  I find this shape works well, and is easy to store in my purse.</li>
    <li> A little bigger than my Invisalign case but still a great color.</li>
    <li> My invisaligns didn&#x27;t actually fit in to these. I am a pretty normal sized person and my Invisaligns are about 1/4&amp;#34; longer (front to back) than this container can fit.</li>
    <li> Storage case was exactly like I wanted. I was scared it might be cheap, because of the low price, but when I got it I was surprised how sturdy it was. I got the item when they said I would and I will order it again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t meant to hold water or cleaning liquids in it so, take it from me and don&#x27;t put any liquids in it and take it along for travel. (obvious but I let it slip my mind..)</li>
    <li> Cheap and works great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> This hard plastic case is sturdy, solid, and just the right size for Invisaligns (or retainers), not too big, not too small. The snap-on closure is just right. Also reasonably priced, and a choice of several colors. This is the perfect \\&quot;extra case\\&quot; for Invisalign users who need a secondary case for work, for the office, or as a backup to keep inside your car (just in case you forgot to bring your primary case). No complaints whatsoever, a good buy.</li>
    <li> this was a very crappy retainer case. flimsy plastic and did not stay shut. all i need it to do is stay shut!</li>
    <li> I have opened and shut this many many times and it still works and the price is cheap too so I would buy again</li>
