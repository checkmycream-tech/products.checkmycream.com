      <li>Amazing color and quality.</li>
      <li>This wig is so amazing, let me just count the ways:&lt;br /&gt;-arrived on time</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice for a costume party ijs</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more for costume than fashion or good cosplay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice synthetic hair wig.</li>
      <li>Price is nice though.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
      <li>The wig came through to the mail in good time, and was well packaged and lovely upon opening.</li>
      <li>The company were really nice in compensating me&lt;br /&gt;with</li>
      <li>This wig is actually REALLY nice for the price I paid.</li>
      <li>The Kids played with it and liked it.</li>
      <li>im sure I will be just as happy with this one as all the others :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful in color, decent quality, and good cap size.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and the length is perfect.</li>
      <li>I love this wig so much it&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good wig for the price!</li>

      <li>I would&#x27;ve liked it a bit more darker.</li>
      <li>Looks good when take pictures but doesn&#x27;t look good in real life....</li>
      <li>This wig has beautiful gentle curls.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;ll deal with that over a product that i got quickly that wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and looks good.</li>
      <li>Bangs are a lot longer than I&#x27;d hoped but if you style it and get them to fall in a certain way, it&#x27;s very cute!</li>
      <li>as with all 5 of my x &amp; y angel wigs, they look best with a beanie or headband because there isn&#x27;t a very natural hairline on the top other than that they are perfect!</li>
      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not at all the color I was expecting, it&#x27;s more burgundy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible wig</li>
      <li>the picture is more like a  wine burgundy color..</li>
      <li>If you want a more wavy look separate the hair into two section, twist and spray</li>
      <li>and I received so many compliments on the color and style.</li>
      <li>I was able to get refunded.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The color isn&#x27;t the same as the picture. Its much to red for me. The company were really nice in compensating me&lt;br /&gt;with the returns. I order two of these wigs. The other one I loved it. The quality of the wig is ok for the money, and can&lt;br /&gt;be worn everday.</li>
    <li> Looks good when take pictures but doesn&#x27;t look good in real life.... Oh well...</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and the perfect color. Looks great with lolita and other fashions and is super cute!</li>
    <li> It was magenta.... and the cut was super cheap</li>
    <li> I love this wig. It&#x27;s soft and nice. But I sadly straightened it and it got natty so I made dread locks out of it and even then it looks good! I have three X&amp;Y wigs, and they&#x27;re my favorite wig compony.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good wig for the price! It&#x27;s very shiny and soft. The only cons are that it&#x27;s thinner than the picture suggests and it&#x27;s a little too shiny, so it definitely doesn&#x27;t look real. Also, I&#x27;d call the color copper with a hint of pink/wine, not wine red.</li>
    <li> So pretty. It&#x27;s not as full as it looks like in the picture, but I think I prefer thinner wigs. The colour is a tad bit redder that what I expected but not super fiery red.</li>
    <li> This wig is not as long as in the picture, and a different red tone to it.</li>
    <li> This wig has beautiful gentle curls. It&#x27;s very soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily. The color turns a very nice ginger in photographs but in person honestly looks very fake. Aside from the color being a little off I found that my wig had some awful kinks/ crimping at the top, and there&#x27;s nothing I can do about them because it isn&#x27;t a  heat resistant wig. I don&#x27;t know how common this is for this seller, but I have purchased two wigs from them so far and they both had this problem. This is probably a great wig to buy for photographs and possibly cosplay but probably not for every day use.</li>
    <li> i would not recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> The Wig&#x27;s color is really different than the picture, it has a more purple tone to it</li>
    <li> Thick and nice texture, but it&#x27;s definitely auburn/orange not a wine/maroon color.&lt;br /&gt;This could pass as a natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re expecting red wine or toward purple this isn&#x27;t that color. More orange/red/honey/ginger.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the beautiful red color it shows in the picture, it&#x27;s almost a dark brown with a hint of red.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig, especially for the price. It got here really fast too. Color matchs the picture and the hair is a very nice quality. Probably not as thick as the picture makes it look, but it&#x27;s not thin or anything. And it came with a wig cap!</li>
    <li> Great product. The only problem I have is the terrible tangle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosplayer so I&#x27;m always buying wigs of varying prices. I&#x27;ve had $60 wigs fall apart and not last 6 months. I was a little worried when I ordered this wig for 9 dollars but what the hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig came 3 weeks earlier than expected. The packaging was fine and the wig came with a wig cap, the wig cap came with a little tear along the seam but that&#x27;s no big deal I have a lot. The wig was soft and in the correct color. Not a lot of shine as opposed to most that I usually get. The bangs were a little crooked but that&#x27;s no big deal and an easy fix. The wig is full, and the wefts don&#x27;t show, it&#x27;s one of the more natural looking wigs I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore the wig for a couple of hours to see how it would hold up for a normal convention day. When I took it off there were hardly any tangles and when I brushed it almost none of the hair fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m very happy with the product and I&#x27;m very excited to wear it to Colossalcon in two months. I would recommend this product to anyone and to cosplayers.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect much from it due to its price and the company, but i thought i would give it a shot. It ended up more disappointing then i originally expected. Starting off the wig i received was NOT an X&amp;Y Angel wig. Or if it was there was not tag to prove it. It took over two months to get to me and the delivery date was changed three times after it said it was shipped. The color was more of a bright purple, not even close to wine red. It came just rolling around in the bag. No Hair net or anything to keep it together, so as you can imagine it was very very tangled. In my attempt to brush out the tangles huge chunks of hair pulled out. Even with finger combing and using a special extension and weave brush it fell out.  Once it got it combed through it would just shed and shed. After all of that i tried it on for just the hell of it and it looked so unnatural! Bangs looked like they were cut by a 2 yr old. It was so plastic looking and shiny, also IT ITCHED like crazy. Felt like i had a million bugs in my hair. Needless to say i WOULD NEVER recommend it to ANYONE EVER!! Save your money and time.</li>
    <li> Doesnt look like the photo, hard to style</li>
    <li> It is exactly like the picture color wise the only thing that&#x27;s different is the bangs need a slight trim!</li>
    <li> I love this wig, it is so beautiful. I used it for my Wendy (from Gravity Falls) cosplay. It was perfect for what I needed, and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Received my wig I like feels nice looks real I put some baby powder to reduced shine or dry shampoo but the wig does not look likr the picture is more like a  wine burgundy color..but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I love it! I only give it four stars though because it took about two months to get here. But the wig is perfect and beautiful :3</li>
    <li> I was mailed a cheap ass knock off that&#x27;s NOT from X&amp;Y Angel. Its trashy and worthless. Color is totally wrong and the cap shows through the wig. Took like a month and a half to arrive and was squeezed into a tiny little package. Super disappointed in this trash. Look up the wig from YOPO. It&#x27;s like gold whereas this one is like dog poop.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the color I expected. It&#x27;s definitely not my color! I have olive skin and was hoping for a darker red, but I do love it. It&#x27;s really good quality surprisingly!</li>
    <li> Excellent wig!  Very true to color.  In great shape and looks very natural when I put it on, right out of the bag!  I would buy this wig again.</li>
    <li> I live this wig!!! I will have a lot if fun wearing it!!</li>
    <li> I actually ended up giving this wig to my daughter because the color was not a good match for me. That being said it is GORGEOUS!!! The color is wine red, just as stated and the hair is absolutely beautiful with just the right amount of wave. It can take the heat of a low setting curling wand if you want to add some curl.</li>
    <li> Nice quality, the cut is like the picture, but the color was a little more orange than I thought it would be. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I wish this wig looked like the picture.  But ,  My. Husband. Loved the wig. !  So ,  I will keep it. !</li>
    <li> Worked well for Black Widow costume for Halloween</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who everyone bought this from, but the wig FutureTrend sent me is not the one in the picture. It&#x27;s more of a strawberry blond color and is extremely thin. The wig cap shows through. It&#x27;s not a terrible wig but it&#x27;s more for costume than fashion or good cosplay. You get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
    <li> The wig is very soft the curls are more like waves which is nice. However, it is very shiny until you treat it (by soaking it in a solution and/or adding baby powder). It&#x27;s a little on the thin side but it doesn&#x27;t shed that much. Contrary to most of the other pictures and reviews I&#x27;ve seen the wig I ordered wasn&#x27;t actually a ginger, orange/brown, or copper color, but more of a burgundy color so it seemed a a little more fake than I would have liked. The bangs were a little long, but don&#x27;t completely go over your eyes, which is nice. Besides the shine and the color, its a nice soft wig that doesn&#x27;t tangle easily. If you are looking for a wine red/burgundy color then I would recommend this wig, but if you were hoping for the color seen on the model, then this wig might not be for you</li>
    <li> This was not X&amp;Y at all. It was a dark, unnatural raspberry red colour with medium-quality fibers and wasn&#x27;t nearly as thick as the wig pictures. It was also shinier. Don&#x27;t buy your wigs from Amazon unless you like playing Russian Roulette with knockoffs.</li>
    <li> bangs were cut really  wide, but maybe its just how it sits on my head. might have to style it. also alot redder than i thought. but the curls are gorgeous and quality really really good for its price</li>
    <li> Very soft and pretty.  Dark burgundy color.</li>
    <li> Very thin and sheds a lot, no where even close to the display color it is very shiny and fake looking I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and soft. I would say its more auburn than wine red, like the color of a henna tattoo. It came within the time frame by registered mail beacause I ordered 4 from them. I can run my fingers through it and, though I havent worn this one yet, im sure I will be just as happy with this one as all the others :)</li>
    <li> It was a lot closer to purple than I wanted it to be, doesn&#x27;t really look natural like in the photos.....</li>
    <li> I give this 10 stars. You can curl, style and do whatever you like to this wig. I love it, love it, love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually in love with this wig. It looks amazing, totally worth it.</li>
    <li> The color and length were true to photo, but the straight across bangs would really only flatter a slim face. They did nothing for my round face.</li>
    <li> This wig came 1 week earlier then expected. I was super excited to open it. It came with a wig cap. It&#x27;s very soft and the length is perfect. It&#x27;s very natural looking and it fit my head perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love this wig and the only real thing i had to do was wait a month for it so i&#x27;ll deal with that over a product that i got quickly that wasn&#x27;t good.</li>
    <li> Wow. I love this wig. I brush it put it on and fell in love. It&#x27;s very true to the color and I simply adore it. As someone who hates her failing out young person hair every where this was amazing. It feels like real hair and looks like it I&#x27;ve New to wig buying but would so order again and again.</li>
    <li> This wig is not red more on the orange end, but not red like the pic...also I am a brown skinned female and this is for white women or a high yellow sister</li>
    <li> The wig was pretty. Hair was noce quality but cap is very small.</li>
    <li> She Loves wearing this . And . I love it too</li>
    <li> great wigs for costume and dress up. tangle easy and the bangs are freakishly long, i trim them or pull them back</li>
    <li> This wig is adorable and people always tell me how beautiful my hair is when I wear it! as with all 5 of my x &amp; y angel wigs, they look best with a beanie or headband because there isn&#x27;t a very natural hairline on the top other than that they are perfect!</li>
    <li> It came really early. it&#x27;s really nice and is soft too. my only problem is that the wig cap on the inside is starting to become unraveled</li>
    <li> Be Careful !!  The wig color is NOTHING like the color in the picture. The wig is long and decent enough texture for cosplay, but the wine red it states for the color is actually a dark purple and black. There&#x27;s NO RED in it at all.  Notice the picture is of a very pretty red/ginger/dark copper color.</li>
    <li> Total fraud. Don&#x27;t buy this wig, it is extremely thin and falling part and NOT a X&amp;Y wig. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Seller was great product not quite as pictured.</li>
    <li> The hair is very soft and fits comfortably. However, color is way off from photos. It is not a natural color at all - more burgundy. Also, it looks great in indirect light, however if you are under a direct light that is not diffused, it is really shiny like a doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> The color is very nice but the hair could be thicker.</li>
    <li> Its Red. The Kids played with it and liked it. Looks Good. Halloween My wife used it and nobody knew her</li>
    <li> I love this wig! So realistic, great quality and fashionable. I received this and all my wigs from this company on time. I&#x27;m Drag queen and I received so many compliments on the color and style. I recommend buying wig spray and wig brush to lossen it up. The curl pattern doesn&#x27;t fall out and can be easy restore by twisting it in the curl formation. If you want a more wavy look separate the hair into two section, twist and spray let it sit for 15 minutes. You use the brush to keep a straight top and bottom half wavy or curly. You&#x27;ll love this wig!  Totally forgot, you&#x27;ll have to cut the bangs, they were too long.,</li>
    <li> Well, the color isn&#x27;t exactly as advertised. But it is still a pretty wig, although my only disappointment was the color.&lt;br /&gt;It was a very red red. Other then that, it&#x27;s okay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Mei</li>
    <li> A little too tight on the head</li>
    <li> This is a great wig for the cost, very thick and full and soft. it fits great and looks almost natural</li>
    <li> Yeeeeeeees I love it must purchase again ....beautiful wig I must say !!!!all smiles my way !!</li>
    <li> Bit darker than photo, but definitely wine red like the description says, which I expected. Totally fine by me.&lt;br /&gt;I cut it myself after I got it to fit my own style, and I love to wear it with a beanie, super cute! It looks good without it too, though.</li>
    <li> Con: Color varies widely between units (see other reviews).&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Cheap, looks nice, easy fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I maintain my hair in a pixie cut for convenience, but miss the dolled-up feeling of long hair. This wig does the trick and makes me feel glamorous. The already-styled bangs are long and needed trimming. My unit arrived as a bright burgundy or wine, a lot less coppery than I had hoped, but still pretty. It is not a naturally occurring color.</li>
    <li> Good looking. But this is closer to an Ariel color rather than a dark auburn red color. Had to cut the bangs too. But the wig looks okay. Just the color difference</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful in color, decent quality, and good cap size. I would definitely recommend the copper wig!</li>
    <li> The color came out a bit more purple wine than I expected from the picture, but it is really pretty and easy to wear.</li>
    <li> The colour was way dark- almost near my black hair! I wanted a drastic change and was sorely disappointed. .</li>
    <li> not the same exact color wanted like the pic but quality nice and the color grew on me &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> It is definitely a wine red, not a natural looking color but very pretty. It is very shiny and not as full as it looks in the picture. It would make a great costume or party wig and young women and girls might not mind the unnatural color to wear every day since a lot of them dye their hair similar colors.  Definitely 5 stars for the price. I was not expecting to get a $200 wig for less than 10 dollars.</li>
    <li> My husband enjoyed the wig on me.</li>
    <li> I have yet to be disappointed by an X&amp;Y ANGEL wig. great quality for the price. never does the wig cap show through but the wigs aren&#x27;t overly full. love the color, just as pictured. wig caps do run on the big side, but I&#x27;m not complaining; I do have a large head.</li>
    <li> This item is gorgeous, it looks like the photo but the color was off. Mine was Brown and only came out a tint of red in the sunlight, which I personally don&#x27;t find a problem.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a natural looking reddish brown color then you found it.</li>
    <li> Love this unit. The color is almost exactly as it appears in the picture maybe just a tad bit lighter. It feels so soft and silky and the fit is just right. Definitely a worrthy purchase.</li>
    <li> The wig is soft, seems really good quality and looks just like the picture. The shipping was fast and arrived sooner than expected. It looks so real, I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> i Love it thank you so much get to dangled for my taste tho</li>
    <li> Love it!!! This is such a great deal.  It&#x27;s really beautiful and high quality and looks like it&#x27;s my real hair and not a wig.  It took about 2 1/2 weeks to deliver to MN.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Its perfect, its soft, light on the head and thick. looks natural and real.</li>
    <li> I received it early, and the color looks natural. I really like it, however it doesn&#x27;t fit! It is the perfect size for my young daughter it looks great on her. Very disappointed :(</li>
    <li> This wig is actually REALLY nice for the price I paid. It looks exactly like the wig worn by the model in the photo. It&#x27;s thick, has plenty of hair in the back, and doesn&#x27;t shed nearly as bad as I expected. I bought a few other cheap wigs from a different brand and they suck. Not all X&amp;Y ANGEL wigs are perfect, but I&#x27;d recommend them over other similarly priced brands.</li>
    <li> absolutely beautiful I love it especially the color!!!!</li>
    <li> Great. Not the same color as the picture but that might just be the computer screen. Great over all</li>
    <li> Really love this wig! Beautiful color, looks natural - not too shiny. Has great body and curl. Can&#x27;t see the tracks, looks very good on. Very happy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what you pay for not very good quality it&#x27;s nice for a costume party ijs I wear wigs all the time I even sleep in them this one never...!!!!the sun heat it up</li>
    <li> Love this wig! It gives me a chance to change up my look after treatment. It arrived safely and will be worn soon. Shipping was amazingly fast!</li>
    <li> Long, beautiful red hair. I loved it!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good quality for the price! The hair tracks are sewn down against the scalp cap and it is not large enough to cover all of one&#x27;s head, so it&#x27;s difficult to style it into any sort of up-do. You can, however, curl it with rollers or pincurls and hairspray (I wouldn&#x27;t advice using any sort of heat on it as it is not real hair). It&#x27;s not the most realistic wig, but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> This wig is great quality. It&#x27;s not thin like other inexpensive wigs.  I decided to add on to this review. I have had this wig for about a year and a half. I only wear it occasionally. It got slightly tangled, so I decided to brush it out. Brushing the wig caused it to shed quite a good bit and left the hair kind of frizzy. I washed the wig and conditioned it well, and now it looks good as new. I would still definitely recommend this wig.

    <li> The color of the hair was 10 times brighter than the actual color in the picture I ordered and the hair was not human like they said it was , heat burns the hair</li>
    <li> Very cute wig! By far better then I was hoping for!</li>
    <li> Had to trim bangs, wig slips a lot.</li>
    <li> Mine was insanely thin, it was more light brown than red, it&#x27;s super poofy and frizzy and it sheds like crazy... it&#x27;s decent, i can use it, it just isnt what i wanted. it looked literally nothing like the picture....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE it - The color is a little off from the picture - but other than that - it&#x27;s great!!! I had to cut the bangs but it&#x27;s full and comfortable!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent wig and is a bit redder than the picture. It&#x27;s really shiny and takes a bit of tailoring to get it to look like what&#x27;s in the picture. However you are getting what you paid for. I would save my money for a more natural wig (if that&#x27;s the look you were aiming for). If not then this wig is better for quick halloween or cosplay in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I look like a red headed Zooey Deshanel in this, the cut is exactly like Zooey&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I got this wig a year ago (super late post). But I really loved it the only Thing I was bummed about was the color I was so hoping that it would have been that beautiful red in the picture but instead it was a red wine color (didn&#x27;t see that it said it at the time) but when I got it and put it on I loved it! I had to cut the bangs because they were to long (but who didn&#x27;t have to) but none the less it wasn&#x27;t super thin and everyone kept telling me that it looked like real hair. Which was a bonus fir me :)</li>
    <li> I give it three stars because overall I did like the product, but the color wasn&#x27;t close to that of the picture. The color I received was a more literal wine red. It came on time though and has a good wig cap (not one of the tiny caps). It has a shine but nothing that can&#x27;t be dealt with by using baby powder or dry shampoo.</li>
    <li> I got my wig this morning and fell in love with it! its beautiful,soft and the exact same color as the wig in the photo!</li>
    <li> This wig is adorable! A little to shiny though but hey it was cheap. Also the color of the wig is a little less red than the pictures shown. But I still love it and it is very soft.</li>
    <li> The wig came through to the mail in good time, and was well packaged and lovely upon opening. However, I guess it&#x27;s always true: you get what you pay for. This wig was no longer presentable in the least after one day of use.&lt;br /&gt;The strands tore easily, and it even arrived to me with both of the sizing hooks missing :/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d consider this buy again.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price but the color is way different than what it shows.</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful and natural looking. one thing that suprised me was how very close it is to my own hair color. not quite as bright copper as the picture (i viewed it on a few monitors) but a distinct natural red head look. everyone thought i had extentions onand had no idea it was a full wig. because of the match i am able to pull my hairline out and create a natural hairline in the front like i do with my black wig. shipped within the timeframe, I am very pleased with this wig.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wig. The color is a tiny bit lighter than what I expected not by much, but I still find it to be very beautiful.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very silky wig, and the shine isn&#x27;t too much.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs will need to be trimmed unless you have a very large forehead.&lt;br /&gt;The waves are bigger so they don&#x27;t get tangled very easily.&lt;br /&gt;The net is a pretty good quality,and bends to the shape of your head well.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a wig cap too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;The wig is not good for daily wear, but it&#x27;s great if you have a few wigs and you don&#x27;t rely on one wig.&lt;br /&gt;The net is a bit itchy, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this wig if you have buzzed hair or hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;The color is much more brown-red and neutral toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;VERY happy with my purchase, it came 5 days early and I will buy from this brand again!</li>
    <li> Bangs are a lot longer than I&#x27;d hoped but if you style it and get them to fall in a certain way, it&#x27;s very cute! I love the color and my husband absolutely LOVES it!! Would definitely recommend! I was hesitant due to the very cheap price but it&#x27;s better than most expensive wigs I&#x27;ve bought!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Very curly and love it! Bangs were long but a trim fixed it. They&#x27;re synthetic Im not sure how it applys to heat but if you do try a strip and put it on low. The color in the picture is a bit off. Its more or a red wine and a little darker. But other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> cant rate a product i dont have</li>
    <li> This product sucks. Don&#x27;t waste your money. If you don&#x27;t have a tiny head then don&#x27;t buy this product. Plus it looks super fake and you can see the tracks. No amount of powder will make this thing look real.</li>
    <li> Color is little different then picture, but still great!</li>
    <li> I really like it, although it&#x27;s nothing like my other X &amp; Y Angel wig, it&#x27;s lighter, and came in a different package... it also doesn&#x27;t have a tag for it inside.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not at all the color I was expecting, it&#x27;s more burgundy.</li>
    <li> This wig is so amazing, let me just count the ways:&lt;br /&gt;-arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;-is prestyled (and well done!! It has light wavy curls and straight accross bangs just like the picture)&lt;br /&gt;-is a beautiful colour (a deep aburn true to the picture)&lt;br /&gt;-and it looks really natural!&lt;br /&gt;Really, this is insanely good quality for what you pay, I highly recomend.</li>
    <li> The people are very kind and answer any questions I had. Would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> The wig received was NOT the color in the photo; it was a much brighter, much more artificial red color. I know that colors may vary due to monitor settings and all hat, but no one on Earth could have this as a natural hair color. Besides that, the wig was well made and thick enough to look natural (outside of the color). By the end of the day, it was frizzy and a bit tangled, but that was easily solved with a gentle brushing. If this wig was available in a more subdued, natural looking red, I would purchase it.</li>
    <li> looks just like the picture very nice I actually order 3 wigs from this seller delivery was fast coming from China will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I love this wig so much it&#x27;s my favorite! Please watch my review on YouTube! !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch &amp;#34;X&amp;Y Angel Wig Review&amp;#34; on YouTube&lt;br /&gt;X&amp;Y Angel Wig Review: http://youtu.be/0jxDa79RTgU&lt;br /&gt;☆Mï$$ Aųťůmņ☆</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive this wig having already bought from X&amp;Y Angel, however this wig was not legit. Completely the wrong color, terrible quality, and very thin. The cap was made of a black mesh and barley fit my head (it&#x27;s pretty small) I was able to get refunded. Just look out for an official X&amp;Y Angel tag inside the cap to make sure it is real.</li>
    <li> overall so far it&#x27;s been great. my friends love it on me. the color is rich and true to the photo, it&#x27;s nice and soft. it&#x27;s nearly exactly like the photo. it came a day earlier than i expected, so overnight. they included a wig cap. the only downside was it had a slight smell, it wasn&#x27;t bad but wasn&#x27;t pleasant either. i hairs prayed mine into place so that was quickly resolved!</li>
    <li> Love this wig!!  It is gorgeous and well made.  The adjustment straps help to customize it to any head.  Beautiful color!</li>
    <li> Amazing color and quality. The bangs were slightly too long, but it was not difficult to trim them.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and looks good. It&#x27;s a bit lighter than the red in the picture.</li>
    <li> This is a costume wig. Don&#x27;t expect realism. From some of the other reviews I thought it would be a deep red but the one I received is that pinky red. Think April O&#x27;Neil from the original TMNT cartoon. It is soft but too shiny.</li>
    <li> Is more of a wine colour and the hair falls out. However I don&#x27;t know how to take care of a wig and the ends are now frizzy. I just put in braids and put on a beanie and it looks pretty good. Price is nice though.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this is not an authentic X&amp;Y wig... not only are they made better, but X&amp;Y put a label on their wigs so you know you are getting the brand.  Sad.</li>
    <li> its too thin i can see the wig cap through it and its not the right color i expected a fiery red and got an orangy-brown i hate it</li>
    <li> I would rate it less if I could, I am very dissapointing, the color I got was bright bright red, and not long at all, I was so dissapointing I didn&#x27;t even try it on.</li>
    <li> It is not the color in the picture.  More like strawberry blonde.</li>
    <li> This is now my favourite wig.  Love, LOVE the colour, the length,  it&#x27;s just wavy enough.  It stays in place with no hassle, is as light as it could logically be.  It&#x27;s better than, but very close to the picture.  It makes me look healthy!  DOES ANYONE KNOW OF ANY OTHER WIGS OF THIS COLOUR?  I would so much appreciate a long straight one.  I just ordered another of this as a spare.  And the price!  You get much more than you pay for with this pretty, flattering, well-made wig.  Hard to believe they could do such a great job with synthetic.</li>
    <li> love the product and got here fast and glad that it came with a wig cap.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful and I feel so sexy wearing it.</li>
    <li> great item AAAAA++++++</li>
    <li> My mom loves this thing ! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The wig came on time. It&#x27;s a nice synthetic hair wig. I love it but the color is a bit too brassy. I would&#x27;ve liked it a bit more darker.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absolutely adorable! It is a bit shiny but other than that, it&#x27;s a great wig for the price.</li>
