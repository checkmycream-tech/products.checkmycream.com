      <li>I like this product, good for my african american hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month with nothing really positive to say about it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is a long list of ingredients, mostly vitamins.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and texture,i love the way it makes my natural hair(I&#x27;m African American) feel.</li>

      <li>I had high hopes for this product to help restore my thinning edges.</li>
      <li>Overall its a good product but may not be a solution for women needing a solution to re-grow hair due Alopecia or stress related hair loss.</li>

      <li>I guess I was looking for a magic elixir, so I&#x27;m not a good review to gauge this product.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s for long term growth</li>
      <li>Works very well, especially in combination with the topical treatment, shampoo and conditioner.  </li>

<li> Couldn&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s for long term growth</li>
<li> Works very well, especially in combination with the topical treatment, shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
<li> This has been a long three year journey to grow my hair back after the birth of my child.  </li>
<li> I had thining hair and plus due to the stress of wearing pony tails, I was starting to lose hair in the middle part of my hair.</li>
<li> Taking too long to work</li>
<li> I also suggest the  Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil line for ppl with dry damaged hair...</li>
<li> I wear my hair braided (micro) and it helps keeps my hair and scalp from feeling dry and itchy, reduces breakage and increases growth.</li>
<li> The thinning stopped abt the same time and noticed hair growing were the thinning had previously been.</li>
<li> It is much thicker and the areas where it had thin</li>
<li> I can not really rate</li>
<li> However, the second time, I can say it is almost destroying my hair.</li>
<li> I tried do- grow growth oil,nioxin and other products to reverse the damage done to my temples</li>
<li> but I have not seen this for spots where I have lost hair due to stress (crown area).</li>
<li> I began to use Profectiv Growth Renew products and within a few weeks,I noticed limited breakage and within 6 weeks, NO breakage.</li>
<li> PG is a form of mineral oil, an alcohol produced by fermentation of yeast and carbohydrates.&lt;br /&gt;Though cancer might not be a concern, it was also found that PG provoked allergic reactions in patients with eczema and other skin allergies, even in formulations of much less than 50%.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Ok,personally I don&#x27;t write reviews but due to the fact that I bought this hair cream based on some people&#x27;s reviews that it grew there hair and bla bla!</li>
<li> I typically use it at night before bed or during the day if I am staying home.</li>
<li> but I believe that I will have achieved my results in about half the time at the rate of growth that im seeing..</li>
<li> In fact, I think Dr. Miracle and the Edges of the Olive brand break hair off a little.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks.</li>
<li> waste of time and money.</li>
<li> I noticed after a few days the spots began to fill in.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even tried the Profectiv line(no lye perms,conditioners and anti breakage creams) and wasn&#x27;t pleased at all  and have been very disappointed in the lack of results.</li>
<li> I have used this product in the past and it works for me.  </li>
<li> I had a difficult time finding this product in stores.</li>
<li> It has been difficult to find in stores</li>
<li> Try it, you will not be sorry!</li>
<li> It was extremely painful.</li>
<li> How dumb do you think we are!!!</li>

    <li> I am always weary about trying products that suggest \\&quot;growth\\&quot; of any kind.... I tried do- grow growth oil,nioxin and other products to reverse the damage done to my temples/edges from micro braid wearing.I&#x27;ve even tried the Profectiv line(no lye perms,conditioners and anti breakage creams) and wasn&#x27;t pleased at all  and have been very disappointed in the lack of results. I was concerned that I may have alopecia even. However I decided to give Profectiv another try and I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently (once in the morning, and once before going to bed) on my temples and edges (paired with the organic root stimulator products)and I already see hair fuzz in areas where it was literally bald! The advertisement suggests you use it for 6 mos for results.. but I believe that I will have achieved my results in about half the time at the rate of growth that im seeing..I&#x27;m going to continue to use to see how it goes....there is hope for my edges after all....I also suggest the  Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil line for ppl with dry damaged hair... it has done wonders for my hair growth journey I use this every day[[ASIN:B000UUQZNG Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Moisturizing Hair Lotion]]! I also use the no lye perms.. the deep conditioner and the neutralizing shampoo....I will never use another product again....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks.I love it! I bought it because my hair has fallen out and i have bald patches.Coincidence maybe,but my bald patches have hair since i started using.I love the scent and texture,i love the way it makes my natural hair(I&#x27;m African American) feel.Looks like it has been permed,it feels and looks great.So far so good.Love. Love.</li>
    <li> Ok,personally I don&#x27;t write reviews but due to the fact that I bought this hair cream based on some people&#x27;s reviews that it grew there hair and bla bla! Well I used this diligently for a month to try to grow my edges and I did not see any difference! Infact I have a feeling it broke off some of the hair! Reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was ok as a moisturizer for my hair,made my hair shine that&#x27;s all. This is just your regular hair moisturizer,don&#x27;t expect any growth!</li>
    <li> I have natural \\&quot;African-American\\&quot; hair. I bought this product (Profectiv Growth Renew Root Recovery Stimulant) based on the reviews it received. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month with nothing really positive to say about it. If you just need something to groom your hair so it&#x27;s all neat and in tact, then you can try this product. But then why pay so much to get a hair tamer? The only thing this product did was to create a huge amount of build up in my hair and left me with flaky scalp. Suffice to say, I don&#x27;t think there is any positive in using this product and highly doubt I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. It seems to be working. I can see fine hairs starting to grow. The only thing I see that I don&#x27;t like is the greasiness of the product. I typically use it at night before bed or during the day if I am staying home. All in all its a great buy</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 3 months, didn&#x27;t see much improvement, will continue to use, i may not have have given it enough  time.</li>
    <li> This has been my second order.  Trying it the first time I found out that there was improvement in my hair texture and growth.  However, the second time, I can say it is almost destroying my hair.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 3 stars.  I can not really rate it&#x27;s effectiveness, because I can not use it.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product about 2 weeks ago. My scalp would tingle upon application. However, hours later my scalp would itch and burn.  It was extremely painful. I washed my hair, exfoliated my scalp and used Phillip B Rejuvenating Oil. After a day, the itching and burning stopped. I didn&#x27;t use the product for two days. After the two days, I applied the product and got the same results, itching and burning. I could not understand why a vitamin based product was causing this issue. I looked for reviews and could find no one else complaining of this problem. I finally went online to get a list of ingredients in the product.&lt;br /&gt;There is a long list of ingredients, mostly vitamins. The one ingredient that caught my attention was Propylene Glycol. So, I researched it. This is an excerpt from naturalnews.com&#x27;s review of this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;PG is a toxin regardless of which strength is used. PG is a form of mineral oil, an alcohol produced by fermentation of yeast and carbohydrates.&lt;br /&gt;Though cancer might not be a concern, it was also found that PG provoked allergic reactions in patients with eczema and other skin allergies, even in formulations of much less than 50%.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I have skin allergies.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed. I had high hopes for this product to help restore my thinning edges. I can not use minoxidil, because I am allergic to that as well.</li>
    <li> I had a difficult time finding this product in stores. Thanks to Amazon I found exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Taking too long to work</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It&#x27;s exactly as described and does wonders for my scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a product to stimulate hair growth...then this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I will be using this as a leave in on my hair I have always loved the brand and have used for years.I&#x27;m expecting good result from this product for breakage</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 years. I wear my hair braided (micro) and it helps keeps my hair and scalp from feeling dry and itchy, reduces breakage and increases growth. It has been difficult to find in stores so I order from Amazon mostly. Profectiv states this product will regrow hair but I have not seen this for spots where I have lost hair due to stress (crown area). I also noticed my scalp turns white when my scalp is sweating so I have to wash it out or remove with a towel. Overall its a good product but may not be a solution for women needing a solution to re-grow hair due Alopecia or stress related hair loss.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference when I used this. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Did not work.  Use Castor Oil.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. I love this product. I used it before when I came out of my weave and had traction alopecia. I&#x27;m using it this time for hair loss after putting a relaxer in. This product really works.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best hair care products on the market. I have used this product for about six months and the product truly works. I had thining hair and plus due to the stress of wearing pony tails, I was starting to lose hair in the middle part of my hair. I used this product and in one month, not only did I start seeing results, but the thinning of the hair started to thicken. The bald spot in my hair started to grow longer and fuller. Now, to my surprise, I have longer and thicker hair which I had back in the day. I go to Walmart and basically stock up on this product. I am a african american women, and take it from me, this product definitely works!</li>
    <li> Just came today and have tried it once. We like it be cue it can be used by mn o omn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months. I&#x27;ve never missed a day. I use it in the morning and at night making sure my edges never go dry. I put just a little bit of water on my edges first and then apply the renew, it seems to absorb better that way. In three months my front and back edged grew 2 1/2 inch. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This product is really helping my edges, I love the smell also, Wonderful product an I would recommend it to anyone who needs help with their hair growth.</li>
    <li> Shocking but this product is amazing, works to stop thinning hair  problem and will cause hair to grow faster and continue to grow.  Been using it for over a year.  Smells great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This product is a &#x27;miracle cure&#x27; aka &#x27;medicine in a jar&#x27;. I started to experience some breakage and thinning over a year ago.I began to use Profectiv Growth Renew products and within a few weeks,I noticed limited breakage and within 6 weeks, NO breakage. The thinning stopped abt the same time and noticed hair growing were the thinning had previously been. I also used the feather lite or regular Profectiv Growth Renew Growth Restoration Oil Stimulant abt 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently started using their shampoo. All work great. My hair is back to normal &amp; healthy. I get my hair cut or ends clipped abt once every 2 months. Great product, try it ;o)</li>
    <li> Great product.  I saw thicker hair growth around edges. I would buy again.  Give it 2 weeks before you make up your mind.</li>
    <li> I had to send back.  I thought it was for a different use than what it was.  I cannot rate it honestly because I couldn&#x27;t use the product. Received as expected and was in good condition when received.</li>
    <li> It is Ok don&#x27;t know about the hair growth part but it does loosens up your braids so it semi works</li>
    <li> I love this product because it does what it says it does. I started using it just three months ago and I already noticed the change in my hair. It is much thicker and the areas where it had thin the hair has begun to grow back. I will continue to purchase this product. Janie De Coster author of What My Sister Didn&#x27;t Know.</li>
    <li> I have Alopecia and I honestly thought that this would help with my receding hair line, but I guess I was looking for a magic elixir, so I&#x27;m not a good review to gauge this product.</li>
    <li> So excited to try a product that got so many great reviews!!!!!!!!!!!! It smells great and goes on very easy, Hope it works!!!!</li>
    <li> My edges was thinning a lot and I started using growth renew about two weeks and I&#x27;m already seeing a difference even my daughter told me my edges are getting thicker. This is a great product already ordered a second jar.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It really works!  I&#x27;ve tried many magic potions, lotions, weaves and even have gone the natural way without success.  This has been a long three year journey to grow my hair back after the birth of my child.  I lost a great deal at the crown and have always had thinning at the temples.  All I can say is WOW!!!  It is all growing back.  I began to see results after 1 month of faithful application.  Try it, you will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I used Miracle and Olive oil brands but they did not work that well.  In fact, I think Dr. Miracle and the Edges of the Olive brand break hair off a little.  I have only used this a couple of times and I like the texture.  It appears to working already.  I will definitely keep using this product and monitor my outcome.  However for now I think it is great.</li>
    <li> I got this  in a speedy amount of time and i really havent seen any change in the hair but it was with the try</li>
    <li> I have use this product a couple of time when my hair was falling out because of stress. I can tell you in a couple of weeks my hair was growing back. I love this product. It smell wonderful not to greasy or anything. if you want your hair to grow use it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product January 2, 2015 &amp; I got it on January 8, 2015 so shipping was really fast for me I think. Product came nicely packaged. I love the smell of it, smells really fresh and minty, just started using the product today and I&#x27;ll see how it goes. I recommend everyone to order from this seller.</li>
    <li> this is not intended for MPB and will do nothing to help. waste of time and money. stay away from it.</li>
    <li> Works very well, especially in combination with the topical treatment, shampoo and conditioner.  Nice smell to it. ,can be used with weave styles too!</li>
    <li> this works, all my hair were falling out, because when i am stress i pick out my hair, so the remaining at the side and back tend to fall out, after apply twice daily, after three weeks, my hair side and balm that is the lining at the back is totally grown back.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t yet know if the stuff works, I doubt it, but there are two different people in the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; photos. COME ON!! How dumb do you think we are!!! The ear shape of the two women are totally different. The only thing that looks the same is the earring hahahaha!! Bastards. I have a feeling the placebo effect is what works here coupled with better general hair maintenance. Disappointed because I&#x27;m not as stupid as the company thinks I am.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I had to discontinue use when my hair started to come out.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and it works for me.  I had originally purchased this product from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply Store in 2010.</li>
    <li> I am a product junky so again I thought I would try something else to keep my bald spots at bay.  This really does work.  I noticed after a few days the spots began to fill in.  Couldn&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s for long term growth but it does work to keep your edges from balding from braids and weaves.</li>
    <li> It smells really good but I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth in my hair. However, it definitely gives my hair some shine.</li>
    <li> I like this product, good for my african american hair</li>
</ol>
