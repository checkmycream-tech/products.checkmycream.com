      <li>Overall, the entire thing works great.</li>
      <li>** BROKE THE FIRST USE..</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it was intended to do.  </li>
      <li>Just used it for the first time</li>
      <li>People with sensitive skin might want a soft material, but I love it.</li>
      <li>easy to use, bought it for my boyfriend who does not like the &#x27;girly&#x27; back brushes you find at stores.</li>
      <li>Easy to reach my back.</li>
      <li>Works fine, but won&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy and just as the ad promised.</li>
      <li>Makes it much easier to scrub.  </li>
      <li>Works very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
      <li>This item was everything very thing I expected and more.  </li>
      <li>Previously I had an itchy back and didn&#x27;t have the good fortune to have someone who could remedy that situation.</li>
      <li>On this scrubber she uses a Neutrogena body wash to help with blemishes, and it scrubs all the oils out and off of her back, helping her skin stay clear and free of any flare ups.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
      <li>Does a good job getting at those hard to get at spots (i.e., back, feet, etc.).</li>
      <li>I thought it would be too soft, but I&#x27;m really quite pleasantly surprised at how well it works.</li>
      <li>This exfoliating back scrubber is exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
      <li>Gets those hard to reach places and feels amazing on your back.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find my item was  delivered on Sunday.</li>
      <li>Long enough to easily wrap around my back and scrub away!</li>
      <li>The loofah is not too soft or rough on the skin, just the right texture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft enough to not scrape the skin, but still has enough texture so that it can scrub skin really well and help clear pours.</li>
      <li>Was delivered on time (actually a day before I expected it) and is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
      <li>This is great for my teen who&#x27;s skin is extra oily right now and was in desperate need of something to help scrub the oils and such from her back.</li>
      <li>A bit smaller than I expected, but the construction seems reasonable for the price paid.</li>

    <li> Cheaply made.  The thin rope handles one broke off while in use.</li>
    <li> This exfoliating back scrubber is exactly what I hoped it would be.  I ordered it to replace one purchased in Tarpon Springs, FL. years ago and it is perfect. I recommend it to any one looking for one with great exfoliating capabilities without being too harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time and I love it! Arrived early and safely, with no damage!</li>

    <li> Very nice loofah scrubber. Feels really good using it on my back. Very nicely made and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great! The loofah part is quite abrasive without hurting the skin. I thought it would be too soft, but I&#x27;m really quite pleasantly surprised at how well it works. Overall, the entire thing works great. However, I am taking off one star because the loofah section needs to be longer than it is.</li>
    <li> Works well enough. A bit smaller than I expected, but the construction seems reasonable for the price paid.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find my item was  delivered on Sunday. This item was everything very thing I expected and more.  Makes me feel as if I just had a massage.</li>

    <li> Great product. Took a while to get to me but well worth waiting for. Previously I had an itchy back and didn&#x27;t have the good fortune to have someone who could remedy that situation. Now all is well, thank you America.</li>
    <li> I love using this scrubber</li>

    <li> Works like it&#x27; supposed to!</li>
    <li> This is perfect to reach your back in the shower.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is well made and works great for back washing, I had a brush but it kept falling off the handle while using it.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I use it daily.  Holds up to usage well.  Makes it much easier to scrub.  I&#x27;ll buy this again when I wear it out.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, but I expect more.</li>
    <li> S*** BROKE THE FIRST USE..SMH CHEAP</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. The length is perfect for me and the loofah section works great. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on how it &amp;#34;holds up&amp;#34;...but so far; so good.</li>
    <li> Almost like having a shower mate!</li>
    <li> Hard, scratchy, loose pieces. I washed it a few times to see if it would loosen up, no still very stiff.</li>
    <li> Good for those hard-to-reach spots!  It comes with a small suction cup, I presume for hanging it up in the shower, though I hang mine to dry on a the towel rack.</li>
    <li> The scrubber is very long, but the loofah part is quite think and too short, only about 1 foot.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Highly recommended.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love thus product. Gets those hard to reach places and feels amazing on your back.</li>
    <li> Loofah is just the right roughness</li>

    <li> Loved it! Just what I wanted. More importantly, just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the Loofah section was very small.</li>
    <li> Loofah part of scrubber is wonderful.  Feels absolutely great on my back.  Would like to see thicker handles on ends.  What you get is too thin and cuts into your hand when using.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised but needs to be wider.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this back scrubber and uses it daily!</li>
    <li> Was delivered on time (actually a day before I expected it) and is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
