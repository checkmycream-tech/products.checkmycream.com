      <li>In all the set up is fairly nice, I haven&#x27;t had to many problems.</li>
      <li>and i love the product def.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal.  </li>
      <li>the kit needs a better power source.</li>
      <li>its all ok</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>The DVD was bogus for the most part.</li>
      <li>The Four Gun Tattoo Kit Tattoo Machine Gun Kit By Fancier S-T01 had very fast shipping came as advertised and worked great, the DVD is Funny</li>
      <li>We are very satisfied with our purchase, and also the shipping was VERY timely</li>
      <li>guns run smooth.</li>
      <li>The guns are nice and function very well.</li>
      <li>, the inks are cheap and run a bit but are usable with patience.</li>
      <li>you might also want to research your state&#x27;s laws, regulations and legalities concerning licensing before you begin any kind of undertaking to protect yourself from any legal actions in case you make a grave error.</li>
      <li>is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>This is one of the fastest and worry free co. I have seen</li>
      <li>I would say if you are looking for a cheap kit</li>
      <li>Delivery was on time, everything was included like advertised, I did not use the ink I&#x27;m uncertain of how safe it is... other than that all machinery works great.</li>
      <li>My husband couldn&#x27;t wait, did his first tattoo the other night, and was very happy with the materials.</li>
      <li>but good enough for beginners and practicing techniques.</li>
      <li>Good for starting up.</li>
      <li>As a starter kit not bad for the price</li>
      <li>Your best bet (short of knowing an artist and doing your apprenticeship)  is to watch countless youtube videos before you get this.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly...</li>
      <li>Within the first couple weeks (Beginner Tattooist) I have used the kit on practice skins and have done one tattoo on a \\&quot;vonlunteer\\&quot;, already my kit is paid for from that one tattoo!.  </li>
      <li>The fact that this has multiple guns was kind of useful except that one of my guns just does not work.</li>
      <li>i was so excited to recieve the tatoo Kit but very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>In general, I love this kit.</li>
      <li>The price was well below the range I was willing to spend, so I took a chance and bought it.  </li>
      <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>The kit itself is great, The ink in this kit sucks, suggestion to buy 5 star ink at the time of purchase of kit</li>
      <li>It was exactly what is was supposed to be.</li>
      <li>all is good but one was missing a gun</li>
      <li>The instructional DVD is not bad, but could be more detailed at least for beginner&#x27;s sake</li>
      <li>Overall, I enjoy this kit very much</li>
      <li>Came exactly as described, all well packaged and decent quality, worked out of the box, only suggestion is to get some higher quality ink for work on skin, fantastic kit for beginner.</li>
      <li>gift for daughter,she loves it ,thanks</li>
      <li>the ink is SOOO cheap you have to go over the Same tatoo 3 Times to try to get the colored ink to stay.</li>
      <li>and you can buy that machine works grate very well</li>
      <li>very upset....</li>
      <li>Like for real.</li>
      <li>Overall not bad for the price</li>
      <li>but again I suggest that you research the wide variety of tattoo kits available and find one that suits your particular needs.</li>
      <li>but I suggest thorough research before you make any kind of purchase on this type of item and to consider any form of health issues that your subject may have such as diabetes or hemophellia.</li>
      <li>Everything was brand spanking new.</li>
      <li>This kit comes very complete</li>
      <li>, I think due to the screw being too short, but that should be an easy fix with a replacement screw.  </li>
      <li>The ink is holding up so far, waiting to see if it fades.</li>
      <li>but I ended up having to order a new one after only 4 uses.</li>
      <li>the kit got here 3 days early, not only that</li>
      <li>So far this seems to be the only issue I had aside from personal preferences.</li>
      <li>The training video is substandard and will only play on older DVD players due to the fact that the program language written for newer DVD players will not recognize this disc.</li>

<li> for first tatto was crazy we use to have a home made and later we chose to buy a real one</li>
<li> I received the kit in less than a week, halfway around the world, no less.  </li>
<li> Two of my guns have already quit and i havent had it long at all.</li>
<li> I was kind of disappointed though that my blue gun didn&#x27;t work.</li>
<li> I was hesitant to buy the kit due to the price, I figure a professional kit should be pretty expensive.  </li>
<li> One of my major issues is that the power supply ended up crashing on me, not sure the issue</li>
<li> Quality of everything was as expected.</li>
<li> All in all, you get what you pay for and it&#x27;s about what I expected.</li>
<li> days before expected arrival date.</li>
<li> Everything came as expected, and was in working order!</li>
<li> Look in the bottom for the other two guns.</li>
<li> And the power supply was broken, but they sent me a new one.</li>
<li> i though its was a good kit but just start use and broken :(</li>
<li> Could be better but definitely not the worst for the price.</li>
<li> half the time the guns do</li>
<li> They need to include, at the very least, an instructional booklet that lets you know EXACTLY what to do with the equipment, or else you are just left guessing and that is dangerous when it comes to tattoos.</li>
<li> the reason i gave it 4 stars was because it came with a small amount of ink in each bottle other then</li>
<li> When I got it one gun was broke the power supply stop working after a few minutes</li>
<li> It comes with ONE small little skin and ONE piece of transfer paper with no sample of transfer solution.</li>
<li> no ink was in the kit the case was broken and other things were missing..</li>
<li> It comes with no written instructions, and the instructional dvd is hardly instructional at all.</li>
<li> The guns could be slightly confusing to set up.  </li>
<li> Though it is not as thick as it should be and causes a lot of splatter.</li>
<li> Its ridiculous.</li>
<li> Well, as previously stated, the instructional video is practically useless.  </li>
<li> NOT a good kit!!!  </li>
<li> This isn&#x27;t something to be careless with.  </li>
<li> Very cheesy with no help on setting up the machines.</li>

    <li> I was start plus in and its close self , i can&#x27;t open it anymore i can&#x27;t do anything i though its was a good kit but just start use and broken :(</li>
    <li> The machines r okay. But dont use the inks on anyone, there really bad. And the power supply was broken, but they sent me a new one.</li>
    <li> i love this kit, it is amazing, all for guns are perfect, the inks are good, and so is the equipment that was included, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Magnifico kit, exelente calidad, 100% completo, lo unico que le falta son pigmento de mejor calidad, de resto todo magnifico</li>
    <li> It was exactly what is was supposed to be. Look in the bottom for the other two guns. Or you could just get pissed off like I did and not look &#x27;til later. Ehh, it happens to the best of us I guess.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy the kit due to the price, I figure a professional kit should be pretty expensive.  The price was well below the range I was willing to spend, so I took a chance and bought it.  I received the kit in less than a week, halfway around the world, no less.  Like a kid on Christmas morning, I opened it and went through everything and was very happy with all that was included in this kit.  The instructional DVD is not bad, but could be more detailed at least for beginner&#x27;s sake LOL.  Within the first couple weeks (Beginner Tattooist) I have used the kit on practice skins and have done one tattoo on a \\&quot;vonlunteer\\&quot;, already my kit is paid for from that one tattoo!.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal.  I will say though, one of the machines does not hold the tube attachment, I think due to the screw being too short, but that should be an easy fix with a replacement screw.  Overall, I enjoy this kit very much and I think it surpased my expectations the amount of money I paid to get it.</li>
    <li> The kit itself is great, The ink in this kit sucks, suggestion to buy 5 star ink at the time of purchase of kit</li>
    <li> My husband couldn&#x27;t wait, did his first tattoo the other night, and was very happy with the materials. We are very satisfied with our purchase, and also the shipping was VERY timely</li>
    <li> This kit is amazingly put together. Everything was brand spanking new. I bought it as a gift for an aspiring artist. She absolutely loves it! It even arrived quicker than we anticipated.</li>
    <li> all is good but one was missing a gun its all ok but the seller should provide instructions aside the DVD on how to build the tattoo gun  the nails or screws were like all over the box   all aside it ok</li>
    <li> NOT a good kit!!!  When I got it one gun was broke the power supply stop working after a few minutes no ink was in the kit the case was broken and other things were missing.. I would not buy this kit!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two of these now, and the power supply has been defective for both.</li>
    <li> The foot pedal for power. is cheaply made. rest of kit was really a good deal....&lt;br /&gt; guns run smooth. the kit needs a better power source. then there would be no probs....</li>
    <li> Everything came as expected, and was in working order! Excellent value for the price! I would suggest getting different inks, though!</li>
    <li> In general, I love this kit. It&#x27;s great as a beginner kit. I was kind of disappointed though that my blue gun didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Very nice love the hole kit</li>
    <li> Just got my girlfriends kit in and its more than what they said it would be very nice I would say if you are looking for a cheap kit this is the one to get</li>
    <li> In all the set up is fairly nice, I haven&#x27;t had to many problems. One of my major issues is that the power supply ended up crashing on me, not sure the issue but I ended up having to order a new one after only 4 uses. So far this seems to be the only issue I had aside from personal preferences. Could be better but definitely not the worst for the price.</li>
    <li> gift for daughter,she loves it ,thanks</li>
    <li> Great guns, good equipment, ink though... not to impressed with the ink... Awesome shipping time, excellent service. Hope to buy from again!</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time, everything was included like advertised, I did not use the ink I&#x27;m uncertain of how safe it is... other than that all machinery works great.</li>
    <li> Guns work great kit has everything to start your own business</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my starter kit. It arrived quickly...days before expected arrival date. The training video is substandard and will only play on older DVD players due to the fact that the program language written for newer DVD players will not recognize this disc. The inks included with this kit are also substandard but not enough to lose sleep over but good enough for beginners and practicing techniques. The plastic tips included in this kit are also not individually bubble wrapped which could be a sterilization concern...and there could be a wider variety of liner and shader needles that are included with this kit. The guns are nice and function very well. As a starter kit not bad for the price but I suggest thorough research before you make any kind of purchase on this type of item and to consider any form of health issues that your subject may have such as diabetes or hemophellia. you might also want to research your state&#x27;s laws, regulations and legalities concerning licensing before you begin any kind of undertaking to protect yourself from any legal actions in case you make a grave error. I like my kit but again I suggest that you research the wide variety of tattoo kits available and find one that suits your particular needs.</li>
    <li> Well, as previously stated, the instructional video is practically useless.  Your best bet (short of knowing an artist and doing your apprenticeship)  is to watch countless youtube videos before you get this.  The guns could be slightly confusing to set up.  This isn&#x27;t something to be careless with.  Everything came that was advertised, but one gun doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Overall not bad for the price</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift for my brother and he adored it there was no complaints from him the reason i gave it 4 stars was because it came with a small amount of ink in each bottle other then that it was perfect</li>
    <li> The fact that this has multiple guns was kind of useful except that one of my guns just does not work. It comes with no written instructions, and the instructional dvd is hardly instructional at all. In fact I had to look up on the internet how to put together my machine properly. It comes with ONE small little skin and ONE piece of transfer paper with no sample of transfer solution. They need to include, at the very least, an instructional booklet that lets you know EXACTLY what to do with the equipment, or else you are just left guessing and that is dangerous when it comes to tattoos.</li>
    <li> the kit got here 3 days early, not only that but it had everything it said it would. great kit for artists in all stages from beginners to masters. would buy again and recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> for first tatto was crazy we use to have a home made and later we chose to buy a real one and you can buy that machine works grate very well</li>
    <li> Very cheap, perfect for learning to tattoo. This kit comes very complete</li>
    <li> Shipping was on time. Quality of everything was as expected. Good for starting up. There were no directions, but I do not recall if it stated that there was or not. The DVD was bogus for the most part. Very cheesy with no help on setting up the machines. The ink is holding up so far, waiting to see if it fades. Though it is not as thick as it should be and causes a lot of splatter. All in all, you get what you pay for and it&#x27;s about what I expected.</li>
    <li> i was so excited to recieve the tatoo Kit but very dissapointed. half the time the guns dont Work and the ink is SOOO cheap you have to go over the Same tatoo 3 Times to try to get the colored ink to stay. very upset....</li>
    <li> Everything is there and it is a great deal for what you get. It is by no means of the highest quality however, it works and is a steal at amazon.com price.</li>
    <li> 100% not one bad thing to say. This is one of the fastest and worry free co. I have seen</li>
    <li> The Four Gun Tattoo Kit Tattoo Machine Gun Kit By Fancier S-T01 had very fast shipping came as advertised and worked great, the DVD is Funny but if you have never seen a tattoo done then I guess you could watch it, the inks are cheap and run a bit but are usable with patience. For the price and everything included this is an Excellent Deal...</li>
    <li> Two of my guns have already quit and i havent had it long at all. Its ridiculous. Like for real.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described, all well packaged and decent quality, worked out of the box, only suggestion is to get some higher quality ink for work on skin, fantastic kit for beginner.</li>
    <li> perfect shipping time exactly what i was expecting works great and i love the product def. buying again when needed</li>
