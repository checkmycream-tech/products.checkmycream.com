<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very Fresh.. my wife likes it very much&lt;br /&gt;she wants a girl version of my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;thank you...D&amp;G for men.</li>
    <li> Great price considering it&#x27;s delivered to your door. Favorite Eau De Toilette!</li>
    <li> Not the aroma i have been using for several years. I thought it was somewhat weak in comparison to older versions. Don&#x27;t know if it has been tampered with.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered! The only I will mention is that because it is a liquid and this was a gift it says on the front of the Package &amp;#34;FRAGRANCE&amp;#34; so good thing I intercepted the package before the bday boy. Otherwise he smells delicious :)</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions and correct item. You can&#x27;t be wrong on selecting this perfume, I have used for several years and all people around me feels ok with it.</li>
    <li> I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to see this cologne for so cheap on Amazon. I&#x27;m used to buying it from Sephora, where it&#x27;s a lot more expensive. Now I know why. The scent is the same, but this is definitely watered down. Don&#x27;t waste your money, get the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Smell does not stay with you, almost like it was a knockoff product, I will not buy it again, thankyou</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve brought this item by recomendation, didnt even know if the scent was good or bad! but as I received it the first thing I did is trying it.. then the fragrance lenghtened the afternoon..</li>
    <li> This has been a favorite since the 1990&#x27;s &amp; I ensure that it&#x27;s always in my cabinet.  My bottle from Amazon has not yet arrived, but I certainly am pleased with the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/05/14:  My bottle from Amazon arrived about two hours ago &amp; it is absolutely perfect is every way.  It was packed in a thick-walled carton with 2 large pieces of bubble wrap!!  This is IDENTICAL to what I purchase at Dillard&#x27;s...  However, it costs $40.00 more for the same size bottle (4.2 oz.) &amp; even costs $20.00 more for a smaller bottle (2.5 oz.) at Dillard&#x27;s.  The round seal (D&amp;G sticker) on the wrapper, the box, the box markings, the bottle, the bottle markings, the scent, the potency are correct!!  Therefore, all the conspiracy theorists need to stop the hysteria.  Please keep in mind that colognes behave differently from person to person based on a great number of factors.  As far as the bottle, which several people have mentioned, it was changed approximately 11 years ago!!  Please trust &amp; believe in what I am saying, as I have used this product for 20 years...  With respect to manufacturing in another country &amp; ruining its original scent, I don&#x27;t agree.  However, I must not have that guy&#x27;s \\&quot;keen olfactory\\&quot; senses...  Thank goodness because this is one of my favorite fragrances &amp; has been since its introduction.  The \\&quot;keen olfactory\\&quot; guy uses it like a deodorizer for his bedding?!  Please!!  Lastly, Someone else said that it smells like a lemon cleaning agent...  C&#x27;mon, man, get a grip!!  Procter &amp; Gamble is in the business of making money - lots of money - in several different arenas &amp; would not be foolish enough to change anything about the formula of a proven, successful commodity.  If I am not mistaken, P&amp;G owns Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Hugo Boss &amp; Gucci fragrance lines.  Enough said, right?  Folks, please don&#x27;t let the foolishness, negativity &amp; misery of some of the reviewers mislead you...  I only hit my wrist with one tiny spray from this bottle - right out of the box from Amazon - of Dolce &amp; Gabbana Pour Homme (approximately 2 hours ago) &amp; the scent still is very strong.  Authentic cologne at an outstanding price from a truly customer-friendly organization...  Thanks to Amazon &amp; its employees for another extraordinary experience.rom Amazon - of Dolce &amp; Gabbana Pour Homme (approximately 2 hours ago) &amp; the scent still is very strong.

    <li> Great Stuff, Great Price!!!</li>
    <li> My brother asked for this for Christmas,and AMAZON WAS, BY FAR, THE BEST PRICE ANYWHERE, ONLINE OR IN STORE. GREAT BUY!!</li>
    <li> Original perfume.fir the right price</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. This is not the first time I bought the product, so this was just a replacement. The smell is one of a kind, easily recognizable, and suitable for all occasions.</li>
    <li> One of husbands favorites, great price and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> I love the way the fragrance mixes with my chemistry. It is extremely attractive to all that smell it. I encourage all to purchase it.</li>
    <li> not happy at all specially paying over 50 dollar for it when after an hour and half at the most you cant even smell it no more so freaking mad/sad.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for a great price. Lasting till the next day. I always spray it on my undershirt. One more tip: you might get a hug more often with this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I gave it as a gift to my boyfriend, but it smells so good that it&#x27;s a gift for me as well.</li>
    <li> This is the kind of cologne you buy because it smells good to you. I don&#x27;t even care if my girlfriend likes it (she does) I would wear it anyway. It is just that nice. I do hope they continue making it for years to come.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent on me, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I am a huge Dolce &amp; Gabbana fragrance fan.  I myself love the Light Blue for Men better, but my wife love this one more!  Either way, you can&#x27;t lose with D&amp;G.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This scent starts off incredibly sweet and fruity, with bananas and pineapples mixed with a variety of tropical fruits. It&#x27;s a little disarming, with the cocoa butter and oil smell. But it evolves into a more masculine scent that blends tobacco and black pepper. This is a pretty decent scent that should be tested before you buy it. Very strong and will last you all day.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling colognes I have ever purchased. The really nice thing about this cologne is how long the scent stays with you. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001JDDMJS Dolce &amp; Gabbana Dolce &amp; Gabbana 0.15 oz EDT Splash (Mini) For Men]] I&#x27;ve used this cologne for almost a decade now, with excellent results. It&#x27;s distinctive enough that I&#x27;ve often been asked what it is I&#x27;m wearing. When I tried to switch to another scent a few years back my fiancee was so persistent in her campaign for me to switch back that bought another bottle and haven&#x27;t looked back since. I&#x27;d highly recommend this cologne.</li>
    <li> Fragrance super nice, elegant and sensual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very original design and super quality.</li>
    <li> purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They changed the formula and this is no longer a good scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to be strong and last all day, now, you are lucky if it lasts an hour. To make sure it wasn&#x27;t just the one i purchased from amazon, i also went to a local store, and tested it there, same lackluster quality as the one i purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous versions were made in Italy, now they are Germany and the UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the formula change, do not buy, if they ever go back to the original then buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess no one ever learned from &amp;#34;new coke&amp;#34; in the 80&#x27;s...</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic. Definitely the real thing. Put this on yesterday evening and its now the next morning and I can still smell it (wearing off tho). It definitely last. Love the suede box. Its the real deal. I bought another box! Would highly recommended.</li>
    <li> From my experience, the designer house of Dolce and Gabbana make some overrated fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it was Light Blue. Light Blue seems to be very popular on the Net, but it reminds me too much of laundry detergent. The scent is something I would wear around the house for lounging, but not something I would be proud to wear in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D&amp;G for Men is also an overrated scent. Here I was, thinking D&amp;G was the best scent out there for men, according to Internet site reviews, but it&#x27;s not. In case you&#x27;re interested, a gentleman I know had a sample vial of this, so I dabbed some on my hand out of curiosity. I was shocked how lemony it smelled; though, that is its top note. But, it just stayed lemony on my skin. I eventually washed it off because I was tired of smelling it. I used some dish washing liquid to wash it off, and I kid you not, I could not tell the difference between the cologne and the lemon dish liquid I used to scrub my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, it smelled like a unisex fragrance, not a top-selling, sophisticated man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> I was originally nervous to buy such a distinctive product online, but I did and it was great! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This cologne has become an icon among male colognes.  I guess it will never be out of fashion to wear this cologne every once in a while.  The smell even gets better as it mixes with your body perspiration.  Trust me, ladies will ask you!</li>
    <li> Is there anything else you really need to know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought this HUGE 4.2 Oz bottle for about 30% less than MSRP!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume before, but this time I thought the scent very weak. But the quality of fragancy is very sweet and the womens love it.</li>
    <li> The scent is very classic. I am very satisfied with the long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m foreing and i bougth it through my nephew who lives there, so i can&#x27;t give my opini&amp;oacute;n about that, neverdeless i&#x27;m sure all is Ok</li>
    <li> I really wanted this perfume for a long time, my girl friend gave me as a present.But i was very disappointed with this because it lacks longetivity and i dont quite like the way it smells...definitely not for me.....</li>
    <li> I must be honest,this dolce and gabbana its smell does not last half hour.sorry but its true.</li>
    <li> Just Good, but is not amazing for me. I think this escent is not for me. The blue box is nice.</li>
    <li> Really nice and subtle. Women enjoy it. Only problem is it doesn&#x27;t last the longest but it won&#x27;t wear off right away either.</li>
    <li> long lasting and smells great - best cologne i have ever bought - will be buying in the future for sure</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl and this is by far my favorite cologne for years.  I can tell right away when someone is wearing it and I turn into a purring kitten.  LOVE IT!  I did a trail secret blind test with my boyfriend.  I had him smell a few and rate then. D&amp;G came out on top, thankfully.  He loves it and even wears it to bed because he knows I love it so much.  I highly reccomend this cologn to any girl looking for a present for her guy.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> The scent is soft yet strong enough to leave a positive impression on those who smell the spray. My wife loves the scent.</li>
    <li> i bought for my hubby for christmas and he love it</li>
    <li> Great price and always rapid delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this for my husband! :) Such a sexy grown man smell! This is my second time buying this product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting really, but it&#x27;s my own fault for not trying to find a shop to test it first. I&#x27;m more of a D&amp;G Light Blue person.</li>
    <li> I have been using D&amp;G  Pour Homme  and have found it thoroughly disappointing. I like the fragrance. The top note of citrus, Bergamot and neuroline are pleasant but that is where the story ends. The Heart and the base note does not seem to exist. The perfume does not have a lasting power. After a couple of hours the fragrance is gone, at least for me. I was expecting a lot more from this perfume in terms of its staying power. Where are the sandalwood, tonka bean base notes ? Did they forget to add it to the batch that I purchased ?? Don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence giving it a two star.</li>
    <li> This is a gift to my father. I don&#x27;t know what kind dose he like. But I think he will like it.</li>
    <li> I have been very satisfied with this fragrance which I believe has a very distinctive scent that always intrigues others and ask for its name. The 4.2 oz. size is very manageable.</li>
    <li> The perfume smells awesome and my husband likes it. The price suited ku budget as well. Can&#x27;t complain at all</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying every time i wear this scent i get compliments everytime. The women love this its sort of fruity and musky mixed so it gets their senses going wild. This is a little pricey but if you are trying to impress a woman id go for it.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift nearly 20 years ago from a female friend in Los Angeles who is fashion consultant. The fragrance is still contemporary and I still get compliments.</li>
    <li> Dolce&amp;Gabbana, at this point, is officially become my favorite smell.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing in it shouts at you.  It&#x27;s just has a perfect light cosy balance. (You&#x27;d like to be wearing it around a fire place.)&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s nice to take a whiff of yourself now and then...&lt;br /&gt;Love Gio outside, but, Dolce&amp;Gabbana is the one for home.&lt;br /&gt;Try it.</li>
    <li> A longtime favorite, this is a staple fragrance of mine that never fails to stand out. Very distinct,  long lasting, it has a mature aire to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22, at university in Boston, and have been wearing various colognes for the past 7 years or so. I have a nice collection of fragrances, and this one certainly stands out. It&#x27;s not my favorite, but I&#x27;m always happy that I put it on whenever I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hype about this fragrance, almost 17 years after it was introduced, exists for good reason. This is a fantastic scent, and I love to wear it. I prefer this cologne for summer use, as well as one of my true favorites, Versace Signature Pour Homme (Polo Double Black and Terre d&#x27;Hermes are my favorite winter fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dolce&#x27;s classic Pour Homme is lemony, spicy, smooth, warm, deep and cool. The campaign colors and dyes in the fragrance itself perfectly suit the colors and sensations the fragrance connotes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small apprehension I have about this fragrance is that it can be almost overwhelming during the first 20 minutes or so after application. If I&#x27;m running late for class, I&#x27;d be reluctant to put on a few spritzes of this, as I wouldn&#x27;t want to choke up the cute girl beside me when I sat down. The true magic of this scent comes up maybe a half hour after application, and if I&#x27;m wearing it out I&#x27;ll set a few minutes between putting it on and leaving the apartment. I put one spray on each side of my throat/neck, and one on my left wrist before rubbing it in with the right. Lasts for hours, and a few drops of water can re-activate the oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, this is one of my favorite fragrances. It&#x27;s distinctive, distinguished, luxurious, and complex. One of my favorite externalities of wearing it is catching waves of it when I wake up from wearing it the night before. By that point, it&#x27;s got almost a vanilla-ish base, which is fantastic. I highly recommend this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget about trying to achieve compliments--girls will compliment you if you wear Axe Body Spray for crying out loud. Wear a fragrance that suits your personality and style.</li>
    <li> When this came out back in the 90s, I fell in love with it. This is the only cologne I allow  my husband to  wear.</li>
    <li> If you remember a cologne called The Baron from several years ago, then you will recognize this scent. It is very similar--not sure I would be able to tell the difference in a scent test. That&#x27;s not a bad thing since The Baron is no longer produced and was one of my favorite scents. As for longevity, it&#x27;s adequate. After a couple of hours, the scent fades quite a bit. I have tried other colognes, such as Boucheron, that are almost as strong 8 hours later as when first applied. This is not that type of fragrance, but it should be fine for a work day or a night on the town.</li>
    <li> the article exceeds the expectations of quality and manofactura, I am very happy with the delivery time, is an article that I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It a good product quality, I hope it lasts a long time to use. The beautiful model. Recommended 100%. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described. I bought it on Amazon because it was the best price I could find anywhere and it was delivered right to my doorstep. There was no need for me to try to find a store rep to unlock any displays for me or any or that sort of nonsense. I just clicked on the &amp;#34;Buy It Now&amp;#34; button and within 2 days I had it in my hands!</li>
    <li> The original Dolce &amp; Gabanna still smells the best ...I recently had been shopping and was looking for it when the sales girl told me there were many newer choices than that really old one....sorry sales girl, but none smell as good as &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Dolce &amp; Gabanna for Men......</li>
    <li> Bought this for my brother&#x27;s birthday. Its his favorite cologne. He is happy with the gift and confirms it&#x27;s exactly the perfume he&#x27;s used to. It was package brand new. No worries there. Excellent. THank you</li>
    <li> I have tested some fragrances and D&amp;G is my favourite so far. Not much to say: My wife loves it  &#x3D;).</li>
    <li> Too many men buy a cologne because they themselves think it smells good. You gotta realize, it doesn&#x27;t matter if YOU like it. Instead, does your lady (or anyone else&#x27;s lady,) like it, and the answer to this is YES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed at all of the compliments I get on it, requests for the name, and especially the reactions when I try to nonchalantly reply \\&quot;D&amp;G.\\&quot; It is just one great men&#x27;s fragrance. As any good cologne should, it smells different enough on each wearer instead of smelling like everyone else wearing what they see sold on TV in an industrial-sized spray can.  I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s and attend a community college. I love it when some 20-something hugs me and tells me how good I smell. Try some -- this stuff is its own best advertisement. And for you guys that expect miracles, SHOWER before you put it on. NOTHING will mask pure stink.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found a cologne that suits me as much yet... I have tried a few different colognes at various price points, but this is a really nice scent (especially on a smoker) with the hint of tobacco.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product because I bought it for a gift and now its spray does not work. What a shame! I delayed  in giving my opini&amp;oacute;n, so I could not contact the seller.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much...wait wasn&#x27;t long and the product was exactly as stated. Thank you once again and you can bet I&#x27;ll be buying from you in the near future.</li>
    <li> Would not accept return  I really dislike this fragrance!! n Still have  replace ???  feel I wasted money  I did  Will not use</li>
    <li> It is a superb eau de cologne with a long-lasting scent. I first tried it when by brother bought DG EDT as a gift 2 years ago and that made me an addict to this sophisticated smell. It is not uncommon to see people (both women and men) ask what brand I wear. I strongly suggest D&amp;G EDT. The only downside is the price. If you like a stronger aroma you might like Kenzo EDT.</li>
    <li> I received a watered down version of a cologne I have worn for years.  This is the type of product and vendor that will ruin web shopping.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful minty, fresh and reasonably strong cologne from Dolce and Gabbana.  Their signature scent, I suppose, and remarkably fine!  It is one of my personal favorites, and balances citrus with floral/herb notes very well.  This is a reasonably formal cologne, and superb for a night&#x27;s out, though I would think too sporty for the office, in my opinion.  One of the best of it&#x27;s class.</li>
    <li> Very happy all around.  This item is my favorite cologne.  The price was perfect and I wouldn&#x27;t have, and couldn&#x27;t have found a better price or been happier with any other supplier from soup to nuts I was very satisfied with them</li>
    <li> I love Dolce &amp; Gabbana By Dolce &amp; Gabbana For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray...I purchased previously and I always wanted more!</li>
    <li> now my husband smells super sexy and I didnt have to pay an arm and a leg at the local department store for it either.  thank you for fast delivery and a great smelling product.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years now. I get compliments on it all the time. It has a very classy but not overwhelming scent that gets noticed in a positive way. I&#x27;ve been around people wearing cologne that is too strong and it can be annoying. I don&#x27;t have to worry about being one of those people with this stuff. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> The perfume came in a lovely velvet-wraped box (fancy!) and the scent was unbelievable delicious and long lasting! It was by far the best christmas gift I could have ever given, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for 8 years and counting. I got it as a part of a gift set on my 21st birthday.  Its the one and only fragrance that I&#x27;ve chosen to be &#x27;me&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;It has a really classy but subtle fragrance. I still get the urge to smell it on my hands now and then when I&#x27;m not wearing it - even to this day.</li>
    <li> It was good I was satisfied with the product I don&#x27;t use anything else I&#x27;ve been using it for a long long time ...</li>
    <li> Smells great, shipping was good, didn&#x27;t have to wait all that long for it. It&#x27;s what I like to smell on my husband, I like to just cuddle up next to him and just smell. I love it, deff. will buy again.</li>
    <li> Normally I&#x27;d prefer a scent that is subtle, but in this case, I would prefer not to have to use so many sprays to get the fragrance to &amp;#34;stick.&amp;#34;  It seems to become unrecognizable after about three hours or so.</li>
    <li> I ordered this last nite and it was waiting for me when I arrived home from work!!! It&#x27;s a strong masculine scent!!!</li>
    <li> BEST COLOGNE I THINK IT CAME TO ME SOONER THAN IT SAID IT WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT LIKES TO SMELL NICE.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I love It!  good stuff and cheap price.</li>
    <li> Usually I only get this good of a deal on auction sites but found this &amp; jumped on it immediately. The price was incredible &amp; the free shipping got the product to me quicker than anticipated. Will definitely be coming back for more.</li>
    <li> Well its ok , but i had too much expectation . Any way this was not i expected for sure.....</li>
    <li> Good one and met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended by my wife and would recommend to any of my close relatives , friends or whoever interested in buying good perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance way better than light blue and the size/price ration on Amazon was totally amazing. Impossible to beat. Strongly suggested.</li>
    <li> The traditional D &amp; G smell. I love it and will continue to buy this product. I actually am stoked I found an affordable 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this cologne out as a Father&#x27;s Day gift but I bought myself a sample first before I gave it out. The presentation is great as the box is covered in some kind of velvety fabric, really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I sprayed it on me, as I do with my other colognes. It smelled great and was looking forward to smelling it throughout the afternoon. However, less than 3 hours later I couldn&#x27;t smell it on me anymore unless I brought my forearm to my nose. Then I would definitely sense the beautiful scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fresh, masculine and sweet all at the same time. I think everyone who is exposed to it will like it specially your girlfriend, wife, or ladies you are around often. It just needs to project and last more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read some reviews in which amazon is accused of selling &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; colognes. I hate to accuse amazon of the same and really hope this experienced wasn&#x27;t the case as amazon has never failed me before.</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly. I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I stole a spritz before wrapping it up and I really like it (I hope he does too). It&#x27;s not to strong and smells very clean.</li>
    <li> DOLCE GABBANA IS THE BEST. THE ONLY COLOGNE MY MY WIFE LIKES PLUS I GET COMMENTS FROM OTHER PEOPLE ALL THE TIME ASKING WHAT I&#x27;M WEARING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> This was the real deal, authentic, and arrived on time.  I get plenty of compliments when wearing this scent. Its manly, not to loud, but long lasting. I will buy it again and from this seller.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Best price at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Lovely as usual the classic Blue by Dolce and gabbana</li>
    <li> perfect for yhe night</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT COMES A TIME IN EXCELLENT CONDITION VERY RESPONSIBLE SUPPLIER, WE RECOMMEND 100% WHAT YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS CERTIFY</li>
    <li> I loved the product because its a lot cheaper than our mall. The quality was even the same and even bigger for better price.</li>
    <li> This IS REAL Dolce &amp; Gabbanna. HOWEVER, if you&#x27;ve been a fan of this fragrance forever like I have, it IS NOT the same version you used to get in the mid 90&#x27;s until around mid 2000&#x27;s when Dolce &amp; Gabanna stopped making the cologne in Italy and started making and bottling the cologne in Germany. In the shuffle they&#x27;ve definitely (based on my keen olfactory system) lost some key tones and notes that made the original version so special. The box is the same navy blue suede, the bottle is the exact same shape and the cap is the exact same. The new version has \\&quot;Dolce &amp; Gabbanna\\&quot; printed directly on the bottle which actually looks much nicer than the original Italian version which read the same on a cheap silver foil sticker stuck on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, if you&#x27;ve never worn this cologne and you&#x27;re looking to rattle off, \\&quot;thanks, it&#x27;s Dolce &amp; Gabanna\\&quot; to the next woman that says, \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;, you can do so in good conciencenous. It still smells great compared to most out there, but if your looking for that original magic scent, it&#x27;s just not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t wear it anymore. It&#x27;s just a watered down version of what was the best scent ever... Except, maybe bacon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use it like Fabreeze to spray my bed though.</li>
    <li> This juice is too feminine smelling for a man&#x27;s cologne. I don&#x27;t like it at all. I sprayed some on me at the store and it took hours to get rid of the smell. This juice lasts which if you like the smell is a good thing. This is not the way I want to smell. Many people do seem to enjoy this scent - I am just not one of them</li>
    <li> I have ordered this before it is a very good smelling cologne.  I received the purchase on time and my husband loved it as well.</li>
    <li> Because everything they have good special parfum not too much alcohol I want to becom businessman I can order the same material amazon have</li>
    <li> Best smell, best price. I used to use this so sparingly. Now that I have gotten a few years older, I find it necessary to sprits more than once. I hope this smell never goes away. Great product for a great price. Thanks Amazon and D&amp;G!</li>
    <li> This is my husband favorite cologne! :) thought I&#x27;d surprise him! He loved it, worth to see the expression on his face.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne at a really good price. What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!  Just in time!!!  It is a DOLCE GABANA!!!  I am using for 15 years and it is ORIGINAL!!!  THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> Hi, this product is not original, if it is your scent does not last, I felt like I cheated with this product</li>
    <li> Smells beeeeuutiful! love it. shipped fast and was not damaged at all. Great handling!</li>
    <li> My son is very pleased with this product.  He would recommend this product.  It is a great deal.  Thank you Amazon for your great prices and great deals.</li>
    <li> I like this product because the fragrance is clean, pleasant without being overpowering so is appreciated by you and others without causing respiratory distress</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband &amp; He Loves it...Really &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> My brother had gotten it for him originally and he loved it -- he wears it going dancing at the Senior Center each Thursday...</li>
    <li> It was a good experience and would buy it again</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t smell it after a few minutes two stars we not buy anymore</li>
    <li> I got a small leftover bottle from my dad once when I was 16. I&#x27;m 23 now and this is the only cologne I ever use. It smells great and whenever I use it I always get complimented about smelling good, so I&#x27;m very happy with this smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 15 year old son for Christmas because he wanted a more mature scent.  I went by reviews and I am glad I did because he absolutely loves this cologne and it really does have a very sexy scent.  Not overwhelming as long as you do not put too much on.  My husband said he would have loved to receive this cologne as well!</li>
    <li> It was a present for the husband of my sister, he like it a lot and smells really good, good buy.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma which this products provides.  It works very well for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne.</li>
    <li> Girls like it,Great smell</li>
    <li> Dolce &amp; Gabbana, enough said.</li>
    <li> I absolute love this cologne, but this one purchased by Amazon.com smells like a watered down version of D&amp;G for men. The packaging looks legit, the box, the bottle, and the scent smells like a watered down version of this cologne, and it doesn&#x27;t linger like my husband&#x27;s old bottle that was purchased at a department store.</li>
    <li> I wont rant and rave that&#x27;s already been done. I am not a Reviewer of Scents, But i do own a wide Variety of Scents. This is one of those classic Scents that&#x27;s very versatile it can be worn by nearly all ages, worn on nearly any occasion and all season. It isn&#x27;t really a great Night out Scent But it would work just fine. Does get plenty of Compliments from the women! It lasts for around 6-8 hours on my skin, does have somewhat of a scent trail. People can typically smell it on me from several feet away when first sprayed. Comes in closer to the skin as it dries down but you can still smell it a 5 feet away once it dries down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 8 out or 10 for me!</li>
    <li> Very nice I bought this as a gift and I ended liking it so much that I kept it for my self..Very fresh, very clean and masculine cologne</li>
    <li> The packaging was just the right size and the amount of protecting package inserts were valuable. The scent is a classic gentleman scent with woods and soft spices. An all day scent no need to reapply later. It&#x27;s especially great in the spring and summer.</li>
    <li> very good product has high quality and is of very good material, I recommend the product for buyers in this class.</li>
    <li> Furious that I cannot return this item.  It was the wrong item, and is supposedly a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; therefore not returnable. It came in a box with brown paper.  Why was it okay to ship it to me that way, but I cannot ship it back.  When a search is done for &amp;#34;The One&amp;#34;, this item should not come up as an option.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware:  This is a fake item.  I compared this to the real item and there is a night and day difference in longeivity.  This one fades in 30 minutes and also smells slightly different.  Upon reading the reviews it is clear that others have received a fake version too.  Shame on amazon for allowing a crrok to sell products on its site.</li>
    <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last long and does not smell like the german version nor the italian. Keep away and get the original versions, the smell is not the same.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t bought this fragrance for a guy in years. It is just as fabulous and sexy as I remember. Not too heavy or perfumey. It&#x27;s hypnotizing to me. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with fragrance and size</li>
    <li> Larger bottle than what I expected for the price- I was VERY impressed.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Great smell.</li>
    <li> I loved it, i m using now</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as department store products.  I&#x27;m very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift so I don&#x27;t know anything about the scent or how long it last.&lt;br /&gt;Product as described, very pleased with the delivery time, sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and would definitely buy from amazon again!</li>
    <li> Nice product and one of my two favorite colognes to wear. Nice and light but still lasts without being overly strong. Wife loves it and I receive regular compliments when wearing it out.</li>
    <li> Excellent price and quick delivery!</li>
    <li> Thanks amazon famıly... I love that</li>
    <li> Great Seller. Item arrived ahead of schedule and item was great. Thanks</li>
    <li> MY DADDY LOVES FRAGRANCE IS THEREFORE RECOMMEND THEM, IT IS VERY RICH</li>
    <li> Great perfume and good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, my first hesistation with ordering cologne/perfume online is if I&#x27;m getting the real deal.  This package was a great discount and came in perfect packaging and was clearly brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap was tight and clean, no marks of any kind and the bottle took a few sprays to get going - sure sign it wasn&#x27;t used before. The felt in the box is mint and every indication was that you are dealing with the genuine article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, I&#x27;ve had this cologne for years and the smell is right on and strong - no dilution here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great win over department store pricing!</li>
    <li> I have been around with this frangrance almost everyday at work and let me honest it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work with everyone but for the most part it&#x27;s smell good on a lot of people, you just need to try it in real at the department store first before you buy it</li>
    <li> Outstanding fragrance,,,very good shipping from west to the east coast,,I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice, just as described, smell really good, would deff buy again.</li>
    <li> Beware of 365 Beauty, all their client real reviews are for fake counterfeit products.</li>
    <li> I love my product i am really satisfy with it. It took a little longer than i expected but still was on the time they gave me for my product to arrived.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product, because it did not smell like the Dolce and Gabbana that I bought previously for my husband at my local Macy&#x27;s.  Although much better priced, it smelled more like a knockoff.</li>
    <li> Fake, fake and fake. Don&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;Falso, falso y falso, no lo compres solo dura 20 minutos y despu&amp;eacute;s un olor a detergente.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan :(  Everything was fine from the seller&#x27;s end, just didn&#x27;t like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance since 98 (not continuously, of course). In my opinion it&#x27;s a little overpriced for its \\&quot;age\\&quot;. But stills a good value for me.</li>
    <li> I have used Dolce &amp; Gabbana for many years. This does not have the same scent. It is definitely a knock off. I am so disappointed. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I received this product and immediately was impressed with its smell and subtle aroma. its funny but the first \\&quot;girl\\&quot; to smell it was my five year old niece when i picked her up to hold her and she said \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;, I have had the same reaction from all of the women that i have worn it around. I am not sure if it is me but i do believe that it isnt as long lasting as i would like it to be but the size of the bottle compensates for the duration of the scent. buy this one it is great.</li>
    <li> the best product i have ever purchased on amazon.com. This cologne smells really good. the ladies love it in bed and anywhere. ladies man.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the fragrance and was disappointed to find out I couldn&#x27;t return. Oh well,  live and learn</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! It only last 3-4 hours though so be sure to apply a second spray at lunch.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite cologne. Sadly it tends to fade away rather quickly unless you apply a generous amount all over you and even then one would have to come close. With that said it&#x27;s probably my pH the guilty party because other stronger-smelling colognes really stick with me, even if I only spray once.</li>
    <li> NO MATTER WHICH YEAR IT IS I LOVE THIS SCENT. VERY GOOD. VERSATILE TO BE WORN ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS&lt;br /&gt;HAS CLEAN BUT ROMANTIC SMELL</li>
    <li> I get comments on this every time I wear it.  It is really strong so go easy, one spray is plenty.  Girls love it.</li>
    <li> I like a manly cologne.  I don&#x27;t want to smell like a chick,  I want to attract them.  This is my favorite.  It has a clean spicy scent with hints of wood.  It is earthy and fresh.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> An excellent perfume. Recommended to all. Great setting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Success olfactory, for sure. Traditional that does success.&lt;br /&gt;Sucessfull</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this cologne! I bought it for my husband. The price was half of what it would cost in any other store! I will be buying this again when he runs out!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite found it and every thing went like specified actually received it one day earlier</li>
    <li> I originally found this scent on a trip to Chicago several years ago.  My husband loved it then and still loves it today!!  Timeless notes of musk and almost an undertone of fresh linen.</li>
    <li> Buenos dias, el dia de hoy me tome la molestia para calificar esta compra, la cual cumplio con los parametros que esperabamos. Quedamos conforme con la compra, gracias.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance for men. I have bought to my brother and he told me that the price was the better. I suggest you keep having the best prices and promotions!!!</li>
    <li> Not bad but neither am I too impressed.</li>
    <li> Im a cologne fan. My father always wore cologne when I was a kid. He is a classy gentlemen; which I look up to. this is not one of his colognes, but Its one of my favorites. Like other reviewers on this site, I will also mention it is a strong scent; so dont go nuts. One, or two sprays max boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you put it on, and are dressed to impress for a night out, the ladies will swoon. when you start dishing out hugs they will all comment on how good you smell. Especially if they are drunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> different formula than was used previously.  Smells and looks a little different</li>
    <li> Quality product and price where as promised. Delivered and received as expected and did a great job.</li>
    <li> One of the best smell</li>
    <li> very good product I recommend it to everyone I came perfectly and has no sign of damage apart is very good product!</li>
    <li> The first time I smelled this product was when I was on vacation in Mexico.  One of the entertainers at the resort was wearing it and I fell in love with it.  I bought it here because the price was right.  If I bought it at ULTA the price I paid here would only get me the 2 oz size instead of the larger size.  I got more for my buck.  Thank you so much.  It smells wonderful on my husband.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and been wearing it for 16 years and well you can spot a fake even before you take off the plastic to reveal this is a counterfeit china town product... First of all the bar codes on the box can be rubbed off with your nails, easy give away... Second of all the cap on the bottle is wrong and well as soon as you spray it on yourself you automatically can tell from the smell of 16 years its fake... A new comer would never know... Buyer beware...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that this perfume is original</li>
    <li> I smell great all the time.</li>
    <li> This cologne is really great. Signature smell is worth the money. I would def buy this product again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my Son&#x27;s Birthday.  It was on his wish list but his birthday has not arrived yet.  I am sure he will love it. It was package nice and it will make a great gift.</li>
    <li> Good price and arrived before the expected.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this brand but this version is the cheap version not the real version buyer beware</li>
    <li> This cologne went from a signature scent to lemon scented cleaner scent. Sad, very sad. It turned to piss water when the license to the cologne was sold to Proctor and Gamble, yes the toothpaste and detergent people.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect, arrive on time, size of bag was good no problen opening it thanks a lot and have a nice day</li>
    <li> This lasts very long and has a strong masculine smell. I&#x27;m not talking about Bruit neither, I&#x27;m talking about expensive smell that you can smell a mile away. I will never pay double for the same bottle that I can get on the internet again! Thanks again Amazon I am always pleased with your product.</li>
    <li> I ordered online during the Holidays and received my products&lt;br /&gt;very quickly and was advised with tracking information.</li>
    <li> My husband and I agree that this is one of our favorite fragrances for him!  He saves it for our times together and uses a less expensive fragrance for work.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this men&#x27;s fragrance based on reviews and value. I was not completely disappointed, but do feel it&#x27;s over rated. I like the Light Blue better, but even it will be used for day time use, and informal gatherings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this product goes, I&#x27;ve given it away after using it one time, and will probably stay with some of my other favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has their own taste, and fragrances do smell differently on different people. Armani seems to suit me well as do a few others, but this fragrance just was not a good choice for me, it might work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it&#x27;s good cologne but not great.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume Dulce &amp; Gabbana. Its smell real nice, very sweet in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the 4.2 ounce Eau De Toilette and when I received it, the cap on top of the bottle had a leak. About 1/3 of cologne had spilled/evaporated. I looked to return it since this one was sold by Amazon, and I found out that I couldn&#x27;t because \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.\\&quot; Really disappointed right now.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.  Highly recommended. Always get noticed and is must have for your collection. My personal favorite go to cologne.</li>
    <li> Favorite scent. I am not sure if the smell changed over the years, so I have no complaints compared to other reviews. I think it smells great and my girlfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> distinguished the personality with this fragance, soft, wooden base perfume. endures all day,  my husband for years has been used it.</li>
    <li> My husband was very happy</li>
    <li> Perfectly  sexy for the  male to use on any occasion</li>
    <li> really like this cologn fair price</li>
    <li> Perfume I have been using for years, that fits&lt;br /&gt;my body. Besides its aroma is to my taste, exquisite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks and forth</li>
    <li> This cologne works for me!</li>
    <li> Gift for my husband.  Always pleased with this cologne, even the packaging.</li>
    <li> the first time i tried this cologne my wife fell in love with it. wherever i went i received compliments. My wife doesn&#x27;t like me to wear it unless she&#x27;s with me because of, well you know. Thanks. gary</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  Upon wearing it we noticed that it had a musk smell instead  of the fresh scent it normally has.  I do not recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> My son, who is much younger than me, recommended this new fragrance to enhance my dating life. I like it and have received many compliments from the younger ladies.</li>
    <li> Was sceptical on purchasing it online. But, it is the original. The best of the best! D&amp;G will never let you down.</li>
    <li> I know that cologne, more than anything else, is a personal preference kind of thing. BUT I have never gotten compliments before like I have with D&amp;G. It is a light, subtle and refreshing scent. Not sweet and overbearing like Polo.</li>
    <li> Smells so refreshing and get compliments all the time!  It was quick and easy to order and i will do it again!</li>
    <li> The bottle  broken and the liquid is poured&lt;br /&gt;I want to return&lt;br /&gt;I dislike this product&lt;br /&gt;I can not use because it arrived broken&lt;br /&gt;wet Box</li>
    <li> el producto llego a tiempo y cumple con todas las caracter&amp;iacute;sticas indicadas por eso escogi esta calificacion por la responsabilidad del vendedor recomendado a todos</li>
    <li> I can remember the smell of my pre-school classroom, Mrs Bell....the school yard aid(moth balls..lol)and the thick colored wooden blocks (carmel/sweet) I would chew on when I was just 3 years old.  Humans never forget a scent.  I remember the smell my grandmothers purse, my sisters hair oil, burning fireworks, black shoe polish, Ajax, inside an M-16 A2 and even death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what is inside this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never smelled it before.  No memory comes to mind except; of a little girl who rang my door bell, selling knock-off cologne. She only need to squirt a sample in the air for me to decline.  Smelled like fresh scented roach spray or something.  :  (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never in life buy cologne on-line.</li>
    <li> Fantastic cologne, lasts all day, I receive complements all the time.  Beats the price of any brick and mortar store and is delivered to your door.  No hassle, no traffic, no crowds.  If you like Dolce &amp; Gabbana this is an unbeatable proposition.</li>
    <li> I think this cologne is fake! Not anything at all like I remember... I have to spray so much to get a lasting smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but no thing special.Old version(Made in Italy) is better&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and has longevity 1-2 Hours&lt;br /&gt;Good for it&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> I have been used Dolce &amp; Gabbana cologne for years and the bouquet never changes, DELICIOUS!  George</li>
    <li> Fragrance very fresh and remains at time. very good price . met my expectations I recommend it for personal use or as a gift</li>
    <li> Ordered this and received a bottle of Dolce and Gabbana lemon oil.  The scent is gone in five minutes.  Definitely a very watered down version of a nice cologne. Embarrassed that I fell for this scam.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been one of my top two colognes for a decade now. This size bottle lasts me about a year. One quick spray on your chest is all you need. Don&#x27;t go overboard. It&#x27;s clean ,grapefruity, and a slightly soapy. Similair to Eternity but 10 better!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Dolce &amp; Gabbana product and it arrived within 3 days. Now this where it get&#x27;s interesting. After opening the shipping box I realized the plastic that goes over the product box was open at the bottom. I decided to get into the box through the bottom making sure I don&#x27;t damage the inner carton lining the box. After opening the bottom flap of the box a piece of the inner lining of carton fell off as it was torn. I realized immediately the box had been tampered with, and possibly the original Dolce &amp; Gabbana had been switched with a knock off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon.com and aired my concern, I was surprised at their understanding and was delighted at the speed it took them to resolve my issue. They refunded my money, and since sprays fall under flammable/hazardous material category they are not returnable. So they asked me to keep it. Not to worry Amazon, I&#x27;m getting ready to buy a 55&#x27; LED TV and I will be buying it from you guys. You rock!!</li>
    <li> i guess it works just as its supposed to, i really dont like the smell at all, almost hate it, but girls like it so i guess i suggest it to others.</li>
    <li> great smell. very fresh.  would definately recommend.  love everything about it.  people always ask what the scent is and where to get it.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was expecting, I&#x27;m very Happy with the purchase, I definitely would recommend it to other people</li>
    <li> Loving My New, but usual Parfum!!!</li>
    <li> I saw this as the top rated cologne on a website and decided to order it without even smelling it first. I am really happy with my purchase because this cologne smells great! I would also recommend Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue Cologne.</li>
    <li> This Big presentation is great, and at a good price!</li>
    <li> My personal favourite cologne for Fall / Winter months. Has a nice spice hint to it.</li>
    <li> One of the best perfumes in the world. I really love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. I think I need another one. will look it up again and purchase more for sure.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product arrived &amp; did not smell right.  We&#x27;ve had this scent before &amp; know what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like.  The good news is our money was immediately refunded. Thanks!</li>
    <li> contento porque es el producto que deseaba y es a un precio muy accequible. estoy contento con mi compra de este articulo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write negative reviews, but I was just so disappointed in this fragrance! I bought it for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day 2014 based on it being the \\&quot;Best Seller\\&quot; in Men&#x27;s Fragrances on Amazon. I know, kind of risky in hindsight with a cologne, but after reading a ton of great reviews I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be bad. The minute my husband opened the box we smelt cinnamon - weird?! Than, after both of us wearing it for a few minutes, all I could think of was that it smelled as if we&#x27;d both doused ourselves in a ton of sunscreen?!! Really, really bad! Please, PLEASE make sure you try this fragrance on in a store before you buy it blindly like I did; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s our skin type, or the batch we got, but this really does not wear or smell like a $40+ designer fragrance. Boo!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY cologne my son will wear and it is a very nice scent. So happy to find it online $20.00 cheaper than in our area! Great Christmas present!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so damn good. The only cologne I have gotten more compliments on from females is Givenchy Pi.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it drives my wife wild so I wear it strategically.</li>
    <li> They sent me a fake a new york counterfeits not good at all I have the real think from someone else</li>
    <li> I gave it two stars to be fair about it, seeing as how it just really isn&#x27;t for me at all.  I&#x27;ve been reading up on finding a fragrance that is right for me and from what I read on this, it sounded like it would meet my standards.  But unfortunately, this did nothing for me or my girlfriend.  I got it and sprayed it on my wrist immediately.  I would say this would be recommended for an older audience, first thing I smelled was a musky odor that seemed to offend my girlfriend and to be honest... me as well.  I went to the bathroom to wash it off and went back in for a return.  I told them it wasn&#x27;t for me and they insisted that I give Light Blue a smell.  Surely enough it grabbed my attention immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are between 18-25, I would say that your best bet would be Light Blue.  It gives an aquatic scent that also has a sophisticated finish.  But if you are older than that and are looking for that respectable scent to wear to your next meeting, this could be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  Purchased as a gift.  I was skeptical about ordering but was very pleased.</li>
    <li> Smell very well but when you turn the perfume spill the product.</li>
    <li> Like this scent ony man.</li>
    <li> This is knock off, don&#x27;t buy and be dissapointed like i was to find a watered down version of D&amp;G. Its not even the real signiture bottle and doesn&#x27;t even compare to the real D&amp;G.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d hoped for be sure you have smelt it an like it before ordering.</li>
    <li> D &amp; G at a good price. I do not care for cheap colognes or aftershaves - this stuff is very subtle and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Period! Never leaving my apt without a spray. At night, I use 5-6 sprays. Ladies loves it and your friends will be jealous.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband as a Christmas gift. He loves it, I love it, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I bought this after I liked it at macy&#x27;s store. But This one is not very strong, I think I tested another perfume from same brand at macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it as well as their cologne, which is what I thought I was buying. The odor is a bit sweet and it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
