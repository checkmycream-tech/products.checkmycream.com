      <li>but  i can live with it.........</li>
      <li>Recently realized it does snag a little, but it is better than my safety pin method</li>
      <li>It works but it&#x27;s really too big for my Sisterlocks.</li>
      <li>much too long and flimsy for my loc tightening.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty nifty tool that I find useful for picking dirt out of my locks, but haven&#x27;t learned to use it quite like a hook for knitting my loose dreads tight.</li>
      <li>Thought the tool was at least a more stronger plastic.this same tool can be found at your local hair store for $.59.</li>

    <li> Worked very well with my locs. I gently twisted the root theN wove the loc through in to directions. No tension in my scalp and no painful clips. Also good for catching all of the loose hair and new growth.</li>
    <li> Love it this tool is great. Very neat package  and delivery. My hair  root  is neat when i use this tool..... have to get another  one for my reserve. Yes it is  not strudy but  i can live with it.........</li>
    <li> Thoroughly pleased with this product and company. The owner is more than helpful and on top of their game. The product, although small and cheap (monetarily speaking), was packaged beautifully and with care. It truly is better than any latch hook or crochet needle I&#x27;ve ever used. It bends so it moves with the way my locs are formed instead of having to be forced through the loc and ripping it up. And painless too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that this tool is available. After 10 years, I have decided to retighten my locs myself.  This tool makes perfect sense. Absolutely pleased.</li>
    <li> Thought it was metal when ordered per photo. However, pricewise should sale for no more than  $2.00. Product works well, now able to lock my own hair.</li>
    <li> product works well but does snag. I literally had to cut it out of one of my dreads</li>
    <li> I am rating the actual product&#x27;s appearance and not the quality itself. I think the product was packed very well and it was pleasing. The reason for the lower rating is due to the size. The item was huge and I was expecting something much smaller that I could use. Perhaps more emphasis  on the actual size would be wonderful. I cannot even use it. 😕</li>
    <li> It works but it&#x27;s really too big for my Sisterlocks. I wish there was a smaller version.  But, for bigger locks it&#x27;s a great product --very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and makes the hair look way better.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tool; it makes  the interlocking process  so easy and keeps my hair looking neat all the time. I love that I don&#x27;t have to pay extra money to maintain my hair .I&#x27;m glad that I kept searching until I found this hair tool.</li>
    <li> by far the worst dreadlock product I have ever* used on my hair. My hair got snagged in the &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; on the little piece of plastic and without any force it broke. I would give this no stars. An absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> This item is soooooo much bigger than I needed to maintain/tighten sisterlocks. I&#x27;m looking for something that is bigger than the tool in the beading kit,  which is great for repairing locs, but not THIS big.  I don&#x27;t recall seeing any length noted in the description on line.  If it was there, I missed it.  What would have helped is a picture of it being used on an actual head so a person would note the tool to head/loc size scale. It&#x27;s even bigger than I would need to tighten traditional locks.</li>
    <li> Already bent up point but does its job</li>
    <li> bigger than pictured.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It was too long for my locks</li>
    <li> great item, very easy to use, love it!</li>
    <li> There is a point on the inside of the loop that snagged my hair. So the claim of snagless. No it isn&#x27;t.  However I do enjoy the product, I am just cautious when it comes to that.</li>
    <li> Instructions were unclear, but did not take long to figure it out.  I has been very east to lose, and broke fairly quickly as well.  I would purchase another if you could get two or three for what I paid for one.</li>
    <li> This is great in concept. I have Sisterlocks and appreciated that I could use this tool on my very thin locs, but I agree with the other reviewer concerning the snagging. It definitely snags the hair during tightenings. I had to cut the tool in order to get it out of my hair because it became tangled in it. I saw a diagram for a homemade tool which is similar to this one that is made out of guitar strings, so I may try that instead.</li>
    <li> This thing is Flimsy...the shape distorted after working 2 lochs.</li>
    <li> much too long and flimsy for my loc tightening.</li>
    <li> I plastic piece of crap. To big, to flemzy. I bought two. First one bent etc. And was trash before my hair was done! Disgusted I went to youtube to learn how to make a tool with a hairpin. Used that instead. Total waste of $$ &amp; very disappointing.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Has worked well for my son!</li>
    <li> It works and is super easy! It doesn&#x27;t snag my hair. Tightened my dreads in no time!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nifty tool that I find useful for picking dirt out of my locks, but haven&#x27;t learned to use it quite like a hook for knitting my loose dreads tight. This is cheap, flimsy plastic and a fair price would $2 for one in my opinion, especially considering shipping cost.</li>
    <li> I love the concept and the ease of use, but I wish the plastic were sturdier. The tip is already going a bit bent on me. Not just good for roots but also good for tips as well!</li>
    <li> Too long and tangles in the hair</li>
    <li> I got the item today opened it tried using it and it broke this thing is over priced and very cheap I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> Awesome product and so much easier to use than a latch hook! Took half of the time off of tightening my locks. And yes it does snag because if the small bump of plastic located in the eye of the product.. but it was nothing compared to a latch hook! Very pleased and I def recommend!</li>
    <li> Really stimulates my scalp when I wash my hair. Better than using my nails</li>
    <li> This product is simply over priced. Have no idea how to use it. Claim to have a video, but the web page cannot be found. Thought the tool was at least a more stronger plastic.this same tool can be found at your local hair store for $.59. Iam returning.</li>
    <li> Really like. Recently realized it does snag a little, but it is better than my safety pin method</li>
