      <li>fi is a great product but in my opinion I like the smell</li>
      <li>this is the best pomade i have ever used, the best part about is it washes out very quickly and easily but stays in during the day.</li>

      <li>I like this product and believe it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
      <li>This is a good pomade.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing on my hair.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
      <li>It is medium hold so it will give you the shape you want and leaves your hair nice and shiny.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best pomade that I have used.</li>
      <li>A lighter one would work better for finer hair.</li>
      <li>More substantial hold than mousse.  </li>
      <li>It \\&quot;styles\\&quot; your hair without it becoming crunchy or feeling unnatural.</li>
      <li>It holds all day and washes out easily.</li>
      <li>This little thing is perfect for my needs.</li>
      <li>This light pomade is a great beginner set for those who are just starting to use.</li>
      <li>It also gives a light and pleasing scent in your hair.</li>
      <li>Very useful for anyone sporting a &amp;#34;Gentleman&#x27;s Cut&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Light weight with enough hold, and doesn&#x27;t leave things greasy, with pleasant fragrance added.</li>
      <li>but I think it was originally made for men..</li>
      <li>It seems to do a pretty good job, but there are similar cheaper products around.</li>
      <li>The fragrance of the product is about right for a men&#x27;s line.</li>
      <li>Perfect product due to that it holds your hair and it shines giving the wet look.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize the 3 oz was only 3 dollars more until after I purchased the 1.75 oz.</li>
      <li>Then use a hot hair drier for an even matte finish.</li>
      <li>$10 for 1.75 oz is pretty steep.</li>
      <li>; I hadn&#x27;t used it before and looked it up and bought this one first off.</li>
      <li>I agree with the first review .  </li>
      <li>o American Crew better.</li>
      <li>I love the product, however, I did not realize that 1.75oz is the tiny size.</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair, but it can be very stubborn about its direction when I want a slicked back ponytail, and this stuff works like a charm</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use pomade very often, but when I do I turn to this stuff.</li>
      <li>However, I wish that American Crew made a light hold rather than a medium one.  </li>
      <li>Decent pomade but leaves a lot of residue in your hair.</li>
      <li>Is it worth ten bucks?</li>
      <li>I especially like it since the hair will hold but will not look crisp like it used to when I used gel.</li>
      <li>For the size of the container I&#x27;m not entirely sold on it, but you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done!</li>
      <li>It holds it in place without making it hard like most gels.</li>
      <li>I have mildly curly hair and adding this just out of the shower gives it a full curl which finally takes me out of the irritating middle ground.</li>
      <li>Hold could be a little stronger but definitely makes my thick hair more manageable</li>

<li> This product works well for my hair (thick, coarse, and straight).  </li>
<li> The product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol and gives my hair a natural look-not shiny and stiff.</li>
<li> With a few brush or comb strokes 1/2 half hour later , or once dry</li>
<li> , I put through my hair (a little goes a long way).</li>
<li> Spread a little over your fingers then through your hair while it is partially damp.</li>
<li> The only complaint that I have is that it smells manly, like cologne</li>
<li> Very small only about  half the size of the ones I have bought in the past.</li>
<li> Not greasy or heavy.</li>
<li> The shine fades after a few hours but will keep its shape and is re-formable with just a little water and a stiff brush.  </li>
<li> I use it usually to lay my edges and flyaways down.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little too small for my liking.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
<li> so you can use it everyday without ridiculous buildup or excessive wash time.</li>
<li> only bad thing is, it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the small jar you get.</li>
<li> Bought it cause it was less expensive than where I get my hair cut, Sports Clips.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is by far the best pomade that I have used. It holds all day and washes out easily. It also gives a light and pleasing scent in your hair. The only thing I wish I had done differently is order a larger jar.</li>
    <li> Best Pomade available. Very useful for anyone sporting a &amp;#34;Gentleman&#x27;s Cut&amp;#34;. The only thing I&#x27;ve found that is cheaper and works almost as well is Alberto Pomade. Doesn&#x27;t wash out as well as the American Crew Pomade imho</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little too small for my liking.  I know there is another size up which you used to carry...why stop?</li>
    <li> Very small only about  half the size of the ones I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> I like this product and believe it&#x27;s a good value.  However, I wish that American Crew made a light hold rather than a medium one.  A lighter one would work better for finer hair.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol and gives my hair a natural look-not shiny and stiff. I would recommend this if you are trying to switch from gel.</li>
    <li> This is a good pomade. It is medium hold so it will give you the shape you want and leaves your hair nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> The best size for travel. This stuff lasts forever. Spread a little over your fingers then through your hair while it is partially damp. Then use a hot hair drier for an even matte finish. Light weight with enough hold, and doesn&#x27;t leave things greasy, with pleasant fragrance added.</li>
    <li> I agree with the first review .  I&#x27;ve been using it for over three three years on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s left in my hands, I put through my hair (a little goes a long way). With a few brush or comb strokes 1/2 half hour later , or once dry,  you&#x27;re looking like you put nothing on at all.</li>
    <li> Not greasy or heavy. This light pomade is a great beginner set for those who are just starting to use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing on my hair. It holds it in place without making it hard like most gels. I use it usually to lay my edges and flyaways down. The only complaint that I have is that it smells manly, like cologne but I think it was originally made for men..</li>
    <li> I asked the person who cut my hair last what she uses and she said &amp;#34;pomade.&amp;#34; I hadn&#x27;t used it before and looked it up and bought this one first off. The American Crew Pomade works well and I&#x27;m loving it. I especially like it since the hair will hold but will not look crisp like it used to when I used gel. I&#x27;ve integrated this into my daily routine and expect to get it again next time.</li>
    <li> Bought it cause it was less expensive than where I get my hair cut, Sports Clips.  Use it daily and no issues.</li>
    <li> Hold could be a little stronger but definitely makes my thick hair more manageable</li>
    <li> Decent pomade but leaves a lot of residue in your hair.</li>
    <li> Not what i was looking for</li>
    <li> Perfect product due to that it holds your hair and it shines giving the wet look.  D:fi is a great product but in my opinion I like the smell o American Crew better.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done.  More substantial hold than mousse.  The fragrance of the product is about right for a men&#x27;s line.</li>
    <li> This product works well for my hair (thick, coarse, and straight).  I use it to help manage my hair and keep it from looking like albert einstein when i grow it out.  The shine fades after a few hours but will keep its shape and is re-formable with just a little water and a stiff brush.  The best part is it washes out (water soluble) so you can use it everyday without ridiculous buildup or excessive wash time.</li>
    <li> Is it worth ten bucks? I&#x27;m not sure. It seems to do a pretty good job, but there are similar cheaper products around. It \\&quot;styles\\&quot; your hair without it becoming crunchy or feeling unnatural. I have mildly curly hair and adding this just out of the shower gives it a full curl which finally takes me out of the irritating middle ground. For the size of the container I&#x27;m not entirely sold on it, but you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done!</li>
    <li> My son loves this product</li>
    <li> This little thing is perfect for my needs. I don&#x27;t use pomade very often, but when I do I turn to this stuff. I have straight fine hair, but it can be very stubborn about its direction when I want a slicked back ponytail, and this stuff works like a charm</li>

    <li> I love the product, however, I did not realize that 1.75oz is the tiny size. $10 for 1.75 oz is pretty steep.</li>
