      <li>You might want to try a great  recipe that I found on the internet (passionatehomemaking.com) for making your own deodorant.</li>
      <li>Fresh product, awesome scent.</li>
      <li>I have yet to find a product by Desert Essence that I don&#x27;t love!</li>

      <li>Good health is something we should all be able to enjoy, and companies like this one could care less...appalling.</li>

      <li>okay,</li>
      <li>I know that some people are concerned with baking soda containing aluminum, but please look into the matter a bit more.</li>
      <li>-you know how your body works, so if you need more baking soda to control odor, then add it.</li>
      <li>For me: Nature&#x27;s Gate Deodorant, Tea Tree &amp; Blue Cypress works the best.</li>
      <li>I am sure no one else would be able to smell it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Propylene Glycol is perfectly safe unless you have a sensitivity to it, so I will be seeking out another aluminum-free product.</li>
      <li>I know that some people are concerned with baking soda containing aluminum, but please look into the matter a bit more.</li>
      <li>A hundred times better than the Thai liquid spray deodorant that I also recommended.</li>
      <li>and it claims to be safe.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
      <li>I am so glad I gave this deodorant a chance.</li>
      <li>Definitely a better alternative to the more commercialized/mainstream products.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>super nice for the healthy and clean alternative.</li>
      <li>But for a natural aluminum free deodorant it works great on keeping the stink away, and I think it mostly has to do with the tea tree oil</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like a deodorant with aluminium but works great for a natural one.</li>
      <li>so I decided to try something a bit more readily available.</li>
      <li>Ok, here is the original recipe, with my adjusted recipe following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ok, here is the original recipe, with my adjusted recipe following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it was fine.</li>
      <li>was just about to resort to making my own using coconut oil &amp; baking soda, but this was on sale one day at Whole Foods, so I decided to try it out.</li>
      <li>The one pictured here is no longer available.</li>
      <li>Has good scent, works well naturally.  </li>
      <li>I think most women are on chemical overload, and I have been purging my cabinets for several months now, and have never felt better!</li>
      <li>deodorant is promoted as &#x27;propylene glycol and aluminum free&#x27;, yet propanediol is the very first ingredient.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been about a week, and I am loving it so far!</li>
      <li>I am just glad I don&#x27;t have to make a trip to Whole Foods to purchase this item.</li>
      <li>Luckily I have a back-up stick at work</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hands down, best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Anyway, so that lead me to try something more natural.</li>
      <li>fun fact...  </li>
      <li>Bought this to try to switch to something more natural with fewer chemicals.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It can be absorbed through the skin with harmful effects, and is not recommended for handling.</li>
      <li>Baking soda comes from the earth, and with many naturally occuring materials, it will contain trace elements, keyword being \\&quot;trace\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Works much better than jason or toms natural deodorant for me.</li>
      <li>Baking soda comes from the earth, and with many naturally occuring materials, it will contain trace elements, keyword being \\&quot;trace\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The old product worked great for years and then suddenly stopped working.</li>
      <li>This one is very effective with just a little.</li>
      <li>I received it right away.  </li>
      <li>If I have a particular hot sweaty day may have to reapply, but very rare.</li>
      <li>Shipping is super fast.</li>
      <li>It lasts the whole day even if it is warm outside.</li>
      <li>First some tips, then I&#x27;ll get to the recipe.</li>
      <li>Here is the exact dictionary definition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The advertising on this deodorant promoted a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product, yet the first ingredient is Propylene Glycol.</li>
      <li>the only downer is that it doesn&#x27;t have a refreshing scent.  </li>
      <li>Not recommended unless you&#x27;re ok with having to reapply your deodorant several times a day.</li>
      <li>twice a day when I went out in hot weather.</li>
      <li>It is the most similar to an aluminum stick deodorant i have used comparatively on smell</li>
      <li>Better than Toms and equal to Herbal Clear but more natural.</li>
      <li>So far this is not only the most natural (very few sketchy ingredients) product I have found, but also it works the best of all I have tried.</li>
      <li>My personal opinion, for what it&#x27;s worth, is that it is fine to use.</li>
      <li>My personal opinion, for what it&#x27;s worth, is that it is fine to use.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s positive antibacterial effects.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff - it works pretty much all day as long as it is applied liberally.</li>
      <li>I have tried several more natural deodorants, including Tom&#x27;s, and a Body Shop brand one, but still had issues with b.o., and issues with irritation - after several days of use, I had to discontinue both products because my armpits were so itchy and were developing a rash - lovely, I</li>
      <li>it Shipped quickly and it last a long time making me smell fresh and so clean, clean.</li>
      <li>I can go most normal days with one application, on especially perspiration inducing days two will cover it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my husband because he is allergic to certain deodorant sticks.  </li>
      <li>she really like it has a lite scent and has hours of protection</li>
      <li>If it is too wet, add more arrowroot powder to thicken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s much safer for my body than the brands that have aluminum.  </li>
      <li>If it is too wet, add more arrowroot powder to thicken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells very herbal and manly.</li>
      <li>Really depend on it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than I expected.</li>
      <li>I will say that this takes care of odar, but I didn&#x27;t really have a problem in that department to begin with.</li>
      <li>This stick with the tree tea oil works really well on BO even over night.</li>
      <li>I really wanted it to work because it didn&#x27;t have aluminum and a bunch of chemicals in it like the stronger deodorants</li>
      <li>It no longer contains propylene glycol, which may please some people, but it absolutely stopped working for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll just buy it, surely it will work if it worked for all these other sweaty people.</li>
      <li>Ok, so if you are not aware, Propylene Glycol can cause abnormalities in the heart, liver and even lead to kidney disease.</li>
      <li>Not bad, but not effective for more than a couple of hours.</li>

    <li> The advertising on this deodorant promoted a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product, yet the first ingredient is Propylene Glycol. Ok, so if you are not aware, Propylene Glycol can cause abnormalities in the heart, liver and even lead to kidney disease. This is a very dangerous product! DO NOT BUY THIS! Good health is something we should all be able to enjoy, and companies like this one could care less...appalling.</li>
    <li> leaves a rash does not last long (barley half of the day and iam not a sweaty person) not even really organic or natural all lies&lt;br /&gt;horrible horrible i do not recommend them at all&lt;br /&gt;there service is quite disgusting too&lt;br /&gt;took about a while to come in&lt;br /&gt;i asked them a question they didn&#x27;t even reply properly&lt;br /&gt;NEVER AGAIN ! DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Love it! The deodorant smells great, considering it has tea tree oil in it! It lasts the whole day even if it is warm outside. I found that I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply mid way through the day.  Definitely a better alternative to the more commercialized/mainstream products. I feel healthier already!</li>
    <li> Wonderful natural deodorant.  Has good scent, works well naturally.  No chemicals and effective product.  Long lasting because of delivery method.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I hope. Can I know everything thats in it..NOPE! But I like it and it claims to be safe. I will have to go on that. Faith People. Faith.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 15 years.  I think it&#x27;s much safer for my body than the brands that have aluminum.  It takes a while to get used to underarms being moist, but as long as there is no odor, it&#x27;s my #1 choice.  The tea-tree oil and lavender are antibacterial and keep odors away...at least for me!</li>
    <li> Love ir, good forma muy skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using another natural deodorant for a while, but I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it in stores or online so I decided to try something a bit more readily available. I read a few reviews and also found some articles online recommending this brand and the lavender scent. Unfortunately the first day I used it, I could smell myself by lunchtime. Luckily I have a back-up stick at work so I reapplied. However, by the time I got home later that evening, I caught a whiff of BO again. I&#x27;m not an abnormally sweaty or stinky person, so I figured maybe I need a few days with it to acclimate to my body. Nope, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I still get a hint of BO midday. I even have to reapply this before bed so I don&#x27;t knock my husband out with odor overnight. I&#x27;m going to switch to another brand after I road test a few, but I won&#x27;t be using this again. Not recommended unless you&#x27;re ok with having to reapply your deodorant several times a day.</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to be more aware of what I am exposing my body to daily, and with this comes a lot of product changes, with deodorant being one of the major ones. I have tried several more natural deodorants, including Tom&#x27;s, and a Body Shop brand one, but still had issues with b.o., and issues with irritation - after several days of use, I had to discontinue both products because my armpits were so itchy and were developing a rash - lovely, I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just about to resort to making my own using coconut oil &amp; baking soda, but this was on sale one day at Whole Foods, so I decided to try it out. It&#x27;s been about a week, and I am loving it so far! Of course, it&#x27;s not the same as using my old antiperspirant, so there is a little wetness to deal with, but this does a pretty good job of halting any b.o. I have noticed a little on very hot days in Southern California, but only when I&#x27;m doing the \\&quot;sniff test\\&quot; on myself. I am sure no one else would be able to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Bought this to try to switch to something more natural with fewer chemicals. I had used an antiperspirant for years, but sometime about 2-3 years ago antiperspirants started making my pits smell awful, I guess the chemicals in them mixed with my sweat in some new way. So, about a year ago, I switched to regular non-antiperspirant deodorant, and even though I sweated, it never stunk. But about a month or so ago, when applying the deodorant, I would get a burning sensation, and redness on the outside corners of my pits. Seemed like a chemical burn maybe? I assume it was a developed allergic reaction. Anyway, so that lead me to try something more natural. This is the 1st one I&#x27;ve tried, but after giving my pits some time to heal by not wearing any deodorant (thankfully I usually work from home), I tried this out. It doesn&#x27;t prevent stinkyness at all. I still sweated, as expected, but the sweat smells bad, like it&#x27;s mixing badly with the deodorant like the antiperspirants would do. I can only guess that propylene glycol is the ingredient that used to work for me, and whatever is in this doesn&#x27;t. Guess it&#x27;s on to something else... a shame, too, because I like Desert Essence&#x27;s tea tree toothpaste, it works well. :\</li>
    <li> And they don&#x27;t have this at my health food store. I don&#x27;t sweat a lot it&#x27;s just for insurance so I&#x27;m not sure how strong it is but so far it has been excellent. I notice a difference without it</li>
    <li> but once I tried it, I loved it! It&#x27;s better than I expected. It works and that&#x27;s all I could ask for. It is not the BEST, but for a natural deodorant, it&#x27;s excellent. If my day isn&#x27;t going to be extremely hot or full of heavy activity, I use this.</li>
    <li> I will say that this takes care of odar, but I didn&#x27;t really have a problem in that department to begin with. I still sweat likea pig with this stuff.</li>
    <li> smells good, works well, didn&#x27;t test it under harsh circumstances but does the trick! super nice for the healthy and clean alternative. recommend it!</li>
    <li> So far this is not only the most natural (very few sketchy ingredients) product I have found, but also it works the best of all I have tried. I can go most normal days with one application, on especially perspiration inducing days two will cover it. Better than Toms and equal to Herbal Clear but more natural. I have yet to find a product by Desert Essence that I don&#x27;t love!</li>
    <li> Product came as described &amp; pictured. Shipping is super fast. I&#x27;ve used this product for a while now, it works for my needs. I am just glad I don&#x27;t have to make a trip to Whole Foods to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Fresh product, awesome scent.</li>
    <li> I researched this deodorant for weeks, reading reviews, reading about tea tree oil and it&#x27;s positive antibacterial effects. People said they sweat a lot and that this deodorant stayed on all day long without having to be touched up often, if at all. I thought, okay, I&#x27;ll just buy it, surely it will work if it worked for all these other sweaty people. Apparently, these people sweat nowhere NEAR the amount I sweat. This deodorant was off before I even got the chance to leave the house. And I sweat a lot, I sweat when it&#x27;s freezing out, so I expected a lot from this deodorant. It didn&#x27;t even get close to meeting expectations. I really wanted it to work because it didn&#x27;t have aluminum and a bunch of chemicals in it like the stronger deodorants I&#x27;m accustomed to using. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you sweat a lot because it will be off faster than you can almost put it on. I&#x27;ll just stick with my soft solid Secret. It works the best without ruining my clothes and I don&#x27;t have to put it on 50 times a day.</li>
    <li> Looking for a natural, milder alternative to supermarket antiperspirant that works.  This has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have found that doesn&#x27;t have the yucky stuff in it and still works.  It is NOT an anti-perspirant so you will still sweat but that doesnt bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely reccommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t to use a deodorant with aluminum in it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - it works pretty much all day as long as it is applied liberally. It did take a week longer than expected to show up, but that&#x27;s to be expected when using USPS around Black Friday. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I would purchase from this supplier again. It did cause a little bit of irritation after about 4-5 days of use, but I used my old deodorant for one day and started using this again and it was fine. So, as long as I take a day break every week or so it works great.</li>
    <li> This stick with the tree tea oil works really well on BO even over night. the only downer is that it doesn&#x27;t have a refreshing scent.  But for a natural aluminum free deodorant it works great on keeping the stink away, and I think it mostly has to do with the tea tree oil so I couldn&#x27;t tell you how this brand does if it doesn&#x27;t contain the oil and is just a scented stick.  It is the most similar to an aluminum stick deodorant i have used comparatively on smell, I don&#x27;t know about sweating, I have yet to do a really hard work out for the sweat test. but I am of the opinion it is good for your body to sweat and then you need a shower anyway so what does it matter. Hopefully this helps.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who likes natural products she really like it has a lite scent and has hours of protection</li>
    <li> Been using this for over 12 years. Unlike a lot of deodorants laden with perfumes and chemicals, there is no negative skin reaction to wearing this. They did change the formula a bit a few years ago, however, and since then a get a few of them that will disintegrate and break off part way through. I assume it is because of their desire to make it even more natural, but it is frustrating when a chunk breaks off and falls on the floor. But it is still a great deodorant that goes on well, works well, and does not cause skin reactions.</li>
    <li> I was using antiperspirant for the longest time before realizing the error of my ways. When I stopped using it, my body had a lot of toxins to discard and this was the only deodorant that helped. It smells great. I love it. I only wish they removed corn starch from the ingredients because I do have a sensitivity to corn.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works good . I apply it liberally under my arm and it works well enough. It&#x27;s not like a deodorant with aluminium but works great for a natural one.</li>
    <li> Sticky and did not work for me at all :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> For me: Nature&#x27;s Gate Deodorant, Tea Tree &amp; Blue Cypress works the best. Then this product. And third:  Earth Science Tea Tree/Lavender Deodorant. But as a guy, I prefer the one that is not lavender.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband because he is allergic to certain deodorant sticks.  This worked quite well for him, I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> They have CHANGED the formula of this product. It no longer contains propylene glycol, which may please some people, but it absolutely stopped working for me. The old product worked great for years and then suddenly stopped working. I thought that I had bought the wrong deodorant, but when I checked I saw the completely new ingredients. Sadly, they didn&#x27;t even change the item number or UPC code of this totally different product, so you don&#x27;t even know what you&#x27;re buying when you order it online. The one pictured here is no longer available. You may get someone who has old stock, but they have stopped manufacturing it. I won&#x27;t be buying it anymore. Propylene Glycol is perfectly safe unless you have a sensitivity to it, so I will be seeking out another aluminum-free product. Sigh. . .</li>
    <li> I get this for my husband who has very sensitive armpits and it actually works! It smells very herbal and manly.</li>
    <li> Works much better than jason or toms natural deodorant for me. Love the scent not too overpowering. If I have a particular hot sweaty day may have to reapply, but very rare.</li>
    <li> I ordered this deodorant because I am trying to make natural changes in my personal care products. I think most women are on chemical overload, and I have been purging my cabinets for several months now, and have never felt better! Your skin is your biggest organ, and vital for detox.  It absorbs what you apply to it, and pounding it with chemical laden beauty products day after day (and year after year) takes its toll.  Chemical overload can make you lethargic, throw your hormones out of balance, affect your thyroid, and lead to a host of other health problems; cancer, kidney failure, you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is promoted as &#x27;propylene glycol and aluminum free&#x27;, yet propanediol is the very first ingredient.  Propanediol can be a petroleum derivative, and shows systemic retention.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Propylene glycol, also called 1,2-propanediol or propane-1,2-diol\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead, look it up! Here is the exact dictionary definition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Noun 1.propanediol - a sweet colorless, viscous, hygroscopic liquid used as an antifreeze and in brake fluid and also as a humectant in cosmetics and personal care items although it can be absorbed through the skin with harmful effects\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propanediol/propylene glycol is used in automatic brake fluid and antifreeze.  It&#x27;s used in deodorant to prevent loss of moisture. It is a neurotoxin that can cause liver damage and kidney problems.  Workers are advised not to handle it, \\&quot;From the MSDS: \\&quot;May cause eye irritation, skin irritation. Chronic exposure can cause gastro-intestinal disturbances, nausea, headache, vomiting, and central nervous depression.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be absorbed through the skin with harmful effects, and is not recommended for handling. So what is it doing in this deodorant, that cost me double compared to my usual one? Should I go back to using Dove, which works a lot better, doesn&#x27;t burn my armpits, and at least I KNOW that Dove deodorant ingredients are crap.  They don&#x27;t hide behind a false label, peddling natural deodorant with hidden chemicals in it. Either way, this Desert Essence deodorant is getting returned.  If I am going to use a deodorant with chemicals in it, I will at least use one that works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does the Desert Essence one stack up?? Well, it leaves your armpits perpetually sticky, probably due to the overload of propanediol which makes skin feel moist, and it burns like crazy when applied after waxing or&lt;br /&gt;epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fun fact...  \\&quot;The FDA has banned or restricted only nine personal care product ingredients. For comparison, the European Union has banned 450.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: So, I tried the Thai deodorant spray and it worked for me for about a year, then it just stopped.  I don&#x27;t know if it expired, or if it was something to do with me, but I turned to trying to make my own. You might want to try a great  recipe that I found on the internet (passionatehomemaking.com) for making your own deodorant. It&#x27;s cheap, and I have tried several homemade deodorant recipes, this has been the only one that worked, and I mean it WORKED! A hundred times better than the Thai liquid spray deodorant that I also recommended. I had to apply it once a day in cool weather, when I wasn&#x27;t really active, and twice a day when I went out in hot weather. But it works! I am over the moon for this recipe-it&#x27;s not sticky or irritating. First some tips, then I&#x27;ll get to the recipe. It does make white marks on clothes, but you can either wipe marks off with a damp washcloth, or they come off when you launder them. Second, I adjusted the recipe by using less baking soda because I had read tips that if your armpits were sensitive or irritated by the deodorant, to use less baking soda. So, I just used less to begin with and it STILL WORKS! Just adjust the recipe for you-you know how your body works, so if you need more baking soda to control odor, then add it. Also, it said that you can save an old deodorant container to fill with this. I am going to try that today, and will update after I do. I also keep mine in the refrigerator, because it is natural and there are no preservatives, so I think that might be best. I know that some people are concerned with baking soda containing aluminum, but please look into the matter a bit more. Baking soda comes from the earth, and with many naturally occuring materials, it will contain trace elements, keyword being \\&quot;trace\\&quot;. My personal opinion, for what it&#x27;s worth, is that it is fine to use. It&#x27;s not even comparable to the junk in traditional deodorants, so just go for it. Ok, here is the original recipe, with my adjusted recipe following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-8 Tablespoons coconut oil (I use organic, unrefined, cold pressed)&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup baking soda&lt;br /&gt;1/4 cup arrowroot powder (found some at my local health food store, five bucks for a big bag!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine equal portions of arrowroot powder and baking soda. Slowly add in coconut oil and work in with a spoon (I used a fork, it works much better) until it maintains a firm but pliable texture (don&#x27;t make it too runny). If it is too wet, add more arrowroot powder to thicken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, this how I made mine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;put just less than 1/2 cup arrowroot powder in a bowl. Add one heaping tablespoon of baking soda. Stir together. Add coconut oil, one tablespoon at a time, while mashing with a fork. When it gets to be the texture of mashed potatoes, then you have added enough oil. It is cool here, so I put my mixture in the microwave for ten seconds to melt it a little bit, this made it easier to mix. Just mix and mix, then put a lid on it and put it in the fridge, or pour it in an old deodorant container. It does get pretty hard in the fridge, so you might want to take it out about an hour before you use it. It melts when it contacts skin, so that&#x27;s not too big of a deal. I am crazy for this recipe because it is truly natural, it works (that&#x27;s important!) and its cheap! Hallelujah!g to try that today, and will update after I do.

    <li> Not bad, but not effective for more than a couple of hours. Still beats the unhealthy ingredients in some of the other deodorants</li>
    <li> Works all day. No overt fragrance. Lasts almost a year. Really depend on it. Tried an herbal clear sport DO in a yellow tube with &amp;#34;great review&amp;#34; that caused a bad smell. So back to this. This one is very effective with just a little.</li>
    <li> Customer service was great.  I received it right away.  However, the product didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> No aluminum. I have used old spice for years and finally got sick of smelling like a man. I am so glad I gave this deodorant a chance. it Shipped quickly and it last a long time making me smell fresh and so clean, clean.</li>
