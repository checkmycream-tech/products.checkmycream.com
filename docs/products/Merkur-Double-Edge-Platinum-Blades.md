      <li>These blades are great and hold a sharp edge.</li>

      <li>GIVES A SUPER CLOSE SHAVE.</li>

      <li>Merkur are expensive but this was the best price I found.</li>
      <li>But, when it comes to blades, while I have no objective data to support my oppinion, I feel like Feather blades give me a better shave longer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My amazing wife bought me a Merkur Soligen razor, a high quailty product indeed. So, I used these Merkur Double Platinum Blades for the first time, and I can NOT stress the closeness of my shave.  At first, I was a bit apprehensive, having used blades with strips, vibrating handle and other various extras.  BUT, this gave me THE closest shave ever, and at 44, that&#x27;s saying something.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to install&lt;br /&gt;* PRICE (50 blades is LESS than $30)&lt;br /&gt;* Quality shave, close and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Nothing I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Good quality razor.  Sharp enough to shave and doesn&#x27;t knick the skin causing bleeds</li>
    <li> These are the first blades that my husband used with his safety razor.  He&#x27;s going to try others just to see how they are, but he says these are good and will keep buying them.</li>
    <li> Best blades I have used. I can use one blade for about a 1.5-2 weeks. I use art of shaving sandalwood cream, also a good choice.</li>
    <li> These are the best double edge blades I&#x27;ve tried.  Consistent quality and long-lasting edge.  I frequently get five or six shaves from each blade.</li>
    <li> Great way to save money on shaving.  Great quality blades that shave closer than the cheap disposable ones.</li>
    <li> As advertised. This blades are the best for my skin although I think the Germans are compromising quality over profits. The sharpness has decreased and they feel like only last for one shave.</li>
    <li> i dont grow much facial hair so i shave maybe 3-4 times a week.    i change my blades about once every two - 3 weeks.    these blades really start shaving well after the 3rd use.  very smooth and comfortable    i am a lifelong fan    5/5</li>
    <li> These blades are quality. I have purchased quite a few different brands and these hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note* TSA will not let you travel with these. They will throw them away.</li>
    <li> I have never before used a safety razor in the 23 years I been shaving till tonight I saw reviews on YouTube on how to use a safety razor and I used it and didn&#x27;t cut myself at all! Best shave I ever had it takes some getting used to. I shaved a thick 2 week old beard off in 2 passes very very close shave I recommend using brush on shaving soap ( better and cheaper than shaving cream) it&#x27;s a keeper for me</li>
    <li> I started using these a couple of years ago because I got tired of paying $50 for 3 month&#x27;s worth of disposable blades and thought I&#x27;d try it old-school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, there was a bit of a learning curve to the razor but now I get a close, clean shave and a year&#x27;s blades for $30.</li>
    <li> Great shave. Great price. Use them everyday with my safety razor. It is just like the blades that my Dad used and I love them. However be careful of the razor you use with them, they are sharp and you had better have a styptic pencil on hand!</li>
    <li> These blades and the Shark blades are my favorite.  They are effective on a tough beard without the nicks and irritation I have experienced with other blades.  When I converted to shaving with a double edge razor (I use a Merkur razor as well), I bought one of the variety packs of blades (with maybe 42 types), and it included both the Merkur and the Shark.  The Merkur are more expensive but I continue to buy them because they work very well.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product my husband always buys this brand as the knock offs don&#x27;t even compare. The shave that this blade deliveries is far superior to the disposable ones. Plus they are a more Eco-friendly product.</li>
    <li> We originally found these where we found the razor.  They were out, so we ordered on Amazon.  Great blades, quick shipping, great shaves with them.  They definitely are much smoother and last much longer than store-bought blades.</li>
    <li> Been using Merkur blades &amp; razor for over 50 years/there is nothing on the market that comes&lt;br /&gt;close Merkur!</li>
    <li> Great price for this many.</li>
    <li> After having a great experience with the Merkur razor I purchased from Amazon, I ordered this large lot of replacement blades, thinking that I had found my long term razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, these blades were too small and did not actually do any shaving when I put them on my Merkur razor, despite it claiming to fit all Merkur styles.</li>
    <li> Awesome and far cheaper than specialty shaving websites.</li>
    <li> These blades are great and hold a sharp edge. Normally I can go up to two weeks of dailey shaving before having to change a blade, which means I am spending $30 to shave for two years. I will never go back to the pricey disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Used these blades for my razor, they are perfect and always sharp. Will continue to purchase these in the future.</li>
    <li> I converted to a safety razor years ago and never looked back, and I&#x27;ve always trusted Merkur blades. I tried Feather blades once but tossed them all because they don&#x27;t play well with my face beard. These Merkur blades are indistinguishable from other Merkur blades I&#x27;ve used in the past, and buying in bulk is convenient, especially if you replace your blade every shave (I only shave about once a week; more often than that and my face gets irritated, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the blades; when I used cartridge blades my face would always get irritated).</li>
    <li> Spend a few extra $$$ and don&#x27;t rip the hell out of your face with cheapo blades.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with severe razor burn from the double, triple and quadruple blades that we nowadays use.  My skin is way too sensitive.  I switched to these blades and started using facial cream instead of water and shaving cream.  My face is clearing up and my skin is busy returning to normal.  Truly an excellent product, giving a close shave, but not overly tearing up the facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many double edge blades in the past. Merkur blades are the best! They keep their edge longer than others!</li>
    <li> When I first started with DE shaving I thought I could just get the cheap CVS blades. Bad idea! Spend the money and your face will thank you!!</li>
    <li> Really like these; ultra sharp.  I shave my face every other day, and I shave my head once per week. 1 blade lasts me a full weeks worth of shaving. less than $4 per month in blades.</li>
    <li> I get a nice clean shave with these blades. After about 2 saves I got the hang of it. I was use to the 2, 3 &amp; 4 blade systems. I wanted to go old school like my dad use to use and I love it.</li>
    <li> First time using double edge razor and I have no intention of going back to cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> I have tried about six or seven different types of double edge blades and these Merkurs are the best.  They last at least double the amount of shaves that I get, and seem to give me the best shave.</li>
    <li> Blade that came with razor was fantastic !  But so far the Merkur 5 packs of 10 blades not very good. I have used 5 blades so far and only 1 of the 5 was almost as good as trial blade, 3 were very dull and pulled like an old blade that needed to be replaced and one was so so . Save your money and buy the  Astra blades 100 for 11 bucks. They seem to be much better at 11 cents  vs  56 cents a blade. Got sucked in by that trial blade.  Geo. in Buffalo</li>
    <li> Great blades lasts a good 2 weeks before needing to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that you&#x27;re going to need a handle for these. Very cheap and great product I just learned how to shave using these and have to admit it isnt easy but with more practice these are great.</li>
    <li> They last several shaves and are very very sharp, Couldnt ask for more with such a low price. Very nice quality.</li>
    <li> awesome razors, gives you the closest shave you can get.  Stop wasting your money on the high priced disposable razors, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s set the stage here. I shave daily, yes 7 days a week, I don&#x27;t take a day off unless I am running a high fever. I have been shaving with a double edge safety razor since 1991 (23 years) with a Gillette Butterfly style head made in England so I am not a newby to this style of shaving. I retired my Gillette in December of 2014 and went with the Merkur 20C. The blade that was sent in the razor was excellent. My wife bought me a sample pack that had many of the blades guys rave about because they are cheap, well I was not impressed. I had been using Wilkinson, Van Der Hagen and Gillette thins and Double Platinum&#x27;s in the old Gillette. they worked ok in the Merkur but did not give the same shave that impressed me with the original Merkur blade. So the analytical part of me kicked in. I brought the Micrometer set in from my tool box and began measuring blades to see why. To My surprise one one thousandth can make a very significant difference in the shave you get and technic you have to use to leave the skin on your face. Across the board there are a few thousandths difference in the blade widths some vary in thickness as well. The wider the blade the more skin will be removed and the more razor burn left behind. The Merkur blade fits the Merkur razor well, DUH! Merkur razor + Merkur blade &#x3D; Merkur quality shave. With that said I am not sure why the negative reviews. Only thing i can see is personal preference, like FORD CHEVY GMC and DODGE. My beard is hard to shave because the hair does not grow in any one direction straight therefore I don&#x27;t like a highly aggressive blade. I like a blade that leaves my skin on my face and takes the hair off. So I went to buy me some Merkur blades, I ran across quite a few from China, I steered clear of those and guess what, the new supply of blades so far have measured out to match the one that came in the razor I opened and measured enough to feel comfortable the blades are pretty consistent in width and thickness I would not expect less from german craftsmanship. I like these blades and will order them again, it may be a while cause they seem to last me a while. But I will re-order. I bought a lot of 50 at $31.40 that equates to $0.63 a blade in a $40.00 razor. Yes it is not a $0.09 blade in a $10.00 razor but I like it. To each his own this works great for me you will have to play around and try the different blades for yourself and make your own judgements. $0.63 a blade that out last the disposable heads from the shave clubs and giving me a Baby smooth shave on a daily basis works great for me! Update I bought my wife a Edwin Jagger Heather DE razor. It did not take her long to get in to my Merkur blades she says\\&quot; they take the hair not the skin. And it is a smooth shave in the shower. In her words don&#x27;t run out of these blades.ect less from german craftsmanship. I like these blades and will order them again, it may be a while cause they seem to last me a while. But I will re-order. I bought a lot of 50 at $31.40 that equates to $0.63 a blade in a $40.00 razor. Yes it is not a $0.09 blade in a $10.00 razor but I like it. To each his own this works great for me you will have to play around and try the different blades for yourself and make your own judgements. $0.63 a blade that out last the disposable heads from the shave clubs and giving me a Baby smooth shave on a daily basis works great for me! Update I bought my wife a Edwin Jagger Heather DE razor. It did not take her long to get in to my Merkur blades she says\\&quot; they take the hair not the skin. And it is a smooth shave in the shower. In her words don&#x27;t run out of these blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous other blades in my Merkur and nothing beats the blades made for the razor</li>
    <li> Go get the feather, better than these ones, superior in all ways, your shaving will improve, your face will appreciate it</li>
    <li> Good, sharp blades with which I got a close shave.  They are good for at least three shaves and probably more.</li>
    <li> This is my 1st go using this type of razor, I was a mock 3 kind of guy. After using these for a few weeks I&#x27;ll never go back. I also found out this is probably enough blades to last me for 3 years.</li>
    <li> IF i bought it and its rated 4 or 5 STARS then YOU should WATCH it or READ it. and if your don&#x27;t end up liking it then you have no sense of good movies so i really don&#x27;t know how found any of these amazing products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple of months now and I must say they are worth every penny spent.</li>
    <li> For the price, there are better blades. They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn. However, they do offer a close shave. I feel that there are much better options for the price; Persona (imported and domestic varieties), Derby, Feather, etc. I can use all of these interchangeably. Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
    <li> I these blades with a Merkur #34C, best razor and blade combination I have ever used.</li>
    <li> My dad has always used single blade razors and after experimenting with all the others I will never go back. I barely ever have and nicks and my face is always baby butt smooth.</li>
    <li> This is pretty straight forward. Merkur blades are the best DE blades I have used and I will continue using them.</li>
    <li> Consistently sharp, high quality blades.  I&#x27;ve used them for years and have no reason to use anything else.  They hold up well giving me one or two weeks of awesome daily shaves before needing replacement.</li>
    <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> My barber, whom still performs straight blade shaves recommended these to me.  Last a bit long than the other brands I have used.  I love the way the blades are stored.  Slide a new blade out the top of the box and discard the old blade in the bottom. Throw away the box, and no sharp edges are exposed.</li>
    <li> Super good product, however be warned, must exercise care so as not to cut/bleed. But this is not difficult and a few days will make the user an expert. GIVES A SUPER CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
    <li> The blades were a gift for my son who is very happy with the blades and they will be ordered again.  They arrived quickly and on time and are as described.  My son says they are a great value.</li>
    <li> Merkur are expensive but this was the best price I found.</li>
    <li> these blades are awesome!!!! been using them for about 3 years now.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and I can get several shaves from one blade.</li>
    <li> These blades are one sharp deal!</li>
    <li> in a meeting with my lousy boss and he asked, &amp;#34;Did you shave this morning?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him &amp;#34;Yes!  It just doesn&#x27;t look it!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought enough of these blades for a year.  BIG MISTAKE!</li>
    <li> I have used: Astra, Shark, Gillette 7 o&#x27;clocks, Gillette Silver Blue&#x27;s, and Feather Hi-Stainless. Of all, this blade gave me the least irritation and still offered a military satisfactory shave. I have sensitive skin and used to use an electric razor and of all the blades, this one was the best for me, however, everyone&#x27;s face is different. I think everyone should get a sampler pack, which is offered on Amazon, to try the different blades available.</li>
    <li> I made the switch to classic de shaving 3 years ago and there is nothing that compares to my merkur hefty classic. I have learned from experience once you switch to de shaving your face will become conditioned to it and you cannot alternate between a de razor and a cartridge shaver; you&#x27;ll hack your face if you do as I&#x27;ve painfully discovered. Thus, once you switch you can never go back.&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;Still shaving with my trusty hefty classic  by Merkur DOVO Solingen and of course the Merkur platinum blades for the most effective shave ever. I rarely write reviews and only when there is motivation to do so like this one. It has now been over 6 years of daily pleasant shaving with my HD and have no plans to ever stop.&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;There cession we are in has given m no choice but to resort to cheaper blades and Gillette&#x27;s blue double edge blades fit the bill. I already bought my vintage Gillette super speed for use with the more affordable blades.</li>
    <li> These are excellent blades, especially for those who are new to wet shaving or suffer from razor bumps on the neck area.  These are more forgiving than the Feather brand blades, which sometimes leave your face feeling raw after a shave.  Pair these up with a good shave cream (try Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s sandlewood) and a good after shave balm (like Nivea for Men&#x27;s) and you will get a great shave every time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard these blades work for 3 shaves.  Not so in my case, and I have a moderately light beard at most.  I have to change them after each shave or will get nicked up.  I will be trying other manufacturers.  Beware of buying to many of one brand to start off with- I bought 50 of these.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. The empty cartridges work to hold blades.</li>
    <li> I love my Merkur long handle razor. But, when it comes to blades, while I have no objective data to support my oppinion, I feel like Feather blades give me a better shave longer. My subjective feeling is that a used Feather blade gives me a better shave than a brand new Merkur. I personnally don&#x27;t try to press the Merkurs past one week. I often take the Feathers for close to two weeks. I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands than those two.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades and a heck of a price. My hubs and I both use these blades. He gets a lot of shaves out of one since it is just for his face and I get about 4-5 shaves out of one for my legs. Very happy with this purchase and we now have a good supply with this deal.</li>
    <li> Such a great deal.  This is a years worth of amazing shaves for pennies a day</li>
    <li> All Ive shaved with for years now. Only place I can find them affordable is Amazon.</li>
    <li> great quality blades if these are the right type for your skin.</li>
    <li> best blades ever me and my husband use them :D</li>
    <li> I like these blades very much.  They are stronger than others which makes them good for my tough beard and sensitive skin.  I wish they lasted more than just 3 shaves.</li>
    <li> Good for a wiry beard and not shaving every day. My husband shaves about two times a week. He loves the old time safety razor and blades way more than the 5 blade system on the newer kinds. And his skin looks good, to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for eight years now, and Merkur were the second type of blades I tried. I&#x27;ve stuck with them ever since! This is a great deal for 50 blades!</li>
