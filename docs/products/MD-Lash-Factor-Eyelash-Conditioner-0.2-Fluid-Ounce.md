      <li>I loved it!  </li>
      <li>it is great.</li>
      <li>Happy with MD Lash.</li>
      <li>Thank you for wonderful product and easy transaction.</li>
      <li>i use Latisse  now and  although MD used to be good, the FDA prohibits the use of the hormones that make lashes grow.  </li>
      <li>you for the good things to have..</li>
      <li>I really liked this product.</li>
      <li>I know I won&#x27;t be wasting any more of my $$$ on these products.  </li>
      <li>much better than this.  </li>
      <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I love putting on mascara in the mornings.  </li>
      <li>It really does magic and very effective although, I should admit, that it has it&#x27;s side effect.  </li>
      <li>and it completely worked!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>In a month I could see a huge improvement in my lashes &amp;#34;right before my eyes&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>My lashes are long and beautiful.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;you&#x27;re right, it doesn&#x27;t work as good as the old product.  </li>
      <li>So, I WAS RIGHT!  </li>
      <li>However, it really made my eyelashes a lot longer and more dense.</li>
      <li>I started seeing a real difference after two months, and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;But, The goods which i think so that can be lucky is right !</li>
      <li>It made my eyelids swell a bit and some of my friends experienced other side effects.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited when I first read about this product.</li>
      <li>I have used the tube nightly for almost three months, now, so that makes it economical, too.  </li>
      <li>I bought it, for half the price and was super excited!!  </li>
      <li>I like this tiny brush for accurate application.  </li>
      <li>This product works very well and lasts for years.</li>
      <li>I used it every night for months, with absolutely zero results.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are really longer.</li>
      <li>It is half the price, and better results.</li>
      <li>Overall, it is worth the price and effort.</li>
      <li>It stinks that something so good, that actually worked, is now taken away from us girls who just want to be pretty!!!</li>
      <li>So be warned, all \\&quot;lash grow\\&quot; products will not have the right ingredient that will actually make your lashes grow.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s their \\&quot;new formula\\</li>
      <li>I heard on the Doctors program, alerting viewers to be aware there have not been  enough study&#x27;s on this product.</li>
      <li>&quot;  they just don&#x27;t tell you that it won&#x27;t work as well as the old one!</li>
      <li>So I dropped nearly $100, expecting it to live up to the hype.</li>
      <li>I have long lovely lashes now, a couple spots that were hairless now have longer than average lashes.  </li>
      <li>Well, I checked the bottle, compared it to my old bottle that worked.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work like the old formula.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical, but it cost a great deal less than the Latisse, and since it&#x27;s not the Glaucoma drug, it won&#x27;t darken blue eyes.  </li>
      <li>I bought a cheaper product that barely worked, so I&#x27;m back.</li>

<li> I have started using it on my brows, too, but haven&#x27;t seen a difference, yet, since I&#x27;ve only used it there a few weeks.  </li>
<li> I am careful not to get it in the eye itself.  </li>
<li> Latisse would probably give a more dramatic result, but it costs $150/month and might darken my blue irises, which is scary.  </li>
<li> I am a little bit curious if there is a reason for that...especially since Amazon is selling it for half of the price that the doctors offices and actual MD Lash website is!!!!!!!!!</li>
<li> On other websites, I have seen complaints of stinging and irritation.</li>
<li> Have used it every other day for a month, lashes thicker/longer...</li>
<li> but...hesitate to continue  due to  eye irritation.</li>
<li> I will keep using it and can recommend it to anyone who wants thicker and longer lashes without putting on fake lashes.</li>
<li> have tried other products both more expensive and less expensive -</li>
<li> (which is half of what i paid from the drs office).</li>
<li> Latisse works extremely well and lasts a long time so although it is expensive, in the long run, it is not.  </li>
<li> and I didn&#x27;t see that this product did anything for that problem after using it for a little over a month.  </li>
<li> To ALL of you that tried to save a little money let me tell you, You get what you pay</li>
<li> I thought it would make it a little longer and fuller</li>
<li> Latisse (sp) brought a lawsuit, or threatened all the other \\&quot;lash grow\\&quot; product companies and claimed one of the ingredients was \\&quot;theirs\\&quot;, or whatever!!  </li>
<li> A few months ago I searched online and found it.  </li>
<li> a small spot that had no lashes now has a few.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s sad, because Latisse is prescription only!!  </li>
<li> I have tried Latisse, but my results were not very good.</li>
<li> My lashes are so long that they look fake.  </li>
<li> They were forced to change their formula.  </li>
<li> /&gt; The capacity appeared in the photo introduced the goods in the wrong</li>
<li> I have been using this product since September and unfortunately see no change.</li>
<li> disappointing</li>
<li> So sorry for the bad news, but I hate to see people suckered into spending $$$ on things that aren&#x27;t legit!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this tiny brush for accurate application.  Product lasts almost a year.  I have long lovely lashes now, a couple spots that were hairless now have longer than average lashes.  Yay!!</li>
    <li> no results as yet.  maybe should have gone the Latisse way, but am still hoping this product will work.  Eyes do get itchy after application</li>
    <li> The MD Lash Factor has NOT work for me yet. I am still using it with hope and because at this price I&#x27;ll keep trying.   I started on 4/25 and it is 5/23 now.</li>
    <li> Have used it every other day for a month, lashes thicker/longer...but...hesitate to continue  due to  eye irritation. I awake with a reddish discolor in the corner of my eyes the morning  after. I heard on the Doctors program, alerting viewers to be aware there have not been  enough study&#x27;s on this product. It could Possibly effect our eye sight after long use.   (Strangely enough my vision has changed - think I&#x27;m going to skip it for awhile, &amp; see if   my vision corrects itself). I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has noticed changes in their eye sight   when reading!  ???</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. My lashes are long and beautiful. I have tried Latisse, but my results were not very good. I like MD Lash Factor. It is half the price, and better results.</li>
    <li> It really does magic and very effective although, I should admit, that it has it&#x27;s side effect.  It made my eyelids swell a bit and some of my friends experienced other side effects.  However, it really made my eyelashes a lot longer and more dense. It even works for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t take time out of my busy schedule to write reviews on anything, but this one I feel I must.  Two years ago I bought MD Lash Factor, and it totally worked!!  I loved it!  Well, I ran out.  A few months ago I searched online and found it.  I bought it, for half the price and was super excited!!  Well, after a month, NOTHING!  After two months I was wondering why it wasn&#x27;t working.  Well, I checked the bottle, compared it to my old bottle that worked.  The new bottle was missing the little \\&quot;TM\\&quot; mark on it.  So I called my family friend who works at a medical spa in Anchorage (who also used MD Lash Factor, and sold it at the clinic, as well)  I told her my situation.  And she told me \\&quot;you&#x27;re right, it doesn&#x27;t work as good as the old product.  They were forced to change their formula.  Latisse (sp) brought a lawsuit, or threatened all the other \\&quot;lash grow\\&quot; product companies and claimed one of the ingredients was \\&quot;theirs\\&quot;, or whatever!!  So, I WAS RIGHT!  It doesn&#x27;t work like the old formula.  It&#x27;s sad, because Latisse is prescription only!!  So be warned, all \\&quot;lash grow\\&quot; products will not have the right ingredient that will actually make your lashes grow.  Instead they are lash \\&quot;conditioners\\&quot;.  We all konw hair conditioner doesn&#x27;t make your hair grow!  It stinks that something so good, that actually worked, is now taken away from us girls who just want to be pretty!!! I know I won&#x27;t be wasting any more of my $$$ on these products.  Maybe I&#x27;ll just have to hit my doc up for a prescrition of Latisse!  Crappy?!!  So sorry for the bad news, but I hate to see people suckered into spending $$$ on things that aren&#x27;t legit! Well, they do tell you it&#x27;s their \\&quot;new formula\\&quot;  they just don&#x27;t tell you that it won&#x27;t work as well as the old one!</li>
    <li> I started using this on recommendation by a friend.  I was skeptical, but it cost a great deal less than the Latisse, and since it&#x27;s not the Glaucoma drug, it won&#x27;t darken blue eyes.  I do see a difference in length of lashes, and a small spot that had no lashes now has a few. I have started using it on my brows, too, but haven&#x27;t seen a difference, yet, since I&#x27;ve only used it there a few weeks.  I started seeing a real difference after two months, and I am pleased with the results.  Latisse would probably give a more dramatic result, but it costs $150/month and might darken my blue irises, which is scary.  I have used the tube nightly for almost three months, now, so that makes it economical, too.  On other websites, I have seen complaints of stinging and irritation. I do notice it makes the eyes dry, but it hasn&#x27;t irritated them.  I am careful not to get it in the eye itself.  Overall, it is worth the price and effort.</li>
    <li> I have long eye lashes already. I thought it would make it a little longer and fuller but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hairdresser.  She said it was just like Latisse but cheeper.  At $70.  which I don&#x27;t consider cheep does not work.  I&#x27;ve been using it every nite for one month and have seen no results.  I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product works very well and lasts for years. I bought a cheaper product that barely worked, so I&#x27;m back.</li>
    <li> Thank you for wonderful product and easy transaction. Did not have a chance to try it, I had to ship it to my friend.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037LYRS0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> To ALL of you that tried to save a little money let me tell you, You get what you pay for!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from Dermstore.com and it works! I paid $140.00 but is quality, also you have to be very careful because It could be old product.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you have to spend extra $$$ to get the wanted results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this help!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  I have been using it for 7 weeks now.  My lashes are so long that they look fake.  I love putting on mascara in the mornings.  I will keep using it and can recommend it to anyone who wants thicker and longer lashes without putting on fake lashes.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I first read about this product. So I dropped nearly $100, expecting it to live up to the hype. It did not. I used it every night for months, with absolutely zero results. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I started to use it 3 weeks ago and I can see the results! My eyelashes are really longer. No itchy eyes neither irritation. I use it every night after removing make up.</li>
    <li> Ok...So I bought the MD Lash last year and I bought it from a Doctor...and it completely worked!!!!!!! My eyelashes grew really long! and People commented on them. When I ran out and saw that Amazon had it on sale for 70$...(which is half of what i paid from the drs office). I decided to buy it again! But for some reason...this time its not working! I am a little bit curious if there is a reason for that...especially since Amazon is selling it for half of the price that the doctors offices and actual MD Lash website is!!!!!!!!! Wonder if there is a difference in product???</li>
    <li> Happy with MD Lash. In 4 weeks I saw improvement in the thickness of my lashes. Hoping it will continue.</li>
    <li> I have very short lashes and I didn&#x27;t see that this product did anything for that problem after using it for a little over a month.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use MD Lash every night before I go to bed.  In a month I could see a huge improvement in my lashes &amp;#34;right before my eyes&amp;#34;.  My lashes are longer and darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products both more expensive and less expensive - this lives up to what it promises!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since September and unfortunately see no change. I would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing</li>
    <li> i use Latisse  now and  although MD used to be good, the FDA prohibits the use of the hormones that make lashes grow.  Latisse works extremely well and lasts a long time so although it is expensive, in the long run, it is not.  much better than this.  go to your opthamologist for an eye exam (which u need anyway) and  get cleared for Latisse. my dr sells it in the office.  it is great.</li>
    <li> The item ordered unlike my anxiety arrived well.&lt;br /&gt;I a mistake and was going to cancel an order.&lt;br /&gt; The capacity appeared in the photo introduced the goods in the wrong way.&lt;br /&gt;But, The goods which i think so that can be lucky is right !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the good things to have..&lt;br /&gt;Hope soon to see the effects..</li>
