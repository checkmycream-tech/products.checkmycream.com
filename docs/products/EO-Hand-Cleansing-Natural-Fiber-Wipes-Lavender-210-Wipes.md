      <li>Excellent product from a top notch company.</li>
      <li>we have no water where I work and these are so pleasant and non-drying for freshening up after the porta potty or before lunch.</li>
      <li>and everyone says my car smells so good.</li>
      <li>They smell SO good and with the sanitizing feature</li>
      <li>I gave one to all of my friends on Xmas, and all of them keep mentioning how good it made them feel.</li>
      <li>Good.</li>
      <li>We are very pleased.</li>
      <li>Great alternative to more toxic chemical wipes.  </li>
      <li>Nice scent, good size.  </li>
      <li>I love these wipes!  </li>
      <li>Love these!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind because the smell is so nice.</li>
      <li>Nice price.</li>
      <li>The scent is wonderful, the hydration good - enough moisture to do the job without being over-saturated.</li>
      <li>These are very handy, nice lavender oil aroma, and just the right size.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of these wipes.  </li>
      <li>The aroma is her favorite.  </li>
      <li>I love these wipes.  </li>
      <li>and i love the smell and the 210 count too :)</li>
      <li>Great smell, keep them on our changing table for a quick hand clean after diaper time.</li>
      <li>More like alcohol than lavendar.  </li>
      <li>LOVE EO wipes.</li>
      <li>Love this container of my favourite wipes.</li>
      <li>I love how them make my hands feel and smell.</li>
      <li>it uses lavender is a natural antiseptic which is great for using around babies.</li>
      <li>I loved the smell and feel so much</li>
      <li>Way too strong for some co- workers</li>
      <li>Very useful cleaning wipes.</li>
      <li>Plus they leave your hands very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>The smell lingers and makes everything smell clean for while after using it.</li>
      <li>Thought lavender would be a more gentle fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to many odors, but these wipes do not have a strong, lingering scent.  </li>
      <li>Gentle enough to be used on most surfaces, and the packaging can be neatly recycled to make your own wipes if you want to.</li>
      <li>Just plan on having to yank the entire top off in order to get at the wipes, and for goodness&#x27; sake make sure you put the top back on and seat it securely</li>
      <li>after I get out of the shopping mall I pull the tissue out, clean my hands and all of a sudden the world feels more friendly.</li>
      <li>This one smells like real lavender, and is fantastic.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I keep it in a drawer near my mke-up tools and it&#x27;s so easy to pull one out to clean my eye-lash curler or tweezers, etc.</li>
      <li>I actually wipe things down more than I need to just to get the great smell in the air, occasionally, I put one in the car and the lovely smell lingers for a couple days.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find something without toxic chemicals but the intensity of the smell was very irritating (and I love the smell of lavender).  </li>
      <li>For all that they do a good job, but nothing like a wet wipe or a clorox wipe for the kitchen or something similar that you might be familiar with.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is not little after all, it is very economical.  </li>
      <li>We first used these wipes at the Whole Foods eat in section.  </li>
      <li>It has a very chemical smell.</li>
      <li>This is the money very well</li>
      <li>Thanks for send for making the quality stuff.</li>
      <li>I really like these hand wipes and will be ordering them again.</li>
      <li>Whole Foods provides these wipes at the door for it&#x27;s shoppers.</li>
      <li>I really like the smell and how it feels on hands, etc.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I like that these wipes are rated a 1 on the skin deep website and that they are a nice light scent, BUT they are small and barely moist.  </li>
      <li>First it&#x27;s organic, second</li>
      <li>The only downfall is the large container.  </li>
      <li>Our local Whole Foods store had these by the elevators and doors and we got hooked.  </li>
      <li>The aroma from the lavender isn&#x27;t overpowering and I appreciate a natural anti-viral product and convenient wipe for the facerest of my massage chair.</li>
      <li>If you consider yourself very sensitive person, whose mood is easily influenced by simple luxuries - do yourself a favor, indulge yourself and buy that little box.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are thick and do not tear easily.</li>
      <li>It comes in a huge tube that is hard to separate the sheets in.</li>
      <li>I have an 11 month old and we use these wipes on toys, table tops, dropped pacifiers, hands, public changing tables, you name it!!</li>
      <li>This recent order has a new look on the container and came from a different supplier.  </li>
      <li>so much I wipe down my sink after the dishes are done</li>
      <li>The only not so good thing is the wipes are fairly small and thin, so they don&#x27;t stand up well for scrubbing sticky stuff off the table.</li>

<li> they&#x27;re too darn small!</li>
<li> Unfortunately, this particular time, the product had a bad small.  </li>

    <li> Whole Foods provides these wipes at the door for it&#x27;s shoppers. I loved the smell and feel so much I decided I had to have some for the house and car.</li>
    <li> My mother is in a nursing home.  She loves to have these by her bed for daily use.  The aroma is her favorite.  Nice price.</li>
    <li> These are very handy, nice lavender oil aroma, and just the right size. I really like these hand wipes and will be ordering them again.</li>
    <li> We first used these wipes at the Whole Foods eat in section.  Nice scent, good size.  We immediately went home and ordered them through Amazon.  We are very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes.  I am sensitive to many odors, but these wipes do not have a strong, lingering scent.  And the scent actually smells like lavender, not perfume.  Great alternative to more toxic chemical wipes.  They are thick and do not tear easily.</li>
    <li> Great for use in the car, with no synthesized petrochems! and i love the smell and the 210 count too :)</li>
    <li> I was happy to find something without toxic chemicals but the intensity of the smell was very irritating (and I love the smell of lavender).  Also the container does not seal well enough to prevent the towels from drying out.  If you use them a lot this won&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> I stock up on these whenever they are on sale.  I put them into smaller bottles and have all over my house.  They do a great job and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> I run a yoga studio and my students use these wipes to refresh their mats.  Excellent product from a top notch company.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!! It is great for SO MANY REASONS!! First it&#x27;s organic, second it uses lavender is a natural antiseptic which is great for using around babies. No more toxic Triclosan. I have an 11 month old and we use these wipes on toys, table tops, dropped pacifiers, hands, public changing tables, you name it!! I was just using baby wipes before but now I use these  all the time. They smell SO good and with the sanitizing feature I just don&#x27;t see ever going back to using baby bum wipes for cleanup. Of course I&#x27;d never use them on baby&#x27;s bum. BUT totally look forward to EO making a flushable diaper wipe. The EO sanitizing wipes are a mommy must have!!</li>
    <li> EO Sanitizing hand wipes.  I really like the smell and how it feels on hands, etc.  I would like the napkins to be a little larger.  Since I like the smell so much I wipe down my sink after the dishes are done and I use 3 cloths at a time.....I don&#x27;t mind because the smell is so nice.</li>
    <li> I like lavender smell. so I can smell all day long. Thanks for send for making the quality stuff. Good.</li>
    <li> we have no water where I work and these are so pleasant and non-drying for freshening up after the porta potty or before lunch.</li>
    <li> These are great. I keep them in my car. I love how them make my hands feel and smell.</li>
    <li> I love these wipes!  I keep them in my car and everyone says my car smells so good.</li>
    <li> We have been trying to find an alcohol wipe that doesn&#x27;t smell like fakey perfume. This one smells like real lavender, and is fantastic. The smell lingers and makes everything smell clean for while after using it. Large container is expensive, but it&#x27;s real lavender oil, so that&#x27;s expected. The only not so good thing is the wipes are fairly small and thin, so they don&#x27;t stand up well for scrubbing sticky stuff off the table. I actually wipe things down more than I need to just to get the great smell in the air, occasionally, I put one in the car and the lovely smell lingers for a couple days.</li>
    <li> We have been using these wipes for over a year.  We have always been happy with them.  They are even great for my twin toddlers&#x27; skin.  This recent order has a new look on the container and came from a different supplier.  This one was completely dry and cannot be used.  I&#x27;m not sure if there is a new formula or simply a faulty seal.</li>
    <li> very good! will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> I take them with me everywhere, and have some in my car to wipe my hands after going to ATM or gas station etc.  Yes!</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful, the hydration good - enough moisture to do the job without being over-saturated. The problems are 1. they&#x27;re too darn small! I mean these wipes are tiny. For all that they do a good job, but nothing like a wet wipe or a clorox wipe for the kitchen or something similar that you might be familiar with. The second problem is the fact that the thing that holds them so you can pull one off of the roll is functionally useless. Just plan on having to yank the entire top off in order to get at the wipes, and for goodness&#x27; sake make sure you put the top back on and seat it securely or they&#x27;ll dry out significantly in only a day. That all being said, they&#x27;re the best thing like this for the price out there, and until something better comes along at this price point it&#x27;s still worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day. In the car. It smells divine, it elevates my mood, after I get out of the shopping mall I pull the tissue out, clean my hands and all of a sudden the world feels more friendly. If you consider yourself very sensitive person, whose mood is easily influenced by simple luxuries - do yourself a favor, indulge yourself and buy that little box.&lt;br /&gt;It is not little after all, it is very economical.  This is the money very well spent.&lt;br /&gt;When I travel, I even pull out few tissues and place them in the little ziplock&lt; to carry in my pocket. I keep ordering that thing over and over. I gave one to all of my friends on Xmas, and all of them keep mentioning how good it made them feel.</li>
    <li> Love these!  Our local Whole Foods store had these by the elevators and doors and we got hooked.  I wish we hadn&#x27;t because they are pricey, but the scent and size and quality are too good!</li>
    <li> Has  chemical smell.  Certainly not lavender.</li>
    <li> Very useful cleaning wipes. Gentle enough to be used on most surfaces, and the packaging can be neatly recycled to make your own wipes if you want to. (Mix 1 cup of water, a quarter cup of rubbing alcohol, a few drops of tea tree oil, and a teaspoon of dish detergent. Cut a roll of paper towels in half, remove the core, pop off the lid of the EO wipe package, insert the paper towels, and pour the mixture over. Pull the towel out of the center of the role, threaded through the lid, and you&#x27;ve got another package of wipes.)</li>
    <li> Very nice product . The aroma from the lavender isn&#x27;t overpowering and I appreciate a natural anti-viral product and convenient wipe for the facerest of my massage chair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE!!  I use them as handy-wipes but also to wipe off my desk at work and it leaves my office smelling wonderful.  Everyone loves these.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works good too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  Unfortunately, this particular time, the product had a bad small.  More like alcohol than lavendar.  Not so with previous batches.  I don&#x27;t know if this was the way it was stored, or the age of the product, or if EO is making the product differently.</li>
    <li> LOVE EO wipes. Great scent and fabric. Sadly the top snapped off but it still seals. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this to use at work.  Thought lavender would be a more gentle fragrance. Way too strong for some co- workers</li>
    <li> I thought  i was buying face wipes. It comes in a huge tube that is hard to separate the sheets in. It has a very chemical smell.</li>
    <li> Great smell, keep them on our changing table for a quick hand clean after diaper time. Plus they leave your hands very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Love this container of my favourite wipes. I keep it in a drawer near my mke-up tools and it&#x27;s so easy to pull one out to clean my eye-lash curler or tweezers, etc.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of these wipes.  The only downfall is the large container.  They also make spray hand sanitizers which are great for the purse or car.</li>
    <li> I like that these wipes are rated a 1 on the skin deep website and that they are a nice light scent, BUT they are small and barely moist.  I would get them again though simply due to them being safer for use on items that my baby touches than chemical-laden alternatives.</li>
