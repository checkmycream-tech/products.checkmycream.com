<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this as an applicator for some especially smelly essential oils.  Works great and my daughter is happier with it than having the oils sprayed on.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most cosmetics.  I use plain jojoba oil as a lip gloss and needed a spill-proof, easy-to-apply way to carry it.  These bottle are perfect!  As a bonus, they are of the right size to go in a carry-on plastic liquids bag on an airplane.</li>
    <li> Perfect for rescuing the lonely perfume, easy to cary in a purse, easy to refill. I can&#x27;t say how pleased I am</li>
    <li> Ordered for 3.02 for a single, not too bad really, I needed to try it. Using a mix of lactic acid, salicyilic acid and witch hazel for skin issues. Two days and 3 uses, the roller ball fell out and will not stay back in. I can understand that if I used it for weeks @ 3x a day, but 2 days? Not really. Seems I need to go higher quality.</li>
    <li> I use this to apply cologne to my face. It works very well. Only problem is that the liquid gets a bit dirty after a while due to picking up skin debris. Therefore I don&#x27;t fill it up all the way.</li>
    <li> Perfect for homemade essential oil mixtures. These are a good price and perform well.</li>
    <li> I have 4 of these bottles and like the handy size. it takes longer to receive them than I would like, but I have enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> These bottles are very nice. Great quality and look. You can easily fill these up and the rollerball is a nice way to apply. You can even put acne treatment in them and roll them on when needed. Could be used for anything wet you need to apply to a smooth surface.</li>
    <li> plain small little bottle with a roll-on top..Hardly worth the price. I was shocked that I paid this much for something this small and plain.&lt;br /&gt; I would suggest going to the local dollar store to look for this particular item- not worth what Amazon is asking.</li>
    <li> great for adding spray perfume to use as rollerball and store in your purse - I got a small funnel to do this with all my favs. These are good quality glass and rollerballs.  If rollerball is stiff - run your fingernail around ball to loosen plastic a bit.  I&#x27;ve gotten many of these and always have great luck with them.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  The cap stays tight while in my purse and it is exactly what I hoped for.</li>
    <li> These have an odd smell to them, but are otherwise great. Perfect for mixing your own perfume or, like me, applying diluted essential oils for headaches, etc. I believe the smell in them is just residual from some other liquid that was previously in them; not a bad smell, but kind of like a baby powder perfume.</li>
    <li> These little Bottles are perfect for Carrying small amounts of your favorate scents. They dont leak and they are easy to refill.</li>
    <li> I blend my own essential oils as perfume and use roll on bottles for their application.  I&#x27;ve purchased them before with minimal issues.  This time I seem to have gotten some poorly designed ones.  The ball falls out.  Iive been using an old eye makeup brush to apply it.  I know they don&#x27;t cost much, but if they don&#x27;t stay together like they&#x27;re supposed to its still money wasted, and who can afford that?&lt;br /&gt;I will have to think long and hard before I purchase more.</li>
    <li> I filled this up with my favorite perfume so I could have it in my purse (they don&#x27;t sell mine travel size) and it spilled....tried to tighten the cap several times but nothing worked</li>
    <li> brother inlaw wanted it, I didnt ask why</li>
    <li> This seems like good quality. The glass is sturdy. However, the liquid does not come through the dispenser ball, which defeats the entire purpose.</li>
    <li> This is not at all okay. The bottle is very large, and the roller ball popped off after my first use. It also dispenses VERY fast... Not to mention the leaking. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because of the low price... Still...</li>
    <li> Works great for my DMSO application and I can carry it with  me.  Have arthritis in my shoulder, hands, knees, and this works really well to disperse it onto my aching bones!!  I probably should have bought a colored one because you are supposed to keep it in a dark jar, but the bottom of my purse is dark, so.....</li>
    <li> I have this roller as a purse-sized deodorant, and it is great. Rolls smoothly, easy to refill, a perfect size for discreet freshen-ups during the day. I was a little nervous that it might leak, but it has been great.&lt;br /&gt;The only caution I would add is that if you travel by air, be sure to put it into a ziplock bag first. I did so, and it must be the pressure in the aircraft that caused it to leak a little - but the baggy saved me any mess in that instance.</li>
    <li> Great product now I can put my favorite perfumes right in my bag in this perfect compact roll on bottle</li>
    <li> Bought this product so i could make a lip balm for my husband using essential oils( for chapped lips).  Worked perfectly and he takes it to work everyday.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I wanted.  It never dawned on me to check the size.  Sometimes I am so pretty. :)  It works fine though. Was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Fill with your favorite perfume and throw it in your purse or take on a plane.</li>
    <li> YAY! Brought these in the house, and filled several immediately with essential oils I like to keep handy. They were JUST what I needed!</li>
    <li> These are a great size and were easy to fill and put together. Would definitely buy again in the future!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply moisturizers to your skin and scalp while away from home.  Highly recommended for traveling and personal use wherever you may be.</li>
    <li> I received these bottles pretty quickly.  The rollers came separate d from the bottles. I liked the size,but one small thing is that I had planned on filling it with oil and rubbing it in hubby &#x27;s feet. I wasn&#x27;t able to do that because the roller hurt his feet. Otherwise I think these are great little roller bottles and may lend themselves to other uses well.</li>
    <li> Saw a hint to put the cologne in one of these. It works like a charm and is easy to carry or travel with.</li>
    <li> They turned out to be smaller than I expected but all in all I am pleased. Thank you so very much. Good job.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a few weeks, then the roller ball came out.</li>
    <li> I love these bottles. My Vitamin C Serum bottle had a dropper which came apart. I poured the serum in the bottle and I have been using this on my face. It feels relaxing. Great for so many things.</li>
    <li> Good for everyday use. Perfect size to fit in pocket or purse. I&#x27;ll be buying another one. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. (and it shipped fast)</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works great.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly what I expected and works great for rolling on my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made and half I can&#x27;t even use because the top keeps unscrewing and falling off.</li>
    <li> Works well for my aftershave.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these and I think they work just fine. My only issues is that I wish they were a little wider instead of thin in diameter but other than that they&#x27;re good for what I need them for.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price</li>
    <li> Nice little bottle for homemade essential oil perfume. It did take a little time to arrive but it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Great for carrying perfume on the go, but it leaks a little</li>
    <li> Just as explained.  Will work perfect for my needs</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than we thought,but worked fine.</li>
    <li> Love these for my essential oils</li>
    <li> this is awesome for the price and what i need them for</li>
    <li> Very handy little gadget.</li>
    <li> This are prefect for making blends for my kids to take to school!</li>
    <li> I really like the roller for my essential oils - way cheaper to buy them in a bottle and transfer them to a roller than to buy the essential oils IN a roller.</li>
    <li> Good roller and does not leak.</li>
    <li> I got a bunch of these to give as a part of a gift bag for the holidays- they were a huge hit! Everyone loved the idea of filling it up with their favorite perfume and keeping it in their purse.</li>
    <li> Perfect for putting in purse</li>
    <li> great for my essential oils and these are gifts fro friends and family&lt;br /&gt;When your friends have the means to buy what they want these are nice gifts they can get from me&lt;br /&gt;thank you for helping with the presentation</li>
    <li> I am currently using the refillable glass perfume bottle to hold my liquid Benadryl. I find it to be very dependable.</li>
    <li> I used this for travelling and I fill it with after shave. No more spilling on hands, I just roll it in my face.</li>
    <li> I usually buy these type of bottles from Whole Foods but they were out of them for several weeks.  I use these bottles to apply essential oils.  The bottles I usually buy there are very good quality.  Since Whole Foods were sold out of these bottles I decided to try the Plain Roll-On Glass Perfume Bottles from Amazon.  The cost of 15 cents a bottle should have been a sign that they would be poor quality. I ordered 10 of them.  The shippping was almost $10.00 and my bottles totaled $1.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The problem with these bottles were that the plastic roll on device would not work properly.  The roller that rolls the essential oils on would not move which made it impossible to roll anything on my skin. They were all that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with this purchase and would never order anything from them again.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have been making my own cologne.  When I come up with a scent I want to give away, I use these bottles for all of my friends. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I received this product and filled it with the almond oil I use as a moisturizer. My skin is extremely dry and I needed something on the go that I could take out of my purse and apply the oil onto dry spots throughout the day. The item was defective. It doesn&#x27;t roll. I literally left red marks on my face trying to get it to disperse any oil. The only way to get the roller ball to move is to push it with your finger.  For 1.90 I am not going to bother returning it especially considering it took forever to get here. Word to the wise, you get what you pay for. If you want something that works do not go with this product.</li>
    <li> These are okay. The rollerballs don&#x27;t work very well and it&#x27;s hard for the liquid to come out. You have to really use pressure and roll it over and over again. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> These bottles are awesome, I have about 10 bottles with all my favorite scents. Just put it in my pocket and go.</li>
    <li> these are fine as long as you are able to keep them upright or have a really thick liquid in them. i filled one with vegetable glycerin (which is actually pretty thick stuff, thicker by far then olive oil) and added a few drops of essential oils to it, not more than 20 drops, and that oil isn&#x27;t really thin either. i shook the bottle to mix and allowed it to sit upright for over an hour before i got around to sampling it. when i rolled it on my wrist it almost dribbled out  under the ball, although the ball did roll just fine. a while later my daughter tried it (she is 4) when i wasn&#x27;t looking (bad mommy, i know) and she shook it with the lid off, the ball actually came right out and my scent was slung across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these might be better for something like a really thick lip gloss or even lotion, that might be able to hold the ball with vacuum action, but don&#x27;t use these for anything less thick</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.  I use these for my oil that I buy online. Shipped very quickly as well. I will buy these again!</li>
    <li> Perfect for creating your own signature scent from pure essential oils.  Just a little bigger than I expected, which is a GOOD thing!</li>
    <li> These are so handy, I put vitamin E oil in them &amp; keep it in my purse as Lotion for my face &amp; hands especially during the cold seasons!</li>
    <li> Using this for essential oils.  Rolls on great. Easy to fill. Doesn&#x27;t leak, though I haven&#x27;t traveled with it. I&#x27;m planning on getting more.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Works great. Will buy again. Not sure why others had issues, but this replaced my perfum bottle that I keep in my purse. Quick and easy.</li>
    <li> loved it, work great for my favorite perfume. it is easy to use, and it is to carry with me</li>
    <li> I ordered 6 bottles. Someone in the shipping department can&#x27;t count to 6. I first received 4 bottles, 2 caps and 2 lids. I sent them message asking if the other parts are send separate, and the parts I needed. I then received a week later ONE cap in the mail (I&#x27;m talking the actual ball cap). I sent another message of what I needed to complete te order. I then received the rest of the order the next day. They did send it overnight (I did not request that) and spent $19.99 shipping it. (Not my money) so I do appreciate that. All this over 6 bottles. So, I do appreciate their making good on the order but it was a pain to get it correct when simply counting to 6 in the first place would have been good.</li>
    <li> i  don&#x27;t remember paying so much shipping and handling. it raised up the $.50 each for 40, $20.00 (a very good bargain ) plus $19.80 s&amp;h.( Not a good bargain). i love the bottles. they fit just right for what i need. Just not at that price.</li>
    <li> thanks so much !  These bottles are perfect for YL essential oil mixtures !!!</li>
    <li> I have not had to refill one after the initial fill, using them for mixing essentials oils so the real test will be if they are reusable or if they start to wear out in time</li>
    <li> I mix my doTerra oils and use them in a roller bottle. For the cheap price, it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Nifty little gadget that has multiple uses.  Not only for smell goods, but handy in first aid kits, for pet ointments, etc.  Perfect little size that can be packed anywhere.  Its glass, so it will break, but it is thick glass, just us you head on storing and handling. Super price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This little roll on bottle works great.  I will definitely purchase more to use them. They are great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I put a classic perfume in here to roll on when I get to work... its great and fits perfectly in my bag, without getting lost.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I got this roll-on perfume bottle to make it easy to carry my favorite perfume in my purse or pocket. IT&#x27;S PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!  It doesn&#x27;t leak, it&#x27;s the perfect size and honestly it&#x27;s cute. I plan to get more of these for all my perfumes. I just sprayed my perfume straight into this bottle, popped in the roller attachment and I was done! That easy! This is a great find!!!!</li>
    <li> Roller doesn&#x27;t roll very easily, which seems like the whole point! Glad it was only a couple dollars.</li>
    <li> These little bottles are great for my essential oil blends.  The price is fantastic and they are just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Use this for my tea tree oil for acne spot treatment.  Works great, easy to refill.  Thanks for a low price great product.</li>
    <li> easy to put perfume in and all in one piece.</li>
    <li> This bottle has been great and easy to assemble and clean. I only had one of the ball rollers not working but other than that its a great product.</li>
    <li> Product looks exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I love these for my oils</li>
    <li> Works with essential oils. Little trouble filling them.</li>
    <li> This little bottle did the trick!  I had some perfume from a small bottle that I disliked having to blot onto my finger and then dab onto various parts of my neck, wrists, etc.  This perfume roller does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The ball rolls easily and doesn&#x27;t stick. It&#x27;s refillable and if you&#x27;re careful, you don&#x27;t really need a funnel to fill it, unless you have shaky hands of course. I keep the bottle sitting upright on my bathroom vanity, so I&#x27;m not sure if it leaks. Overall, this was a simple solution, at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> A good size for mixing oils, but one of the bottles I received has a loose ball so it leaks! I didn&#x27;t know this until it leaked all over my leather utility belt. -.- I just keep this one on my dresser and take the other ones in my purse now.</li>
