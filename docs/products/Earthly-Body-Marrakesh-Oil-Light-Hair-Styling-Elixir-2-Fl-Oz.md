      <li>I have been using Marrakesh oil for the last 3 years and love it.  </li>
      <li>First, I tried the salon shampoo recommended by my stylist ([[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Actually like this better than the heavier weight Argan oil.</li>
      <li>This product smells AMAZING, leaves your hair feeling soft without being weighed down, and feels more natural when used as a finishing serum to tame frizz and fly aways than anything I have ever used before.  </li>
      <li>Any residue that&#x27;s left on your hands can just be rubbed in, like a moisturizer, leaving your hands feeling nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>Being a surfer as well, it&#x27; now goes with me to the beach, so after I&#x27;m done catching some waves, I add the Marrakesh Oil to my hair, rub it in &amp; I&#x27;m good to go to meet my buddies for a cold one.    </li>
      <li>Liked it a little better than the regular oil.</li>
      <li>I have allergies to certain scents and moraccan oil gives me migrains.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very masculine, earthy scent, but it takes some getting used to, especially if you are more used to the &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; scents in many other men&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Light enough, smoothing, protecting and smells</li>
      <li>I tried to use straight argan oil on my hair instead of this</li>
      <li>Really helps with frizz.</li>
      <li>i dont really know how else to describe it.</li>
      <li>Doesnt leave my hair oily nor you have to use much.</li>
      <li>She absolutely agreed with me after she tried it and is now a Marrakesh fan.</li>
      <li>It is heavy on the cinnamon-y, warm spice side.</li>
      <li>it comes out in sort of like a gel, not really liquidy, which is nice its not messy, but rub it in your hands and through your hair,</li>
      <li>it helps it dry quick and actually keeps it as healthy as a product can.  </li>
      <li>I have long straight, fine hair.</li>
      <li>A truly amazing product where  a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair and have always had trouble with fly-aways.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 53 with dry, frizzy hair, and nothing I tried seemed to work before I found Marrakesh Oil Light.</li>
      <li>My stylist at a high end salon introduced me to Marrakesh Oil.</li>
      <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t like things with an herby scent</li>
      <li>i buy this product over and over and got like 5 people buying it too!i love the smell not too heavy</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Helps hair stay strong when you use heat a lot. Smells wonderful. I love it!! I think your hair dries faster too.</li>
    <li> I have long straight, fine hair. It tends to get dry on the ends and I get fly aways. The oil works great and smells really good too. It makes my hair shiny and smooth. But if you use too much near the scalp it will make your hair greasy. Just use a small amount on the ends.</li>
    <li> I recently had my hair done ( colored, cut &amp; styled) and I&#x27;m always watching to see what my stylist uses on my hair.  Yes, we men primp equally as much as women, if not more.  Doubt me?  Try taking away the man in your life&#x27;s hair products...    This visit,  she used Marrakesh Oil (Original) &amp; I was truly dumbfounded as to how great my hair felt, how well it smelled, how the color shined, the tingling of my scalp, how it held my hair in place, &amp; how well it worked per it&#x27;s billing on the bottle (in the product description) and more...      Being a surfer as well, it&#x27; now goes with me to the beach, so after I&#x27;m done catching some waves, I add the Marrakesh Oil to my hair, rub it in &amp; I&#x27;m good to go to meet my buddies for a cold one.    A truly amazing product where  a tiny bit goes a long way.  A must have for any male who cares about his hair &amp; how it looks day &amp; night.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair and have always had trouble with fly-aways.  In addition to that, showering in hard water for the last 3 years made my hair a total disaster.  First, I tried the salon shampoo recommended by my stylist ([[ASIN:B0034CSS0K Matrix Biolage Hydratherapie Hydrating Shampoo 1000ml/33.8oz]]), then a smoothing cream ([[ASIN:B002TBFY6I Tigi Bed Head After-Party Smoothing Cream]]).  Those products did help a little but not completely.  Then, I installed a filtered shower head, which did wonders, and my stylist switched to a new shampoo (by Scruples), which also seemed to help.  Instead of the smoothing cream, she told me to use the Marrakesh Oil.  This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly long hair and I only need a little bit to work through my damp hair.  Then, I blowdry and it comes out so smooth, soft, and shiny without weighing it down or getting too greasy looking.  I don&#x27;t need any other products and I hardly even need to brush my hair between washes, which is every other day.  The stuff smells pretty good, too.  Normally, I don&#x27;t like things with an herby scent but this is nice and light.  Another plus is that there&#x27;s no need to wash your hands after applying this stuff.  Any residue that&#x27;s left on your hands can just be rubbed in, like a moisturizer, leaving your hands feeling nice and soft.  That way, nothing gets wasted.</li>
    <li> Love this product...smells so good too!</li>
    <li> Adds shine and moisture as I wanted, but do not like the scent. It is heavy on the cinnamon-y, warm spice side. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Marrakesh oil for the last 3 years and love it.  I have long hair and found my ends getting brittle. I apply the oil after I wash my hair while it is still wet. It seals in the ends without weighing down my hair. I like the pump on this bottle as compared with other hair oils which can get a bit messy.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very fine and thin hair, this works so well.  Smells so good also.</li>
    <li> I love this product, lightweight, makes hair shine! The best to use and then blow out your hair, awesome softness, and shine. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My daughter has mixed hair, which comes in a wide range of texture and coarseness. I am lucky that she has fine hair (very curly), but it truly needs the moisture from \\&quot;pink lotion\\&quot;. When I have used a moisturizing lotion it always left her hair looking greasy, but the curly was nice.  My hair dresser told me to try this product and I love it.  Talk about shine and healthy looking hair!</li>
    <li> Nothing seems to tame my hair - but Marrakesh Oil does! This stuff is great! It really helps calm my hair down to a manageable point. I have hated my hair for years and now I hate it significantly less!</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect for my super-fine hair.  The light consistency is great.  Gives me moisture without weighing my hair down at all.  Also gives me texture.  Never feels greasy.</li>
    <li> It de-fuzzes my hair and makes it shiny and manageable.  Don&#x27;t know what I did before I discovered it from my daughter!!</li>
    <li> Very good product, no regrets. Shared with friends, they love this product.  Will continue to use. Leave my looking healthy and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this oil for my hair.  I have fine thin hair and it really makes my hair feel good.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on a whim and have been hooked ever since.  I accidentally picked up a bottle while on a business trip and had zero expectations that I would find it worthwhile.  However, after the first use I noticed an improvement in the overall quality of my hair.  I have finer hair and hate overloading on too many products (which I find I have to do).  This product smells AMAZING, leaves your hair feeling soft without being weighed down, and feels more natural when used as a finishing serum to tame frizz and fly aways than anything I have ever used before.  Needless to say, I love this much better than Moroccan oil and use it daily.</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected, you have to keep applying the oil to keep the hair soft.  It did not make my hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> THis isn&#x27;t an oil, it is a syrum. We loved it the first few weeks because it really tamed our daughter&#x27;s curly hair, then it began to weigh it down real bad. Now we only use it once a week or when it&#x27;s humid out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice if you like an incense type of smell.</li>
    <li> light weight oil.  Does not leave hair oily.  Has a nice fragrance.  Liked it a little better than the regular oil.</li>
    <li> I chose this because I had received a sample product as a gift in a gift bag and it worked so well, I had to find it and buy it.</li>
    <li> Smells fabulous and makes my hair silky. How did I live without this?</li>
    <li> Best Oil for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this &#x27;light&#x27; version of hair oil for a couple of years. The bottle with every day use lasts I think anywhere from 6-8 months. It&#x27;s a very subtle product. It adds shine, manageability and some bounce. I don&#x27;t use any other products because I like my hair to just feel natural. Using this makes my hair just feel like my own, on a really good hair day, everyday. It would also work well as a blow dry buffer. I just use it on its own. I tried to use straight argan oil on my hair instead of this and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well, it just made it sort of oily stringy looking. This doesn&#x27;t do that, just shine and a bit of bounce, I don&#x27;t want to go with out it.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, slightly frizzy hair and live in a very dry climate.  This helps keep my hair manageable without feeling greasy.  I have purchased and thrown away MANY products before this one, and for the first time, I really love it!  Has a nice smell too!</li>
    <li> I meant to order the original Marrakesh Oil Hair Styling Elixir and ordered this one by mistake.  My hair is thick and wavy.  This just did not do it for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I put it on when my hair is damp(not on the roots)and its helped my hair to be healthy again without weighing it down which is hard to find.  I use one pump of the oil, that&#x27;s all, and rub it through my hands then put it on my hair when it&#x27;s damp....it helps it dry quick and actually keeps it as healthy as a product can.  It smells GREAT and works.....finally something that conditions for fine hair without weighing it down!  So worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have allergies to certain scents and moraccan oil gives me migrains. I have a lot of hair but each strand is very thin so I get bushy hair and frizz. After I towel dry and brush my hair i use 3-5 pumps of the Marrakesh oil &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;, rub my hands together and then evenly apply the oil from the ends of my hair to about half way up - avoiding the roots. Sometmes I will add a timny amount to the entire hairline around my face to tame kinks the oil smells so good, it gives off a light scent  of warm graham cracker i dont really know how else to describe it. I get compliments from everyone who gets a whiff.  I was telling my hairdresser about this brand because she uses that morracan crap She absolutely agreed with me after she tried it and is now a Marrakesh fan.</li>
    <li> Love this product , not greasy just the right balance of moisture and shine. Company packaged with care.</li>
    <li> My stylist at a high end salon introduced me to Marrakesh Oil. She suggest Earhtly Bodies because it is cheaper than the salon stuff. This stuff is great for round brushing. It smells great and leaves hair so smooth. Only thing is it doesnt really help hold style so I always have to use something else too. I put a small amount on my hair while still wet and then dry it like normal. Really helps with frizz.</li>
    <li> This product really makes your hair smell nice. I get compliments all the time about how good my hair smells when I use it. Does not make hair greasy or weigh it down. I recommend using right after washing and before your hair dries.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Love the way it keeps my hair shiny and love the divine aroma. A very little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells a little sweet but does a very nice job. Leaves hair soft and shiny. Becareful not to put on too much will weigh hair down and leave greasy.</li>
    <li> Just one use of this product and my thin lifeless hair was glossy and full. Two pumps and run through my hair. It drys faster and is more full than ever before.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I have very fine hair and this is the only oil that isn&#x27;t too heavy for my hair. Added bonus.....it smells awesome!!</li>
    <li> The spray  did not work.  It just ran down the bottle.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser started me on this product. Just a small drop of it rubbed through your hair leaves a wonderful shine.  What&#x27;s left on your hands feel lovely and smells just as good.</li>
    <li> This purchase is not as good as my original, it is a thinner liquid and not as effective. I don&#x27;t like using this one. If is definatley diferent. The label in the picture is not like the label I received.  Although the label says Earthly Body the logo is different and has what appears to be a symbol for a butterfly in between the words Earthly and Body. It feels like a knock off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 with dry, frizzy hair, and nothing I tried seemed to work before I found Marrakesh Oil Light. After a few weeks of using just a large drop on my wet hair and then styling as usual, my hair is soft, non-frizzy, and shiny. It smells great, and I love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Just one or two drops of this product manages to keep my hair in place all day (I have medium-short hair with a vertical style). I can use much less of this oil than I need of other styling oils.  However, it does have a very strong scent that reminds me of a cigar store.  The scent does dissipate after a while, but I keep detecting bursts of the scent throughout the day.  It&#x27;s a very masculine, earthy scent, but it takes some getting used to, especially if you are more used to the &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; scents in many other men&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Actually like this better than the heavier weight Argan oil. Does a great job of making your hair look smooth &amp; shiny if applied before blow-drying</li>
    <li> I got a sample from a friend and I loved it. Gives a lil more volume to my hair. Makes styling more easier. Doesnt leave my hair oily nor you have to use much.</li>
    <li> Use just a little bit when your hair is almost dry.  Smells heavenly, leaves your hair soft and silky without the frizzies!</li>
    <li> The delivering was delaite but it was oké mistakes can happen.&lt;br /&gt;THE seconde mistake was that i don&#x27;t get the ilgt marakesch oil&lt;br /&gt;But still is it oké  THE shop made there apologies and i accept them&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you.&lt;br /&gt;Greatings from marjan</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Best smell and makes hair feel nice.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> i was so excited that this was so much more then i expected. it comes out in sort of like a gel, not really liquidy, which is nice its not messy, but rub it in your hands and through your hair, its amazing and the smell is my fav part!!!! it smells soooo good! im in love, ill probably never use another hair oil ever again. im hooked!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair oil i&#x27;ve found - it&#x27;s light and smells wonderful.  I use it on my hair when wet, and then apply a small amount on the ends when dry.  I actually have people compliment my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; all the time - but I don&#x27;t wear any, it&#x27;s just this! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a silicone shine serum. It works and it smells nice but it&#x27;s not magic.</li>
    <li> I will never go without this product again ...... Light enough, smoothing, protecting and smells Amazing!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes chi serum seem horrible!!!</li>
    <li> i buy this product over and over and got like 5 people buying it too!i love the smell not too heavy</li>
