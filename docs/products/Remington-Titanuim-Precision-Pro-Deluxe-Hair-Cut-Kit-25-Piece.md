      <li>15 years ago, or a can of soda, which was $0.25 15 years ago, it&#x27;s amazing that a buzzer doesn&#x27;t cost $50-$75 today.    </li>
      <li>I bought this thinking that I could cut my own hair.  </li>
      <li>Somehow the defective battery is affecting the electric motor of these clippers so that it no longer effectively cuts hair in either mode (plugged-in or unplugged).  </li>
      <li>It also has a nice storage case, scissors, and a smock.</li>
      <li>I would have liked an additional adaptor for trim, beard, moustache.</li>

      <li>I have been pretty happy with this thing.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not a real hard thing to use.i had more than a couple people tell me i got a good haircut and was happy to tell them i did it</li>
      <li>/&gt;-light, very light...</li>
      <li>Very light.</li>
      <li>The haircut is excellent!It cut my hair very smoothly.</li>
      <li>Great, many pieces and cuts very well!</li>
      <li>On the plus side the motor and battery seem to be pretty good, but that doesn&#x27;t do you any good unless you just like to listen to the sound of a clipper running.     </li>
      <li>Many &lt;br</li>
      <li>Cuts hair well and the feel of the cutter is better than the bulky feel of most.</li>
      <li>But I do not need so many functions.</li>

      <li>and i was beyond pleased.  </li>
      <li>Works great!I love the fact you don&#x27;t have to be oiling the blades since they are oiled for life according to the instructions...</li>
      <li>i love the fact that it&#x27;s corded or cordless.  </li>
      <li>These cut through hair much better than the pair that I paid 45 bucks for at walmart.</li>
      <li>This one is mostly made of plastic.  </li>
      <li>You will be pleased with this deal.</li>
      <li>But pro-trimmer costs two or three times more.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, and the clippers cut great.</li>
      <li>It is more challenging when you get carried away and shave your eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>Most, I&#x27;d wager.</li>
      <li>THE TITANIUM BLADES ARE IN NEED OF SHARPENING WHICH WILL PROBABLY COST MORE THAN THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CLIPPER.  </li>
      <li>As with many products on the market, the manufacturing quality seems to have gone downhill over the years.  </li>
      <li>If hard-pressed, I might suggest a better storage box for all the trimmers and accessories that it comes in.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i used it for 1 month...and all of a sudden it stopped charging &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i dont know what is the problem..is it the charger? is the hair  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;clipper.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i dont understand &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Summary: It works mostly like Remington says.  But that means... not for do-it-yourself cuts, except a crewcut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details: I tried this cutter and now use a vacuum-based (e.g. Flowbee or Robo-cut) unit instead.  This cutter requires that the hair either stand by itself or be held up vertically, typically with a comb.  (It is intended to be used \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;, or across the grain if hair is held).  Thus, except for crewcuts, you must use two hands, making it difficult to clip your own back and sides without a lot of practice.  Other reviewers complained about cutting speed/sharpness.  I had no trouble, but I charged a brand-new clipper overnight, and left the power supply plugged in, *AND* oiled the blades with some clipper oil from another product I was testing.  I tried it later without re-oiling, and it actually ran slower!  The \\&quot;perma lube\\&quot; seems like marketing nonsense: one can titanium- or teflon-coat, but it will still run easier with a little oil.  (This model is not supplied with an oil vial; use only trimmer oil.)  Also, it&#x27;s true that 3.0V NiCd power (The body is sized for 2xAA, though I didn&#x27;t take mine apart.) might not be enough to drive the trimmer long-term.  Especially without oiling, the head heats up, and actually slows down -- you can hear it for yourself -- during long use.  Stop, let the head cool, and start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 3 stars, because it&#x27;s only \\&quot;mostly OK.\\&quot;  But it got 4 because it&#x27;s sooo inexpensive!  I don&#x27;t feel bad putting it away for the occasional clean-up, and using the Flowbee for my actual haircuts.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I can&#x27;t go to the barber while recovering from a bone marrow transplant. For the price, I considered it would do as an interim step, but had no great expectations. I&#x27;ll probably never go to the barber again. It is a high quality product and performs well beyond what I expected. I anticipated some hair pulling, but there is none. It has good sharp blades and high cutting speed. This is with or without using the power cord. My daughter in law cuts my hair outdoors and likes it so much she is using it on my son&#x27;s hair. He likes it as much as I do. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend who has been shaving his head for eight years. He likes the buzz-cut look, so he shaves using no attachments. This product wouldn&#x27;t even cut his hair the first time he tried to use it where as his old Conair one was still going strong. To make matters worse, it cost me almost ten dollars to ship it back to Amazon because it&#x27;s so heavy. A Christmas gift disappointment and overall pain in the...</li>
    <li> The last couple of years I&#x27;ve been paying $15 per visit to the local barber to basically get my head shaved with electric trimmers. I decided that I was wasting my money and if I could only find something good at Amazon I would never have to go to a barber again. After reading reviews I settled on the Remington Titanium. The cord/cordless feature was the primary lure.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now giving myself a complete head shave at the closest setting every two weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is light, the battery lasts more than long enough for the main shave and the secondary fine tuning. It comes with a case and a load of accessories I will never need. :) It is so inexpensive it paid for itself with just two head shavings.&lt;br /&gt;One shortcoming is that it is kind of hard to clean. At one point I partially dismantled it which was not such a good idea. I will have to live with knowing that it will always be getting hair stuck inside of it but as long as it keeps working it should not be an issue. It can be a little slippery due to the smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: July 2011 - My clippers are finally dying. The battery stopped holding a useful charge long ago so I used it cordless, shaving my head every one or two weeks for the last five years. The blades never dulled on me. I&#x27;m replacing the clippers with the current version which seem to have the same weird mix of 5s and 1s that this one received. This was money VERY well spent.</li>
    <li> Didnt cut quite as close as i wanted it to, or as other clippers do for the #1 attachment, but a very well made product, lasting battery.</li>
    <li> My wife has cut my hair since we married some 26 years ago and through the years we used just about every kind of clipper. The Remington HC-920 will be in our house for a long time, because it&#x27;s not just a cordless, but when the batteries run low it will operate with the extra long cord. It comes with all the bells and whistles to cut hair on any part of your body. Plus it comes with a mini trimmer for those hard to reach areas. It&#x27;s the finest haircut kit on the market.</li>
    <li> Do NOT waste your money on the Remington HC-920!  I&#x27;ve had mine for a little over a year and started having problems after only about 15 haircuts.  First, the battery stopped holding a decent charge long enough to cut hair for more than 5 minutes and got progressively worse as time went on.  Then it only worked when I plugged it in because the supposedly rechargeable battery was shot. Now it only works intermittently, oscillating between a high-pitched \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; sound and a low-speed/low-pitched \\&quot;whirring\\&quot; sound, even when it&#x27;s plugged in!  Somehow the defective battery is affecting the electric motor of these clippers so that it no longer effectively cuts hair in either mode (plugged-in or unplugged).  PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BRAND OR THIS MODEL OF CLIPPERS. I&#x27;m sticking with Wahl or Oster from now on.</li>
    <li> This hair clippers is smooth and easy to use and maintain.  It&#x27;s cordless and that makes it easy to cut those hard to reach spots.  I use the cord when cutting the front and sides and go cordless when cutting the back because the battery dies after 20 minutes or so.  Otherwise, they work great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for just about a year now, and at this point I&#x27;ve all but relegated them to the space under my sink. &lt;br /&gt;Though I may intend to do it more often, I end up cutting my hair about every 2 weeks on average. While this is a far-cry from my old &#x27;high-and-tight&#x27; it still looks alright I suppose.  &lt;br /&gt;I bought these clippers to replace an old pair that I&#x27;d acquired from my parents house that they had been using for the dog. Since I didn&#x27;t want dog clippers to be my primary form of haircutting, I went for the cordless Remington, thinking about how awesome it would be to avoid the cord. &lt;br /&gt;They worked alright at first, but I quickly found that they lacked power if running on battery alone. After I got a little more lazy w/ my Hair cutting schedule I found that if I didn&#x27;t get around to cutting my hair for 2-3 weeks, these clippers suddenly become torture devices.  &lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;d cut reasonably long hair (1\\&quot;) they&#x27;d jam, PULL, and I eventually found myself moving at the rate of around .000000032 MPH over my head w/ them. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using them at the moment, but looking into a solid Oyster, or something of the like. &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have particularly thick or heavy hair, so I cant really blame it on that.  &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you NEED a cordless shaver, go for it, otherwise, prepare to move slow or pay the consequences. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Exellent hair trimmmer, but it would be nice if the clips would fit smooth and not interfear with the razor cutter.</li>
    <li> I have used many clippers and trimmers, but this is in a class of its own.  I am buying a couple for XMAS presents, or shortest day of the year celebrations.    I like the angle attachments for doing around the ears and tapering the back. No annoying vibrations, or blade adjusting or oiling.    My hair grows fast, so I have recouped my cost in the first month.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.  I have been cutting my own hair for about 5 years now and have gone through some very cheaply made trimmers.  This one is pretty solid.  I echo the statements about it running slow in cordless mode but it runs fine when plugged in and the cord is long enough that I don&#x27;t even notice it.  One drawback is that the combs have a very small plastic tab that holds them in place.  This tab is easily broken and I&#x27;ve had to order replacement combs through Remington.  Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend this clipper set.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff and I was sooo happy with it, the first two or 3 times it worked great.  I went on vacation came back a month later (so 4 months since I bought it) and when I tried to use it, it would not cut at all.  I checked it and tried tightening the bolts that hold the blade and it worked for a while and then it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Tried tightening the bolts again and the thread just gave in, I had to put some new screws to get it tight again.  It never cut hair well anymore.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought and brought it to Iraq with me. I used is for about 8 mouths before it burnt up. The only down fall i have with it was the cheap guards that always popped off.</li>
    <li> I am so far satisfied with this combination of hair clipping accessories. All the components, the main clipper, the ear clipper, scissors and the various combs are working fine. The clipper charges fast and the cordless aspect is very useful and is functional since the charge lasts a long time. So far I have used it on my very short hair which is growing up from a shaven state so I am not sure how this will work on longer hair. But I think this should be fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, though quality is not perfect. The haircut is excellent!It cut my hair very smoothly. But I do not need so many functions.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money! People who gave good reviews didn&#x27;t use the clippers long. I would have given a good review at first. After 10 to 15 cuts they gave up completely. It was downhill from about 10. The battery started not lasting through a cut and I don&#x27;t have much hair. Yesterday they quit cutting at all just pulling and pinching hair. I took the blade apart and cleaned but it didn&#x27;t help much. Don&#x27;t Buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend as a christmas gift.  &lt;br /&gt;I like it becuase its cordless and I like the chrome look.  &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the one who cuts his hair and it cuts beautifully.  &lt;br /&gt;You get your money&#x27;s worth.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a good overall cutter. It comes with all the necessary combs in all of the standard lengths, and the cutter has a taper control so you can adjust the length even further. It includes scissors, hair clips, a vinyl apron, brushes, and a decent storage case to put everything in. It has everything I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this to keep my hair between 1/4\\&quot; and 3/8\\&quot; for the last two months. I cut my hair twice a week, every 4-5 days. The cutter does a good job, as long as you have patience and control. I can get the cut I want within 15 minutes. I prefer to use the unit plugged in, because I find that it runs slower from the battery alone. However, that said, I found that it would allow me to cut my hair at least 3 times before I had to recharge. This is pretty significant and acceptable. It also takes a long time to completely charge the battery (the manual states 14 hours), but there is no indication that charging is completed -- the charging light is always lit when it is plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle.  The cord is long enough to use when plugged in. Controls are simple and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included trimmer is OK, not great. I have used it to clean up my sideburns and neck line, but prefer to use a trimmer on my shaver instead. The included trimmer runs on 2 AAA batteries, and it also seems to run a little slower than I expected. However, it doesn&#x27;t scratch, and I have sensitive skin, so although it&#x27;s not a quality item, it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with this device and don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> It worked relatively well on my 20 month son&#x27;s soft hair, but it was terrible on my mom&#x27;s thick hair, which was the 4th hair cut I made with the Remington. We had to go over and over the same spots, and I had to hold her short hair with my other hand to be able to trim it. I also had to clean it at least 5 times until I finished her haircut. The other trimmer we had worked for almost 7 years. I gave 2 stars because it&#x27;s quiet and it looks nice.</li>
    <li> I had mine for about 1.5 years before my housekeeper dropped them on the blade. Now they are trashed.  I am back because I am buying the exact same clipper they worked so well.  I agree, the battery life is somewhat short, something to consider if there is no power plug where you trim your hair.  The accessory trimmer is junk, toss it in the trash, or give it to someone you don&#x27;t like very much.  Doesn&#x27;t matter, this set is so reasonably priced that I can&#x27;t justify buying anything else more expensive, this does the job.  Don&#x27;t buy these to shave your face with, I don&#x27;t feel that they get close enough, unless you are going for the 5 day old shadow look.    Thanks Remington and Amazon for a decent product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product. But one bad thing spoils whole fun -    It&#x27;s adaptor stopped working after 2 days. Battery didn&#x27;t last too long.    Otherwise blades/combs/quality of material is more than expected.  worth a try if you have separate adaptor to wrk with.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers a year ago.  They have been outstanding for that time period.  The other day it stopped cutting and left me with half a haircut.  Fortunately, there is a barber shop nearby and he fixed it.  The blades are dull after one year.  It still saved me on haircuts though.</li>
    <li> This is good quality for the money.  I have always trimmed my husband&#x27;s hair, trying to save money where I can.  These are worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Pros:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;... always oiled blades, so you never have to grease them ... very nice cutting for the first couple of haircuts ... can be cordless I guess ... good price .... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;... after the first couple of cuts, when finished cutting hair there are ALWAYS some that don&#x27;t get cut - blades don&#x27;t seem sharp enough to cut all my hair ... I have thick hair, so it gets jammed up sometimes on my head and hurts like a SOB ... cordless option is useless, as there is not enough power to cut anything ... takes a long time to recharge the batteries, not that it matters since for any haircut, it&#x27;s better to plug it in ... only a 30 day money back guarantee, so by the time you realize its a piece of junk, its already too late ...</li>
    <li> The item was good, it has different pieces and the price was not bad, thanks</li>
    <li> I have been cutting hair for my family for over 8 years.  Our old Wahl hair clipper has gotten dull, so I ordered this Remington set.  Wow!  The set provides two separate clippers: one cordless clipper with trimmer attachments for an overall cut, and another small, battery-operated clipper for clean-up trims.  Both are really sharp and operate quietly.  I am able to cut both wavy hair and straight hair.  The half-cape which comes with it is short, so I bought a longer cape from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  The scissors which are included are fine, but I like to use another pair which I also bought from Sally&#x27;s.  The beauty parlors in town charge too much for a simple cut, and the walk-in barbers don&#x27;t take appointments.  With the Remington set, our family saves time, money, and frustration.</li>
    <li> IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD THE PRICE IS REALLY GOOD....BUT IT WONT WORK AT ALL!!!!!!I COULD NOT EVEN USE IT ONCE A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!! IF I WOULD HAVE LEFT FEEDBACK JUST ON LOOKS I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS BUT LOOKS DONT CUT HAIR.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not a real hard thing to use.i had more than a couple people tell me i got a good haircut and was happy to tell them i did it myself.sure beats waitng for the barber.</li>
    <li> I just received these today and tried them out- with the cord plugged in since I didn&#x27;t want to wait to charge them- and they were terrible.  The advertised \\&quot;smoother cut, less pulling\\&quot; is a lie. From the beginning they could only cut a little hair at a time, less than half as much as the pair of clippers I used to use.  After only a few passes they jammed up and wouldn&#x27;t cut any more hair, only pull it out and mangle it.  Doesn&#x27;t work at all, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> I used a cheapo one for years and within about 10 haircuts it started catching the kids&#x27; hair because it got dull.  My sister cuts the hair of all her nephews and her husband with these things (that&#x27;s 7 people) about every 3 months and she&#x27;s been using a pair of these for about 5 years.  Still works great!  So I got one and I really love the fact that it&#x27;s cordless so I can actually chase the kids around the house to cut their hair.  Actually I like to sit then down in front of the TV so they&#x27;re distracted and it&#x27;s hard to run a cord to the middle of a room so the cordless feature is great.</li>
    <li> This kit comes with everything at a great price. You can use it cordless or plug it in and use it as a corded trimmer. The extra touchup trimmer it comes with is nice also. And it has attachments up to 1\\&quot;. It also has a nice storage case, scissors, and a smock. The trimmer is pretty quiet as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to go into all the positive things about this product, because the other contributors have exhaustive lists and its true, theres alot of good things about this cutter compared to others on the market. The one nag is that it doesnt come down to a \\&quot;zero\\&quot; grade , i think thats made as a protective mechanism , but unforetunately it means that you dont have the option of a clean cut if you want to use it to completely remove  hair (for example beard) or even for some people who like the shaven head appearance</li>
    <li> I was actually very happy when I used it the first time, cause the blades are sharp and it only takes like 10 mins to cut my hair. However, the 2nd time I used it, the cutter stop cutting hair half way. I was such a disaster I have to go to a local shop to finish my misery.... To be honest I&#x27;m a chinese guy but damn I hate the product that says Made in China cause their quality suck for most of them!</li>
    <li> WE HAVE BEEN USING THIS CLIPPER FOR MY SONS AND MY HAIRCUTS FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR.  THE TITANIUM BLADES ARE IN NEED OF SHARPENING WHICH WILL PROBABLY COST MORE THAN THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CLIPPER.  WITHIN ABOUT 3 MONTHS TWO OF THE HAIR GUIDES RECEIVED BROKEN TEETH DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY MUST BE CRAMMED INTO THE STORAGE BOX BEFORE SHUTTING IT.  ONE OF THE GUIDES WAS OUR MAIN USE GUIDE.  I TRIED CONTACTING REMINGTON AND A FEW PARTS DEALERS.  REMINGTON NEVER RESPONDED, THE PARTS DEALERS TOLD ME THEY ARE NOT REPLACEABLE.  SO WE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO GIVE HAIRCUTS USING THE OTHER GUIDES SINCE THEN.  BASCIALLY I LIKE THE CLIPPER.  IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO USE.  BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT FROM REMINGTON I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE.  WE WILL BE REPLACING THIS, NOW ALMOST USELESS, CLIPPER SOON.  REMINGTON WILL NOT GET OUR REPEAT BUSINESS!</li>
    <li> Read the bad reviews - but took a chance anyway. What a SUPERB  &lt;br /&gt;Clipper with a full load of accessories. I used the power cord immediately and it is very quiet - and smoothe, no jerking hair &lt;br /&gt;and effortless to use. Gave myself (tricky using a mirror) a  &lt;br /&gt;super trim job all around. Stunned by how smoothe and EFFORTLESS &lt;br /&gt;it was using it. Fantastic 23pc set. My BARBER has a noisy noisy &lt;br /&gt;thing he used on my head - that raised all kind of XXXX ---jerking out hair as it nearly stalled at times. Here I did my own hair and it looks darn good --with NOT EVEN ONE PULL! Many &lt;br /&gt;many years ago I bought CLIPPERS and they were terrible - snat- &lt;br /&gt;ching hair out by the roots. This REMINGTON CLIPPER is fantastic &lt;br /&gt;smoothe and quiet and worth every penny. With this unit ANYBODY can be a Barber in about an hour. I RECOMMEND this product 100 &lt;br /&gt;percent - and love the \\&quot;adventure\\&quot; of cutting my own hair - and &lt;br /&gt;saving money!  Jack (and I&#x27;m 72)</li>
    <li> I have been cutting hair with clippers for close to 15 years now. After my last Wahl finally gave up the ghost, I thought to try these clippers.   Nice appearance, description and at the time, nice price...so I thought, \\&quot;Why not\\&quot;  My previous Wahl wasn&#x27;t a cordless and I thought a cordless would make for a nice change.    What a disappointment, right from the begining. These clippers are not heavy duty at all. Don&#x27;t let that \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; finish fool you. It&#x27;s light weight plastic.   In trying to cut my husband&#x27;s slightly grown out military cut, it began to bog down but we managed to get through it-SLOWLY.  In trying to use the cordless feature, found that they were even more gutless.   After about 6 months and 6 cuts, the clippers began to \\&quot;snag\\&quot; and would stop cutting. I would have to go back to the starting point and make another \\&quot;run\\&quot; for it.   Finally, after what took twice the time than it should-I completed his simple cut.   After giving my baby his first hair cut (for which he has baby-fine hair) and having the same experience with his hair as I had with my husband&#x27;s hair...I decided that these are best suited in the trash bin.   They aren&#x27;t worth my time and they certainly aren&#x27;t worth putting my family through the misery.  After I finish this review, I will be placing a new order for a Wahl set.    Good luck to you and yours.    *Update* 01/23/06  I have since purchased and used the Wahl Super Taper II clippers and to date, these have been my absalute favorite! A sweet set of clippers. We are all very happy. Shop around and you may just find a good deal on these Wahls.</li>
    <li> Works great!I love the fact you don&#x27;t have to be oiling the blades since they are oiled for life according to the instructions...just keep them clean. The way I see it it paid for itself after the second haircut so you can&#x27;t beat that!!!</li>
    <li> A Great Kit for the price, well made with a carry case &lt;br /&gt;I would recomend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but not for long. Battery, although fully charged, provided less and less cutting endurance as time went by. For a period we used it with the cord, but now it won&#x27;t even run when it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
    <li> I missed the oil bottle in the package (no big deal). good product. does what it says it will do. i have already done 2 hair cuts with it and saved money equal to the price i paid. from here on its free.</li>
    <li> My wife who cuts my hair is satisfied with this product. She plans to buy one for her sons birthday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this thing twice so far.  I didn&#x27;t experience any trouble with it \\&quot;snagging\\&quot; and not cutting hair.  The battery is kinda short - it died out after about 15-20 minutes of use the first time I used it.  No problems the second time (maybe I just got faster?)  I&#x27;m a young male and just slap a guard on this thing and buzz my hair down - really glad I invested in this instead of paying some goon to do it for me.  The device is comfortable in your hand.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  The clippers are pre-oiled for life according to the user guide.  The guard selection is comes with is very good.  All in all I would recommend this for a home hair cutting solution - solid product, good price.</li>
    <li> I am using this hair cut kit for the past 1 year without any issues. I highky recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The attachments have this tiny, thin, plastic tab that is suppose to hold them on to the cutter. Try putting on an attachment a couple of times, and they all break off, rendering the attachment (and the entire kit) useless. Save your money and avoid like the plague.</li>
    <li> It does the job but I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s not powerful enough. The speed of trimmer is slow. If you are looking for a kind of professional trimmer - this product is not for you. But pro-trimmer costs two or three times more. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 10 years. i had to purchase  a new pair of clippers every year because of the oilable adjustable lever begin to misadjust while using them. after i purchased the Remington HC-920, my problem was relieved. The HC-920 nonoilable adjustable lever never misadjustment during using. i accidently drop the clippers onto the bathroom sink countertop and a tooth on the razor head broke and the clippers begin to sound like a chain saw. perfect set of clippers but never drop them...</li>
    <li> When used with anything but the one inch attachment it badly pulls hair. Even the scissors and trimmer are dull.</li>
    <li> Used the product and satisfied with it so far. I have tried to use the trimmer which does not seem to work with re-chargeable batteries. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I will definitely recommend this product. I do not have any hair pulling experiences as described in other reviews.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Wahl trimmers which I just wasn&#x27;t happy with - they were too heavy and the clip-on guides fell off a couple of times leaving my hair looking awful.  So, I bought this box set and it&#x27;s just great.  The trimmers recharge or you can plug them in, they&#x27;re light, well built and easy to use.  Plus the box comes with loads of extras like a mini trimmer etc.  And the carry case is really nice.</li>
    <li> I am bald in the front and center of my head.  I use the cutters to keep the remaining hair short and even, which it does very well.  If it stays sharp and doesn&#x27;t break down I will be even happier.  In addition it&#x27;s light weight and shape make it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the amount of pieces this set has.  The blades work well - I can&#x27;t really tell if they&#x27;ve dulled yet or not (its been a few months with regular hair cuts &amp; beard trims). I&#x27;d recommend this product; it&#x27;s been working fine.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, very sharp blades and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the same reason as others - light, cordless, positive reviews and Remingtons reputation.  I used it 8 to 10 times before it stopped working.  In all fairness I was initially pleased with the cutter the breif time it worked.         The unit will not recharge and the only solution according to Remington&#x27;s parent company is that I ship it to them at my expense.   There&#x27;s no guarantee that the repaired unit will work or a new unit will work.  The risk and expense is all assumed by the customer.  Clearly the manufacturer does not believe in their own product or express any desire to develop a reputation or goodwill with a customer.    My previous cutter from Wahl lasted 10 years and is still working.  I just liked the idea of upgrading to a modern cordless unit.    I&#x27;m still hoping Remington will reconsider but at this point it looks like Remington just lost another customer.   [...]</li>
    <li> I bought this product, dreaming of the freedom of cordless hair cutting, cut my hair once and the next time it was too dull to cut. I contacted Remington for warranty service and they made me send it in to get a new one. That one went dull after 5 haircuts. Better, but really wasteful. I can&#x27;t figure out where to get replacement blades, but I can&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s worth it as they will probably be of similar quality.     I don&#x27;t have wiry hair; I have fine hair (and not much of it).  This is just a failed  product. On the plus side the motor and battery seem to be pretty good, but that doesn&#x27;t do you any good unless you just like to listen to the sound of a clipper running.     Don&#x27;t waste time and money with this item - go with Wahl or maybe Oster (I had an acceptable Oster that lasted about 4-5 years).</li>
    <li> Im probably not the best person to review this complete haircut kit as I literally shave my head short (number 1) all over. However for this persom they are great. They feel very well made and durable. They are extremely sharp and not having to oil them is a very welcome feature. They hold their charge well enough. As for the other 21 pieces in the set I can really comment as I wont be using them but they look of a decent quality. Shame remington cannot introduce a stand alone clipper set without all the fancy accessories for a cheaper price for those who just buzz cut though.</li>
    <li> Great Clipper for the money. The charge lasts long. The blade stays sharp. Lots of accessories. All in all a great kit.</li>
    <li> I wonder how many of these positive reviews were written by folks soon after using this thing for the first time. Most, I&#x27;d wager. Problem is, the blades on this clipper must be made out of the same steel that soup cans are made of, that is to say they go dull VERY fast. Either that or I have hair made out of Kevlar®.  Half way through my second buzz-job the clippers became useless, leaving me to make an embarrassing foray to the local Lemon Tree to put the tattered remains of my hair out of it&#x27;s misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have laughed my a$$ off if it had happened to some other jerk...</li>
    <li> Picked up this new set as replacement for my old clipper that gave out after 10 years of use.  Comes in nice black plastic and let you keep all your haircut equipments together.  I was using a cheap plastic bag before since my previous case broke in the first few years of use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Comes with different length attachments, a left and right side, and is a lot lighter and quieter than the one i used to own.  Works great and no oiling is needed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only down side is that you&#x27;ll notice difference when running in cordless mode.  It feels like the battery is about to give out since the motor is moving so slow.  I guess it could be &#x27;battery mode&#x27; like those in laptops. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I decided to switch from using a corded to a cordless hair trimmer and have not been disapointed with the related sense of freedom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, I would like to point out the following observations which I feel potential buyers should be made aware of: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- using the charged shaver fully charged is great but it has a tendency to tug the hairs and requires slower movement to avoid this happening. The resulting cut also leaves my hair feeling coarse to the touch as if I&#x27;d used a pairt of blunt scissors. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- the instructions say it is necessary to charge the shaver for 14 hours prior to use and they are not wrong. I once tried using the charge left in the shaver from a previous trim but this soon ran out although I was able to plug in the cord and continue cutting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- using the shaver with the cord plugged in I noticed that the blades appeared to operate at a much higher frequency which also allowed me to perform a faster cut with no danger of tugging. The end result also felt much smoother than when using the shaver cordless. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- the small nose , beard, etc trimmer that accompanied the shaver came without the necessary batteries and would not work with my own batteries but Remington were very helpful and sent a replacement (a slight upgrade as it turned out that also came complete with batteries and its own carry case) after a quick phone call to their customer number. However, it did take over a month to arrive but this may have been due to the seasonal postal delays related to Thanksgiving and Christmas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In summary, its a very light, inexpensive and practical device for anyone like myself wishing to cut their hair frequently. However, nice as cordless sounds, the amount of time needed to charge the shaver and the related quality of the cut make me question whether I should have just stuck to a corded shaver.</li>
    <li> Both of the included trimmers do a very good job of cutting. The cordless feature on the large trimmer is helpful, but the charge doesn&#x27;t last for very long before the trimmer starts to slow down. It is enough for a single haircut, though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sleek and looks very nice but the box smells like melted plastic and it DOESN&#x27;T cut! If you have thick hair... look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Very nice use with blades, indeed very sharp blades. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The batteries without power cord are a bit useless, they dont last long, they should put a bigger and lasting capable engine</li>
    <li> I have never bought clippers, in fact, i&#x27;ve been wearing my hair long and uncut for a few years now. When I first used the remington clippers, they sliced through my thick shag giving me a bald head. they are very nice clippers and i would recommend them to anyone for home use. I have shaved my head twice and I&#x27;ve already made them worth the price...</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair grows very quickly and I don&#x27;t like to go to the haircutter&#x27;s every two months to shave my hair for ten bucks. So I bought this and the first time I used it, I accidentally shaved my head. I put it on the wrong setting. So I was like, \\&quot;What the heck...\\&quot; and I shaved the rest of my hair off. It was extremely easy and quick. It cuts through hair like butter. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this a gift for someone who cuts his own hair, and he loved it! Great, many pieces and cuts very well!</li>
    <li> I just received this clipper. It may work for fine hair, but I tried trimming my beard and these pulled hairs. They just can&#x27;t handle facial hair.     The other reason I am trashing these is the terrible battery life. I charged it for 24 hours and they gave me maybe 15 minutes of run time before I could hear them start to sound like the battery was running out and they were then dead 5 minutes later.    I feel I wasted my money</li>
    <li> Remington used to make decent trimmers but now the cutters are so cheap that they&#x27;re more likely to yank your hair out than trim it.  Their customer service is horrendous.  Never again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and the clippers cut great. The price is great. You will be pleased with this deal. I hate going to the barber since all I basically want is a uniformed cut that looks trimmed and clean. I haven&#x27;t used the little trimmer that came with it. I used the main clippers for everything. These cut through hair much better than the pair that I paid 45 bucks for at walmart. G&#x27;luck</li>
    <li> The blades are not very sharp so don&#x27;t use it on your face, it will pull out your hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been keeping my hair really short (1/8\\&quot;) since last year.  To keep a nice and consistent look, I end up cutting my hair about 2x times a week.  This clipper does the job in much less time than any other shaver I&#x27;ve had in the past.  Not only have the blades been sharp for several cuttings, the battery has lasted much longer (3-4 cuttings) than previous shavers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only one drawback -- the blade is long.  A long blade is great for cutting the whole head quickly, but not as good for the edges around the ears.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many different clippers from different brands and this one is the best. This is the second one I bought for myself.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy.  This shaver has been a big saver for me.  For the cost of less than 2 haircuts at the barber shop I picked up the 25 Piece Remington Titanuim Precision Pro Deluxe Hair Cut Kit and I now cut my own hair.  Gives an excellent cut, no pulling, very clean.    If you prefer a short (crew cut) style of hair cut this would be a great purchase to make.</li>
    <li> I have very very mixed feelings about these clippers.  On the one hand,   the clippers themselves are excellent.  The blades are sharp and cut quickly and without pulling. I&#x27;ve had these clippers for six months or so now, and they haven&#x27;t dulled.  Unlike other clippers, the blades don&#x27;t need oiling, which makes them easy to clean.  The battery in the unit holds a charge seemingly forever.  They feel good in the hand and well weighted and the blade adjustment is well made.      But then there are the combs.  I use these clippers every other week to cut my husband&#x27;s hair with the 1/4\\&quot; comb attachment.  Or I did, for the first five months, after which the 1/4\\&quot; attachment broke.  Looking at the other combs, they are very flimisily made and have very weak tabs holding them on.      I found you can buy new combs for the unit -- but only as full sets, and for $6 plus $7 shipping.  Ouch.  I sent email to remington&#x27;s customer service complaining about this, and heard nothing back.      I am significantly less happy with these clippers minus the one comb that I need, and very reluctant to throw more money at the same very poorly made comb attachments.  I had oster clippers before this and although it needed more regular maintnance at least I could buy the combs. I&#x27;m seriously considering going back to an oster.</li>
    <li> Got these at a reasonable price-they worked ok for a few months and got dull real quick. Tried to find replacement blade-no luck. I guess I&#x27;ll get a more expensive haircut machine-it is not worth another chance.</li>
    <li> Simply put, these clippers work great.  I really don&#x27;t know what a couple of the other reviewers have been talking about.  My hair is particularly thick, and the clippers run through it like a knife through warm butter.  The cordless option is fantastic.  Though it is indeed a bit less powered than when plugged into an outlet, it worked well enough for me to cut my hair standing in the tub so that the hair clippings did not fall all around the bathroom.  Let&#x27;s run through the summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;-light, very light...so it&#x27;s easily maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;-very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;-comes with a bunch of different size groomers and trimmers for varying lengths.  I have opted to go near bald sometimes and otherwise chosen to leave my hair pretty long in other cases.  It worked well in both instances.&lt;br /&gt;-cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-really, I can&#x27;t think of one.  If hard-pressed, I might suggest a better storage box for all the trimmers and accessories that it comes in.  But quite frankly, you get two brushes to clean the trimmers, a bunch of varying length attachments, and a storage bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a terrific clippers and a great value.  Frankly, the only thing that irks me is that the price has come down 5 bucks since I bought mine 6 months ago.  But, the price was still low in the first place, so what&#x27;s the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am lowering the review to 4 stars.  The clippers are still pretty nice, but they lose their sharpness very very quickly.  I am in talks with Remington to figure out a way to resolve this problem.</li>
    <li> This is a best buy for use in the home.  It comes with everything you need in the beginning nothing to add later.</li>
    <li> This is a handy haircut kit, reasonably priced and easy to use. I would have liked an additional adaptor for trim, beard, moustache.</li>
    <li> It seems to be much better built than the several Oster clippers I&#x27;ve owned and the fact that it is cordless is a real plus.</li>
    <li> I have had my share of trimmers and this one works the best and the easiest to clean.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the cutting power of the HC-920, I have very thick hair that normally jams up clippers unless I constantly stop to take my hair out. Not the case with the HC-920.  &lt;br /&gt; My only qualm is the very short battery life. If I do not charge it before each use -I use it once every two weeks-. It will go dead by the middle of my haircut. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item expecting it to be a great product because of the remington name... Boy was I surprised... After charging the trimmer for 20 hours (Suggested is 14) the battery only lasted for 20 minutes!!! I was still cutting my hair when the thing died... If I wanted to have it plugged in to cut my hair I would not have bought a cordless trimmer... So unless you can cut hair at warp speed I would suggest looking elsewhere for a set of clippers.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and plunged ahead, only $30.  6 mos later I had the bad experience posted by many others here.  It still buzzes just fine, only it pulls, hurts, tugs, but stopped cutting after 6 mos and maybe 10 uses.  Like the idea of home cuts and now shopping again cause this one&#x27;s just no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and product support, customer service; fughedaboutit... non existent; voicemail circular menu to nowhere and email web comments -- no replies.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this clipper.  As many pointed out, it will stop cutting after a couple of occasions.  I used it mainly to trim by beard, every two weeks on average, plus cut my hair maximum ten times, all this over a period of 2 years - and it simply does not cut anymore.  Just don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s not worth any money since it will be money thrown away pretty soon.</li>
    <li> This is a real nice package for the price. I&#x27;ve already paid for the thing after two trims. I appreciate the assortment of guide combs even though I keep my hair (what&#x27;s left of it, anyway) very short these days. the ergonomics allow it to function as an excellent beard and mustache groomer as well. Because it&#x27;s cordless and very quiet, it&#x27;s probably an effective pet grooming tool (haven&#x27;t tested that aspect of the tool yet) for long-haired cats and dogs.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The little personal groomer is noisy and non-rechargeable. I don&#x27;t have much use for it, so there is really nothing to complain about.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been pretty happy with this thing. Its reasonably priced, and works really well. It looks pretty good too. Has every possible attachment anyone could possibly want.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever post to amazon. So, believe me when I say this item is worthless. I started looking for a new set of clippers when my old set of conairs became dull.  I read both good and bad reviews and reluctantly decided to take a chance.  After charging the clippers for the recommended time, my wife tried cutting my hair.  After just two passes w/o the cord and two passes w/ the cord, we quickly switched to my old set of \\&quot;dull\\&quot; clippers.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please, save your money and choose another set.</li>
    <li> Over the course of the past 15 years I&#x27;ve owned several different buzzers.  As with many products on the market, the manufacturing quality seems to have gone downhill over the years.  To be fair, the prices have stayed about the same over the years, which, when inflation is taken into consideration, means the price in real dollars has fallen.  In other words, I paid about $20 for my first buzzer 15 years ago, and I paid a little over $20 for this one.  Compared to a commodity like gasoline, which was under $1/gal. 15 years ago, or a can of soda, which was $0.25 15 years ago, it&#x27;s amazing that a buzzer doesn&#x27;t cost $50-$75 today.    Well, some buzzers do cost $50-$75 today, and I think I&#x27;ll invest in one next time.  This buzzer, priced at $25, has many attractive features: price, cordless, bonus smaller buzzer thrown in.  This buzzer also comes with what I can only assume the manufacturer believes to be attractive features, like a million attachments, a cape, a comb, a big plastic box to hold it all.  But the buzzer itself feels poorly manufactured, compared to my previous buzzers.  This one is mostly made of plastic.  The only attachment I was planning on using--which I would expect to be made of plastic, but thicker plastic--broke during its third use.    I would prefer for a higher quality product to be offered at this price point, without all the bells and whistles.  All I really need is a high quality buzzer with 4 or 5 attachments.  I don&#x27;t need 20 attachments and all the other plastic thrown in.  I don&#x27;t need the bonus little buzzer.    But, again, one can&#x27;t expect much for $25.  Next time I&#x27;ll fork over more money and hope for higher quality.    UPDATE: After using owning this buzzer for 10 months, I&#x27;ve given up on it.  As mentioned above, the attachment I intended to use broke after three uses.  So I resigned myself to having shorter hair, and last week that attachment broke during the middle of a haircut, having been used less than 10 times.  There I was, halfway through a haircut with a broken attachment, with the next size up already broken . . . so I was forced to hold the broken attachment over the blade to finish the job . . . so I could leave my house without looking like an idiot.  I&#x27;ve now bitten the bullet and ordered a professional quality buzzer, the Oster Classic 76.  The cost is high at $125, but I&#x27;m hoping to soon write a review about how I&#x27;ll never have to buy another buzzer.  Stay tuned!</li>
    <li> Despite the great price, the Remington hair cutter doesn&#x27;t actually cut hair.  The first time we used it, it was fabulous. But now, it pulls the hair rather than cutting it.</li>
    <li> [...]  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the box is nice and the items included are very cool...but after two or three uses, mine didn&#x27;t even cut anymore.  I ended up throwing it away.    Stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor on my son (age 4) and my fiance for 6 months now, every 2 weeks minimum.  It still works like the day I took it out of the box!  We love this razor, it is lightweight and extremely easy to use.  Also cuts great, my son goes nearly bald and my fiance leaves about 1/4 inch... it does both wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Yeah, Ok, it doesn&#x27;t stay sharp forever, but for the cost of about one barbershop haircut (maybe 2), you can cut your hair for a year.  Then buy a new one.  The cordless aspect is perfect.</li>
    <li> I have used it now 4 times and have not had a problem yet. The charge lasted 3.5 times and that&#x27;s plenty for me. It actually bested my expectations from other reviews.    Cuts hair well and the feel of the cutter is better than the bulky feel of most. Very light. Would have given it 4.5 stars if had the chance.    Pros: Feels in hand, Cordless, Battery life, Solid case, Extra cutter.  Cons: Case might be to small for all extras, takes 10 minutes to try to fit everything in. Can not find attachments to go over 1&#x27;&#x27; like Wahl has.</li>
    <li> The clipper is cheaply made.      The battery capacity is low - after fewer than 10 recharge cycles, the battery can&#x27;t last through a simple hair cut for a kid.  During each of the recharge cycles, I fully drained the battery and charged it over night, to minimize memory effect.    The accessory combs are easily broken.  The combs are made from plastic, not nylon.  The plastic is brittle.  The part that holds the comb to the clipper was poorly designed, looked weak, and was weak.  My 1/8\\&quot; comb broke after about 20 uses.  Since it&#x27;s the only one I use, I have to go find a replacement.    The replacement comb costs only $5.99, but is hard to find.  It&#x27;s out-of-stock at the Remington store.  Now I have to replace the entire kit because of a single cheap part.    Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been buying cheap clippers for years now, when i decided to try out something on amazon.com.  i was looking for anything in the $30-$50 range, reading everyone else&#x27;s reviews to get an idea of what everyone else wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i stumbled across the remington&#x27;s, drawn to them because the set came with the regular clippers and the fine-tuning clippers.  two clippers for $30?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the first thing i noticed when i plugged them in was how light weight they are.  i&#x27;m so used to using what felt like a brick to cut my hair that these really light weight clippers seemed to help me get better control over what i was trying to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after waiting a few weeks to finally order them, my hair had grown out of control.  i shave my head bald so when it got to about an inch long, it was time.  the very minute the blades touched my hair, i was expecting them to slow a bit, maybe semi-jam, or something.  my hair is pretty thick, but these blades effortlessly cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;honestly, because the blades were so sharp, it took less than half the amount of time to cut my hair than i&#x27;m used to.  i mean, these blades are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t even charge them.  i love the fact that it&#x27;s corded or cordless.  i simply plugged them in and started cutting and i was beyond pleased.  i also like the fact it has a mini guard setting on the clippers instead of having to use the plastic guards it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing, though, is that the fine-tuning clippers need batteries.  i haven&#x27;t even used them because i thought i could plug them in and check them out, too, but i used a razor to fine-tune.  and i wish it came with some lubing oil, since i&#x27;m so used to oiling my clippers.  maybe they do and i got gipped.  no big deal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, i&#x27;ve only used them this once and i&#x27;m more than satisfied.  i&#x27;ve never really thought about doing reviews, but i was so impressed with these clippers, i had to post something for whoever cares.</li>
    <li> That was the scream of my husband when getting his hair cut by this new set of clippers.  Our old one finally died after 5 years (a different brand) so I tried to research some clippers.  I saw Remington seemed to have only a slightly higher rating than others so I thought we&#x27;d go for that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only pro?  It&#x27;s whisper quiet, he didn&#x27;t even know it was on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...until wads of his hair were getting ripped from his scalp.  He likes his hair short (less than 1/2\\&quot;) and we had to whittle using the 1/2\\&quot; attachment which made him wince and then again with the 3/8\\&quot; and 1/4\\&quot; attachments to get it even all over.  I was literally sweating I was so nervous cutting his hair because he was obviously in pain.  This is going back PRONTO and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be reviewing another brand...hopefully a positive one!</li>
    <li> These clippers work very well.  However, you have to finish quickly before the charge runs out (I&#x27;ve said that somewhere else, before).</li>
    <li> I used these clippers a lot for simple crew cuts, and the clippers were fairly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in retrospect&lt;br /&gt;the internal battery was not useful, because i always used the clippers with the electric cord, and in fact&lt;br /&gt;the internal battery was significantly counter-productive, because there were times when the clippers would not function sufficiently to cut hair, even with the electric cord attached, because the battery was not sufficiently charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the motor seemed not as powerful as that of the Wahl Color Pro clippers.</li>
    <li> it s realy good clipper and the free small clipper helps alot with the edges . just sometimes it can be sharp enough to cut your skin that happen twice for me . i dont know is this my fault or the machine i m just a beginner.MY advice \\&quot;buy it \\&quot;it s worthy for every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that I could cut my own hair.  The sleek design is attractive and professional looking.  The components are abundant and the storage container holds them nicely when neatly organized.  The charge holds ok and can cut without cord for about an hour or so (when charged for a few hours).  Cutting hair on your own head can be challenging.  It is more challenging when you get carried away and shave your eyebrows.  I haven&#x27;t used the small cutter yet...it uses 2 x AAA batteries; but seems that it can trim in very tight places.  Easy to clean and fun to use.  A great buy! Again, use with caution.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> Positives &lt;br /&gt;The product seems to be good. Almost everything works fine. Good investment for the price paid. Lots of extra accessories provided. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Negative &lt;br /&gt;Only the neckline trimmer seems to have problem. The problem is with the circuit. It seems to be loose and not complete. I put a penny(coin) at the end of the cap and closed it. Its a bit hard to close but closes without breaking the cap. It works perfect after the alteration. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other than the problem described everything is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!!!!! This is the first machine that can really cut the hair of Afro-Americans without sounding like it is going to explode!!! &lt;br /&gt;I wish that the the little clippers that came with it was electric too and not battery operated. &lt;br /&gt;A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i originally purchased this item to cut my husband and sons hair.(their barber recently retired). figured,it&#x27;s a great price and how hard could it be to use. IT&#x27;S EASY!! it comes w/everything you need-even sizes and attachments you might not know you need! HIGHLY RECOMMEND-(keep in mind-once friends and family find out you have one-you could wind up using it more than you ever imagined!!!!</li>
    <li> Apologies in advance for not being able to write out a long review for this item.    Anyways. I purchased these clippers a little under a year ago and for whatever reason they are unable to shave properly anymore. I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t gone out of my way to maintain them (just the standard cleaning after use and oiling on occasion) however they just won&#x27;t cut my hair anymore. I have no idea the reason this could be because the first 3 or 4 times I used them they cut my hair perfectly fine. They won&#x27;t even shave without the guard attachments in place. More or less it traps small portions of my hair and feels as though it&#x27;s ripping them out my head now. Quite terrible.    I figure the blades must have dulled somehow or the internal battery isn&#x27;t supplying enough energy to move the clippers. Anyhow I&#x27;ve taken it all apart and made sure everything was clean and free of any obstructions. They just don&#x27;t cut anymore. I&#x27;ve probably used these 4-5 times total so I guess I saved some money on getting haircuts but I would have expected these to last longer.    As for the mechanical quality of these clippers. They really are quite poorly built. The weight is very low and I believe the shell is made of chromed plastic. I was never able to use the clippers properly without the charge cable attached because it would not supply enough power no matter how long they&#x27;d been left to charge.     Have to say I also own a remington electric shaver for facial hair and it&#x27;s faired quite a bit better than these since I&#x27;ve owned it close to two years and use it on a daily basis. The electric beard trimmer attachment however no longer cuts properly and I think it uses the same sort of metal or mechanics as these clippers. I have to replace both now. After my experience with these clippers I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase another Remington product in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a good purchase.  The clipper is lightweight, fits well in the hand, and the cordless feature is very handy.  The entire kit, with small trimmer is a good deal.  A good one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this kit for over a couple years now and never had any issues with it. The battery still holds good charge and the blades are intact. This kit has paid itself and more in the couple years I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper almost 8 years ago. At first I used it to shave my head due to a medical treatment that made my hair fall, and lately to trim my beard. It has worked pretty well and I don&#x27;t have any complaints. After all this time, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for a full shave, but that is to be expected. It is still sharp and does a good job while plugged into a wall socket. That is not as convenient as wireless operation, but it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with an assortment of guide combs (I haven&#x27;t used most), a pair of scissors I sometimes use to trim my mustache or sideburns and a cape that I lost. I never used the smaller clipper that came with it. I am pretty happy with this clipper and would buy a similar product if I needed it (but I don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries are an issue, so I opened it up, cleaned all the grossness that had accumulated in these years of use (quite a lot) and found it uses two Nickel-Cadmium 1.2V, 600mAH batteries. I&#x27;ve ordered a pair right here on Amazon for $8.52 ([[ASIN:B000FP63M4 Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models &amp; others]]) and will replace them; it doesn&#x27;t seem like a hard fix, but it will require some soldering.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 of these over the years, and I have to say that they did the job, however last year I upgraded to an Oster Professional and the difference is large to say the least. The Remington does cut away at your hair well enough and it is great as a wireless option, but it is not gentle on the head and the power of the motor is a lot less and this makes a big difference to the speed and smoothness of the cutting experience. If you can&#x27;t afford something better this will most certainly get the job done, but there are much better clippers out there for a little more money.</li>
