      <li>I use this stuff as well, Im honest</li>
      <li>The reps are always honest and helpful.</li>
      <li>Received quickly and in great shape.</li>
      <li>Large bottle and a very good price.</li>
      <li>Most Bod fragrances are based on something that is popular.</li>
      <li>but the fresh fragrance is a pleasant experience during that time and it does linger on ones clothes so beware.  </li>
      <li>I used to LOVE this spray -- it was fresh-smelling, macho, sexy in an understated way, and made me a MAGNET.</li>
      <li>My wife love&#x27;s it too.</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite bodyspray.  </li>
      <li>I think the blue one is the best one myself</li>
      <li>THIS IS NOT MY FAVORITE, BUT IT&#x27;S STILL OUT THERE.</li>
      <li>It would have been more of a pain to return it.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m ok with the product.    </li>
      <li>Love the smell of this stuff been using it for years and my girlfriend loves it to</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>but after using it for a while, I began to truly enjoy the scent!  </li>
      <li>BOD spray fragrace is an excellent backup to regular bathing.  </li>
      <li>and I have never smelled more ripped.</li>
      <li>Most important of all is that the women love it</li>
      <li>Great for in the Summer, when sweating from outdoors or busy around the house, etc.</li>
      <li>Only a spray or two of this in the morning, and you are good to go all day!</li>
      <li>Even when I have a huge hoodie on, people stop me in the street and comment on how \\&quot;ripped\\&quot; my abs are.</li>
      <li>MAKES YOU FEEL FRESH AND SEXY</li>
      <li>Cheap and unique fragrance that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Smells  great  similar to  Cool Water&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
      <li>This is a knock off of Davidoff Cool Water.</li>
      <li>real Cool Water is a slightly better scent to me, and it&#x27;s also longer lasting.</li>
      <li>However, at this price, you can afford to wear as much as you like, and then it lasts just fine.</li>
      <li>It might not be the best for you high class date nights, but as an everyday body spray, I have no complaints!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price you pay for it.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to many fragrances used in men&#x27;s products but this one gives me no trouble.</li>
      <li>worth the price if you like that smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is clean and fresh, and isn&#x27;t as pungent as you might otherwise expect from a &#x27;real&#x27; cologne.  </li>
      <li>The Bod Man Really Ripped Abs fragrance has that clean fresh \\&quot;just got out of the shower\\&quot; smell, that mimics CK1.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>For me, this is much more preferable than an aerosol which mainly perfumes the air and not so much the body.  </li>
      <li>Bod Man Really smells great and lasts much longer than other body sprays.</li>
      <li>very fast shipping will buy from again....</li>
      <li>Out of all the scents I use this one gets me the most attention out of any I use, Such as axe, chrome, armani code, I am king.....</li>
      <li>Better price then the local drug stores.</li>
      <li>Enter Bod Man Really Ripped Abs Spray.  </li>
      <li>I really like this spray.  </li>
      <li>Also, for the record \\&quot;really ripped abs\\</li>
      <li>This smells 100% like really ripped abdominals.</li>
      <li>This stuff really smells like really ripped abs.</li>
      <li>Granted, I didn&#x27;t use it as much as it was sprayed on me, but you get the picture.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>I think that my abs are even getting a little more ripped just by using this spray.</li>
      <li>The first time I bought this it was actually as a joke, so I could tell people that I have really ripped abs...</li>
      <li>After the long hot shower that accompanies a good work out, after the pool or anytime you want to freshen up clean skin with a something other than your usual colognes.</li>
      <li>old &amp; now loves this stuff........</li>
      <li>Have you ever been stuck next to someone in the gym who could really use a shower?  </li>
      <li>Not very interesting or unique</li>
      <li>&quot; would smell the same as \\&quot;totally normal</li>
      <li>now, this new batch in the tinted dark-blue bottle with the black spray head -- is NOT the \\&quot;Bod Man Really Ripped</li>
      <li>It used to come in a clear bottle, and the liquid was blue.</li>
      <li>Now its in a blue bottle and liquid is clear.</li>
      <li>nothing like barely ripped abs, or even somewhat toned abs.</li>
      <li>Industrial feel and delivery system while at first seemed off putting, actually allows you to spray heartily and distribute evenly as it goes on wet.  </li>

<li> long it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> This is the sixth time I ordered it and as long as they make it I buy it.</li>
<li> (Secret: my abs are actually sub-par, but this spray gives me the illusion of really ripped ones!)</li>
<li> /&gt;It has little to no staying power on the skin past the first hour or so</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> Not sure why this customer stated such without calling the company as I did.</li>
<li> pungent, tinny, sharp, overpowering.&lt;br</li>
<li> Specific Bod products are hard to find, however Amazon has them.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff religiously for the past few months</li>
<li> Either way they were sorry I had a bad batch and sent me a new bottle for free.</li>
<li> They recreate the scent, price it for less, and sell lots of cologne.</li>
<li> I think if it sits too long it loses its kick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Just spritz a little under you work-out garments, and you won&#x27;t have to worry.  </li>
<li> In my opinion it is a step up from the everyday AXE body sprays, and the scent lasts quite a bit longer.  </li>
<li> The only strange thing was that at the base of the spray nozzle, there is a big sticker that says, \\&quot;Tester.\\&quot;    </li>
<li> unfortunately it does not last too terribly long as it is only a body spray :(</li>
<li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
<li> I also called the company and complained.</li>
<li> My question is: What does \\&quot;Tester\\&quot; really mean?    </li>
<li> SENT ALSO SUBTLE</li>
<li> Seriously for the price you cannot beat this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> , they think it&#x27;s some expensive cologne.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the scent is rather &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; in my opinion.  </li>
<li> abs\\&quot; neither of which smell like this crap.</li>

    <li> I used to LOVE this spray -- it was fresh-smelling, macho, sexy in an understated way, and made me a MAGNET. Everyone around me LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, this new batch in the tinted dark-blue bottle with the black spray head -- is NOT the \\&quot;Bod Man Really Ripped Abs\\&quot; I used to know and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pungent, tinny, sharp, overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened..................?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two bottles and although I probably should return them, I&#x27;ll try diluting them with water -- with the hope that maybe that will cut the fragrance a bit so it&#x27;s usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am VERY VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff...unfortunately it does not last too terribly long as it is only a body spray :(</li>
    <li> Best body spray on the market bar none! I am allergic to many fragrances used in men&#x27;s products but this one gives me no trouble. My wife love&#x27;s it too. This is the sixth time I ordered it and as long as they make it I buy it. As a commercial once said \\&quot;Try It You&#x27;ll Like It!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This stuff really smells like really ripped abs. Don&#x27;t worry, it smells nothing like barely ripped abs, or even somewhat toned abs. This smells 100% like really ripped abdominals. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff religiously for the past few months and I have never smelled more ripped. Even when I have a huge hoodie on, people stop me in the street and comment on how \\&quot;ripped\\&quot; my abs are. (Secret: my abs are actually sub-par, but this spray gives me the illusion of really ripped ones!) Just the boost of confidence I need! I think that my abs are even getting a little more ripped just by using this spray. Or maybe the scent is tricking me too!</li>
    <li> I could not find this in the stores and I really love the fragrance !!!  THANKS</li>
    <li> There was a review that questioned whether the product was changed. I contacted a company consumer rep. She checked and advised me the product was never changed only the color of the sprayer. Not sure why this customer stated such without calling the company as I did. I do this when products disappear from the stores or when they seem different. The reps are always honest and helpful.</li>
    <li> Have you ever been stuck next to someone in the gym who could really use a shower?  Ever wonder what you smell like?  Enter Bod Man Really Ripped Abs Spray.  Just spritz a little under you work-out garments, and you won&#x27;t have to worry.  Bod Man Really smells great and lasts much longer than other body sprays.</li>
    <li> Just got some at Family Dollar for $1. It&#x27;s called \\&quot;Body Heat\\&quot;. A body spray. Not the stuff shown here. Smells great.</li>
    <li> GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND. I FINNALLY GOT HIM TO TRY THE BODY SPRAYS. BUT EVERY TIME WE FIND ONE BOTH LIKE THEY STOP MAKING IT. THIS IS NOT MY FAVORITE, BUT IT&#x27;S STILL OUT THERE.</li>
    <li> Specific Bod products are hard to find, however Amazon has them.  Better price then the local drug stores.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Cheap and unique fragrance that lasts all day. Most important of all is that the women love it, they think it&#x27;s some expensive cologne. I just tell them I can&#x27;t remember the name.</li>
    <li> BOD IS EXCELLENT BECAUSE ITS A VERY NICE SENT ALSO SUBTLE SO IT STILL FITS IN THE CATEGORY OF  A BODY SPRAY UNLIKE AXE.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this it was actually as a joke, so I could tell people that I have really ripped abs... but after using it for a while, I began to truly enjoy the scent!  In my opinion it is a step up from the everyday AXE body sprays, and the scent lasts quite a bit longer.  Only a spray or two of this in the morning, and you are good to go all day! Definitely worth the price you pay for it.  It might not be the best for you high class date nights, but as an everyday body spray, I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband.  Large bottle and a very good price. Received quickly and in great shape.</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot.    The only strange thing was that at the base of the spray nozzle, there is a big sticker that says, \\&quot;Tester.\\&quot;    My question is: What does \\&quot;Tester\\&quot; really mean?    Other than that, I&#x27;m ok with the product.    I don&#x27;t think I would have purchased it if I knew beforehand that it had a big sticker labeled \\&quot;Tester\\&quot; on it.    It would have been more of a pain to return it.  I ordered 6 bottles.    Still ... 4 Stars which is Awesome!    Well done Amazon.Com!</li>
    <li> ARE YOU PEOPLE INSANE!? THIS S*** SMELLS LIKE BUG SPRAY AND NOW IT&#x27;S ALL OVER MY DAMN SHIRT AND IT WON&#x27;T GO AWAY! I think I need to actually take a shower after using this. Granted, I didn&#x27;t use it as much as it was sprayed on me, but you get the picture. Also, for the record \\&quot;really ripped abs\\&quot; would smell the same as \\&quot;totally normal abs\\&quot; neither of which smell like this crap. Go figure.</li>
    <li> This is a knock off of Davidoff Cool Water. Most Bod fragrances are based on something that is popular. They recreate the scent, price it for less, and sell lots of cologne. Seems to be a working formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real Cool Water is a slightly better scent to me, and it&#x27;s also longer lasting. However, at this price, you can afford to wear as much as you like, and then it lasts just fine.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff as well, Im honest when I say Its the best stuff there is IMO. I also thought that the smell had changed after they changed the look. I also called the company and complained. They said nothing had changed except the color of the bottle, and the color of the liquid. It used to come in a clear bottle, and the liquid was blue. Now its in a blue bottle and liquid is clear. Either way they were sorry I had a bad batch and sent me a new bottle for free. I think if it sits too long it loses its kick.&lt;br /&gt;I also disagree that it doesnt last long it lasts a long time. Out of all the scents I use this one gets me the most attention out of any I use, Such as axe, chrome, armani code, I am king..... I like this the best and the ladies seem to as well. Seriously for the price you cannot beat this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I dont order this online so I realize amazon wont verify my review. This is a legit review. This stuff really is great!!!!!</li>
    <li> Industrial feel and delivery system while at first seemed off putting, actually allows you to spray heartily and distribute evenly as it goes on wet.  For me, this is much more preferable than an aerosol which mainly perfumes the air and not so much the body.  Unfortunately, the scent is rather &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; in my opinion.  Not very interesting or unique but hey, it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has little to no staying power on the skin past the first hour or so but the fresh fragrance is a pleasant experience during that time and it does linger on ones clothes so beware.  Best use?  After the long hot shower that accompanies a good work out, after the pool or anytime you want to freshen up clean skin with a something other than your usual colognes.</li>
    <li> BOD spray fragrace is an excellent backup to regular bathing.  There are those days when one has to work overtime, and BOD helps to make it possible.  Consider it a &amp;#34;cup-of-coffee&amp;#34; for your body.</li>
    <li> The Bod Man Really Ripped Abs fragrance has that clean fresh \\&quot;just got out of the shower\\&quot; smell, that mimics CK1.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price if you like that smell.</li>
    <li> Great for in the Summer, when sweating from outdoors or busy around the house, etc. I like it. My wife likes it. Done.</li>
    <li> I really like this spray.  The smell is clean and fresh, and isn&#x27;t as pungent as you might otherwise expect from a &#x27;real&#x27; cologne.  Its great to put on a spritz after a shower.  Everyone in my family likes it.</li>
    <li> Smells  great  similar to  Cool Water&lt;br /&gt;get 8 ozs  for like  7-8  bucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments  all day long that someone  likes my cologne  or what is it</li>
    <li> MAKES YOU FEEL FRESH AND SEXY</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff been using it for years and my girlfriend loves it to I think the blue one is the best one myself well you be the judge. very fast shipping will buy from again....</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t seem to keep her hands off me when I put this on, and for good reason. This stuff smells great!... Yea Buddy!</li>
    <li> My grandson loves this spray &amp; was very happy to receive it........His is 13 yrs. old &amp; now loves this stuff........lol.......</li>
    <li> Love it.  Only problem is that it is overpriced  in here.  Get it at k-mart,  way cheaper</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite bodyspray.  Hard to find in stores.  Smells delicious.</li>
