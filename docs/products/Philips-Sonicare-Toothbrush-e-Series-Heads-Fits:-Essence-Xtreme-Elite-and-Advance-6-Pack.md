<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The real thing is so much better than the cheap imitation.</li>
    <li> Not a huge price break, but I haven&#x27;t found them anywhere else cheaper.  Just have to face the facts that they cost what they do.  I love my Sonicare and won&#x27;t switch back to any other electric toothbrush, let alone a manual brush.  This package is retail, and after trying non-Philips brand brush heads, there is no point to saving a few dollars since the off-brands do not work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Great deal for these...</li>
    <li> I like the packaging with six.  Good deal for the price.  I will order this package again when I need them.</li>
    <li> I doubt you can beat this deal. Always use the Philips Sonicare e Series replacement heads. The knockoffs do not work!</li>
    <li> As described, work perfectly in my Sonicare. Be sure you get the right brushes for the right model you are using.&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper here than retail.</li>
    <li> Product matched discription</li>
    <li> Great deal, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> These Sonicare brush heads are expensive but they are original equipment and work great. I think the brush heads that came with our brushes initially lasted about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found disgusting was the amount of crud under the brush attachment area. I had no idea that every time I brushed my teeth, toothpaste, slobber and everything else in my mouth was seeping under the brush head fastening area and building up there like a shower drain! When I changed my brush head for the first time I found it to be quite gross and immediately wondered why Sonicare didn&#x27;t do a little preventative measure in this area to seal it better. So now that I know things are living under there I remove the head and clean that area on occasion.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised. I found the packaging scheme less than satisfactory -- &#x27;way too big and containing too much plastic. And whenever I order these things, I flinch at the cost.</li>
    <li> Works great, fits perfectly.  Good price, delivered on time.</li>
    <li> packaged well and mailed promptly.  The head works like a charm but now I need another base, it appears.</li>
    <li> Needed then for the sonicare. price is reasonable. got them when there was not sales tax at that time</li>
    <li> arrived as promised, second time have ordered as we really like these heads</li>
    <li> Great heads for the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This package is really a good deal. The head fits perfectly to my brush, I also gave it to my mom and my mother in law. And they all love it.</li>
    <li> Great company to order from.  Was delivered in a reasonable time, package was in good shape and the description of the product was clear that you knew exactly what you were ordering.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush heads are simply a convenience when ordered online. You can find these&lt;br /&gt;usually at Costco for the same price, but if you don&#x27;t have one close and you need your sonic&lt;br /&gt;heads, order here!</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, even though the replacement brushes tend to be expensive.  This toothbrush has basically saved me from gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supplier, Consumer Wholesales sent the package very quickly, and their prices cannot be beaten.</li>
    <li> For the money it was cheaper to buy this multi pack than individuals as we need the. Good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I received them quickly and in good condition.  I just don&#x27;t understand how replacement heads are not sealeled up as well as the originals.  They must be removed, drained and air dried after use.  I guess Phillips found a way to save a penny.</li>
    <li> Still expensive but better than buying a 2 or 3 pack. Works with most Sonicare models. Change your brush-heads about every 6 months</li>
    <li> Perfect match, good price.  Recommended.  Was hard to find locally but Amazon had them so that worked out very well indeed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Original replacement heads for my Essence Toothbrush. Works and cleans like a charm without making much noise</li>
    <li> So happy to find a bulk set for a reasonable price. I love my sonicare but the heads are normally so expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for years, my husband and I bought them for each other for Christmas gifts years ago!LOL</li>
    <li> This purchase was a good value. When I remembered to look for replacement head in the store I could not find them. Buying this product through Amazon was convenient, fast &amp; easy.</li>
    <li> They fit my Sonicare Elite perfectly and I feel like I got a great deal! Now I have plenty of replacement heads and don&#x27;t have to worry about buying more anytime soon.</li>
    <li> High quality, good performance and excellent price.  Have only tested the first toothbrush of 6.</li>
    <li> Great deal--fantastic price, the heads work well; clean teeth just like the original head cleaner.  Turns blue after 3 months so all of us will remember to change it then.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush!  I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it has held up well.  My teeth feel like they&#x27;ve just been cleaned by the tech at the dentist&#x27;s office.  great product</li>
    <li> The e series head replaced an \\&quot;Advanced\\&quot; series model and does a much better job on my teeth and gums.  Great product.  I wish I had discovered it sooner.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Cleans well, battery lasts a long time, I use this brush once a day and a manual in the am, so they last about 4 months for me. Love the larger pack more cost effective. I tried using off market brand heads and they did not work after a week so not worth the money</li>
    <li> This is an incredible value!!  Love this product and the wonderful, fresh, clean feeling it leaves after use.  Change the heads every three months. With this package, you are set for over a year</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare &amp; replace the head every 3 months</li>
    <li> TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT. YOUR  MOUNTH WILL LOVE YOU FOR IT, I HAVE USED THEM 10 YEARS, AND I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> The color is slightly off, but my old base holds these heads just fine! I was shooting in the dark with this purchase, and I am pleased!</li>
    <li> Great value!  I used to get them at my local cvs &amp; they were not always in stock &amp; were much more expensive.  I have found my new source!</li>
    <li> We have older model Sonicare brushes and it is impossible to find replacement heads in any stores.  These not only fit but were cheaper than anywhere else I checked.  Good price and perfect fit:)</li>
    <li> Everyone with a Sonicare flinches at the price of replacement brushes in the store. Like others, I once tried some generic replacements, which were so bad I actually took them back for a refund.  The generics might fit on the handle, but they&#x27;re not engineered the same and buzz like they&#x27;re going to shake the whole thing apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while yes, I will have a rather large package of brushes under the sink for some time to come, at less than nine bucks apiece, compared to fourteen to sixteen or more in the stores, it really does pay to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush and am glad to find this bulk packaging on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipping was fast! Everything was just as they described in the ad. I will definitely be buying more when I need them.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush.  I will never go back to a regular toothbrush.  Its even greater when you can get a 6pack for the price of 2.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheaper kick-offs and just can&#x27;t compare with the original. You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;How much would you pay for  healthy teeth? I think they are worth it.</li>
    <li> As everyone in the family has their own base unit, these replacement heads are a great value. They fit perfectly with our Sonicare Essence toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> So happy I did not choose a generic.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. More online videos as to how to best brush using this will be helpful so that one can benefit the most.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Amazon has the best price, and believe me, I&#x27;ve checked everywhere.  These work wonders for my teeth!</li>
    <li> Once you have a sonic toothbrush you will never go back, they work great, but the replacement heads are getting kind of expensive.</li>
    <li> Not original this are cheaply made knock offs from china. The thing comes apart in your mouth. Horrible</li>
    <li> Having a pack of replacement brushes around conveniently allows one to replace the head as necessary.  Many people hang onto their toothbrush long after the bristles have ended their useful life.  These replacement heads have a blue strip on them which fades with time.  When it&#x27;s gone, it&#x27;s time for a new brush head! I like this toothbrush better than the last electric one I had because it runs off of a wall plug in charger rather than double a batteries, but that is a review of the toothbrush more than of this product.</li>
    <li> Seriously, why are the replacement heads so expensive?  The toothbrush is great, and as far as I could find, this is one of the better deals for the replacement heads.  The price is borderline laughable though.</li>
    <li> Having this many on hand makes it more likely to change the head out when it begins to wear.  The price is good.</li>
    <li> Love this simple toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These are the real deal. 6 of these at CVS would have cost me around double, so this is a no brainer purchase.</li>
    <li> Everything was as advertised. It will be great to have a clean mouth with nice clean teeth to enjoy good job Philips.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Phillips sonicare replacement brushheads for my Phillips Essence toothbrush.  The shipping was extremely fast - I think I got the brushheads three days after I ordered them!  It wasn&#x27;t mentioned when buying, but you actually get brushheads that each have different color rings, which I thought was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Yep, they are brush heads that fit my Philips Sonicare handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They clean my teeth properly I just wish they lasted longer due to the price.</li>
    <li> Outstanding  &amp;  perfectly satisfied.  I thought I&#x27;d have to buy a  brand new  toothbrush  $110.  or  more  ,  but  the replacements  did the  trick!  5 Stars</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what we were looking for.  Fits our e-series toothbrushes.  Good price. Would recommend to others and would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> These are good replacement heads at a great price. They fit the older Sonicare models perfectly. I would order these again.</li>
    <li> These were good replacement heads, and the two colors of the band between the head and the handle allows for two of us to use the same handle by just switching heads.  That&#x27;s convenient, but these make more noise than the original equipment head for this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;the price is  good and they work great&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend them to other consumers.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy them again</li>
    <li> My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just come back from a dental cleaning. They fit my toothbrush and came in a sealed package.</li>
    <li> I cannot say much about this product since I have not used it as suggested.  I hope that it helps other people that do use it as suggested.  Amazon is the BEST BUY you can find with a fantastic return policy. It is my opinion that the Best Buy Store has a terrible return policy and may soon be going out of business.  They want your Photo ID when you return any item.  If you are returning an item purchased on your Credit/Debit card and the return is being applied to your Credit/Debit card you should not have to show any ID.  This is an invasion of privacy.  They are collecting information from your photo ID that is beneficial too their agenda.  This information could be sold, bartered, traded or given to any organization.  It is also my opinion that the so-called Best Buy Store will go out of business within 3-5 years.  Good luck and Thank You Amazon for letting me post this review.</li>
    <li> These were purchased to replace brush heads.</li>
    <li> They are a good buy for the price and do a good job of brushing teeth, just like the more expensive ones bought in the store.</li>
    <li> But I will say, I&#x27;m not certain. I have used non-Phillips brush heads before with the exact same results I&#x27;m seeing in my teeth now. My hygienist says my teeth are filthy. I&#x27;m a person who never has tartar buildup on my teeth (unless I use a non-Phillips brush-head). I wanted to wait some time and use the product (2 so far) for a long time before reviewing, because I was skeptical. The product&#x27;s packaging does not look like its counterpart on costco. I&#x27;m going to purchase there and see if my teeth improve, which will confirm my suspicion. If they don&#x27;t improve, I will come back here and change my review.</li>
    <li> this is a great price for these replacement heads for our Sonicare toothbrush.  I just don&#x27;t like the toothbush itself.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had bought a different brand, but now that we have it, the replacement heads are an excellent bargain through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price, plan to get long use from these</li>
    <li> Great heads,  specially nice when they are new, they scrub your teeth just the right way. a good buy for all and each came to $10 a piece!</li>
    <li> The packaging is a bit ridiculous. Came in a huge blisterpack with a big cardboard header that was as big as the actual contents. Check the user submitted images for what Im talking about.  Its a minor gripe unrelated to the product itself, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are as to be expected. Authentic Sonicare brushes like the ones that came with your electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I was at Bed Bath and Beyond and saw that one of these cost 15-30 bucks. Very grateful for this amazon option of buying bulk like for cheap.</li>
    <li> These are top quality, manufacturer brush heads and they are priced equivalently to BJ&#x27;s and Costco.  They are expensive, but they do last.</li>
    <li> Amazing value. Quick Shipping. Perfect fit for each and every single member of our family. Anyone to get this on a quarterly auto-ship? Brilliant!</li>
    <li> Invigorating, cleansing, gum stimulating...I can&#x27;t say enough about this toothbrush.  Can never return to a manual toothbrush! I&#x27;ve bought one for everyone on my list!</li>
    <li> Another great product that has a limitation. The toothbrush is wonderful for cleaning your teeth. It feels like you just got out of the hygienist&#x27;s chair and your pocketbook also feels like it. This is one of the best prices for the replacement brushes but replacing them sure costs a lot more than regular toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> works well - tried an off brand won&#x27;t do that again.  Will stick to sonicare!  Quiter and more power than the off brand</li>
    <li> Everything was flawless with the purchase. Brushes work great.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about sonicare.  The best toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Love the multipack! Much cheaper than buying 1 or 2 at a time... Will buy again soon...</li>
    <li> My boys can&#x27;t live without these!</li>
    <li> I love how well these brushes clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> The 5 stars is for the sonicare toothbrush, really great toothbrush both in practice and for durability. Costco has a better price on this though, so I would purchase from them in the future.</li>
    <li> Good fit for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Truly a GREAT buy.  Compare to prices at Sam&#x27;s or other retail places, this is a much better price.  You get 6 brushes for the price of 3 elsewhere.  I will buy these again when I&#x27;ve used them up.</li>
    <li> Well, they ARE the real ones.  And they fit onto the motorized body perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right, and I have to add some more words to finish this recommendation.</li>
    <li> It is certainly nice to have a place to order replacement heads for my toothbrush and have them arrive at my door.</li>
    <li> I had previously tried a generic brand replacement head, and it was very noisy and did not seem to work as well.  It was especially noticeable once I went back to the Phillips brand heads.  The bulk packaging provides a great value, considering the higher cost of the Phillips brand replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these over generic brands when it comes time to replace the toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> It seems to be the same brush heads one can find in any store, but these were just a better value.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are great because the Philips Sonicare Toothbrush is the best thing since a bunch o&#x27; candy.  Really - I DO love this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great and I love the way my teeth feel after cleaning.  Good price too.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this multi-pak of Sonicare E-series toothbrush heads because Costco ran out (or stopped carrying them).  These fit perfectly and have lasted longer (per toothbrush head) then the original ones that came with the toothbrush.  This pack will last me a long, long time.</li>
    <li> been using the sonicare toothbrush for years. Will not use another brand. So happy to find this seller with a great deal on replacement heads. shipping was super quick and packaging was top notch. Super satisfied with this purchase. if you need replacement heads this is a great deal</li>
    <li> Since this product is a refill head produced by the manufacturer of the toothbrush itself, my expectation was that the refill would be perfect. ... It was. ... and the price was quite right!</li>
    <li> We have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for several years.  This pack of six heads is the most reasonable price that we have been able to find.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Exactly the same brush as available everywhere else at a significant savings.</li>
    <li> purchased the generic replacements... not very good... don&#x27;t waste your money.  These are the real deal and work much better.</li>
    <li> Bought the Essence from Costco but they didn&#x27;t sell the replacement brushes. This one fits and is a pretty good price for 6 brushes. Since one lasts 3 months, this should last for a year and a half.</li>
    <li> Exactly when I needed.  Fits on my toothbrush just fine.  I just hope they continue making a set this large.</li>
    <li> Good Price for 6 heads. I tried cheaper replacement heads and you cannot beat the real deal.</li>
    <li> A very good value, promptly delivered and performed as expected.  I would certainly purchase this product again.  Not only is the price right, the quality of the brushes is great.  I did compare this product with lower priced knockoff versions marketed by Wal Mart and suggest you do not buy the Wal Mart brush.</li>
    <li> This was a second time order of these for me and they arrived in no time and I&#x27;m already using one of them.</li>
    <li> They work like they are suppose to, and they fit my e Series just fine.  No problems so far.</li>
    <li> My Mother uses these to brush her teeth with as the dentist recommended them becasue they aren&#x27;t really harsh on her enamel.</li>
    <li> Never have changed my brushes soon as should have because pain going to store to find and very expensive in a one or two pack.  I now have these saved for quick and easy reorder and replacing three months as suggested.</li>
    <li> These fits to my brush. Would it to be cheaper. Maybe a better design would have made it last cleaner ...</li>
    <li> Great price for six heads.  Better to buy in bulk for an item that must be replaced periodically.  Fits my Sonicare e Series toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are very good and a great price point. Will continue ordering in the future. Hope Amazon will always carry these.</li>
    <li> Needed replacement brushes - these came in less than $10 each, as compared to almost $14 each at the local big-box stores.  Genuine Sonicare.</li>
    <li> fits both of my sonicare handles perfectly.</li>
    <li> I was shocked to see that just two of these brushes cost $30 at the store.  This is such a good deal and the brushes work awesome.</li>
    <li> These work great and come in a big enough package to last awhile.</li>
    <li> You can not beat their price and the brushes are excellent.</li>
    <li> The replacements were shipped very quickly and were just what I was looking for, great Xmas stocking stuffers.  I will be looking to order again next year.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product</li>
    <li> This is the best price for these replacement heads.  This is like buying two brushes and getting four free.  Definitely a great way to buy new brushes.</li>
    <li> I love my electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  We have used Sonicare products for 20+ years and they are great.</li>
    <li> Nice not having to borrow someone&#x27;s CostCo card just to buy more than three replacement heads (when you&#x27;re in a two-person household, the three-packs don&#x27;t divide evenly).</li>
    <li> These heads seem to work great in our Sonicare Toothbrush e Series.  A much better deal than buying them individually!!</li>
    <li> Same quality as store bought ones. Works perfect with my Sonic Toothbrush.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly and for a good value.</li>
    <li> on time, accurate. price was right !</li>
    <li> Love Sonicare toothbrushs. My dentist recommends it and I find it easy to use. Does a great job according to my hygienist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve said it before: there&#x27;s nothing like the Sonicare line off toothbrushes, and I went so far as to subscribe for two replacement brushes every 6 months. But the initial price for the subscription was $21 for two brushes. Then, California added the tax, so it was basically $11 per brush. Last week, the price jumped to $33 for two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found these which, even with tax, are back to $11 per brush. I consider that to be expensive since the most I get out of a brush is 4-5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my premise: the Sonicare can&#x27;t be beat. So, if the brush takes care of your teeth and gums, I can say that $11 is expensive, but well worth it considering the price of (California) dentists (who even have a lobby in Sacramento)!</li>
    <li> ....sometimes you want things made by the original manufacturer because they just fit..or fit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These fit our Sonicare e series base perfectly: meets all expectations for the replenishing the consumable part of this dental care device.</li>
    <li> This was the best value I could find for replacement heads.  They work the same as my original brush, which came with the handle, and they arrived on time.</li>
    <li> These are good value for the money and allows you to replace worn heads very economically. Sonic Care works well for our family.</li>
    <li> Product is great, but with Prime shipping I was guaranteed two day shipping. It was delayed because it went through Fedex to USPS.</li>
    <li> Good quality ultrasonic toothbrush heads. Fair price.</li>
    <li> I agree with a lot of the other reviews on this product. While the knock-offs are indeed cheaper, they are loud. It could also be my imagination, but I don&#x27;t feel like they clean my teeth as well. In this case I would say the brand-name is a better use of your money.</li>
    <li> I usually buy the cheaper generic replacement heads, because they&#x27;re cheaper. But I noticed the toothbrush didn&#x27;t work as well. I bought these and they work great.</li>
    <li> I bought a box of 4 of these replacement brush heads at my local Sam&#x27;s Club for 38.88 before taxes. That works out to be about a dollar cheaper per head than here on Amazon! I only gave three stars because usually Amazon is the cheapest but not in this case. These are nice replacement heads. They are just like the one that originally came with my Sonicare, maybe a little softer which is nice. I just wish they weren&#x27;t almost ten dollars each!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Had to go to a newer type Sonicare as I can&#x27;t buy replacements for my old Sonicare which is still in good working conditiion.</li>
    <li> no problems, completely satisfactory</li>
    <li> Six in a package results in significant savings.  It&#x27;s important to replace your electric toothbrush heads not only to avoid poor cleaning due to worn-down bristles, but to avoid nasty organic build-up in the brush head and inside the brush head units.  If you normally delay changing your brush heads, unscrew the top and have a closer look.  You&#x27;ll be unpleasantly surprised at the build-up after 3-4 months.  (This refers to the Essence Model).</li>
    <li> I agree that going with the brand name is a better choice in this case. These replacement brushes hold up well and fit the specified models of the Sonicare electric brush perfectly. They last more than the recommended replacement period (3 - 6 months - consult your dentist). I too started using the Sonicare on recommendation of my dental hygienist and I too have never gone back to manual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend checking local pricing (use your Amazon iPhone/Android app to compare in-store with Amazon pricing). Unlike some of the other reviewers&#x27; experience, I was able to find the best price for this replacement brush set at a Los Angeles Costco, beating the best Amazon seller price by $11 for the set. It pays to shop and compare, so I purchased this replacement set at Costco rather than Amazon this time.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product! I will continue to make all my purchases of Sonicare products from this site.</li>
    <li> My husband and I started using the Sonicare Toothbrushes in June 2012. After the very first time we were shocked at how clean our teeth and invigorated our gums felt. I recently went to my dentist, no cavities. These are way better than the manual toothbrushes and buying these replacement heads worked out far cheaper than just getting one everytime you needed a replacement. Buying 1 at a time, you end up paying almost double compared to the Unit cost in this 6 pack. Also, very happy with this supplier. They delivered in 3 days.</li>
    <li> These new toothbrush heads only lasts 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I think its quality has diminished over the years so that Philips can sell more brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;Also the water that sweeps into the handle causes mold to build up and stink.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are outrageously priced in my opinion.  However, Amazon does offer the least expensive outrageous price that I was able to find anywhere.  The toothbrush itself is outstanding and I recommend it without reservation with the only caveat being that the replacement heads are too expensive.  But, oral hygiene is critical and I believe the cost is justified in the long term.  So, can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price and if you can than post a review and tell me where you got-em.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the money arrived earlier than I though it would.I save a lot of money, if I had purchased this at the store it would have more than doubled the price</li>
    <li> I ordered this after buying a store brand that was supposed to be an exact fit of course.  It wasn&#x27;t and I returned it, looked on Amazon and found this 6 pack of name brand for basically the same price as the store brand and they actually fit and work correctly.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> These work great. I just wish there was a more cost effective way to buy them without buying so many at one time since there is only one person in this house that uses them. I do wish they had a better seal to keep saliva/toothpaste from dripping in to the handle.</li>
    <li> Work really well.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My parents have sworn by Sonicare for years, but I never paid them much attention. It seemed ridiculous to me to pay that much for a toothbrush. But, after a trip to the dentist last year and a warning about my gums I decided to give it a try. At my next appointment my gum problems had been rectified with the only difference being my use of the Sonicare toothbrush. An expensive toothbrush is still a lot cheaper than any dental work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these replacement heads so I&#x27;d have a stockpile and because they are much cheaper than buying in the store or in smaller packs. I&#x27;m not sure how long they are supposed to last, but I get about 4 months out of one before the bristles get messed up and the inside mechanism is gross.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Need I say more.</li>
    <li> Read they were knock off generics, but the ones I got are Phillips and appear to be genuine.</li>
    <li> This is a must have toothbrush!! It gives your mouth a great cleaning that I feel any other toothbrush simply cannot offer.</li>
    <li> Perfect, Just as described and much less expensive than others! Fits the unit perfectly and what a difference from the old on!</li>
    <li> fits my brush handle just fine.  Buying in bulk saves a bit of money, even though it feels like a lot up front</li>
    <li> Best value I was able to find anywhere to date in shopping for replacement heads for my Sonicare Elite Toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it a good deal.  One should know that it does not have the internal timer older models had.  (4 periods of 30 seconds each)</li>
    <li> Saved $30 by purchasing here. Typically these cost about $15 a head, so there&#x27;s 6 here for about $10 each. Great deal! I tried to save money by buying the target brand once, they broke within 2-3 weeks. I was pissed. After examination, it was clear that the target brand was made physically different. The original design is evident in this product. These are definitely originals- not a knock off like target. I waited months to use these before I wrote my review.</li>
    <li> I love my sonicare and these heads came as ordered on time.  The price was right.  They are original sonicare product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Very pleased with the service. Received order ahead of time. I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about 20 years now, keeping my teeth and gums healthy throughout that interval and am glad that dentists still consider it the number one recommended brand up to this time.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works well, the price of these seems high, but this was the best I found..  Would likely order again.  I liked the easy open feature.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cheaper (even when not on sale) at your local buying club (CostCo).</li>
    <li> Works like they&#x27;re suppose.</li>
    <li> These work perfectly with my Sonicare toothbrush and came at an excellent price. The generic Sonicare heads from Wal-Mart (Equate brand) are very low quality, make a racket while the toothbrush is on and don&#x27;t work as well. These brush heads are noticeably better than the generics. Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> When my first Sonic Care of 15 years stopped working, I just had to find another.  The e-series Sonic Care is wonderful, it&#x27;s small head gets into those tight back teeth that are often difficult with other brushes.  I truly Love my Sonic Care and hope that this one lasts as long as my last.</li>
    <li> These things are expensive - this is the best way to buy them.  The order came quickly and I recommend changing them every three months.  They are normally almost twice as expensive.</li>
    <li> Initially, I thought this was a great deal for the price, but then I found a set of 4 at my local warehouse store, and they were cheaper, even after taxes.  It is convenient to purchase these online and get free shipping with my Prime membership though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads fit my needs perfectly.  They&#x27;ll last a whole year, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Fit the tooth brush as promised. Convenient packaging for the 2 tooth brushes we now own. Correct size for the brush</li>
    <li> Best price I have found. Haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I bought it. Dentist says my teeth have never looked cleaner.</li>
    <li> For those that have bought the Sonicare toothbrushes in the past, you know the biggest issue is always the replacement heads. This was a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> This was the best price I could find for the Sonicare heads.  The wife and I love our Sonicare toothbrush which is now several years old.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Stocked up for a bit for a good price and so convenient.</li>
    <li> They are original manufacture so nothing to complain about and the saving for the bulk purchase seems well worth it.</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush heads, not much to say. No problems with the packaging, and no issues to report. Three more words.</li>
    <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen for these e Series brush heads.  They&#x27;re the real deal, and they hold up to heavy use.</li>
    <li> Trust me- buy your toothbrush heads in bulk on the internet. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Great find and great price.  Looked allover the internet and this was the best priced item for the amount of heads you got.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads for one of the best electric toothbrushes that I have owned.  Model currently going on 4 years old.  Replace the head every 6 weeks or so</li>
    <li> These are just replacements, really this review is for the whole toothbrush itself, which I love. My teeth have never felt so clean! Great that you can buy the replacements in bulk.</li>
    <li> Had it for three months . Loving it.  Why did I just now discover this?  Easy to maneuver the head.</li>
    <li> Glad to have found here. Reasonably priced from the vendor I ordered from. Color coded bands and brushes with color indicator (that fades out the green color - indicating time to change brush). Prior to these, I tried buying a &#x27;generic&#x27; (turned out to be made in China) brand and the bristles had a &#x27;industrial cleaner&#x27; type of taste and were an odd texture that quite frankly, I didn&#x27;t feel were safe to put in my mouth. Stick with the actual Philips Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
    <li> they fit the eseries and they&#x27;re priced great!  the work as advertised.  your teeth will be clean so what more do you need?</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I wanted in a timely fashion and the price I expected. This particular electric toothbrush replacement seems to no longer be available in stores, so this was perfect.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare Toothbrush along with my dental floss and Stimudents.  Your teeth are squeaky clean.  It cleans better than a manual brush.</li>
    <li> A good value. Most cost $12.00 and up apiece. Here it comes out to $8 and some change.Will last a year and a half.</li>
    <li> Perfect price, they work great!</li>
    <li> An excellent product.</li>
    <li> Good fit and works well</li>
    <li> Best price for six. I have not been able to find a package larger than four any where else. Thanks</li>
    <li> Original Sonicare, not a knock off at a fantastic price.  A little pricy to put out so much at once, but I won&#x27;t have to buy again for another half a year.</li>
    <li> For my electronic brush, fits and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> They work great, and are cheaper purchasing this way, rather than one at a time at the store.  I will be purchasing them again in the future.</li>
    <li> This package is a great deal for the money!  Got these when I ordered the Sonic brush and added the seals as well.  Won&#x27;t have to order later when my brush wears down--it&#x27;s great to have product back-up!</li>
    <li> I bought some sonicare toothbrush replacements at costco and they were the wrong ones and didn&#x27;t have the one we need.  So found them on Amazon and at a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always bought these in multi packs because it saves money.  Only recently, I have found them cheaper at Costco (49.99).</li>
    <li> This is the best electronic tooth brush out there IMO.  Have been using this for over five years.  DO NOT try the Target knockoffs to try and save money.  They are WORTHLESS compared to the real heads.  Most of Target&#x27;s own brand stuff is great but these don&#x27;t work and I returned them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good price and free shipping on these makes it a no brainer.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush system.  It&#x27;s too bad they time markers were eliminated from this model.  That is a real asset.  hjg</li>
    <li> I love my Philips Sonicare and think it provides the best cleaning experience. The price for the package cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Although expensive, it is worth replacing the brush heads as I have found this product very helpful in keeping my teeth and gums in good shape. I have not had any dental work since I have started using the sonicare brush.</li>
    <li> they are what you expect.  you do not lose quality because of the cost.  i will order these here from now on.</li>
    <li> The convenience of having so many purchased is wonderful as they can be very hard to find even in a box store where the price might be comparable.</li>
    <li> Better price than even Walmart - I usually pay about 12.00 each and this came out around 11.00.  Will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> after reading reviews i decided i should try name brand again, have been buying generic.  these definitely are way better.  really do clean better and are quieter than generic.  price not too bad either.  will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dental hygenist.  It is the first electric brush that I have used and I am completely satisfied with the results.  I must admit that it took some time getting used to the vigorous action but now I wouldn&#x27;t go back to a regular brush.</li>
    <li> A lot more reasonable than the stores...and then there is no excuse to not replace the toothbrush.  Only thing I wish for are replacements that are kids size so I could have to do alterate with.</li>
    <li> Great! The products was the best price I could find! Will order again when I need to replace brush heads! They fit perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this.  I have yours is product for many years and it works fantastic just getting new supplies for it</li>
    <li> Although these brushheads screw into the handle, they are NOT the same as the original Philips heads. The magnets hit the bottom of the handle and scrape and VIBRATE terribly. They destroyed my wife&#x27;s unit and we had to get a new one. No wonder they were cheaper than the real Philips heads!</li>
    <li> These are great brush heads and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I used these as stocking stuffers and were a great hit. I&#x27;ve bought drugstore brand replacement brush heads before, and although they are adequate, they are not the same as name brand! Great product and saved me $$$$$$$.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads are just fine, they are exactly like I have bought at Target, just at a better price. However, I can&#x27;t wait to get rid of the toothbrush model that goes with these because it collects water inside and gets moldy and gunked up. I would not recommend this tooth brush model at all but, the replacement heads are fine if you already have it and need replacements.</li>
    <li> The best way to stay stocked up for toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> These are perfectly adaptable to my chargeable toothbrush.  Every 3 months, I just screw a new one on and I&#x27;m good to go.  Product came as described, fast and easy.</li>
    <li> We have five sonicare users in the household and this was a nice price to get everyone a replacement head.</li>
    <li> Package arrived as expected.  No problems!</li>
    <li> Great deal on these toothbrush heads, fit perfectly on my eseries brush, no vibration noise like on the knock of brands.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with the knock-offs, stick with the original. As a 6-pack, a great price!</li>
    <li> I have not had any cavities since using this.  Buying a package of 6 heads is cheaper than buying 2or 3 at a time.</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare Toothbrushes for 16 years and I am sure that I&#x27;ve saved many dentist bills because of it.&lt;br /&gt;However, purchasers of new brush heads should be aware that although these brush heads \\&quot;fit\\&quot; the older recharging stands,&lt;br /&gt;there are at least two drawbacks.  One, minor, is that the new white brush head will not match the white color of the&lt;br /&gt;older stand (they are different colors of white).  The major problem, however, is that the gunk that accumulates&lt;br /&gt;inside the brush head and inside the top of the base is awful, and difficult to clean, no matter how clean you&lt;br /&gt;keep the outside of the brush and stand.  (This was true of the older \\&quot;matching\\&quot; brush and stand, but it&#x27;s worse&lt;br /&gt;now, because the replacement brush head is smaller in diameter, and the brush tends to drip down the outside&lt;br /&gt;handle and into the cracks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, you need to clean the inside of these parts very, very often, or you will find unbelievable green/&lt;br /&gt;brown/black stuff growing!  You will wonder why you haven&#x27;t expired from the bacteria already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that (and it&#x27;s a big \\&quot;other\\&quot;), the toothbrush did and does a great job, and is much less jarring in&lt;br /&gt;its vibrations that the cheapo single vibrating toothbrushes you can find hanging next to the dental floss in your&lt;br /&gt;neighborhood big box store.</li>
    <li> They fit, they work &amp; a lot better deal then buying them one at a time at the corner store.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0085RZLQS Philips Sonicare HX7023/30 Eseries Standard Replacement Brush Heads, 3 Pack, Frustration Free Packaging]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased my first Sonicare toothbrush over thirteen years ago, works as well today as the day I purchased.  My&lt;br /&gt;son and daughter purchased the E series Standard replacement brush heads as a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My dentist has always recommended Sonicare.  This product has saved money and trips to the dentist.</li>
    <li> These are the replacement brushes for the Sonex electric toothbrush.  This screws on and off easily and I replace it about once a month.  Everyone whose done the research knows Sonex is the toothbrush system of choice by most dentists.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are a very good deal. There are enough in the 6 pack to last over a year because one toothbrush lasts at least 3 mos.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush head does not fit well enough to keep the water and toothpaste from seeping into the 2 spaces: at the top (where the brush and hood meet) and at the bottom (where the hood screws into the battery handle). The result is that in a short time, a foul smell develops,  from the seepage, letting you know that you need to take the replacement brush apart and give it periodic and thorough cleanings each month.</li>
    <li> The e Series toothbrush head fits my very old Sonicare well.&lt;br /&gt;And my teeth, breath and gums appreciate the cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to have a good supply of new brushes; visitors get their own toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Still using them.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothbrush for the past several years and have had good dental check ups.  The toothbrush heads are easy to change and keep clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for quite some time now and for the most part my experience with them has been positive.  At first, it was a bit difficult to get used to using an electric toothbrush but once I saw the results, I would never go back.  Even my dentist has commented during my bi-annual cleaning about how good my teeth look and how little plaque buildup there is.  These toothbrushes make my dentist and the dental hygenists&#x27; jobs much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that here on Amazon, you typically are getting the best price for these toothbrushes and combined with either super-saver shipping or prime you&#x27;re getting them at a much cheaper price than the big box stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value is also increased when you buy the bigger packs (I typically buy the 6 pack for my wife and I).  The brushes typically last you about 3-5 months depending on your brushing style and frequency (remember twice a day!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  My dentist comments on how clean my teeth are&lt;br /&gt;2.  My teeth actually feel cleaner than a normal toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;3.  Using the Sonicare forces you to brush for the recommended amount of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  They are a bit pricey&lt;br /&gt;2.  They seem to not last that long (but no different than a normal toothbrush, just more expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switch to a Sonicare today, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every generic out there, and none of them compare to Philips brand replacement heads. They&#x27;re the best out there, and worth the extra few dollars.</li>
    <li> Fits the toothbrush per specifications (e series).  Happy with the purchase and for the bulk pack of 6, cheaper than when I combined against our local SAMS Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still debating how much I really love these toothbrushes.  Battery needs to be charged often and while I feel like they do really work, I only feel that way for a couple of weeks when the brush heads are new.  You really do need to change the brush heads often otherwise they get dull and don&#x27;t feel like they are very effective.</li>
    <li> I have never found these heads for any smaller price than what I paid for this package of 6.  At Costco they are at least $5-7 each more per head.  Yahoo!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> we bought the extra amount of heads when we purchased the brushes so that we would make sure we had some for when we needed to change heads.  Shipping was great!</li>
    <li> Why do these toothbrush heads have to be so expensive? I think it&#x27;s unnecessary to have the head be such a big part. It seems the head could be built into the base and have just the brush be replaceable.</li>
    <li> Costco used to carry them but they are always out of stock.  As my wife and I have Sonicare handles this is the only way to get refills where we live.</li>
    <li> I like my sonicare toothbrush and need replacement brushes. I wish the brushes would last longer. They&#x27;re supposed to last 3 months but I find that I need to replace after a month and a half.</li>
    <li> Quick ship.  Exactly what I wanted.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I tried a brush head wannabe. There is no comparison. The Sonicare head woks perfectly with the handle; the substitutes do not. The answer is to use the Sonicare head the brush was designed for. In my experience, other brands are inferior. Furthermore, this is a real bargain. You can expect to pay $20 to $25 for each these heads elsewhere. So you get six for the price of two.  The handle just keeps on going, and these heads make it operate as if it were new.</li>
    <li> very quick - glad to get them.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare (and so does my dentist!), but the brush heads are very expensive.  Buying them in a multi-pack helps to keep the cost down.  This supply should last me a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When buying new toothbrush heads BE SURE to pick the one that is compatible with your Sonicare model otherwise the heads may not fit and then you&#x27;l be disappointed!  So do your homework first before ordering.</li>
    <li> These heads work great, but they really bend you over on the price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;mon guys!  You should give the customer a break if they buy in bulk!</li>
    <li> Who in the world designs an electric toothbrush that requires $10 dollar replacement heads. Extremely inefficient design. I feel certain a better solution could have been arrived at.</li>
    <li> I purchased the eSeries Heads on Amazon but received a set for a different Sonicare series.  I contacted the seller, HBKDirect about the mistake, and they promptly sent out the correct eSeries heads.  Also, when I requested refund of the shipping I paid to return the incorrect item, they promptly issued a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Phillips Sonicare eSeries for many years and purchase replacement heads regularly.  The only complaint I have regarding the actual product is as described by another user: a design flaw that allows water to collect at the seam (where the head is attached to the toothbrush unit) and around the neck area (where the colored rings are).  This requires cleaning attention and cleaning to avoid mildew.  Other than that, I like my brush and will continue to use Sonicare products.</li>
    <li> Many brush heads for reasonable money. Will not have to buy them for awhile. Wish Sonic Care made a super duty brush head for braces and retainer wearers.</li>
    <li> Purchased these because they were a lot cheaper on Amazon works and fit perfectly</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a multi-pack ! These will last me for over a year and are highly recommended by my dentist</li>
    <li> This is an awesome price (better then Costco) for these excellent name-brand Sonicare replacement heads. The Sonicare helped my husband keep his teeth in excellent shape while wearing braces. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It is what is says and is good value compared to buying two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy out of original packaging ... You are probably paying too much for cheap counterfeit replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying tip: Be patient. The lowest Amazon price for this product varies as much as $5-10 over time.</li>
    <li> Normally these are super expensive for just one so it&#x27;s nice to be able to buy this pack at a good value.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the fact that I paid $63.00 for the product and in just a couple of days it was $49.95.  I will be going to E Bay as my first place to shop in the future.  I have had a good experience with Amazon up to this poiont, purchased many items, buit I will not be burned again if I can help it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aubrey House</li>
    <li> Good and prompt service, thanks</li>
    <li> The product is great and the price is right. I will purchase this again without hesitation. Thank you for reading</li>
    <li> arrived and works with my toothbrush as expected. I wish the colors were more distinct from each other for those who share a base</li>
    <li> I bought this for the whole family, and for this price, it&#x27;s worth it. They came almost as shown and sealed, of course, the only difference is that it does come with the sonicare packaging, it was just cut out in a square as though the seller has an uncut unit of these and cuts what they sell perhaps, or maybe for shipping purposes, I don&#x27;t know. Either way, they were sealed and unbroken. I used them and yes, they feel (and sound) like they are supposed to. I did buy the off brand ones at Walmart because these are very expensive there but it sounds like there is a chainsaw inside my head. The deal I got on this package ultimately was the same price I would pay for the cheap ones, so yes, of course I want these and would recommend these to anyone who is in need. Hope that helps</li>
    <li> The product is good but just an fyi that this is not for the Elite ProResults - just any FYI as they have so many different types out there it can get confusing.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like to do these reviews, because they make you have a certain number of words.  Mostly I buy things that are pretty straight forward. How excited am I supposed to be about toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait for my replacement heads to finally arrive. Got to love the fresh feeling and with nice price I got few more for future.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush heads I received were not the same as pictured.  I received the newer TB heads with the GREEN outer-bristles and the newer bristles are not as strong as the original TB heads with the white bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep searching for someone that still has the old ones, but would appreciate if sellers would manage a buyer&#x27;s expectations by posting accurate product images.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the real deal, they work.</li>
    <li> Best price I got for this product.</li>
    <li> Good quality. But they are pricey to buy.</li>
    <li> I love the no hassle packaging.  The heads fit well and perform as expected.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this bundled pack because we have a household of three that use the sonicare. The heads fit perfectly and there are two of each color so we will not mix up our toothbrushes love that.</li>
    <li> Work great..don&#x27;t get the generic heads is my advice..</li>
    <li> Good deal and good service.</li>
    <li> Great price. Would buy again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use the e Series Sonicare and decided to get this package because it would last the two of us a full year.  Like others we have tried the knock off replacement heads from other stores and they do not work like the official Sonicare replacement heads.  This is a great product and the price is unbeatable.  It is much better to buy these in bulk rather than individual packages because of the price difference.</li>
    <li> great  price at 10 dollars  a head you cant beat the price and quality of sonicare tooth brush heads they do the job so you dont have to !!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I&#x27;ve seen for these brush heads, and they arrived in one day (Prime two-day shipping selected)! They fit my Sonicare Essence toothbrush as expected. Sixty-one dollars seems like a lot of money, but if you replace the heads every three months as recommended, it works out to less than $0.80/week, which is definitely worth it. Don&#x27;t bother buying generic products (looking at you, red big box store) - they are incredibly loud and don&#x27;t clean as well. I&#x27;ll be buying this again in 18 months!</li>
    <li> The cost is still better than what I would pay at the drug store with a $5 off coupon. I&#x27;m trying to make them go 6 months instead of 3.</li>
    <li> We wouldn&#x27;t use another product.  These are terrific; as advertised.</li>
    <li> Economical way to replace your toothbrush head.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this item, and lots of them complained that it didn&#x27;t fit the base, but this is the same brush head that came with my base and and they fit just the way they&#x27;re supposed to, if you didn&#x27;t like the way it fit when you bought the toothbrush, then maybe you should buy a different toothbrush</li>
    <li> Delivers as promised!  Sonicare is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I have had my Sonicare toothbrush for some time and it keeps plugging along. However, the brush heads do need to be replaced, and this was a good price enabling me to do that.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are really expensive in the stores but price is much better on Amazon. Arrived in good condition, fits my toothbrush base &amp; works perfectly. Plus I like the convenience of delivery to my home.</li>
