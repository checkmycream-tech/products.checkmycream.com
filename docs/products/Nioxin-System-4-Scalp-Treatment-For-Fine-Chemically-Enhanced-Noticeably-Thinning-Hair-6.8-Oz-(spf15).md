<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received within days. The treatment is working well and I really like it.</li>
    <li> After 1 year of use, I didn&#x27;t notice a change</li>
    <li> I have used Nioxin original and for color treated hair before and this one is sudsy like soap was added to it.  Really dried out my hair. I do not know if it supposed to be this way or if the seller added soap to dilute it but I would avoid it.</li>
    <li> Great for fine or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner, so I ordered this without a reservation.  It is completely useless to me.&lt;br /&gt;If you like your hair to look and feel like you just sprayed a can of hairspray on it - then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;I only used a small amount and as soon as it dried it was awful: sticky, wet looking, stiff, completely unbrushable just like hairspray.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone liking it!  I&#x27;m wondering if the positive reviews are talking about the same product.  The only way it would work is if you have very very short hair.  Unfortunately I bought the big bottle and I&#x27;m just going to throw it out.</li>
    <li> At 64 I&#x27;m somewhat lucky that my hairline has not receded much but it is receding and my hair is brittle and breaks easily.  The Nioxin system was recommended by my partner who happens to be a hairdresser.  After a few month use, I noticed that less hair was dropping into the sink when I was styling it than before meaning it is doing a good job of adding moisture and after it dries my hair looks full and this fullness extends over my hairline completely hiding it and helping me look younger than I am.  When I tell the folks at work how old I am, they simply don&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I was buying Nioxin products at the professional supply warehouse where my partner purchases his supplies.  I was stunned when I saw Amazon selling the Nioxin line for less than the warehouse.  Even my partner is looking at buying his supplies on Amazon to save money over the supposedly wholesale price at the warehouse.</li>
    <li> Ok call me crazy but I have seen a few little hairs growing back and my hair dresser has noticed it too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years.  After I entered my 50&#x27;s and developed some health issues my hair began to thin.  I use the full line of Nioxin 4.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but it helps.</li>
    <li> I love Nioxin, but this product isn&#x27;t always 100% necessary . When I do use it I use a very small amount.</li>
    <li> I had to quit using this as it made bumps on my scalp.  It didn&#x27;t do anything that I noticed.  Would not purchase again and wondering what to with the bottle now.</li>
    <li> Actually nice to leave in thin hair to make look fuller and as a styling product for thin hair. Do sent cause new hair growth just makes hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> Does not work for me.</li>
    <li> Amazing price! , wonderful product. I find this product encourages my hair growth. I have thin fine hair, from medication, and thyroid disease. When I use this, it stops my hair from shedding as much. I also find new baby hairs growing allover after a month of use. I recommend you try it. What do you have to loose?</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 10 years and I love it!  Really works!</li>
    <li> have thin hair which makes me feel depressed.  spent too much for this and have not noticed any change in hair</li>
    <li> I use this item regularly and love the results.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and order was correct.</li>
    <li> Great product does what is claims</li>
    <li> Have been using this product since October or November and see a noticeable difference in my hair thickness. Have new hair growth.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It has helped my hair be stronger and look healthier.  I ususally buy this through my hairdresser, but Amazon has a much better price.</li>
    <li> I trust nioxin and their products.</li>
    <li> I think this makes my hair feel a little thicker when I&#x27;ve put it on but don&#x27;t know that it is actually making any long term improvements.  Seems almost like a mousse.</li>
    <li> Disappointed this is no longer made by the original manufacturer (P&amp;G); seemed to have changed ingredients; now made in Mexico.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I was getting thin on the top of head. I tried a lot of products most were greasy. The made my hair look dirty. Also stained pillow cases. This I use after a shower it stays in and my hair is coming in thicker every day. I use the shampoo, Conditioner, and this foam. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This has helped greatly. It&#x27;s embarrassing to have such thin hair, and since starting to use this product about 4 months ago, my hairdresser reports that there is new hair growth. I&#x27;ve also noticed it. I use the shampoo, conditioner and this scalp treatment. This almost instantly gave me the feeling of thicker hair. Hope it works for everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big product person and will take a few months to see it its working, so will update again later</li>
    <li> its been a while I am using it, I dont really feel any influence!</li>
    <li> Got this first as recommended by another hair care professional to my mother.  Her hair is thinning crazy due to stress and hormonal changes. This seems to have stopped the thinning.  She likes them so I reordered.  I think it has hinoki tree oil which very rare and helpful to the hair roots.</li>
    <li> Great product for thin, fine hair. Gives it volume ,however is drying if you use&lt;br /&gt;a lot.. So decide:: do you want your hair to look fuller? Not a hard decision for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for about 2 months and I love the way my hair has changed to look fuller than it ever has.  Great smelling product as well.  I also use a leave in conditioner as well because I find that if I don&#x27;t my hair looks a little dry.</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, works great!  I was told you need to buy them both, in order for them to work properly, and so far... no complaints.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly, love this product.</li>
    <li> If your hair is falling I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;It does not make his regrow but avoids more from falling and it mdkes it really look healthy</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for about 3 years and my hair does much better with Nioxin than when I use other products. I have minimal hair loss due to ongoing chemotherapy and I&#x27;ve seen improvement since using Nioxin (much less continued loss).  Also, the price I paid online was cheaper than Walmart!!</li>
    <li> Product has kept my scalp moist. Has relieved the scaling I was prone to.</li>
    <li> I am 33 and have male pattern baldness. This started to grow some wispy hairs, and since has done nothing. I have been using this for about a year now with the conditioner and leave in conditioner, every day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and now that I found it on Amazon, I am delighted as the price is great.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  It actually made my wife&#x27;s hair look a little better but we don&#x27;t feel it held up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I am going to buy it for my husband since he is out in the sun so much.  (Not for color-treated hair however!)</li>
    <li> Good price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Been using this product since September of 2013, meaning 4 months. My hair stopped falling out in December. Must be working.</li>
    <li> Great...Will buy a again...!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think I need to use the product every day...&amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;I shower every day, but don&#x27;t wash my hair every day,  because this is when I find the most hair loss, so I will start to wash my hair with the Nixon products every day...!!!</li>
    <li> First, you really need to use the system all together to make it work and yes I learned the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;Mistake#1, I only used the cleanser and conditioner (it dried the crap out of my hair which made it brittle and tons of breakage)&lt;br /&gt;I have long thin hair with the thinnest areas being the entire facial hairline. I refuse to cut it short so I decided to try Nioxin&lt;br /&gt;Now, I used hair serums and oils daily to bring my hair back to hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to the system I decided to use Hair booster and Scalp treatment (initally I thought a scam) BUT it is not!!!! I have regrowth that has taken months to get here and its not a lot but its there!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have read many complaints about it making hair stiff and yes it will like mouse but just use a little less or blow dry your hair and its smooths like nothings in it! I always use a hair serumor hydrator meant for high heat on top of my nioxin system so i dont dry out the hair!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!! Good Luck to anyone using it! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for several years and find that is does in fact help to make my hair a little more manageable and thicker.</li>
    <li> it works however you have to use it religiously</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and like it.</li>
    <li> Have used these products before and they do help stimulate hair growth and health.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;This treatment if the most important of the three, but best to use all.</li>
    <li> This product is not for me! I did love how clean my hair felt at first. After a few weeks my scalp broke out and I had an allergic reaction in other parts of my body. I don&#x27;t know which ingredient it was but it made me sick.</li>
    <li> Need to pay attention to the description more carefully. I thought these were the larger size. A little over priced for the small size. But my mistake!</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what its supposed to do &amp; at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for years, and it nice not to have to pay such high prices for the formulas involved.</li>
    <li> Nioxin products are my favorite for helping add strength,growth and body to my fine hair. I like the scalp benefits of the  Nioxin System 4 Scalp treatment, already adding noticable difference to my hair. The added bonus is the sun protection. I actually use a little as a mouse  when blow drying my hair to keep it from going limp. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment for about 5 years now and I can really see the difference when I stop using them, that&#x27;s for sure.  I haven&#x27;t tried using the scalp treatment alone, but I know that this is probably the most important step in the three-step system.  I have definitely tried the shampoo and conditioner alone, and they don&#x27;t make much of a difference without the scalp treatment.  I have baby hairs growing in all the time now and when I stop using the system, the hair just starts falling out like crazy and my hair gets so thin and unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, shipped fast, great product.</li>
    <li> The item does make my hair look fuller however, it also dries it out.  I&#x27;ve tried using less...one pump per area, but that still doesn&#x27;t seem to help the driness.</li>
    <li> I really adore the shampoo and conditioner, but the scalp treatment results are inconsistent.  Some days it makes my hair gummy and sticky.  Other days it does what I want it to do.  I never use it anymore on a day when I want my hair to look great because I never know which result I&#x27;m going to have.  At this rate, it&#x27;ll be a long time before I have to decide if I want to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I noticed some regrowth, but not much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years. It is very effective when used on thinning hair according to instructions. Makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I had tried it some time ago when I noticed my hair loosing body. It works really well on me.</li>
    <li> Started using Nioxin products when post cancer medication started rapid thinning of my hair.  After few weeks of use, loss reversed.  Product strengthens hair so it stays on you head longer, allowing new hair to grow and fill in.  Beautician who worked on my hair only two months commented that I had a lot more thickness on top in that short time.  No longer have scalp showing through on top of head.  This product combined with Nioxin shampoo System 4 unbeatable combination.</li>
    <li> This product is new for me. So far I have noticed subtle positive improvement.</li>
    <li> Love Nioxin 4 Scalp Treatment. It is part of my daily regimen, and has been for over 20 years. The Nioxin  Family of Hair Care Products are outstanding including their Shampoo,(cleanser), Conditioner(Scalp Therapy), and Hair Spray that is not sticky.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, Is wonderful product  for tinny hair. It give hair volume and hide the poor hair. I used whit the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom who has beautiful but extremely thinning hair. She was self conscious because her scalp would show through. I got her this treatment along with the shampoo and conditioner which she has been using every day since April and her hair is already fuller. She loves the mint smell of the products and is happy that she can&#x27;t see her scalp through her hair anymore.</li>
    <li> Mainly just made my hair dry and thick feeling because of product buildup. Biotin supplements have helped better.</li>
    <li> The Nioxin products have worked for me.  I can now have a short bob that requires minimal time to care for.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser could tell that my fine, thinning hair had regrowth after just a couple of weeks. If I used it daily, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have fuller hair. That said, the product makes it a little more diffcult to get a brush through my hair when blow drying, making styling take longer so I don&#x27;t use it daily. I apply the product to my scalp directly where the spots that seem thin. It works well and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product to see results.</li>
    <li> m still trail first 30 day m not sure  it will help anything but i do like the cleanser and the condistioner m noted after washed my hair less falling and will continouing to use it</li>
    <li> this works for me, and I&#x27;m always looking for reduced prices.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thinning blonde  hair and it took at least five or six weeks to be able to see any growth.  But it&#x27;s there.  I&#x27;m very happy and will continue to use the shampoo and scalp therapy.  I don&#x27;t use the conditioner and never did because all conditioner makes my hair too soft.</li>
    <li> As always, love my Nioxin.</li>
    <li> after many weeks of reading reviews on these products i finally decided to give in because my bestie&#x27;s wedding is in a few months and i am the maid of honor and i wanted my hair to be thicker and longer by wedding time. i purchased the complete nioxin system number 4 cleanser, scalp therapy, scalp treatment, and diamax spray. i have highlighted hair and have been highlighting it for 9 years, i am 25 years old now. my life long hair stylist would always comment on how healthy my hair was and would praise me for being her favorite client who would take such good care of my hair. it wasnt until i used this system together for a week straight that my highlights all of a sudden started having a lot of breakage. i panicked at the sight because ive never experienced that before. i called my stylist and told her what happened and she has me on a strict hair regimen to try to prevent anymore breakage and hairloss from happening due to the damage that nioxin did in screwing up my beautiful hair. i had used the nioxin tablets years ago before they discontinued them and they were great so i thought this system would work but instead i have suffered so much, not only with my hair but it was a large chunk of hard earned  money that i just threw away after one week of use, and the money i had to use to purchase the new s.o.s. hair care products. ...tears...</li>
    <li> I used the Nioxin System 4 Scalp Treatment after the cleanser and conditioner and my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this amazing in years. Having very fine hair, in addition to coloring it, has made my hair brittle and breakage has been a huge problem. The scalp treatment really helps my hair look and feel normal. I love it!</li>
    <li> I use it for thin hair. I takes a while though.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I visibly notice a difference, but I trust its reputation to keep my hair from thinning more than it already has.</li>
    <li> I noticed a big difference in my hair. It appears thicker and it doesn&#x27;t just lay on top of my head. It had bounce and there is slight hair growth in the temple area. Not much but it is there!  I use the entire system and do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for thinning hair and itchy scalp</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I spray the foam on my scalp where my hair has been thinning badly for years.  I can immediately feel the tingle.  I allow it to dry, then apply some argan oil leave-in conditioner.  This re-wets the Nioxin and allows it to work more.  I sometimes do this several times a day and I also brush the area 200 strokes (at least once a day) to further stimulate the scalp.  After only a couple weeks I can feel new stubble growing in and I&#x27;m thrilled.  Will it last?  Will I continue to grow more hair?  I don&#x27;t know yet, but I&#x27;m more than willing to try.</li>
    <li> I started purchasing this product about 6 months ago and use it almost every other day.  I only shampoo at most once a week (my hair does not get dirty or oily) so my usual way of application is to wet my hair at the bathroom sink, pat it with the towel and then take small amounts that I massage into the scalp across five sections down and  across my head.  I purchased it on the recommendation of my dermatologist because of thinning hair.  I started with a &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; of three items, a shampoo, conditioner and the scalp treatment, but afterwards was told by my doctor that the main item that I needed was the scalp treatment so that is what I have continued to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any noticeable improvement but my doctor has shown me short hair growth on my scalp as evidence that the product is working.  Whatever is causing my thinning hair has also stopped hair growth.,  I have not had my hair cut in over 10 years because it has not had any appreciable growth. I am assuming that this same problem may be slowing the new hair growth that my doctor has indicated.  Therefore I will continue to use the product for a while longer to see if it will help, eventually, to increase the thickness of the hair on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The one problem I have noticed with the scalp therapy is that it leaves my hair very dry.  My doctor has recommended a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; hair conditioner to alleviate this problem and that has seemed to improve the situation.</li>
    <li> It was okay compared to regular shampoo and conditioner, but there&#x27;s no comparison to xfusion. It required too many products to get the best tresults.</li>
    <li> My scalp has never felt better !</li>
    <li> Works well when used consistently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a personal witness to this product.  My mother who has been sick now has a thick head of hair.</li>
    <li> Am still waiting to see if this product does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> Same good quality as before. Fast delivery. Great price.</li>
    <li> Finally got hair regrowth.  Love it</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and needed to have it again. I have been under a great deal of stress, and my hair was falling out at an alarming rate. I also had two small bald patches. My hair has slowed down on the falling out part. The hair is growing back in the bald spots. You do have to use it religiously though, and it is not an overnight fix.</li>
    <li> I was told by my beautician to buy Nioxin Scalp Treatment 4 - so I thought I did - This product says Nioxin Scalp Treatment 4 but it is really a scalp sunscreen.  This is not what I intended to buy.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding this item in my neighborhood. I was happy to find it online and it was in a larger bottle which made me happy.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for over 3 months now.  It feels great and smells good.  I don&#x27;t know if it has actually promoted hair growth, but somehow my hair does feel slightly thicker.  I would continue to use and buy again.  The colorsafe was really good with my hair color, not washing it out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product worked as well for me as some other reviewers. Even when combined with Nioxin shampoo &amp; conditioner and Nioxin Xtrafusion Treatment over several months only minimum results, at best, were experienced.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin products for almost 3 years.  I had been ill and lost a lot of my, already very thin, hair.  Nioxin brought back the broken off hair and back to where it was before I was ill plus more.</li>
    <li> Actually to be 100% honest, I didn&#x27;t like this product. It makes my hair crispy and also greasy at the same time. I think all you need for your healthy but thinning hair is the shampoo and conditioner! You only need a small amour of those and rub them not your scalp, leave them on for about 3 to 5 minutes and voila&#x27;... shiny, happy hair!</li>
    <li> Unlike the system 3 that my wifes hairdresser initially set me up with, the System 4 scal treatment comes out as a foam. Foam it on, brush it in and style your hair.  I use this with the shampoo and conditioner stuff (I know they call it something fancy, look it up, I don&#x27;t want to think that hard right now...). I have gone from spear bald on top to okay yeah thin, but not too thin, in a little less than a year. No it is no overnight miracle cure, but it DOES help...</li>
    <li> used this for 2 years...won&#x27;t go without.  it does work.  Added Diomox but still won&#x27;t give up the scalp treatment.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any specifics but my wife loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Good deal!</li>
    <li> Looking forward to using it after I have finished my my old one. This is a new formulation so I hope it&#x27;s an improvement on the old one. If it&#x27;s Nioxin, it&#x27;s gotta be good!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use if you have fine, thin hair. It gives me body and makes my hair looks thicker. I&#x27;m not sure it gives me more hair strands, but it does greatly improve the appearance of my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for thinning hair; it reduces the loss of hair! Great product!</li>
    <li> This product works very well on fine hair.  It makes my hair look a lot thicker than it really is.  It works better than gel or styling foam if used on wet hair before drying.  I have been using this for over six months and don&#x27;t feel the need to change.  It is still doing exactly what I want - making my fine hair look and feel fuller.</li>
    <li> been using Nioxin for years, works pretty good, does not increase hair for me but seems to have helped retain what I have.</li>
    <li> I use the entire Nioxin system: Cleanser, scalp therapy, scalp treatment and follicle booster.  Next to actually having thick hair, this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, this...I still get a little itchy but this is by far the best product I have used towards relieving dryness and itch and making my hair, well, almost irresistable.a</li>
    <li> i Got this for my mom. she noticed her hair grew faster, but hard for her to tell if its getting thicker because she recently got a perm.</li>
    <li> I  like this product. My hair is pretty thin and having some sun protection is important to me. It doesn&#x27;t take much and you have a lot more volume in your hair. I found that sometimes I apply too much and all I get is one day before I need to shampoo again. The hair gets very dry and not much can be done with it if I use too much. In my case less is best. I would recommend it to anyone who has thinning hair or very fine hair. A lot of products say they will give your hair more body yet have not worked for me. Nioxin 4 Scalp Treatment delivers additional body plus some protection against the sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for well over six months and I&#x27;ve definitely found it has improved my hair.  It&#x27;s thicker and fuller.  It also really protects my scalp from the sun.</li>
    <li> My opinion is still out. I don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough as this is only my second bottle and my hair still feels the same.</li>
    <li> Does leave hair sticky as if you overused gel. Best to use at night if you plan on washing hair the next morning.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 #4 and only got one #4 and one #3.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether Nioxin System 4 actually physically thickens the hair, but it does work well as a) a styling agent and b) a sunscreen.  If you use the Nioxin Cleanser and Scalp Therapy it makes for a good final touch to make thinner hair seem thicker and more manageable.  I still have a seemingly full head of hair, but it has become very fine over the years and is completely out of control without some kind of product to tame it.  I also spend a great deal of time outside during the summer and would like to avoid the sunburn on the head experience described by so many of my friends.  The System 4 Scalp Treatment has worked well to make my hair appear more full than it actually is and I will continue to purchase the product.  I wouldn&#x27;t advise purchasing any of the Nioxin System 4 products as a &amp;#34;hair restorer&amp;#34;, however.  While they may make your hair seem thicker, they don&#x27;t actually seem to change the total numbers of hairs on your head.</li>
    <li> I love the Nioxin products. This works great with the shampoo and conditioner also. You do not need to use a lot so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several months and am realizing good results for my thinning hair.  Am also using the shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I have been using the Nioxin 3-step System for some time now.  My hair was thinning noticeably in the front and my hairdresser recommended these products.  I can see and feel a difference. The hair is not as limp and fine as it once was.  Even my hairdresser said she can see an improvement.  Sometimes I skip using the Nioxin Conditioner, and even the Shampoo (just using a volumizing shampoo that is not part of the Nioxin line).  But I never skip the Scalp Treatment after shampooing.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this product. Keeps my hair in my head. Perfect when used with nioxin shampoo and scalp therepy</li>
    <li> The Nioxin system was recommended to me by a colorist at a salon I went to who was a cancer survivor.  She raved about how well this stuff helped her hair grow back after her cancer treatments.  So what the heck, I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lost a good deal of my hair partially due to some medication that I take and I&#x27;m sure some of it is just the naturally aging process.  I had crazy thick hair all of my life so I was going through a bit of a crisis trying to figure out what to do about my hair loss.  This stuff has worked for me!  I have 1&amp;#34; hairs sticking up all over my head in only 6 weeks!  I now use no other shampoos or conditioners.  There is no medicine smell and my hair is beautiful and shiny.</li>
    <li> I like Nioxin products a lot to give more body to my hair. I have been using this for a couple months now and I think it does a pretty good job of what it claims to do - boost your hair - without making it greasy! I put it on after showering around my hairline and throughout my scalp and never noticed any residue. I apply pretty generously too. I would recommend this to anyone who wants their hair to look a little fuller and is easy on styling.</li>
    <li> I am 46 years old and starting to see a reduction in the thickness of my hair. I started using the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner which I really like.  I noticed the company also suggested using the scalp treatment so I was curious to try it.  The product is easy to use, odorless and does make my hair feel and appear thicker, although I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable change in the amount of hair i actually have.  I will continue to use it for the thickening qualities it offers and the notion that over time, it will help maintain my hair overall.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helped with my scalp, but it is not a magically hair growth solution. And to my knowledge does not prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> The entire Nioxin System is absolutely great!!!  It really works!  My hair has never been so soft and is really growing!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with your purchase.</li>
    <li> This system truly works. It thickened my hair and I couldnt ask for a better system for thinning hair! Number one!!!</li>
    <li> l have been using the Nioxin system for 7 weeks now.  And am well pleased with how it has increased the amount of hair I have now 7 weeks later.  Nothing extreme but I had thinning hair due to my age.  I can tell more hair is growing in because of the part in the middle of my head, on top of my head has narrowed, meaning more hair.  Now if I can only find a good face cr&amp;egrave;me to tighten my skin. Would recommend for someone else to use.</li>
    <li> This mousse is great for styling my hair.  It makes hair look fuller and thicker, makes it more manageable and protects from harmful enviorment.  Also it makes me feel like I have less shedding, not sure if it&#x27;s just that it binds hair together making it harder for the loose hair to fall or is it really effecting the shedding.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the shampoo and conditioner, so can&#x27;t judge it as a stand-alone but I can say, using all 3, I have definitely noticed a difference and even new growth.</li>
    <li> What was wanted for a reasonable price. Ridiculous requiring more words to write a review when a few does the job.</li>
    <li> I was initially introduced to the Nioxin shampoo by my hair stylist and she recommended that I try the whole system. My hair is naturally curly and very fine, but it&#x27;s thinning on the top and sides; I also have a bad dry patch in the back. In addition to the hair system, I&#x27;m also taking a multi-vitamin (for hair, skin &amp; nails) and stopped using the cheaper alcohol based styling products. Thus far I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the shampoo and the conditioner, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the Scalp Treatment should be used in small amounts. The first time I applied it, I got too much on my hair and while my hair felt and looked great after drying, it did make it difficult to work my hair when it was wet until I had it fully massaged into my scalp/hair roots. That first application was about 3.5 pumps of foam which turned out to be too much (my hair is shoulder length). The 2nd time I washed my hair (about 3 days later), I dispensed 2 pumps and got better results. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for over a month with great results; and just recently added the conditioner and the scalp treatment to the regime so I&#x27;m very optimistic for a positive result. While I&#x27;ve not consulted with a dermatologist, I have noticed a difference in my hair since I began using the whole system and the texture feels stronger - not as brittle. In order to make sure I&#x27;m not reversing any of the positive effects thus far, I&#x27;ve also started washing my styling tools - brush, combs, clips with the shampoo every time I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  It works and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> Been using without issues. Good price. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll let you know when I see results.</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on this one</li>
    <li> I gave this product a fair shot only because I was desperate to stop my crazy hair loss. There&#x27;s no way around it- it just makes your hair feel dirty and sticky. I tried using very little and just on the scalp but my hair still feels dry and dirty and rough. Finally gave up on it.</li>
    <li> I have used this before. It is fine. also use the booster via nioxin.booster I&#x27;m still debating on an other puchase.  Yet I found it oozing from package.I think It is old.. as even after shaking the bottle as told it runs down my neck etc.It seems to have set on your shelf too long...maybe just out of date. does not work correctly.It also is stiff to my hair. this product never did this before.&lt;br /&gt;please check your experation dates.!! claudine bigelow</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner.  Haven&#x27;t used long enough to see how it works.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - I&#x27;ve been useing it almost a year and see positive results!</li>
    <li> This foam completely dries out my hair no matter how little or much I use.  I find sticking to just the shampoo and conditioner works perfectly fine and does a fantastic job.  This foam does the exact opposite of what a scalp treatment should do. It makes my head itch, hair ruff feeling (like horse hair ).  Very similar to hair spray after you try and brush through it.  I like my hair soft and silky and that you will get after you shampoo and conditioner alone with Nioxin products.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> good hair treatment thank you</li>
    <li> as described, received quickly</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for just about two years now. It has made a huge difference in my hair along with the shampoo and conditioner. If I stop using it for a few days, I definitely notice a ditference in my hair.</li>
    <li> Beside this being a good product for thining hair, it was an excellent price as well.  I have been using Nioxin system for about 10 yrs, it has saved me from having to resort to a hair piece which I do not want to have to do..</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a year now - not as a hair loss product, but more as a styling product.  It makes my thin, fine hair full of body.  You can&#x27;t put too much on, I use three pumps on my shoulder length layered hair.  Any more than that and my hair gets hard to work with. I also take Viviscal and 5000 mg Biotin per day, I find that the supplements plus the Nioxin have stopped my hair from falling out (and I need every hair I can get!) I was losing a good amount of hair daily, now it&#x27;s down to a couple hairs when I comb out after my shower. I won&#x27;t stop using this, and it&#x27;s a good price too.</li>
    <li> Have used this before.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> My hair has not gotten thinner but does not seem much fuller. I think this does help prevent sunburn though. I was camping for a week and others had sunburn on their scalp and i did not.</li>
    <li> great price great service</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin products since 2003.  I began with System 1 and graduated to System 4 after several years of use.  It may not promote hair growth but it certainly gives an illusion of thick hair.  I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> This stuff REALLY restored my hair, it was thin, flat and falling out. Thank God it is coming back to the natural fullness!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on and off for the past 8 years, for stress-induced premature female hair loss that has been tied to hormone issues.  I would use it for several months, then stop since it didn&#x27;t seem to work to grow my hair; it just made what I had extra thick, full of body, but feeling like I had use bad 80&#x27;s hair gel or spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They reformulated it; I&#x27;ve bought it 3 times since then, using it consistently for the past several months.  Now it makes my hair thicker, denser, and full of body, but also soft.  I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as regrowing hair, it is adding to my entire regimen.  Nioxin provides an outside-in topical treatment, and I meet it more than half way with an inside-out treatment.  I got my hormones balanced so there is no more testosterone sensitivity.  My doctor also started me on a new diet and supplement regime (Biotin, Niacin, Iron).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had premature frontal hair loss that was noticeable for years.  It receded in a certain pattern.  Now, it&#x27;s awkwardly growing back in reverse so it looks like I cut bangs on the sides of my face but there&#x27;s nothing in the middle yet. There are also sprouts and baby hairs visible on the top of my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the middle is the last area where the regrowth needs to occur (and from the sprouts it will), I add Toppik [[ASIN:B003OELYFO Toppik Hair Building Fibers (.36oz) - Medium Brown]]to it, a keratin fiber hair-filler powder.  The toppik should not affect hair growth but I still wash it out at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My doc said it will take about 2 years for full regrowth (once I started the meds and supplements).  It&#x27;s been 6 months so far, and I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s about right.</li>
    <li> This is one product this i cannot live without. I used to have thinning &amp; brittle hair.started noticing around age 24 that my hair was thinning, &amp; after chemically treating my hair it felt  brittle &amp; dead. I paired this up with a high dosage of the vitamin Biotin &amp; have had wonderful results. I recommend this to anyone that has thinning hair. I use after I shower on the roots.</li>
    <li> Good deal and shipment was fast. Thank you</li>
    <li> It looks.good and i will right my view about it after 3 months</li>
    <li> Really gives my hair the oomph it needs. Great product!</li>
    <li> Definitely worthwhile!</li>
    <li> Product was fine and arrived on time but the packaging had water stains on it. Doesn&#x27;t appear to come from the bottle. Giving as a gift so it looks really bad.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using the Nioxin treatment my hair loss has slowed down quite a bit along with a healthy diet.  So easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this produc for many months because my hair was thinning so badly.  It slowed down but is still thinning.</li>
    <li> Great  products! I was seriously losing my hair at a scary rapid rate and my hair is already fine &amp; thin. I had a grandmother, an aunt &amp; a sister suffer from baldness, they had some hair but very, very little. I&#x27;m not just fighting genetics but pre menopausal  as well, with a stressful job. I&#x27;ve started their line a long with the Hair Booster (LOVE this stuff) and scalp treatment. Not only has my hair loss stopped, but growing some back! I hope it works as well for you too.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed and it made my hair very dry and stiff at scalp level.  I could hardly get a comb or brush through my hair close to scalp.  I had used a sulfate free cleanser for many months and my hair was in good condition but was beginning some hair loss due to thyroid problem and thought this system would help.  I am now using salon conditioners to reverse what this product has done.  I DO NOT recommend this product.</li>
