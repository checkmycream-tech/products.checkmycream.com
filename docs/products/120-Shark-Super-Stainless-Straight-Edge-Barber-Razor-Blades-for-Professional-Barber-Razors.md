    <li> Simple and cheap, they get the job done.  I&#x27;ve been using these in a straight edge style shavette. Be careful starting out.  It&#x27;s like shaving with a scalpel.</li>
    <li> Hello from Florida! Came promptly after ordering, and in even better condition than the box they used in the product display photo for Amazon! When I see people paying $24.95 for 4 tri and quad blades in the stores, it makes me wonder why everyone doesn&#x27;t make the switch to a straight razor. How can anyone beat a deal like that? $9 (after s&amp;h) and I have enough blades to last me for months...if not the entire year, and some. And they&#x27;re so sharp - I never have to worry about getting a dull blade, or tugging and pulling during shaving. Thanks, SHARK! Will buy again!</li>
