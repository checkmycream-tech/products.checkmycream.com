      <li>(Also, you might want to give some to others you know - if you&#x27;re that type of person who doesn&#x27;t just say \\&quot;go buy your own\\&quot;....I tend to be the type to buy them for others to try if it&#x27;s inexpensive, and many of my friends are the same way with things they find they like)</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have tried several different tongue cleaners and this one is definitely the best one.  </li>
      <li>I had my first one for years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the metal tongue scrapers, but these last me for about 2 years and they are dirt cheap.</li>
      <li>i tried everything ,including the stainless one,which is amazon no.1 seller.however</li>
      <li>The stainless steel arch one cut my tongue.  </li>
      <li>With this cleaner I still gag a bit, but it strips the gunk I&#x27;m trying to remove very well.  </li>
      <li>When we needed to buy new ones, Walmart did not sell them anymore.  </li>
      <li>I could get my hands on, this one actually does the job the first time.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, it&#x27;s nice and wide, covering a broad area at once (which is what triggered the impetus to purchase).  </li>
      <li>Simply brushing my tongue made me gag and didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>What good does it do to clean your teeth if your tongue is coated with nasty coffee film?  </li>

<li> My wife has been using this type of tongue scraper for a few years, and thought that it was a good idea to order a few spares, because they are difficult to find in the local stores.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It IS plastic and WILL brake at some point (in my case from long term use and uncareful packing when travelling)</li>

<li> big and ugly but does the  job!</li>
<li> Say bye bye to bad breath and hello to all the ladies.</li>

    <li> Love! These are hard to find.  The stainless steel arch one cut my tongue.  These are great &amp; I give them as stocking stuffers especially to those that can not take a hint.  Works great.  Sort of gross the bacteria you have on your tongue but you get addicted to using them because they work so well.</li>
    <li> We bought this way back when Walmart use to sell them.  When we needed to buy new ones, Walmart did not sell them anymore.  Glad we found them on here.  Easy to use and works great!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this type of tongue scraper for a few years, and thought that it was a good idea to order a few spares, because they are difficult to find in the local stores.  This model is superior to the others.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful tongue cleaner and its so simple it just works like it should. You don&#x27;t need bells and whistles with this one, just one that works to clean off the food grime from you tongue and rewards you with fresh breath. Do your friend a favor and scrape for good hygiene.</li>
    <li> big and ugly but does the  job!</li>
    <li> Strong and works good.  I gave them out for Christmas presents. Colors were fun.  Bought 18. They were a hit.</li>
    <li> Cleans my tongue nicely. The best tongue scrapper I have ever owned. Say bye bye to bad breath and hello to all the ladies.</li>
    <li> This tongue scarper is the best out there and I would recommend this to my best friends.&lt;br /&gt;They are hard to get in stores anymore so that is way I went with amazon.</li>
    <li> Read reviews on a lot of cleaners and this one had the best reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It is a large cleaner that does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another brand.</li>
    <li> A bit bulky and rigid. On the other hand, this is pretty sturdy, if not the most comfortable.  But gets the job done.  Expect it to last a while.</li>
    <li> Love the product, so much better than other scrapers out there and you cant get these in any store around the area now. So glad to have found these. My mouth feels clean again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Simply brushing my tongue made me gag and didn&#x27;t work very well.  With this cleaner I still gag a bit, but it strips the gunk I&#x27;m trying to remove very well.  The scraper is fairly wide, but not too.  I recommend it (although why I needed six remains a mystery).</li>
    <li> I bought these to give away as practical Christmas gifts.  Although I received confused looks, I think they will appreciate it when they try it.</li>
    <li> These really are the best tongue cleaners around.  I have tried various brands and different makes, but this one is the best.  I had my first one for years.  When it broke, I was really disappointed I could not get them out in town, but found them online.  I will never purchase anything but these again.</li>
    <li> My wife couldn&#x27;t locate these at any of our local stores.  Got a great deal on these and needed the extras in case one breaks down the road.</li>
    <li> This tongue scraper does the best job for the price. What typical stores offer just are not up to par.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different tongue cleaners and this one is definitely the best one.  It&#x27;s sturdy/ won&#x27;t break easily and does a thorough job with one or two sweeps without triggering the gag reflex.</li>
    <li> What good does it do to clean your teeth if your tongue is coated with nasty coffee film?  Or yesterday&#x27;s 3 squares?  I have used this brand for several years.  I prefer it to all other brands.  It works for me.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore. Don&#x27;t know. Why since the others just suck. They don&#x27;t get anything off my tongue. I bought this multi pack so I could give some away to friends and family. I&#x27;ve never tried the metal tongue scrapers, but these last me for about 2 years and they are dirt cheap. Plus, no worries through security when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> this is the best tounge cleaner in the market,no ifs and buts! i tried everything ,including the stainless one,which is amazon no.1 seller.however,consumers may have not tried this one yet.otherwise,they will ditch that their current ones,like i did w/ mine!</li>
    <li> The best tongue cleaner ever. One can last years.</li>
    <li> I am not going to lie this the only tongue cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I absolutely love it! I first bought for myself and my mom and then repurchased another 18 for cousins, friends, aunts and uncles. It does a great job and super easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist and I always recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The actual product was as described. They sent 3 different colors which was nice. They were shipped promptly and everything went smoothly. Overall a good experience.</li>
    <li> I have tried every tongue scraper I could get my hands on, this one actually does the job the first time. Even purchased for all my family.</li>
    <li> These are hard to find in the drug stores.  I had one I bought in a drug store and after 3 years, it broke.  So I was happy to find this product on Amazon.  It scrapes off all the sluck from your tongue.  It works.  I&#x27;ve given them to family and friends.</li>
    <li> These are hard plastic that literally scrape your tongue.  The tongue scrapers that I&#x27;ve used in the past have had firm nylon attached to the scraping edge.  They&#x27;ve scraped effectively without taking off the top layer of skin.  Not so this brand.  Unless I&#x27;m deliberately gentle, it can result in a bloody tongue.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s nice and wide, covering a broad area at once (which is what triggered the impetus to purchase).  Except for that, it has little to offer, being a cheaply made product that performs its function poorly.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST tongue scraper I&#x27;ve found - you get good pressure on the tongue as you scrape WITHOUT THE GAG FACTOR.  Easy to use, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS plastic and WILL brake at some point (in my case from long term use and uncareful packing when travelling) and it&#x27;s NOT EASY TO FIND so I recommend that you buy a few spares when you find them.  (Also, you might want to give some to others you know - if you&#x27;re that type of person who doesn&#x27;t just say \\&quot;go buy your own\\&quot;....I tend to be the type to buy them for others to try if it&#x27;s inexpensive, and many of my friends are the same way with things they find they like)</li>
