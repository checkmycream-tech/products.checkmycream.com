      <li>I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>Great holdling power.</li>
      <li>Great clips for transitioning hair.</li>
      <li>I appreciate good sellers with great products.</li>
      <li>but they work good as chip bag clips.</li>
      <li>ancillary benefit for me is that it made a good &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; gift on my wife&#x27;s birthday -- given the HER name is &amp;#34;Diane.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Good quality clips.</li>
      <li>The clips are great and very strong.</li>
      <li>:) Very happy customer. :)</li>
      <li>Love these, hold plenty of hair and don&#x27;t break!</li>
      <li>I need t order more!</li>
      <li>They also look nice.</li>
      <li>Break easily but good for price.</li>
      <li>you get a good deal than these are fine.</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made, but functional.</li>
      <li>Pure joy.</li>
      <li>Love these clips.</li>
      <li>because I have 11 more.</li>
      <li>I would for sure buy these again.</li>
      <li>Ok for using indoors to put hair up.  </li>
      <li>Love these butterfly clips.</li>
      <li>They are high quality and good grip and they don&#x27;t fall apart like dollar store versions.</li>
      <li>They worked just fine</li>
      <li>they work fine and do the job</li>
      <li>Cheaply made</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a cheap ass</li>
      <li>but it is really comfortable</li>
      <li>Super strong hold.</li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>For the price, these are great for holding up my curly hair and, for separating it when I blow dry or iron it.</li>
      <li>They say large, but they are more what I would call medium.</li>
      <li>so they do the job good enough</li>
      <li>While these are not meant to hold up hair in a bun, as the teeth are short, they make great use for holding up a long ponytail during the warm summer months.</li>
      <li>I have a ton of hair, its nice not to have to invest a bunch of money into something that actually works!!</li>
      <li>They are better than the ones I get at the local BBS.</li>
      <li>Great hold for thick hair</li>
      <li>I love how they were packaged and the price was second to none.</li>
      <li>Plus the shipping was fast and no damage happened during it either.</li>
      <li>they really HOLD in place.</li>
      <li>While probably for hair use, these clips double nicely as kitchen clips for open bags, etc.  </li>
      <li>They were delivered on a timely basis.&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing my hair, these clips are easy to open and fit easily on wet</li>
      <li>Well they are pretty well made however not for the larger sized hot rollers.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend these for hairdressers or home users.</li>
      <li>They have adequate clamping strength to hold a folded bag top closed tight..</li>
      <li>I have very thick Asian hair, and the clips are holding up GREAT.</li>
      <li>handles are large enough to grip.</li>
      <li>The fact that this brings 12 clips is amazing, I usually lose and misplaced them</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using them for as long as I can remember.</li>
<li> Wish I had known about these sooner for long hair and styling</li>
<li> Only wish was that I could buy just black and not the white.</li>
<li> All I ask is for them to hold the bags closed, which they do.</li>
<li> the corners of this clip are so sharp like you wont believe...</li>
<li> Sharp edges around the corner which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
<li> Tight hold but be careful</li>
<li> , the corners of the handles are sharp!</li>
<li> and I ended up paying a lot less.</li>
<li> but they are a little flimsy and don&#x27;t have the strongest of springs to clamp down</li>
<li> The only thing is the material it is not good for those how want to wear scarf like me</li>
<li> Not very imaginative in their color choice.</li>
<li> Not much more you can ask for in a clip.</li>
<li> Lower priced than the usual kitchen clip</li>
<li> Just what i needed to hold my thick hair...</li>
<li> Being that my hair is so thick</li>
<li> I have thick hair, not clip breaking issues.</li>
<li> No better or worse than any of the others in this price range.&lt;br</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t broken one yet</li>
<li> maybe that&#x27;s why one has broken within 10mins of receiving them.</li>
<li> its so dangerous, anyone comes close to my hair(kids, husband) they get scratched and poked</li>

    <li> These are used as hair clips, but I use them for plastic bags. They worked just fine and I ended up paying a lot less.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are great for holding up my curly hair and, for separating it when I blow dry or iron it. The fact that this brings 12 clips is amazing, I usually lose and misplaced them but I still have plenty.</li>
    <li> Ok for using indoors to put hair up.  Sharp edges around the corner which I don&#x27;t like.  Cheaply made</li>
    <li> they work fine and do the job but they are a little flimsy and don&#x27;t have the strongest of springs to clamp down</li>
    <li> great product at a great price!  They have adequate clamping strength to hold a folded bag top closed tight..Id buy them again! One of my daughters uses them for a hair clip too lol !!</li>
    <li> Great clips for transitioning hair. I love how they were packaged and the price was second to none. I appreciate good sellers with great products. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great hold for thick hair</li>
    <li> These are perfect for when I wash my hair. I use it to separate it in sections.</li>
    <li> No better or worse than any of the others in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;If you get a good deal than these are fine.</li>
    <li> Kinda flimsy but they work good as chip bag clips. I&#x27;m a cheap ass so they do the job good enough</li>
    <li> Love these butterfly clips. They are better than the ones I get at the local BBS. Will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> $3.97 for 12 butterfly clips with NO shipping; you can&#x27;t beat that. But considering the price expect one of them to break within a week. Being that my hair is so thick maybe that&#x27;s why one has broken within 10mins of receiving them. I&#x27;m not complaining; because I have 11 more. Pure joy.</li>
    <li> I have a ton of hair, its nice not to have to invest a bunch of money into something that actually works!!</li>
    <li> Just what i needed to hold my thick hair...</li>
    <li> There is nothing like these clips when I&#x27;m setting my hair.  When they hold in place...they really HOLD in place.</li>
    <li> Super strong hold. I have very thick Asian hair, and the clips are holding up GREAT. I would for sure buy these again.</li>
    <li> Tight hold but be careful, the corners of the handles are sharp!</li>
    <li> Break easily but good for price.</li>
    <li> These are great, they serve their purpose. Not much more you can ask for in a clip. I haven&#x27;t broken one yet but I&#x27;ve only used them about 3-4 times.</li>
    <li> The only thing is the material it is not good for those how want to wear scarf like me but it is really comfortable</li>
    <li> I am a hair dresser and these clips are the foundation for any of my procedures. I&#x27;ve been using them for as long as I can remember. They last a long time. Only wish was that I could buy just black and not the white.</li>
    <li> Love these clips. They are high quality and good grip and they don&#x27;t fall apart like dollar store versions. Highly recommend these for hairdressers or home users. I need t order more!</li>
    <li> While probably for hair use, these clips double nicely as kitchen clips for open bags, etc.  Unlike some such clips, we&#x27;ve had none break. Lower priced than the usual kitchen clip offerings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ancillary benefit for me is that it made a good &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; gift on my wife&#x27;s birthday -- given the HER name is &amp;#34;Diane.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Wish I had known about these sooner for long hair and styling</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product. Good quality clips. Great holdling power. No cons. I have nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> Perfect for section hair during the wash process and not have it slip off my hair cause of the conditioner in it .....</li>
    <li> The clips are great and very strong. I will definitely be buying this again! My mom and aunt and sister use it too</li>
    <li> the corners of this clip are so sharp like you wont believe...its so dangerous, anyone comes close to my hair(kids, husband) they get scratched and poked</li>
    <li> These clips are PERFECt &amp; GREAT! Defenetly will buy again! Everything as described. Thank you!!!! :) Very happy customer. :)</li>
    <li> They work. Very cheaply made, but functional. All I ask is for them to hold the bags closed, which they do. They say large, but they are more what I would call medium. Not very imaginative in their color choice. The essence of function, not style.</li>
    <li> Love these, hold plenty of hair and don&#x27;t break! Worth it! Plus the shipping was fast and no damage happened during it either.</li>
    <li> These clips were just what I wanted! They were delivered on a timely basis.&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing my hair, these clips are easy to open and fit easily on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;The handles are large enough to grip. They did not slip, even with conditioner on my&lt;br /&gt;fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Well they are pretty well made however not for the larger sized hot rollers.</li>
    <li> While these are not meant to hold up hair in a bun, as the teeth are short, they make great use for holding up a long ponytail during the warm summer months. The teeth do not dig into the scalp and are comfy. They also look nice. Great value.</li>
    <li> Does the job. I have thick hair, not clip breaking issues.</li>
