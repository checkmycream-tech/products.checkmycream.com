      <li>have not tried on vegetables but is supposed to be effective to eliminate insects without carcinogenic chemicals</li>
      <li>what more can I say.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s MUCH better now :)</li>
      <li>I want to make sure there wasn&#x27;t any bugs and spider in the machine.  </li>
      <li>but it is a lot better than treating members of the family with poisons.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My tree is &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; a lot better</li>
      <li>After reading more about Neem oil</li>
      <li>so there could be a lot more to Neem oil than use as  just a bug killer.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy and highly recommend</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and since I&#x27;ve purchased from Dr. Adorable before, I feel confident it will work like I need it to!</li>
      <li>I am impressed and will continue to use this as well as keep reading up on all the other uses.  </li>
      <li>I had a huge spider mite infestation in the wall of my house</li>
      <li>I dont know what is it may be cheap baby oil and traces of neem oil in it.</li>
      <li>for beautiful ROSES  (without carcinogenic chemicals) add a  few drops of oil along with a teaspoon or more of liquid soap in spray bottle, assists with eliminating block spot on leaves and encourages growth.</li>

      <li>I used Neem oil before, it has strong order and become solid under 55 degree F  temperature.  </li>
      <li>It is certainly fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought this was going to be pure Neem, but this is diluted.</li>
      <li>Very goood results nothing else</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a much smarter way to deal with insect pests than to just kill everything.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>whole bunch of spider came out because of the smell.</li>
      <li>If you want cold pressed Neem oil for your plants then this stuff is the best for the price.</li>
      <li>And WOW what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>real hormones, neem oil insecticide works at very low concentrations, in the parts per million range.</li>
      <li>enters the system and blocks the real hormones from working properly.</li>
      <li>Natural plant insecticide/pesticide.</li>
      <li>Insects take up the neem oil ingredients just like natural hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read many other uses for Neem oil, but I can&#x27;t imagine using this cosmetically, it really stinks, yet still smells better than chemical pesticides</li>
      <li>/&gt;Still worth it, I just mixed the oil with other oils to dilute the smell</li>
      <li>Great quality, only issue is I didn&#x27;t realize neem oil smells like durian fruit...which is nicknamed &amp;#34;stinky fruit&amp;#34; because it smells bad and attracts flies.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Neem oil has many complex active ingredients.</li>
      <li>Well, Neem oil stinks, I could ask for a better smell, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be natural.  </li>

<li> Well, Neem oil stinks, I could ask for a better smell, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be natural.  </li>
<li> just mixed a few large drops in a spray bottle and added a little water as I needed and applied it to the area daily, once or twice a day as needed.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS</li>
<li> /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t bad either, honestly it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>

<li> , PETS mix few drops with their bath, or a few drops in spray bottle and use to eliminate fleas,and if they lick it no worry it is a natural antimicrobial.</li>
<li> A good friend told me about mixing 1/3 neem oil with 2/3 water  in a spray bottle for tick repellent on Yutah.</li>
<li> It is not pure neem oil.</li>
<li> A little neem oil goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t waste any time.</li>
<li> (very odd</li>

<li> Can&#x27;t get past the smell ----</li>
<li> /&gt;Obviously insects that are too confused to eat or breed will not survive.</li>
<li> sorry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A good friend told me about mixing 1/3 neem oil with 2/3 water  in a spray bottle for tick repellent on Yutah. It  smells a bit garlicky but it does seem to do the trick. We hike a lot in sagebrush and other brush, and ticks are a problem. I am a lot more comfortable using Neem Oil than the other non natural tick repellents.</li>
    <li> I really hate the smell. It is so unpleasant I can&#x27;t stand to even open the container.  I use this as a plant spray and wear a mask. Yuck.</li>
    <li> Very goood results nothing else worked.thank you for your product.</li>
    <li> for beautiful ROSES  (without carcinogenic chemicals) add a  few drops of oil along with a teaspoon or more of liquid soap in spray bottle, assists with eliminating block spot on leaves and encourages growth. have not tried on vegetables but is supposed to be effective to eliminate insects without carcinogenic chemicals, PETS mix few drops with their bath, or a few drops in spray bottle and use to eliminate fleas,and if they lick it no worry it is a natural antimicrobial.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells horrible.  So bad I will never ever buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product to relieve psoriasis. It has has worked for me and I am planning to keep on buying it</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I used for organic garden and after one spray, my target disappeared.  I am impressed and will continue to use this as well as keep reading up on all the other uses.  Amazing</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t bear the smell... Used it once and just could not! Ended in trash...</li>
    <li> Great quality, only issue is I didn&#x27;t realize neem oil smells like durian fruit...which is nicknamed &amp;#34;stinky fruit&amp;#34; because it smells bad and attracts flies.&lt;br /&gt;Still worth it, I just mixed the oil with other oils to dilute the smell and it&#x27;s MUCH better now :) And my hair is super soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been working well in my garden, I just needed to get started with it earlier. Don&#x27;t waste any time.</li>
    <li> Typical Neem aroma, but very effective in its multiple uses, dog flea/ tick repellent, skin conditioner. Natural plant insecticide/pesticide. Neem is considered Miracle plant in India for its healing properties. If used properly it is very effective. Wonderful product, and best service from Amazon prime, nicely packed delivered on time👌</li>
    <li> This stuff works awesome for a bug inhibitor on my garden. One Tablespoon of 100% Neem oil, 1 1/2 teaspoon of dish soap (I use Palmolive) per one gallon of water. Spray it on my garden veggies once a week and it works great</li>
    <li> As expected, very nice wuality</li>
    <li> Yes, the odor is not like perfumed roses but it works as a good insecticide. I swabbed it on the leaves of a lemon tree infested with mealy bugs. My tree is &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; a lot better and I am not seeing the bugs anymore. I am hoping that the problem has been dealt with sufficiently, but if the bugs return I know now how to thwart them. After reading more about Neem oil I found that it has a multiplicity of uses related to human health. It is being used for cancerous tumors in India and is purported to work to stop skin cancer growths too so there could be a lot more to Neem oil than use as  just a bug killer.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be pure Neem, but this is diluted.</li>
    <li> Tastes awful! Just like it should.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. spider hated the smell.  I brought an exercise machine from outdoor to indoor.  I want to make sure there wasn&#x27;t any bugs and spider in the machine.  I spray with this (mix 32 oz w/1 teaspoon Neem and 1/2 teasppon soap)...whole bunch of spider came out because of the smell. Good for roses plant.</li>
    <li> Works good except on squash bugs.</li>
    <li> Works great, many uses. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Neem oil was recommended for use on the sores on my husbands feet. We have been using this for a while and it seems to help heal the sores.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great...what more can I say. If you want cold pressed Neem oil for your plants then this stuff is the best for the price. It has made my pepper plants grow like crazy!</li>
    <li> We have three little dogs 2 Min Pins, and a Min Pin/Chihuahua cross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our dogs had a TERRIBLE tick infestation, and we had a dog groomer give the dogs a flea/Tick dip. Within 48 hours the ticks was as bad as if nothing had been done. I refuse to use flea collars the other dogs can get at, or Front Line, Advantix II, etc for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told about Neem Oil and given a recipe to use with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kami (the youngest sometimes had 20 ticks on her in one day, and the other dogs had 5-10 ticks each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we tried this we tried Rose Geranium oil. It helped some but did not do a thorough job so we tried using Neem oil. And WOW what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use the neem oil recipe twice a week, and the other five days we use rose geranium oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Neem and rose geranium oil we find 0-2 ticks on all three dogs combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another person commented that Neem oil stinks but it is a lot better than treating members of the family with poisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the recipe I was given for Neem oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16 OZs (480 ml) water&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) Neem oil&lt;br /&gt;1 ml dishwashing soap (I used Dawn)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine ingredients in spray bottle and shake well. Spray onto dogs and rub into their coats&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more miserable little doggies because of tick bites.</li>
    <li> Has an off putting smell I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I bought this to use in herbal body care products. I don&#x27;t know any way to describe the smell other than like an italian sandwich. I am not saying it&#x27;s a bad product just doesn&#x27;t work for what I wanted to use it for.</li>
    <li> good quality, good price</li>
    <li> Great product. Wonderful for my homemade pesticide for my gardens.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get past the smell ---- sorry.</li>
    <li> I purchased Neem Oil for some homemade cosmetics I&#x27;m working on.  I know it is my tooth cleaner but that&#x27;s about all I know about Neem Oil.  It smells fresh and since I&#x27;ve purchased from Dr. Adorable before, I feel confident it will work like I need it to!</li>
    <li> This smells really bad it makes my head hurt</li>
    <li> Good price, whitefly is gone, what else could I ask for?  Well, Neem oil stinks, I could ask for a better smell, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be natural.  If you don&#x27;t want to use pesticides, this is the ticket.  I&#x27;ve read many other uses for Neem oil, but I can&#x27;t imagine using this cosmetically, it really stinks, yet still smells better than chemical pesticides, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stink.</li>
    <li> Neem has a distinctive odor that my not be to everyone&#x27;s liking, a peanut butter garlic combination. Worked well in my application.</li>
    <li> Great organic source of neem oil, will buy again!</li>
    <li> I had a huge spider mite infestation in the wall of my house (very odd I know) and it was driving me out of my mind. I bought this to try as a safe organic way of dealing with them and it worked GREAT. It has seemed to stop the repopulation and gotten rid of the problem in literally three days. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t bad either, honestly it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It just smells like someone has been cooking asian food in the house all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is some information from a website explaining how it works:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.discoverneem.com/neem-oil-insecticide.html&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Neem oil has many complex active ingredients. Rather than being simple poisons, those ingredients are similar to the hormones that insects produce. Insects take up the neem oil ingredients just like natural hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neem enters the system and blocks the real hormones from working properly. Insects &amp;#34;forget&amp;#34; to eat, to mate, or they stop laying eggs. Some forget that they can fly. If eggs are produced they don&#x27;t hatch, or the larvae don&#x27;t moult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously insects that are too confused to eat or breed will not survive. The population eventually plummets, and they disappear. The cycle is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neem oil does not hurt beneficial insects. Only chewing and sucking insects are affected. It is certainly fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like real hormones, neem oil insecticide works at very low concentrations, in the parts per million range. A little neem oil goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is not something that happens over night. People spray neem oil as insecticide, and expect everything to die instantly, because that&#x27;s what they are used to from chemical poisons. When that does not happen they conclude neem insecticide does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work! Give it time to work. It&#x27;s a much smarter way to deal with insect pests than to just kill everything.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just mixed a few large drops in a spray bottle and added a little water as I needed and applied it to the area daily, once or twice a day as needed.&lt;br /&gt;WORKS LIKE A CHARM.</li>
    <li> Zero Star. It is not pure neem oil. This people are cheating. I used Neem oil before, it has strong order and become solid under 55 degree F  temperature.  I dont know what is it may be cheap baby oil and traces of neem oil in it. When it delivered  it was  exposed hours in my out side mail box under icey  30 F NY winter weather, still it was liquid ! Retuning this crap and may reported to consumer protection agency!</li>
