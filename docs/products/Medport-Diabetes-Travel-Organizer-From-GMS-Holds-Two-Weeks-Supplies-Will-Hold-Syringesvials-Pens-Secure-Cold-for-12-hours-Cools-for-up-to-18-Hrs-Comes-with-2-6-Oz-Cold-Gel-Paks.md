<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My first order got lost and I didn&#x27;t get it before I had to leave on a trip.  The re-order didn&#x27;t come in until after I got back.  I saw no loose threads, skipped stitches or cuts in the dense tight weave nylon.  The little &amp;#34;Medical Waste&amp;#34; pouch will be handy for temporary storage of used needles and test strips.  I preloaded it with the hardware and every thing fit OK, except my meter in its case with lancer and strips.  No worries , it will all go into the carryall that the rest of my medical gear ride in.</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that it held all of my insulin.  The only thing I would add is a pill bottle area as many diabetics needs to carry pills as well.  It is also tight to zip when you fill it with meds.</li>
    <li> It keeps your insulan cool for only about 10 hrs. not very well insulated. every than has a place to be stored in this organizer</li>
    <li> I have found this case to be a very handy item.  It keeps my insulin cool&lt;br /&gt;all day long when I&#x27;m away from home.  It&#x27;s neat and well-made.</li>
    <li> Very useful product. Made of sturdy material. For me it won&#x27;t carry two weeks supply. Good for about 4 days. But, you probably would not want to carry a larger case with you. The cooling packs are good for a day and easily refrozen in a freezer overnight. I find many hotels now have refrigerators  in guest rooms.</li>
    <li> We bought this for a two week trip overseas with a Type I child, and this is in NO way large enough for two weeks worth of supplies if you are on multiple daily injections.  Perhaps if you were on a pump and all you needed to bring was backup, I don&#x27;t know, but honestly we had a quart ziplock back in addition to this filled to the brim with everything we needed.  We had insulin, pen needles, and syringes and this held, at most, a week&#x27;s worth (you can get a lot of syringes in to some areas but not many pen needles, they&#x27;re bulky).  I agree with a previous review that mentioned the poor quality plastic on the inside of the pouch which made it difficult to get things in and out of the little pockets. I did appreciate having the seperate pouch for used syringes and test strips.     Finally, the cool-packs are not any special \\&quot;medical\\&quot; cooling gel, they seem pretty much the same as any other out there and last as long.  We froze ours solidly overnight and 8 hours after putting them in the bag when we got to our destination (after being in ice-cold outdoors then normal temps inside) the insulin was fine but the gel packs were cool but nearly melted.  There is absolutely no way they would have lasted 18 hours.  The pack is fine on it&#x27;s own merits, hence the rating, but the claims made for it were unsubstantiated and proved exaggerated.  I will not buy from this seller again on that basis.</li>
    <li> The case shipped and arrived very quick. It is large enough to hold supplies for a week or so.    What I did not like and am having problems with are the follwoing:  1. The medical waste pouch sealer is broke. The zipper sealer is broke and broke very quickly.  2. The velcro is coming off the pouch. Looks like it was sewn on and not adhered correctly.  3. The elastic loops that hold insulin pens and maybe a lancet device have become loose and do not hold the devices very well.    We have had this bag less than three months.</li>
    <li> This organizer is equipped with the necessary pockets and compartments for me to be able to carry all the supplies necessary to repair and maintain my insulin pump as well as other supplies. I consider this unit a great addition to my diabetes treatment.</li>
    <li> The idea is to hold all the necessary insulin supplies, including the meter and test strips. Gel packs from the 0 F freezer are put into a pouch next to the insulin. I don&#x27;t know why the insulin doesn&#x27;t freeze, but it doesn&#x27;t. It seems to be the best product of its type available, but nonetheless it could be a lot better. The organizer uses clear \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; plastic for several of the pouches, and they are difficult to use, resisting putting things in and taking them out. Mesh would be much better. The pouches are really too small for standard 1 cc syringes; they can be used, but only with difficulty. The insulin side of the case is difficult to zip when the gel packs are in place. It&#x27;s the right idea, but needs redesign. There are no instructions as to what is supposed to go where, but that can be figured out.</li>
    <li> This is a great case, durable and well made - much more so then any others I have used in the past.  It has a lot of room and many pockets to allow you to set up what you need to carry in an organized way.  I have no issue with zippering the cool side even when loaded with pens and vials and both ice packs.    My one disappointment is that it is advertised with a detachable container for used sharps and supplies to hold them until you can move them to an appropriate permanent container, however the case came with &#x27;snaps&#x27; where this container must attach but no container as it is showing the in the images and mentioned in what comes with the case.  One of the several things I was looking for in a case was a special container like this so I did not have to devote a pocket to playing the role or carrying a separate container.  I have looked and there does not seem to be anywhere this container is sold separately so I am bit bemused by why it was not included in the original packaging.  The case came sealed in its packaging so I don&#x27;t think it was originally there and just strayed.    Update:  The seller was very quick to send me a replacement for the medical waste insert - apparently the manufacturer left it out and as the case is sealed in its packaging the seller has no way to know that until the packaging is opened    The case was shipped quickly and i got it in a few days and that was great as my last case had started to come apart and was dropping supplies.</li>
    <li> LOVE this bag. It holds enough supplies to actually last the two weeks and even has room for the testing logbook. It keeps every thing in one easy to find place when traveling. Cooler pack stays cold for a very long time, can go 2 days on one freeze.</li>
    <li> Well bulit and practical. Plenty of supply storage areas. Not to big, not to small. Just right for travel.</li>
    <li> We bought this for travel, but we use it constantly.  It stays in the fridge, holding  the insulin, alcohol wipes and syringes. I check &amp; refill it approximately every 2 weeks.  When it&#x27;s time to give my husband insulin, I just take it out of the fridge, and everything is right there. When traveling, we add the gel packs. But we have not tried to put the testing supplies in it; they are in a separate small packet.  My husband took it when he visited some friends for a week.  They had had previous guests who were diabetic, and they were really impressed with how organized my husband was. - - Not how people usually describe him. LOL</li>
    <li> Needed a good travel bag for a 2-week trip in Alaska - passed through security just fine - everything organised and in one place.  Cold packs kept insulin cool.  Not bulky and fit in carry-on bag.  Worked well.</li>
    <li> We travel by air several times a year and I never had a problem getting through TSA security until I used this bag.  The gel packs scan as if they were GELS, which are not allowed on airplanes.  TSA security put it through the scanner several times and said that it looked like there was a large bottle of liquid inside.   It wasn&#x27;t until I took the gelpacks out that they would allow it through.  I had no problem on the return trip because I left the gel packs in my checked baggage, but, then, what good are they?  The pack was not large enough to carry two weeks supplies since I use both insulin vials with syringes and pens and pen needles. It was only big enough for one week&#x27;s supplies.  There was only enough room to carry one pen and the elastic was so tight that the insulin bottles could not fit in.  There was no picture or explanation of what supplies would be best put in what area, so I don&#x27;t even know if I was using it correctly. Having a cold side and room temperature side sounded like a good idea until I used it; then I realized that the insulin was not in the compartment with the needles, causing you to have to open both zippers simultaneously.  The gel packs are small and did not stay cool enough for the 11 hours it took to get to the other side of the country.  The center pouch for medical waste was flimsy and that zipper was not strong.  However, it was very convenient to have all my supplies together and portable. The pouch was small enough to carry inside my travel purse.  This could be a good product with some re-design, but I will look for another brand in the future.  I think the manufacturer should concentrate on pen storage rather than vials and syringes because that is the way of the future.  Storage for vials and needles will not be as necessary soon.</li>
    <li> This item is not worth it.  I thought I bought a different Brand!  This is Not a Medicool!&lt;br /&gt;The zippers don&#x27;t work right...cheaply made, in China!  I returned it!!</li>
    <li> This holds a lot of supplies, and the cold-gel packs keep everything within a safe temperature.  This is great for travel.</li>
    <li> This kit was just what I needed for a 1 week vacation.  It has all the space and pockets needed for at least 1 week and probably more.  2 things that you may want to upgrade or adjust.  The 2 ice packs barely make it for 8 hours.  If your on the road for a long haul, I&#x27;d buy 1 large pack to replace them (although must insulins are supposed to be fine at room temp).  If your using disposable syringes, make sure you keep the needle covers because the needles will puncture the disposal bag without them.  The bag is vinyl and kind of light weight.  That&#x27;s why the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> The zippers on this travel kit are cheap and troublesome. They were continually getting caught up in either the fabric behind them or the cold packs. I would not have purchased the product if I&#x27;d had a sample in hand to preview (assuming they all have the zipper problem).</li>
    <li> This is a perfect travel bag to carry all my medications.  My insulin, needles, and oral medications fit in the bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom who has been a diabetic for a long time.  She loved it!  There were so many convenient pouches but it wasn&#x27;t too bulky.  She is able to put this into purse and carry with her.  I would totally recommend this item</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for my mother, and she likes it better than her previous one!&lt;br /&gt; It just took longer to arrive than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
    <li> Nice case. I&#x27;ve tweaked the hell out of it, between switching the sides I keep my insulin pens and testing stuff, removing cold packs (don&#x27;t need them), and a bit of velcro. Not a drawback of the case so much, but it&#x27;s what I do. Thew a carabiner on one of the side loops too, and I keep it in a drawstring bag with juice, glucagon, a clif bar, and the calorie king book.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product. The internal pouches are made of a clear, sticky vinyl that is somewhat difficult to fill with syringes. The zippers are cheap and insubstantial. The nylon used for the main body is very cheap-feeling nylon. Overall, the fit and finish is quite unsatisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did like the idea of the removable internal sharps bag, I was surprised at how difficult the snaps were - anyone with arthritis would have a difficult time fighting with this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is touted as a &#x27;two week&#x27; bag, but I am finding it less than satisfactory if (like me) you use both pens and syringes, as the supplies I packed for the 4 day trip I am currently on have seemingly taxed the limited capacity of this bag.</li>
    <li> I had one of these and after 5 or 6 years the zipper went bad and I could not find one in stores here in Fresno,Ca. so I looked on line and found one. I love this item because it has room for eveything I need to carry...I had good shiping on it also.</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS PERFECTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CARRYING MY INSULIN AND OTHER DIABETIC SUPPLIES.  IT EVEN HAS A POCKET AND LOOP FOR MY ACCU-CHECK.</li>
    <li> I have one from a few years back that I paid $12 for. It worked fine, except the vinyl inside tears after a year or two from plastic degrading.  The gouging price is why I gave this a bad review. More stiffing the patients by overcharging for medical supplies.  Update: The vinyl inside spontaneously corroded, got brittle, flaked and broke off after a year.   Very Poorly Made in China.</li>
    <li> I use pens (2 types) and have not been able to find a case that holds enough pens for a month-long trip. This fills the bill IF you use the vial holders for the pens -- 10 fit easily this way, which is way more than enough.  That said, this case has drawbacks and I hope the maker improves it.  On the dry side, the vinyl pouches are poorly thought out and executed, and the material seems set to rip sooner rather than later. On the cool side, the envelope for the gel packs is about an inch short. Stitching is crooked all over. The biohazard envelope is a nice touch but truly you&#x27;d get the same result tucking a disposable ziplock bag in that space.</li>
    <li> More poor quality Chinese crap, way overpriced for what it is. Cold gel packs slightly too big and elastic bands too small to hold syringe/pens. Paid $29 but worth $5. Ripoff!</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect for any diabetic with alot of medical equipment.  I highly recomend this for any diabetic.</li>
    <li> Right after I received the case, I went on a trip and I was so pleased at how well this case served my purposes. I would recommend it to anyone who needs something to organize and keep their diabetic items safe while they travel.     Thanks so much, Janice HUnter</li>
    <li> This case was a gift and sent out of the country.  I liked it and so did the recipient of the bag.  It seems to be working well and seems to accomodate well enough the contents for which it was intended.  It appeared to be reasonably well made and i suspect will work for a long time.  Glad I chose it and although i am not diabetic thought compared to what is avaialble it seemed like a good choice.</li>
    <li> This product did not fit my need of transporting Lantus and Aphidra pens.  The plastic inside was stiff and not convenient for me.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> The cool-med bag is adequate, but unfortunately the ice packs warm up fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;By the end of my work day my meds are warm. I believe I will keep looking for another travel med bag or design my own. The concept is good, but the materials are not up to par for the desert climate. I spent more than it was worth. RR</li>
    <li> This organizer was a little bigger than I would have liked it to be.  However, I don&#x27;t think it is accurate to say that it would keep everything cold for up to 18 hours.  On the flight home, we ended up using this organizer about 10 hours.  Both of the ice packs had melted by this time.  The vials were cool, but I would be worried if anything would be cold after 11 or so hours.</li>
    <li> Item is well suited for my needs. The only problem, which causes me to buy replacements is the zippers. They are not robust enough.</li>
    <li> This item is useful for diabetics who need or want to travel. I&#x27;ve used it twice for two week periods and it was more than adequate. Be sure to freeze the gel packs in a area of the freezer so they will fit properly in the organizer.</li>
    <li> This Medport diabetes travel case is part of my daily life. I have everything I need in one case so I just grab it and go! I run tugboats so it is very convenient and portable for me. Highly recommend this case!</li>
    <li> Instead of scrambling for everything you need before you go off to a trip worrying if you are going to miss something. You just grab this bag and fill the slots. Has every pouch you need for being away for a while.</li>
    <li> it was a gift for my husband &amp; he is very glad to be able to carry all his diabetic supplies now &amp; also keep his insulin cold.</li>
    <li> Good way to carry a weeks worth of supplies but is big and bulky.</li>
    <li> THE TRAVEL ORGANIZER WAS JUST LIKE IT WAS PICTURED SO I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING..GOOD TIME WITH THE MAIL</li>
    <li> I am getting ready to order my third one. I use one every day and am quite hard on it. They seem to last about four years for me, then the zippers stop zipping. Needs better zippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could make this bag much better by using better zippers and simply using lighter colored material such as white, light tan, light blue etc. If you leave this black bag in the sun for just a few minutes, it gets soo hot you can hardly touch it. This would help protect your insulin and make the cold packs last much longer too.</li>
    <li> My husband and I bought this travel kit for my father-in-law as a birthday gift. I had noticed that his insulin carry case had a broken zipper, no cool packs and was very old and worn. I decided this would be a nice practical gift for him. He loved it! When he comes to visit us he is able to bring everything he needs in one designated case and it stays cold on the plain ride. We also got him a mini carry case for his daily insulin needs. Great pairing if you don&#x27;t know what to buy for someone. A+++</li>
    <li> I found this cooler to be adequate.  It is small so you can&#x27;t expect it to keep cold for days at a time, but that small size also makes it less of an issue to pack and carry.  Its construction is of average quality and it contains many compartments of varying utility.  If all of its medication retainers are filled, it can be difficult to close, but it is rare that someone would need to travel with that amount of medicine.</li>
    <li> My child absolutely loves this organizer.  It holds and transport everything.  He has even managed to put a few snacks inside.  Great buy!!!</li>
    <li> i have been using this travel organizer for about 8 months and love it. It was the cheapest one a found with all the pockets and sections I need.</li>
    <li> Great bag..bought it for my husband and he carries it everyday. It is roomy enough for all of his supplies. Love the ice packs that are included.</li>
    <li> This has been a life saver for me on short and long trips. Stays cool a long time and has everything you need all in one place.</li>
    <li> my husband is a diabetic and really loved this bag.  it was lost. i tried to re-order the same one but chose the diabetic travel bag and did not like it as well.</li>
    <li> This does what I need it to, organizes my supplies neatly and it is something I can slip into my purse.  It is a good value for the money and I can relax knowing that my insulin will withstand a cross country flight to see family.</li>
    <li> I have always liked the different MEDport Organizers I have had for my Diabetic Supplies,  However they out did themselves when they made this one, Pleanty of room for everything, and you can actually keep 2 weeks of supplies in it. In the kits I had before, there was always something lacking, This one has room for everything and then some, I hope when I wear this one out, they are still making it, because it normall takes 7 or 8 years to wear out, they are that well made. Thank you, MEDport</li>
    <li> Took the kit to Australia -. Travelled well &amp; kept everything safe and cold. Easy for security checks at the airports also! Fits everything and was able to fit easily in cabin bag. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Being insulin dependent has it&#x27;s problems, but this case takes care if all your \\&quot;traveling with insulin\\&quot; issues!  The case is well designed with plenty of storage space for your vials, syringes, and even your used lancets and syringes!  The ice pack is very sturdy and kept my insulin cold for well over 12 hours when I flew out to see a friend.  Went thru security at the airport very easily!</li>
    <li> sometimes, the zip does not work well. But, in general, the product it is good. I liked it.I used it in traveling, was nice, workable. I liked its small size.</li>
    <li> This was useful, but did not keep the med cold for as long as I needed it to.  The ice packs just didn&#x27;t last long enough in a warm car traveling for 10+ hours.  The compartments weren&#x27;t exactly what I needed, but overall it was adequate.  It is well made, but needs more insulating qualities built in to it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worked like a dream.  Holds supplies and vials easily, enough for two people. The cold packs stay good and chilled all day, like Asian almost 24 hours if you need them to.  If you carry cold medicines, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> I purchase this item to assist my wife in the carrying of diabetes supplies. It was the right size for a two week overseas trip and provide a compact organizer for coiming and going through airport security.  Great Product would purchase it again if needed.</li>
    <li> Just received the bag today and it is exactly what the picture shows. It also has a small removable white biohazard bag on the dry side.  This is perfect to hold all medical supplies and goodie rewards after shots for my dog.</li>
    <li> great and safe product for traveling.  well made and plenty of room for my insulin pens as well as everything else I need.  Also, it was a great price</li>
    <li> I needed a travel pack that held enough for 2-3 weeks.  This has what I needed.  Only drawback was the zippers are tough to manage around the curves.  But going slowly with a firm hold on the edges, it suffices.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It has plenty of room to store the basic supplies needed for testing on the go.&lt;br /&gt;- Relatively durable, for the price...DH&#x27;s is holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps insulin cool...I wouldn&#x27;t leave this bag in a hot car for more than an hour or so. It works well in moderate, not extreme temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The straps that hold the pens are a little tight. I suppose the longer you own it, that becomes less of an issue since all elastic weakens over time.&lt;br /&gt;- The zipper is a little cheap...but hey, what do you expect for an inexpensive bag? So far, it is holding up to light use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments: My husband now uses this instead of the bag that comes with the meter. It&#x27;s pretty convenient. We keep the ice packs in the freezer and only use them when we go out. The small zip top bag for sharps is convenient but not &amp;#34;stick-proof&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s nice to have, in a pinch, if we forget the mini sharps container. Overall, I think the design is well thought out. It is reasonably priced and about what I would expect in this price range.</li>
    <li> Liked the product, although early stages yet.  The zipper looks very weak though and I am not sure if it will last too long.</li>
    <li> the pockets are too tight. I have trouble digging strips, lancets and alcohol pads from the tight pockets. My fingers are too big I guess.</li>
    <li> The frozen gel packs made the package too bulky.  I needed to get the packs frozen on the road.  Most hotels were gracious and froze the packs for me.  But it was a hassle.</li>
    <li> This item defiantly holds a lot of things the only issue is that is very big about the size of a small clutch purse.  I would recommend something smaller if your looking for something discreet.</li>
    <li> We bought this bag for the cooler option because we were traveling and needed to keep our sons insulin cool.  The cold packs worked great and the bag fit everything we needed.  My son now uses it as an everyday bag.  The product was shipped on-time and received as expected.</li>
    <li> Just needed something portable for my road trips.  It kept my diabetic medication frig-cool and that is what I needed.</li>
    <li> I chose this Medport Diabetes travel organizer for when I travel long distance and it had good reviews.Plus it keeps the insulin cold.</li>
    <li> Good idea but mine had defect zipper which can happen with any product. For price paid zipper should be stronger</li>
    <li> This is PERFECT for traveling purposes.  I take 6 allergy shots a week and if you happen to go out of town, this makes it so easy -- it has a place for everything including the waste, vials, syringes, etc. and even ice packs to keep the vial cold.</li>
    <li> The inside is stiff plastic.  Does not hold my supplies properly.  It is not helpful at all and I expect the platic pockets to split long before I get 2 weeks supplies in it.</li>
    <li> Had trouble with the zipper getting stuck/caught at first. Thought I was going to have to return it, but it got broken in after a few times of using it. Had a smaller case that my glucose monitor came with, but got sick of not being able to carry extra supplies. This case did the trick.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine. The quality could be a tiny bit better, but really, no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a great case for lots of things other than medical supplies. I use it for my eCigarette stuff and it works awesome. It holds 4 batteries, with large clearomizers attached, as we&#x27;ll as 6 small or medium containers of eJuice - and that&#x27;s just one side! I also keep loads of extra cartomizers and clearomizers and more in the case. It even has a nice pocket for chargers. I love it. I use it for trips and just for home, since it holds anything I need on a regular basis for vaping. Pricey, but well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The size is perfect for a 2 week trip.  Other cases I purchased were too small for a long trip.  This one was the right, compact size I required.</li>
    <li> I use byetta for my diabetes and need something to keep it cool. I fly a lot and really like it.</li>
    <li> I got this item because I have type 1 Diabetes. I brought 2 day shipping on a Sat. it came Monday evening. The cool packs work well just as long as it says pretty much an all day thing. I Love it and it has really helped me with my numbers :)</li>
    <li> Item was more than expected; recommend product to others. You will not be disappointed. Many compartments that are very useful for all supplies.</li>
    <li> Has a place for everything. Love that it had a place to dispose of used syringes,  The only thing I had trouble with was that the zipper is a little hard to use, sticks at the corners.</li>
    <li> This is a poor product and should be avoided. Poor design with many useless pockets. Large for what it can do. Does not keep items cool for more than a few hours. \\&quot;Weeps\\&quot; as condensate forms on the outside. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> As I moved from multiple daily injects to using an insulin pump, the number of items that I need to carry seemed to multiply. Sigh! I searched through several different bags to carry my supplies. This seems to be the best option to allow me to carry everything I need. It&#x27;s just about the right size. It&#x27;s large enough to carry my insulin pump supplies, but not so large that I can not slip it into other luggage. It comes with gel packs that you freeze to keep your insulin cool. However, I purchased a sheet of Techni-Ice to allow me to better tailor the cooling to my specific needs. First of all, I can use one, two, or three of those sheets to increase or decrease the cooling. Secondly, gel packs have an ugly habit of freezing in lumpy shapes (rather than nice an flat). The Techni-Ice offers a good addition to this case.</li>
    <li> My mother in law needed a travel organizer to have everything in one place and for not being questioned by security at the airport. This organizer has everything she needed and she thanks me every time!</li>
    <li> I was able to load two weeks worth of medications and testing material - however because of the design materials became disorganized and kept falling out when opened ... poor design ... would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I feel guilty not giving this 5 stars because I chose it.  It is way more organizer than I need and a little bulky, but there really isn&#x27;t anything in between.  I would have preferred a fold out type to make accessing all my supplies easier because with this one you have to flip it over and unzip the other side to get stuff out of the pockets.  However to be fair, it is well made, and the seller and shipper performed as advertised.</li>
    <li> I needed a bag to transport insulin for plane rides. This looks a bit cheap, but it worked just fine. I went across country and when I got to the hotel, my insulin was still cold.</li>
    <li> I ordered the case thinking that a strap would be included. There was no  strap but had the buckles for a strap. However I do like the roominess and divided sections for individual supplies to be kept</li>
    <li> i like it, is good and comfortable, for short or medium travel, keep an eye on the ice.&lt;br /&gt;very recommendable.</li>
    <li> The case I purchased for my wife. She loved it, we are planning a long road trip this summer so the case will come in very useful . Great case because have of it is cold and other half is room temp. Great price for this item.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it is big enough to hold 2 weeks worth of supplies.  I was disappointed because it does not come with a shoulder strap.  It has the rings on the outside to hook a shoulder strap to it but mine did not come with one.  I bought it mainly because I thought I would be able to carry it on my shoulder to make it easier to carry.</li>
    <li> Plastic all over it&#x27;s made in China and I got to tell you this was a little to much to pay for but I need it something to help Grandma carry all her essentials. Buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> I must say that the cold packs work very well. There are plenty of compartments but the plastic is fairly low grade. Overall it does the job.</li>
    <li> the product is shown and fulfills its purpose very well, I recommend all the parts shown on the package very good</li>
    <li> Perfect little travel bag to carry diabetic supplies or almost anything you need to carry on the go. Great case</li>
    <li> Keeps your Insulin cool and the Medical wast bag is puncture proof!  The pockets are just the right size too!</li>
    <li> This item was used on a 4 day trip.  There was ample space for all needed supplies.  The gel packs kept my insulin cool for the entire day.  I used the ice bucket in the hotel to keep the insulin fresh while the gel packs were in my hosts freezer.  Worked great.  I put the protective cap back on the needles after use to keep from puncturing the disposal pouch.  The pouch itself is a good idea.  All in all it is a very handy, useful product.  I like a product that is as advertised and does the job it is supposed to do.  I</li>
