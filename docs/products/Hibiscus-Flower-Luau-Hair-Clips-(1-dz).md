      <li>The flowers were way to huge.</li>
      <li>These were a huge hit at the Luau that my church hosted.</li>
      <li>The barrette it comes with is a cheap plastic one.</li>
      <li>Cheap &amp; came all crumpled</li>
      <li>and I took them out and tried to smooth them.  </li>
      <li>decent but not as nice as in pictures.</li>
      <li>They did make pretty table decorations at a meeting :)</li>
      <li>After you fluff them out, they are great.  </li>
      <li>The pictures look WAY better then in real life.  </li>
      <li>They were a big hit and they looked wonderful, especially in photos.</li>
      <li>Flowers look pretty cheap</li>
      <li>The material is very cheap not attractive at all i was inspecting better quality and material on this flowers on the pic they look nice</li>
      <li>Flimsy, but colorful.</li>
      <li>They looked better on an adult.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about these at all.</li>
      <li>they are kind of big</li>
      <li>No complaints for a fun Luau,</li>
      <li>We had a luau themed baby shower for a niece and her husband who are expecting their first child (very excited) and these were worn by the hostesses and the mommy to be as a way to make them easily identifiable to the 60 plus guests!</li>
      <li>The other girls loved them.</li>
      <li>And the ladies loved them, they continue to wear them with other outfits.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The flowers spring into shape and have a nice long clip that attaches well to my hair.</li>
      <li>3 year old daughter loved them as well had to buy another back</li>
      <li>They came all smooshed in a bag but popped up quickly with out much fuss.</li>
      <li>They looked adorable in everyone&#x27;s hair and even stayed in very short hair.  </li>
      <li>They look pretty just laying on the table.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the exact ones and thought these would be close.  </li>
      <li>They are rather large for a kids head.</li>
      <li>would be fun for a party or luau, but I was hoping for something to wear at a tropical themed wedding, so I will look for something a little more formal.</li>
      <li>They arrived well within the expected time and after straightening them from shipping, they were absolutely adorable.</li>
      <li>I wanted to give these to my Girls to wear,however,I ended up using them to add to Birthday Cards, as well as clipping them onto the ribbons as an added accessory on packages,This idea went  over very well!&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
      <li>They also came very smushed in the packaging.</li>
      <li>Flowers came really really wringled and smashed.  </li>
      <li>Everyone loved them, and we can definitely reuse them for any other Hawaiian themed events.</li>
      <li>These flowers look great in her hair and are small enough that she can wear 2 at a time if she wants.</li>
      <li>Overall, not bad, but not what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Flimsy cheap and not nearly as voluminous as shown!!  </li>
      <li>Would only recommend they look a little more realistic - but for a party or a show on stage, they do the trick!</li>
      <li>I took a chance and purchased these and was pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>If you are looking g for a pretty plastic clip with a silk flower, about same texture as silk leis, then this is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>If you want this for a luau it would for fine, but not for everyday fashion.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they were really crumpled up in the bag.</li>
      <li>You have to really work them to get back their shape.</li>
      <li>Some of them I pulled out the center flower and made it just 2 flowers because they wouldn&#x27;t shape right</li>
      <li>They look extremely cheap and there is no way I would wear them in public than anything other than a costume party.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and the flowers are big.</li>
      <li>When given the task of making 140 flower hair clips for our church&#x27;s Mother Daughter Banquet/Luau, I had a hard time finding single flowers and the thought of making them by hand was overwhelming.</li>
      <li>The main problem was they were just too big to wear as a side flower, but probably would work if you wore them at the back of your head next to a bun.  </li>
      <li>so you really don&#x27;t know they are clips, so you can use them on the table, or clip to a table clothe, some other decorations...</li>
      <li>But, they did look cheap, and I would not recommend them for a serious luau.</li>

<li> Some reviews stated that they were crushed when jammed into the packaging, were too thin of fabric, and the flowers popped off.  </li>
<li> These are the most terrible quality on the planet!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All wrinkled and squished upon arrival. Flowers look pretty cheap but that&#x27;s sorta what I expected for price. decent but not as nice as in pictures.</li>
    <li> These hair clips were really cute and 6 weeks later I still see girls from the party wearing the flowers to school.</li>
    <li> would be fun for a party or luau, but I was hoping for something to wear at a tropical themed wedding, so I will look for something a little more formal.</li>
    <li> Really really big, I don&#x27;t like wearing them and neither do my girls</li>
    <li> Flimsy, but colorful.</li>
    <li> The flowers were way to huge. Looks ridiculous in the hair because of the size. Plus, they look very cheap and tacky.</li>
    <li> Flowers came really really wringled and smashed.  The price was reasonable, but the condition wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> These flowers look excellent in the hair. The variety of colors is playful and the clips don&#x27;t fall out at all from your hair. Would only recommend they look a little more realistic - but for a party or a show on stage, they do the trick!</li>
    <li> I went to Hawaii and while there purchased 2 silk hibiscus hair clips that I really liked.  When I got home I gave them to my granddaughters.  A few weeks later I realized I would like to wear one with my Hawaii dress and tried to purchase one on Amazon.  I couldn&#x27;t find the exact ones and thought these would be close.  They arrived all smashed together in a small bag and I took them out and tried to smooth them.  I even glued the petals together at the edges, and that helped a little.  The main problem was they were just too big to wear as a side flower, but probably would work if you wore them at the back of your head next to a bun.  They did make pretty table decorations at a meeting :)</li>
    <li> While these are pretty, they came crammed in a small bag and in a mess.  I&#x27;m having to iron them and on some of them use starch just to straighten them out. A few of the petels couldn&#x27;t be straightened out and just hung limp over the stem. Some of them I pulled out the center flower and made it just 2 flowers because they wouldn&#x27;t shape right, you couldn&#x27;t see the extra hole where I pulled it out. The extra ones I pull out I&#x27;ll sew by hand on a better barrette. The barrette it comes with is a cheap plastic one. Not like the foam ones that have a nice metal clip (and stays on better).</li>
    <li> These came squished together In a small bag. I laid them out on a table for a week before a luau party and they were still fairly crunched up. I bought them for a 7 year olds beach luau. They are rather large for a kids head. They looked better on an adult. They look much smaller in the picture then they are. The kids loved them anyway. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size. It all worked out. Cute cheap party favor.</li>
    <li> The material is very cheap not attractive at all i was inspecting better quality and material on this flowers on the pic they look nice but they are not nice at all</li>
    <li> Used these for a Hawaiian theme Baby shower.  And the ladies loved them, they continue to wear them with other outfits.&lt;br /&gt;My 3 year old daughter loved them as well had to buy another back so she can get all the colors for every outfit possible.  Loved them functional adornment for dress or shirt.</li>
    <li> these were a hit at the bachelorette/bachelor party with a hawaiian theme.  all the girls really liked them. fyi:  they are kind of big</li>
    <li> These were a huge hit at the Luau that my church hosted. They looked adorable in everyone&#x27;s hair and even stayed in very short hair.  Everyone loved them, and we can definitely reuse them for any other Hawaiian themed events.</li>
    <li> Well, you get what you pay for! No complaints for a fun Luau, but I wanted them for my bridesmaids&#x27; hair. Haha they were HUGE!!! Had to go with another type of flower, but I will probably use them for a themed party. They also came very smushed in the packaging. You have to really work them to get back their shape. Overall, not bad, but not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about these at all. They look to fake. And now I don&#x27;t know what to do with them.</li>
    <li> Not enough flower to cover the hair clip. Flowers are not well placed on the clips. I do not like them.</li>
    <li> The flowers spring into shape and have a nice long clip that attaches well to my hair. Great product for my chorus.</li>
    <li> Really cute! Great value for the price!  My daughter loves wearing these. The clips go in her hair nicely without tangling.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is part hippy child.  She wears flowers all the time .  These flowers look great in her hair and are small enough that she can wear 2 at a time if she wants.</li>
    <li> These are the most terrible quality on the planet!  Cheesy kids gift bag flowers if that, or a stupid hawaiian party that you don&#x27;t care if they fall off.  I have bought children&#x27;s flowers, hair thingy&#x27;s and this just doesn&#x27;t cut it even for her dress-up box!&lt;br /&gt;PASS ON THESE!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace one I lost for my girlfriend and they almost cover her entire head. If you want this for a luau it would for fine, but not for everyday fashion.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are great.  They look pretty just laying on the table.  They are bigger than I expected.  After you fluff them out, they are great.  The clips are long, I would say longer than a bobbie pin.  The flowers cover them up so you really don&#x27;t know they are clips, so you can use them on the table, or clip to a table clothe, some other decorations...and if the gals/guys, boys/girls, feel festive...wala...in your hair.  I wish I would have gotten another dozen!</li>
    <li> The coloring is so much better in person than in the picture. These are great clips and stay in hair even with a lot of movement.</li>
    <li> Cheap &amp; came all crumpled</li>
    <li> Used these in school play. Were good size and plenty in shipment in case one got lost. You know how quick those costume changes can be :)</li>
    <li> The pictures look WAY better then in real life.  They look extremely cheap and there is no way I would wear them in public than anything other than a costume party.</li>
    <li> These were put in my daughters goodie bags. The other girls loved them. But, they did look cheap, and I would not recommend them for a serious luau.</li>
    <li> I bought these, a bag from Oriental Trading, and a couple individual ones from Party City. The Party City ones were almost $4 each and of course the best of the three. But these are really nice for the price. They have three flowers on each clip. The clips stay in your hair and they were quite lovely. They came all smooshed in a bag but popped up quickly with out much fuss. The colors are vibrant and the flowers are big. They are really nice and the price is excellent ($7.97). The Oriental Trading ones were the pits but with a bit of water I got them to look nice. I&#x27;m sure they will be a hit at my daughters November luau party. I would purchase these again!</li>
    <li> Picture is NOT what you&#x27;re getting. Flimsy cheap and not nearly as voluminous as shown!!  These clips would only work for a party for girls under the age of 6 or 7</li>
    <li> When given the task of making 140 flower hair clips for our church&#x27;s Mother Daughter Banquet/Luau, I had a hard time finding single flowers and the thought of making them by hand was overwhelming. When I reviewed all premade clips online, I finally chose these because of the color variety and multi-toned pedals. Some reviews stated that they were crushed when jammed into the packaging, were too thin of fabric, and the flowers popped off.  Buying in bulk for such an inexpensive cost I would expect them to be jammed and maybe a little thinner than stems from the craft store. I took a chance and purchased these and was pleasantly surprised! I dumped them all out on the table and fluffed each one up. Not one flower popped off! They stayed in everyone&#x27;s hair just fine! Hibiscus flowers have thin, flowing pedals anyway so I feel they looked just beautiful. Definitely a hit of the party!</li>
    <li> i orderd these flowers for my daughter,s hawwaaian party and we loved it , they are so cut and coloerfull</li>
    <li> These make great luau party favors. They are not high quality, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, these are not for you. If you are looking g for a pretty plastic clip with a silk flower, about same texture as silk leis, then this is what you&#x27;re looking for. Comes with 2  of each of the 6 colors</li>
    <li> I wanted to give these to my Girls to wear,however,I ended up using them to add to Birthday Cards, as well as clipping them onto the ribbons as an added accessory on packages,This idea went  over very well!&lt;br /&gt;so its all good.</li>
    <li> they came flat but a little bit of swishing the tops and they were fine. The kids love them and they are easy for the kids to put in their own haie themselves.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift and as soon as they arrived I shipped them back because I would have been embarrassed to give them away.  They looked like something you would buy at a dollar store.</li>
    <li> Clips are easy to use. The flowers are kind of flat(maybe from shipping) but to get a nice full flower we clipped 3 together.</li>
    <li> I found these clip here at the lowest price anywhere. They arrived well within the expected time and after straightening them from shipping, they were absolutely adorable. We had a luau themed baby shower for a niece and her husband who are expecting their first child (very excited) and these were worn by the hostesses and the mommy to be as a way to make them easily identifiable to the 60 plus guests!</li>
    <li> I got the clips as expected. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they were really crumpled up in the bag. You&#x27;ll have to lay them out for a bit to regain their shape prior to using.</li>
    <li> for mothers day it was a great gift to all mothers, they all wore them proudly and thanked me for the great gift</li>
    <li> We passed these out, along with luaus, to guests to celebrate an engagement proposal that took place in Hawaii.  They were a big hit and they looked wonderful, especially in photos.</li>
