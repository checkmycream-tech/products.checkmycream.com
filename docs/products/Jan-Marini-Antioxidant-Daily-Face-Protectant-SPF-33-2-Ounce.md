<li> /&gt;She got it from an expensive salon, as part of an expensive facial treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s and have been using Jan Marini Antioxidant Daily Face Protectant SPF 30 for probably 5 years. I love it. My skin is oily in the T-zone and normal elsewhere and this feels wonderful when I apply it and never feels greasy or heavy. This is a super-easy way to protect your face from sun year-round. Pump makes it easy to use and get the right amount.</li>
    <li> The product is \\&quot;excellent\\&quot; however, the price is way too expensive....  You only get 2 ounces &amp; unfortunately after you apply to your face, neck &amp; chest area....it is short lived. I can&#x27;t recall if it was $30. or $40.00, that&#x27;s a lot for 2 ounces!  No deal here folks.    I received product quickly, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I first was introduced to Jan Marini through a doctor where I worked.  It was the BEST product ever for my daughter&#x27;s acne and sensitive skin.  I use the Face Protectant SPF 30 every day, as well as the cleanser.  I was just DELIGHTED&lt;br /&gt;to find it on E-bay, for a lower cost!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick with no problems. The items were packaged properly. I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. It smells and feels great. Gives you a matte finish and a product you want to apply all the time. Doesnt burn like some sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and don&#x27;t see a change in my future.  I have tried other products, but keep returning to this product.  It goes on smooth, is not greasy, has great staying power.  It seems to have worked, as I have few wrinkles, and get compliments on my unlined face at 56 years old.  It even works on tropical vacations when I am in the water or outside for extended times.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer every single day - no question. Even if it&#x27;s humid, raining, snowing, etc., I will use it. It never comes off, and it&#x27;s great for your skin also because of the SPF. Not to mention - it smells incredible! It leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed, and it&#x27;s not heavy or oily feeling at all. Have and will continue to recommend to everyone I know for daily use.</li>
    <li> The Jan Marini antioxidant sunscreen is hands down the best facial sunscreen I have ever used. My esthetician recommended it for me 5 years ago, and I have never gone back to another sunscreen. It is not greasy like other sunscreens, but it still goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling silky. I usually hate the smell of sunscreen, however Jan Marini&#x27;s product has a quite a pleasant pineapple fragrance that seems to mask the offensive sunscreen odors. My only complaint is that it is quite expensive, but I&#x27;ve come to realize that it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> After applying this stuff, my GF&#x27;s face became red and blotchy. It made her eyes water so badly that she had to stop driving. Her skin got dry and flaky, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She got it from an expensive salon, as part of an expensive facial treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took several days for her skin to return to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend you consult a dermatologist if you intend to use this product, and that you try it on a small area of skin before committing to its use.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! Amazing!!! Non-greasy feel, I actually don&#x27;t have a shiny face when using this product, amazing! And I do not get acne or redness either when using. I highly recommend. I used to use the one from Trader Joe&#x27;s but that one leaves me shiny and has only spf 15.</li>
    <li> I love how this lotion smells and feels on my face.  Very moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product, alone, under makeup and even alone, for at least 5 years. It makes my skin feel refreshed. My friends tell me it makes me appear more youthful. Well, that&#x27;s a plus at any price. This is very affordable as well and lasts a long time. Word of caution though, like any SPF product, don&#x27;t apply anywhere near or above the eye, like the lid. It burns if you sweat or rub your eye.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it got a #1 ranking on some website. It is okay. Lightweight and non-oily. It has pleasant smell which eventually goes away. I have not determined how effective it is. For years I have used Neutrogena (+50 SPF and above) . I use this one mainly under makeup when I am going out.</li>
    <li> I love the way it glides on the face without being sticky or leaving a white residue.  Absorbs quickly and does not leave a shine on the face.  Sun protection to SPF30.  Made in the USA.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer spf for face that I&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s lightweight, goes on smoothly with no white residue, and keeps your face feeling moisturized for the whole day!  Love, love this product!  Thanks Jan Marini for making the AOX Daily Face Protectant SPF 30 Pump!</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever. Entire family uses this. Has an amazing light pineapple scent. No greasy sunscreen feel. Wear daily and look forward to applying it.</li>
    <li> I only use her products! This makes your face so soft and glow so healthy and is an amazing sunblock do it fighs wrinkles and free radicals. If you havent tried this or her other products do yourself a favor and try them. The seller I buy from often as the prices are great and the items always come on time and in perffect condition.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking from the other reviews that it would be the best thing since sliced bread. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I am a long time user of jan marini products but I&#x27;m starting to lose faith in the brand. It also creates this very oil film on my face that feels awful. The perfect spf search continues.</li>
    <li> I received my package on time. But I wish the shelf life of the product is bit more longer. The date at the bottom is Jan 2015. In the past I have&lt;br /&gt;dates longer than a year.</li>
