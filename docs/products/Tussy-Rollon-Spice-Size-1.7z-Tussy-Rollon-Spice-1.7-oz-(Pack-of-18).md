<li> What&#x27;s there bad to say about tussy... except you can&#x27;t find it in stores any more!!</li>
<li> He has me order every year since he has sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
<li> This product has been consistently trustworthy in controlling under arm odors and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 40 years without fail.  </li>
<li> My wife, daughter and brother breakout under their arms with every other brand except Tussy</li>
<li> He recieves the shipment in a few day and is thankful to still have the option to order it.</li>
<li> It works, and does not cause any harsh rash</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed that this last box I ordered did not have an expiration date on the bottom to alert me of it&#x27;s shelf life because I ordered quite a few that should last me a year or so.</li>
<li> Not sure why</li>
<li> and I bought it here at an unbelievable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It is hard to find in stores and you will find that if they do carry it, it is often out of stock.....</li>
<li> As you can see, I didn&#x27;t mess around and purchased a pack of 18!!!</li>
<li> I recommend it, at least give it a try!</li>

    <li> What&#x27;s there bad to say about tussy... except you can&#x27;t find it in stores any more!! Fix that, and all would be good again!</li>
    <li> I think Tussy is great!  I began using my wife&#x27;s Tussy years ago when my &amp;#34;Men&#x27;s&amp;#34; stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was more readily available and miss bright red cap.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It works, and does not cause any harsh rash and I was so pleased that you had it.</li>
    <li> Needs to be produced again</li>
    <li> When my wife was growing up in the 1960&#x27;s Tussy was sold at every store in town.  But as the years went by fewer and fewer and fewer store&#x27;s continue to carry it.  I did some research and found out that it is now produced at a factory for hire which means you give the factory your formula and packaging and they will make it for you.  My wife, daughter and brother breakout under their arms with every other brand except Tussy so I buy it 18 at a time because the people selling this on line know that people need this so their prices are sky high.  When this was sold in the stores it sold for 99 cents.  Now they want up to $8+ per bottle.  The only fairly priced one were the package of 18.  They were delivered quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> This product I have been using since the 50&#x27;s and I got my daughters on it as well so very happy with the quantity and price.</li>
    <li> For me it gives protection all day.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for over 30 yrs! My Dad said It is was one of the safest deodorants to use, so we have used  this great  product since. I recommend it, at least give it a try!</li>
    <li> good product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Not sure why but this product is one of the only ones that works for me, been using it since I was a kid.</li>
    <li> My mother and grandmother used this deodorant also, it has a cult-like following! It is the only thing that works for me. They stopped selling it in stores about a year or two ago so I buy in bulk!</li>
    <li> I love Tussy deodorant.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 40 years.  I just wish I could still buy it in the stores and not just online.</li>
    <li> He has me order every year since he has sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use any other brand. He recieves the shipment in a few day and is thankful to still have the option to order it.</li>
    <li> A product my 90 year old Mother was use to using.  Good product, works for her.  When the company sent a cream instead of a roll-on, they quickly sent the correct product and told us to keep the cream (pack of 18)which I have since donated to a local Women&#x27;s Shelter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would deal with company again.</li>
    <li> Just like the original!</li>
    <li> People think I am crazy but this stuff really is the best you can find! Great anti-perspirant and deodorant roll-on. It is hard to find in stores and you will find that if they do carry it, it is often out of stock..... That is because people who know how great it is, buy it up. As you can see, I didn&#x27;t mess around and purchased a pack of 18!!! I have 2 boys and I can honestly say they are not at all stinky!</li>
    <li> Tussy is not sold at local stores any more.This product is good for sensitive skin and works well. Can&#x27;t beat the price..</li>
    <li> She makes me order this for her about every 6 months.  And she is very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It is all she will use and she says it&#x27;s very good and very good with her sensitive skin, too.</li>
    <li> Best deordorant I have ever used and I bought it here at an unbelievable price.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even buy this in my town any longer.</li>
    <li> This product has been consistently trustworthy in controlling under arm odors and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 40 years without fail.  I was a little disappointed that this last box I ordered did not have an expiration date on the bottom to alert me of it&#x27;s shelf life because I ordered quite a few that should last me a year or so.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Been using it for 60-ish years.  Please keep it available for order since it is not available in stores.</li>
