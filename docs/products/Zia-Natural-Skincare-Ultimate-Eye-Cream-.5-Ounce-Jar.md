      <li>The jar doesn&#x27;t last long if you use it both day and night, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.  </li>
      <li>Be aware that the other reviewers have only reviewed ZIA products and therefore may not be impartial.    </li>
      <li>A thick and rich cream with a relatively neutral scent.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for years, and love it. I hope Zia doesn&#x27;t discontinue it, like they have with a couple of other great products they used to make before Hain bought out the company (the bath salts and body butter).</li>
    <li> Used this prroduct for about 3 months. Did not find it demished lines but was very rich but not greasy. Great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream ever.  I have used it for years and although I have tried many others, I keep coming back to this one.  Expensive, but worth it.  My eyes breathe a sigh of relief whenever I use it!</li>
    <li> both jars were old and the moisturizer was dried up.  I was able to put the contents of the jars together and form 1 jar.  UGH! an expensive (one) jar of eye cream.  Too bad because I LOVE this cream for Colorado and it is hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> this is excellent eye cream - moisturizing but not greasy. does not irritate eyes and makes a difference in the overall appearance of the skin. zia products are incredible.</li>
    <li> Be aware that the other reviewers have only reviewed ZIA products and therefore may not be impartial.    Sad.</li>
    <li> This eye creme is so lovely -velvety to the touch, with a light &amp; elegant  scent, it delivers loads of moisture to my over 50 delicate eye area.  I apply it under sunscreen each morning and after cleansing at night.  I cannot imagine having to use another product since I discovered Zia about 2 months ago.  In my opinion, this is the best emollient eye creme on the market today.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, natural.  I&#x27;m asked to keep ordering it, so it must be good</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye cream. Not the least of which is because of the smell. It seems expensive but the one little container lasts me almost a year (using once a day every night) so it is well worth it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years so it is hard to know how effective it is, I&#x27;d have to compare myself to an identical twin or something. But I love it.</li>
    <li> A thick and rich cream with a relatively neutral scent.  Provides great emollients and moisture for under the eyes.  Seems to help prevent wrinkles and dark circles, but I don&#x27;t think it reduces puffiness.  I&#x27;ve used this eye creme for many years but would like to know if there&#x27;s a better cream out there that does all this one does and also reduces puffiness.</li>
    <li> BEST undereye cream ever.  It&#x27;s a shame that the company stopped making it.  Noticeable reduction in lines under my eyes.  Definitely makes one look younger.  Hope they bring it back!</li>
    <li> They stopped making it! I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never thought moisturizers or creams actually improved the current state of my skin.  I just thought I was slowing further damage.  But this stuff has really gotten rid of some wrinkles.  The jar doesn&#x27;t last long if you use it both day and night, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.  I haven&#x27;t used a Zia product I didn&#x27;t end up loving or at least liking.</li>
    <li> Received my order on 11/5/2011, but its expiration date - as marked at the bottom of the box -- is 09/11. Two months past the product expiration date!!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using Zia Natural Skincare products for more than 25 years and love every product I have used.  The Ultimate Eye Cream is a rich cream not oily, blends in great.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any reductions in crows feet but not sure other eye creams reduce crows feet.</li>
    <li> I can see and feel a difference.  A little pricey but it lasts a while.  I like their products a lot.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Over the top wonderful eye cream I&#x27;ve used for years.  The best at reducing slackness of the upper lid as well as minimizing crow&#x27;s feet. The PROBLEM is that twice now, I&#x27;ve tried to order this product through Amazon and either it was advertised as being available and it really wasn&#x27;t so my order was cancelled, or I received the product and it was so old &amp; dried out it was no longer a cream but more like a hard lip balm and not acceptable.  :(  Please don&#x27;t represent that you have this product available when you can&#x27;t follow through.  It&#x27;s so disappointing and frustrating.</li>
    <li> I am 41, and have been using this eye cream for years. I try different creams from time to time, but always come back to this one. It&#x27;s the only cream that gives me this kind of lift, especially on my eye lids, it&#x27;s no greasy, goes great under make-up, smells good.&lt;br /&gt;But the last order disappointed me, because the jars came in half-open, and the cream looked shrunk ,yellow, greasy - in other words it looked like it expired LONG time ago!!! I&#x27;ve send it back. Going to look somewhere else, because I still want the Cream itself!</li>
