<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for chapped lips.</li>
    <li> I have painfully dry lips all the time no matter what I use. This product is great it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy it just gets the job done. I started using this at the same time as I started using the Lush lip scrub and their Lip Service. Between the 3 items, I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied</li>
    <li> I use this on my lips. heels, and cuticles every night and it works wonders. Pleasant Rose smell not overpowering. Sometimes the oldest remedies remain the best!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  I have used it before, but it is now virtually impossible to find  in retail stores.</li>
    <li> This came really fast!!! The packaging was really protective! The only downfall was that it came melted, which was a bummer. But what do you expect?? It&#x27;s summer and there was nothing a little bit of blow drying and refrigerating couldn&#x27;t do... This is a great lip salve overall. It&#x27;s a classic! I love the scent and the consistency</li>
    <li> I remember this salve from when I was a child. I use it not only as a lip moisturizer, but also rub it into my cuticles to keep them soft. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, keeps lips moisturised all day and last forever.  Everyone needs to have one of these handy</li>
    <li> So I got this and first of all the box was huge and filled with packing paper...for one little tin of lip balm.  Yikes, can&#x27;t do any better than that with the packaging?  What a waste. Then, I cut off the little piece of shrink wrap around the edges of the tin...and some of the salve had leaked out, and so the tin was really slippery.  It took me about ten or fifteen minutes to try to get it open, because it&#x27;s a thin round tin, without a screw on lid like Carmex for instance. It was very awkward to hold on to and try to turn or pop the lid off...couldn&#x27;t get a decent grip on it.  If you have weak hands or wrists, or are arthritic...don&#x27;t even try this. Anyway, I finally got it open...much frustrated at this point.  It looks like pink vaseline, and smells like Ponds cold cream.  I put some on my lips which are always dry and chapped .  It wasn&#x27;t wonderful...it was just okay. Not sure the aggravation was worth it.</li>
    <li> Discovered this through a local beauty supply store and have used for years as lip balm (heal/prevent chapped lips) and a superior lip gloss without the sometimes ultra sticky and strong taste of other glosses.  Ordering from Amazon was way easier than going back to beauty supply store.  Highly recommend this product - tin lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Well I want to leave a good review because this stuff is fantastic but everything that could be said has been already said about this product. It&#x27;s very soothing, softening, and looks very natural and pretty.</li>
    <li> After hearing a lot of buzz about Rosebud Salve, I decided to finally give it a try.  The price was right, and I was very pleased with the salve.  It has a pleasant, moisturizing-but-not-overly-greasy texture, and the subtle rose scent is lovely and not at all overpowering.  I mainly use it on my lips, but also use it on dry skin patches.  A little goes a long way, so while it isn&#x27;t a huge amount, it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one issue is with the tin.  While it&#x27;s very cute and attractive, it&#x27;s very hard to open without having to use something to pry it open with every time.  Although I love the old-fashioned look of the tin, I may reluctantly try the tube version next time for convenience sake.  This is the only reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 rather than a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have expressed concern about dipping a finger into the tin, frankly I would think it would be even more unsanitary to rub a solid stick balm over your lips time after time.  To each her own, but it doesn&#x27;t worry me.</li>
    <li> On my Christmas list this year was Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve. I had read so many good reviews on this product magazines and really wanted to try it and I am so glad I have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on smooth without being greasy or feeling like it is caked on.  I have also used it on my cuticles, which is great especially in the winter months in the Midwest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying it I sometimes feel like I should be sitting outside at a Parisian cafe with large sunglasses and hat!  I  will warn if you are sensitive to smell this does have a mixture of roses and baby powder smell.  I think it is great but the smell might not be for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have chapped lips, rough cuticles or rough patches of skin I would highly recommend getting this product! There is a reason this has been a popular product in their line since 1892 and is a favorite of many celebrities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of it the fact you are putting your finger it in over and over.

    <li> Not too bad it is so so.</li>
    <li> A must have for my night stand ;)</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, wish It had more natural ingredients, but it does give a nice shine to lips. Prefer to buy Aubrey organics lip balm, cheaper and better quality.</li>
    <li> Great, it met my expectation! Thx</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s a lip lifesaver and has a faint but delicious smell.</li>
    <li> It was a faint smell of roses , and with it after the winter will not dry up</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy for a few minutes when you put, but it works well.</li>
    <li> This salve is the best!  Sooths the skin.</li>
    <li> I placed an add-on order for one Rosebud Salve lip balm and when I received the package there was NO PRODUCT in the shipping container.  Trying to get in touch with them to request a replacement or credit has been IMPOSSIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware, placing an order for this product as an add-on item doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that you&#x27;ll actually receive the item!</li>
    <li> My grandparents used this when I was a young girl I was so happy to find it again,  It us such an amazing product.  I am so glad to have found it,</li>
    <li> This formula is good, lives up to it&#x27;s claims, but I do not care for the smell.  It smells more like hair pomade than roses, and once it is gone I will not reorder.  If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, the salve really heals cracked skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use if for my lips, cuticles, and on blemishes. You know when a zit has passed and you have a dry spot of red skin that is still healing over? This is great for that and I think it helps it heal faster. I&#x27;ve even put it on a peeling sunburn. It&#x27;s just a really great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used up every bit of my first tin and am now on my second (and it lasted me several years, by the way). I also have a strawberry scented one, but the original is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love Rosebud Salve. Use it for everything.</li>
    <li> Really like this for multiple uses. I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
    <li> I had looked forward to trying this, as I&#x27;ve found some older products much better than new ones. As far as feel went, it was wonderfully moisturizing and long-lasting. However, it is a petroleum jelly base, which I knew, and as my nose is very senstive, I found I didn&#x27;t care for the scent, even though it worked quite well. I wound up giving it to a friend who absolutely loves it and isn&#x27;t bothered by the scent.</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as i wanted but, its pretty good</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, thank you.</li>
    <li> I love the slight tint and feel on my lips. I love how sturdy the tin is, I can just throw it in my purse without worrying about it opening or bending.</li>
    <li> I was expecting some miracle working lip balm, it isn&#x27;t that but it is still a great product. I love how it left my lips!</li>
    <li> Everyone seems to love Rosebud, so I had high expectations for the product. While the salve does a decent job at moisturizing, I couldn&#x27;t get past the overly strong rose scent, and honestly didn&#x27;t feel that it was the &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; item people made it out to be.</li>
    <li> too greasy...doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin.</li>
    <li> Great for lips and dry hands. Plus the rose fragrance is not overpowering like with many other rose scented products. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> leaves the lips soft and smooth with a hint of shine.</li>
    <li> Terrible taste threw it away immediately! YUCK!</li>
    <li> The best lip, elbow, knee, &amp; dry patches balm I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells it much cheaper than Bath &amp; Body Works, so I got 2 for the price of one at the store!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and will definitely buy again. I use it as an every day lip balm and also to distribute lip liner throughout my lips. Smells great. It&#x27;s melted into its cap a couple of times (hot and humid Midwest summer weather) and I just pop the tin into the oven for about 20 minutes, then move it to the fridge and it is good as new.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I used to have a problem with cracked lips, especially during the winter. I use this every night and no cracked lips!</li>
    <li> My dried winter lips are feeling much better now! :) I read so much about this stuff and kept seeing it at bath and bodyworks but tried it through amazon. It helped my lips out the weird thing is I&#x27;m not a rose fan, just not my flower but the product is good and it comes in alittle  tin.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had seen people use it, and it was highly rated here. When I used it, I liked the texture. It was rather perfume-y and  it really did smell like rosebud which I&#x27;m not crazy about. However, when I went to bed I was wondering &amp;#34;what smells like an old lady?&amp;#34; only for it to dawn on me it was the balm. Disappointing. Wont be buying again. Did not notice any help in the area of moisturizing either.</li>
    <li> This salve is great stuff!  I&#x27;m going to make it a standard in my cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> Mine smells exactly like baby powder. So it reminds me of babies and changing diapers.  I wanted it to smell like roses. I love the tin and find it easy to open. It really does look like pink Vaseline. It feels lighter on though. Not happy about the baby powder scent, so I threw mine out.</li>
    <li> Best ointment ever for dry rough cuticles! Especially when paired with L&#x27;Occitane Shea Hand Cream. Magically repairs the roughness instantly. Also use as a lip balm and dry skin spot treatment.</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews and I don&#x27;t understand how this tin is hard to open? I got it off just fine. I like to use this before I go to sleep and when I wake up in the morning. Keeps my lips nice and moisturized. I use a moisturizing lip balm during the day because I feel like this stuff is too heavy duty and glossy looking for all day use. I do love it though and definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This salve is a miracle worker (even my kids ask for it).  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen, which would make it perfect in my opinion.  Great as a lipgloss, dry skin remedy, and pimple cream.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this for my lips. Nice consistency...like a very light vaseline with no icky smell. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, I use it on my lips, cuticles (fingers and toes) and little dry patches wherever. Must have in the winter, but light enough for year round.</li>
    <li> I purchased this rose salve because it is so much cheaper than the one in the red tin. I expected them to be identical (as I shouldn&#x27;t have...clearly they are two different products by different companies) and at first I was disappointed with the texture. The rose salve in the red tin is much glossier, and that is one thing I liked most about it. This one is more of a balm. Now that my previous expectations had been set aside I decided to continue using it because I love the way this salve feels on my lips. It is much smoother and more soothing than the one in the red tin. It has a slightly different smell as well but I find it to be quite pleasant. I think this product is hands-down the winner because of its MUCH more reasonable price. If you are a rose salve lover, give it a chance, but don&#x27;t expect it to be identical to the one in the red tin (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re used to).</li>
    <li> I did not see that it was any different than Vaseline. Was not what I was looking for in helping chapped lips</li>
    <li> I bought one of these guys at Sephora on a whim, but in minted rose. I have had it for a good 1.5 years and I THINK I&#x27;ve used half of it. I put it on every night before bed and first thing after moisturizer in the AM. Just bought 2 more - one for my mom and one for my fiancé!</li>
    <li> This little tin lasts forever.  I love how smooth it goes on my lips and how my lips feel afterwards.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great lip balm, especially for nighttime use. I have been using it for a couple of years every night at bedtime and have not experienced dry, cracked lips since I found the product.</li>
    <li> Really wasn&#x27;t too sure about petrolatum-based product, but glad I tried this salve! My lips were extremely chapped and kept peeling, so I needed something heavier to protect the skin from further drying. I applied it after cleansing in the morning, and in the evening while relaxing, also right before bedtime. It did the trick, within 3-4 days the chapped skin had healed! It&#x27;s small enough to tuck inside my makeup bag. Lips appear very shiny so I do not recommend wearing this outdoors because of increased risk of sunburm (no SFP). Thank you, Rosebud Salve.</li>
    <li> The product is great.  getting the lid off, however, is almost impossible.  I recently bought it in a tube instead.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s lips get terribly chapped. This is the best product I have found for his lips. It also works on my dry hands.</li>
    <li> I grabbed this from my local store. What a waste of $6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much pink vaseline. When I put it on my lips, my lips dry out within minutes. I don&#x27;t much care for it on the back of my hands, either. It&#x27;s a pretty worthless item.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not a bad product. it&#x27;s nice and moisturizing so I guess it fulfills it&#x27;s purpose. I&#x27;m not a fan of using my finger to smear it on my lips though. But I guess I knew that too before buying it. The manufacturers should make it in a chapstick form. That would certainly be nice</li>
    <li> I agree, this does not last long. It smells great and the tin is pretty! But for reference, I attend 6 1-hour-long periods at school each day, and I need to apply a thick-ish layer of this at the start of each class. Which isn&#x27;t too bad or bothersome. It just smells SO GOOD. And the tin is so hipster, people may think it&#x27;s antique. Actually someone once asked me if it was shoe polish, but never mind that. It works really well for the short time that it lasts, and if you apply it every hour like I do, your lips feel soft and tight. Not dry-tight, but like, idk. They feel like you have naturally soft lips but you know you don&#x27;t. Will buy again once it runs out.</li>
    <li> I recently had a problem with very irritated, chapped lips. I went to my trusty Amazon store to see what others recommended. I live by the reviews here and decided to try the Rosebud Salve. I believe it completely healed my lips within a week of using it. I keep it with me now, always. It has a slight rose smell that is very pleasant to me. I also use shea butter on my lips, but the shea did not heal my lips when they were very sore. Only the Rosebud Salve was handled well during that tender period. I can use the shea butter on my lips now, to maintain, but I still use the Rosebud Salve throughout the day. Really good stuff.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t EVER buy ANYTHING else for your lips.  Once I tried this miracle in a tin, I could not appreciate any other balms.</li>
    <li> I was initially able to pull the lid off, but now it refuses to come off! That being said, I still like the tin itself, so I leave it out as a decorative piece.  Just wish I could use it :)</li>
    <li> Awesome for all of the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chapped lips&lt;br /&gt;-Dry cuticles&lt;br /&gt;-pimples&lt;br /&gt;-Parch skin&lt;br /&gt;-Rashes&lt;br /&gt;-Eyebrow tamer&lt;br /&gt;-Skin Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;-Bug Bites</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has a nice delicate scent and it is a great all-in-one product.  I use it on my lips to moisturize them, on my hands to soften them, and I rub some into my hair to smooth flyaways.  I like to keep this at my desk at work to use throughout the day.  Definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what I was expecting but I thought this salve was just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; . I guess I wanted it to stay longer on my lips than the traditional type of gloss. Comes off easily but does provide shine. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> This works well to moisturize (similar to vaseline consistency but better) and I like the rose scent.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My only negative comment would be that the packaging/can is difficult to open at times.  That&#x27;s the only reason I may not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 15+ years and it&#x27;s always been a staple. A great multi-purpose to keep stashed in my bag, around the house, or in the car. I use it daily on my lips but it&#x27;s a MUST for travel! Road trips or plane rides, this is great around my eyes and areas prone to fine lines when sitting for a long period of time in super dry air. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all! I&#x27;ve used it on sunburns and wind chapped skin as well, it&#x27;s truly a classic! Such a great price here on Amazon too--it&#x27;s double the price at most retail shops like Sephora!</li>
    <li> I really like this salve.  It&#x27;s got a nice color and a pleasant smell to it.  I&#x27;ve noticed that some chapsticks will actually have the opposite effect, and will dry my lips out after a period of time.  This salve doesn&#x27;t seem to do that.  If you put it on before bed, you will wake up with soft, baby-like lips.  My only complaint is that, while the tin quite aesthetically pleasing, sometimes it can be difficult to open.  There have been times I&#x27;ve given up on putting this on my lips just because I couldn&#x27;t get into the tin.  But overall a great product!</li>
    <li> Just ordered this based on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s consist is Vaseline.  I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> True to it&#x27;s claims of being a great salve for dry skin. Going to try some to calm down wild dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love the rose fragrance. Container is compact enough to take it in my purse.  Works really well on my chapped lips.  Admire this company and the history behind it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and still the BEST on the market!</li>
    <li> I use this at night and it works great.  I ran out and my lips started flaking.  Now that I have started using this again they have stopped.</li>
    <li> I rotate out a few different lip balms. I love the rosebud salve because I have a soft spot in my heart for rose scented products. The salve is a pinkish color, but it doesn&#x27;t really show when wearing the product on the lips.  I like that this product stays on the lips throughout the night too. I am a mouth breather when I sleep, so I have often wake up with chapped lips. I&#x27;ve been using Smith&#x27;s for a few years, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever throw it out of my rotation.</li>
    <li> I gave 3 sets of salve and lip gloss as thank you gifts in a mesh bag.  Loved the little tins they were in and the great smell and feel on the lips.  good product.</li>
    <li> So I got suckered into buying this by all the celebrity and magazine hype. Overall it smell very nice and the container is sweet and compact, but the formula is so so. It actually makes my lips almost dry feeling after it dries up on my lips. it works great as cuticle cream as well.  I do think it is great for little girls and their chapped lips. We use it on my niece and she loves it, probably the smell and but of rose tint makes her happy</li>
    <li> Since it is basically made of oil, it can preserve your skin from dryness. But my skin is oil type, so it is probably not good for my skin.</li>
    <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewer said it tends to be gone fairly quick but i don&#x27;t mind...it smells so nice.  Not overpowering like other product, it really smells like subtle rose essential oil.  Also the vintage looking tin is super cute!  I am planning to buy few more and give away as a gift.</li>
    <li> Of all my beauty items, Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve is the most used and loved. Not only is this for dry lips, it&#x27;s a great addition to your first aid kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it works better than anything on the market, including Aquaphor, to keep lips moisturized. Just know this lip salve doesn&#x27;t contain an SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Smith&#x27;s for flyaway hairs, burns, cuts,and as a spot moisturizer in a pinch. Once a week I put a light swipe over my eyelashes to keep them conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price can&#x27;t be beat $4 - $6 per tin depending on retailer.</li>
    <li> Love it so much!!!! It&#x27;s much better than Burts and Bees. Like the color, like the smell, and better for the lip and long lasting. I will definitely order it next time.</li>
    <li> My lips feel so great after using this! I put it on before bed and in the morning my lips still feel great! I truly love this!</li>
    <li> I use this on my hands at night and on dry skin.  I am happy with the help it gives my cuticles and hands.  I’ve had none of those painful cracks on my finger nails.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing. It really moisturizes my lips much better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. Unfortunately, the can was a bit crushed upon delivery.</li>
    <li> I saw the great reviews and thought I&#x27;d try this product. I like tinted balm and a multi use product is appealing. The tin is a generous size for the price...almost as big as powder compact. I have difficulty get this lid off. It&#x27;s shallow, so can&#x27;t reasonably grab the base. I&#x27;ve tried pressing down on one side of the lid in hopes it will pop up opposite, but no luck. It&#x27;s aggravating to have to fiddle with it every time. And the smell....ugh.  It has an old fake rose smell. Stars are retained on this rating because petroleum works on my lips, and I like the rosy tint. I leave it at my work desk and use it on my lips, cuticles, and hair frizzies. It works and you get a lot of product in the tin. I won&#x27;t buy it again, though, because I find the smell extremely unappealing.  Perhaps I got a bad one?</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s not watery, and it WORKS! It&#x27;s shape makes it easy to find in my huge purse (definitely a plus), and it&#x27;s made sturdily enough that it doesn&#x27;t open in my purse or pocket. It does get a bit melty if it&#x27;s in my pocket for too long, but it still works well! Definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this salve for keeping your lips moist and chap free.  I have heard of others using it on other areas as part of their beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Great when your lips get dry during winter! Very moisturising. Makes a nice lip gloss, too. You could probably also use it as a sort of cream blush.</li>
    <li> I use this nightly on my lips and they haven&#x27;t chapped and have stayed smooth.  It&#x27;s convenient to carry on trips.  I will definitely buy this again.  Great price as it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I must always have this in my bag . I use it on my lips, cuticles, and the tiniest amount rubbed into my hands. Have used this product for years. And of course the scent is great.</li>
    <li> The picture on the package isn&#x27;t as old-timey as the package, and the package itself looked cheap. After I saw it I was embarrassed to give it to someone as a holiday gift, so I put it in a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; box.</li>
    <li> I had chapped-lips problem for years and my lip skin is extremely sensitive to most lip balm brands. This product is perfect for me. I am not allergic to it. It sooth my lips and I do not even need to apply very often. I also use it as lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my lips, my hands, dry elbows, flyaway hair... too bad it doesn&#x27;t do windows too. I need to start buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> Dear, the product is very good I have been buying used, thank you for your enthusiastic service, I would be happy to get your help, will focus on these products. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> So smooth, so moisturizing, so necessary during this frigid winter.  I love the smell and the feel on my lips.  I also like to rub into the rough patches on my hands and fingers.  I will keep buying this!</li>
    <li> love it. protect Both my skin and my lips. Fast shopping too. It had a pleasant rose smell, I apply it everyday</li>
    <li> This salve is amazing! Not only does it make my lips baby soft, but it adds a beautiful natural pink to them.  I have been using it for about three weeks and I have barely used much of the tin.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this cute little tin.  The salve goes on smooth, leave lips moisturized and I like the subtle tint.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great for chapped lips, great for dry hands. Plus, it smells great. Can&#x27;t get enough Rosebud. I keep buying it over and over.</li>
    <li> I found this through Amazon&#x27;s add on program.  I had never heard of it but thought I should give it a try.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  It is great for your dry lips, cuticles all kinds of stuff.  I now want to get more to give as little gifts to teachers and friends.  I highly recommend this.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other versions.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and feel of this product. I saw some reviews that said it was just a more expensive petroleum jelly but I don&#x27;t really agree. This is thinner so it feels a lot lighter on your lips. It also has a very faint tint and a nice, rosey smell. It protects in much the asme way as petroleum jelly but since it&#x27;s lighter, I prefer to use this on my lips. Still have petroleum jelly for when my skin is really cracked or dry in the winter (elbows especially, I think this product is too light for that area).</li>
    <li> So I discovered this lip balm about seven years ago. This is absolutely the best lip balm ever! It really softens my lips and moisturizes them very well.  I don&#x27;t even have to reapply it very often which I love. I use it every night before bed and usually once during the day. I also love the natural color it brings out in my lips. But this can also be used for so much more! I use it on my dry cuticles or if my kids  have a scratch this also helps with that. I have purchased this item over and over again because it truly is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> The tried and true perfume of Rosebud in the tin , an original .&lt;br /&gt;The tine can fit in a small space and be handy when you need it.</li>
    <li> Although it smells great and feels nice on the hands, this product did not deliver the emollient quality I had hoped for when used on lips and cuticles.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product works awesome for my really chapped lips. I take it with me everywhere! Definitely recommend. Works better than any of the other chap sticks I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> The hype for this product is overwhelming, years before and after I purchased this product. Of course the tin is adorable and tiny yet holds plenty of the actual product, however the salve itself isn&#x27;t too amazing. The smell was surely off-putting and, to me, had no correlation to a rose. The salve is also a little sticky when applied anywhere other than the lips--it&#x27;s basically just barely tinted petroleum jelly with a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having the product so long, I became pretty bored with it so I melted it down to satisfy my liking. I added a few drops of geranium and lavender essential oil to counteract the overbearing &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; smell, and I also melted in old lipsticks and tinted balms for more color. If you buy this and can&#x27;t stand it / think you have no use for it: just play around with it. The photo attached is my tin after completely changing it</li>
    <li> I like the salve.  I keep it on my bedside table and use it at night.  It feels good on my lips and has a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> It has been the best remedy for my family and me for over 75 years.  Wouldn&#x27;t ever want to be out.</li>
    <li> I keep this tin on my desk at work for easy access. This salve is perfect for where I live, as the dry climate often leads to easily chapped lips.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Container? Cute tin is larger than I like to carry; diameter&#x3D;2 quarters wide and, IMHO, more PIA to open than other lip products because of the size and need to &amp;#34;twist off&amp;#34; the lid.&lt;br /&gt;Content? Pretty pale pink salve.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients?&amp;#34;Trade secret blend&amp;#34; incl essential oils (organic?, which oils??), cottonseed oil (organic??), petroleum base&#x3D;soft vaseline. I get the secret proprietary blends but as consumers, we have to know what is going on our lips, thus swallowed re sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a nice  ~sticky (cat hair-pthipp!) thin gloss to lips that doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;It does not repair deeply chapped lips like Lypsyl, Carmex or even Eos (a bit dry).&lt;br /&gt;I use it on other dry irritated skin and it&#x27;s not superior to other products.&lt;br /&gt;One tin will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to be the next best thing to sliced bread...meh.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. However, the order I placed through this particular seller was IMPOSSIBLE to open. My husband had to open the tin with a screw driver it was so tight. The top lid was hammered on way too deep, making it impossible to get any grip on the tin. Thanks for the defective tin! I had to damage the tin just to get to the salve. Very frustrated. I&#x27;ve purchased several tins of this stuff in the past and never had an issue until now.</li>
    <li> Great for lips cuticles and burns or itches. Keep several in my purse house and desk! Inexpensive and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a great petroleum based salve. It&#x27;s wonderful to put on your lips and elbows before you go to bed, as you&#x27;ll wake up with them being incredibly soft. It has a light natural rose scent, so nothing over powering.</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning and before bed, and my lips have never been better. In the winter, my lips crack and split and become very painful. I used this and in just a few days I noticed a huge difference! The smell is very light in my opinion. If you do not like the smell of roses, than the smell may bother you. I, like many people, have noticed that the tin can be a bit problematic. If the lid goes at an angle when taking it off, it gets stuck and you have to re-close it and try again. I have noticed I have to lift the lid straight up or I find myself fighting with it for longer than I would like to. They also make this in a tube which I am going to try as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  I use it on my lips and cuticles after I am done putting on my make-up.  Love it!</li>
    <li> My Mom has been using this product all my life and then some. Now I use it along with our whole family. It is great!</li>
    <li> I  first got Rosebud Salve as a gift two years ago and I used mine a lot! Its great for everything, from dry lips to cuts. It smells nice too. It lasted so long, however the $8 price tag at Urban Outfitters seemed quite pricey so when I saw it on Amazon for $5.59, I was thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tin did arrive slightly dented but oh well, the product itself was in no way damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MUST HAVE!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. a little too strong of a scent but I like the way it goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> Rosebud Salve was listed in a magazine for one of the top ten balms for chapped lips.  It&#x27;s awesome, very inexpensive and it works great on all dry patches like elbows.  My Friends love it, but they have to get their own!</li>
    <li> This stuff has been around a very long time.  I tried it a few years ago, then gave some as stocking stuffers to family.  My mother has me buy this for her online at Amazon.  She uses it for everything and swears by it.  It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> exactly as described - leaves lips feeling soft without heavy, greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> This is my secret weapon against chapped lips. I used to get chapped, peeling lips every winter and the &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; products I used only seemed to make things worse. Not since I started using this balm. I put it on before I go to bed, and my lips stay moist and soft all year. Any time I find that my lips are drying out, I just reach for this balm, resume my nightly ritual, and my lips are healed within a day or two. I&#x27;ve gotten both my stepdaughters hooked on this product, too.</li>
    <li> After buying the salve from bath and body works I decided to give this brand a try. Bath and body work&#x27;s salve is much better and smells a lot nicer. This one is okay, but not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I use it as my lip salve and I like the rose red color and my lip feels good. But it&#x27;s too hard to open the cover. Actually I almost spend 3 or more mins to open it every time after I wash my face. At the very first time,my hand is not dry ,there&#x27;s some hand cream on my hand,then I want to open the tin,obviously I failed. So I know if I want to open it ,I must keep my hands dry.</li>
    <li> Ok quality.... Cheap with a whole jar of gel.... Do not like the smell though...... I think I&#x27;m not going to reperchase</li>
    <li> still has petroleum jelly in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an addict when it comes to lip balm/gloss.  This is so moisturizing and smells wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy like other types of balms. Stays smooth and keeps my lips nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Has nothing to do with rose at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very oily, leaves finger print on surface.&lt;br /&gt;Not good for lips, oily for the first several minutes and then dry as before use.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not pleasant. It seems that the maker tried very hard to make it smell like something old from drug store.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! I keep it in my purse and use it on my lips, cuticles and occasionally my dry winter hands.</li>
    <li> Wonderful great Product 5 stars does the job use it all the time on my lips twice a day and haven&#x27;t had any dry lips  this will always be in my hand bag</li>
    <li> a nice product, again i dont see what the big deal is about it but I do really enjoy using it on my lips and it makes them soft but so does vaseline.  I do enjoy it though</li>
    <li> Still using this.  Lasts a long time. Put on my lips daily.</li>
    <li> Love it! it has more of should I say &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; type of feel. It comes easily out of the tin and looks more like a lip gloss than a chapstick when on my lips. I love the smell and the color giving my lips some nice shine and color. Good for dry hands and elbows too! I keep it in my purse when in need and it never fails. The one star drop was because of the tin. I&#x27;m not the best at opening stuff, but if you have lotion on your hands or anything that would make your hands slightly slick, don&#x27;t even bother attempting to open this. It has an air seal and can be bothersome to open. Highly recommend though</li>
    <li> This is a time honored classic with good reason. I love this lip balm, and it can be used as a multi purpose salve on rough skin and even a diaper ointment. I love the light scent of the rose in it. The only down side is having to apply with your finger. Not always a convenient thing.</li>
    <li> Great Salve for any coldsores or spots. It clears up coldsores within hours.  I  was recommended this by a friend and wanted to stock up on it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Been using it for years and couldn&#x27;t be a bigger fan. The smell is delightful and mild, the tin is pretty and the balm lasts for a long time. I often give it as a small gift to friends. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been hearing about this stuff all year so I decided to add it to a purchase I was making.  It&#x27;s a good product but I wish the rose scent were a little stronger.  It&#x27;s very faint.  I tend to use it more for a cuticle moisturizer and dry patch salve as I&#x27;ve found that I wear it off my lips very quickly.</li>
    <li> I read all these wonderful reviews and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this stuff.  Good thing I didn&#x27;t pay much for it, because it&#x27;s about as average a lip balm as I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I like its smell though</li>
    <li> This is nice, but really it just seems to be petrolatum jelly with a pink color. Not very much of a rose scent, even. It does what 99 cent Vaseline does for 10x the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not been without this salve for overr 30 years--ever since a friend introduced it to me.  In our previous location, I could purchase locally but have not found a local supplier.  Always easier to order on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see petroleum jelly as a main ingredient. Kind of turned me off.</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with a classic?  For some reason, my tried and true Eos balms were no longer getting the job done, so I searched for a good alternative.  This is just so light and smooth, and the rose scent is very subtle.  My lips feel healthy and shiny with just a bit of gloss.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Its a must have from dry elbows to blemishes!</li>
    <li> Tin larger than it actually appears, which is great, its deeper than you would expect so it last so much longer and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I gave it away because i couldn&#x27;t open the top - what a waste</li>
    <li> Large container that will last a long time, goes on easily and a thin layer goes a long way, nice subtle fragrance and hint of color.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Rubs in nicely.</li>
    <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Still as good as it used to be growing up.</li>
    <li> Addicted to this stuff!</li>
    <li> love this stuff! It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I was expecting too (though it states the size on Amazon). Very good deal - especially compared to the tube</li>
    <li> Very cheerful when I smell this rosebud salve. Always keep my lips moist,glossy and silky. Everyday I take it with me. Love it so much.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for something effective for my lips because lately nothing seemed to help. A lot of products that claim to be super moisturizing really only left a coating over my lips and didn&#x27;t ever feel like it was being absorbed by my lips. The first night that I used Rosebud Salve I noticed a difference that morning. My lips are no longer cracked, and I&#x27;ve only been using this for 4 days! It&#x27;s very light, not thick and has a light pleasant smell. My only complaint is the packaging. The tin is cute, but I often struggle to open it! For the price though, I can&#x27;t complain! I&#x27;ll be scooping this out into some empty makeup jars (with lids that screw shut) to make it less frustrating to use. I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff though, I highly recommend it! For any guys out there who are wondering, this does have a light pink color to it, but the color is not visible on your lips.</li>
    <li> I wish the container were more easy to be opened. I hardly used it ever since I bought it coz it almost impossible to open it even with nails.</li>
    <li> This is a great lip balm that helps with my chapped lips. Every time I don&#x27;t but something on my lips (daily) they get really dry and start peeling. This lip balm is gentle and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I sometimes use it on my hair when I don&#x27;t have my normal hair products around. My mom used it on her dry hands and it worked wonders.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I know some others are less than thrilled with this product but I love it.  I carry it everywhere I go.  I do not put this particular item on my lips since it&#x27;s perfumed.  I do use this on my cuticles/fingers, a scratch, a dry skin patch and it works great.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little greasy but not so much that it&#x27;s intolerable you just have to know when it&#x27;s a good time to use it.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;ll be shaking hands with someone or working with food.</li>
    <li> Wow. As someone with perpetually dry lips, this stuff is amazing. Will defiantly buy again... and again.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this for me as a gift and I love it! It is the best lip ointment ever. Not too greasy and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. Love it!</li>
    <li> I know I will love the product IF IT EVER ARRIVES! as of right now all I have is credit card charge but no product. It was marked as delivered with my other lip balm but I never got it. Very disappointed, I have been looking for this product for a very long time : (</li>
    <li> Love this stuff--the smell is great and it feels great on my lips</li>
    <li> This is the only product that keeps my lips from getting dry and flaky or splitting during the winter. I live in the midwest so it is no easy feat to battle that harsh, cold, dry air from the polar vortexes. I also love the smell and the fact that it has just a bit of a pink tint. Great product. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! And this is also said by those I share it with.</li>
    <li> I love this product.....used it during childhood in the 50&#x27;s.  Wonderful for many purposes.  Having used it in the 50&#x27;s and it&#x27;s still around is reason enough for five stars..... It is recommended to everybody....from baby to adults.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with biting my lip constantly and constantly licking my lip&#x27;s,  so my lips are always chapped and cracking and peeling. I have tried so many different types of products on my lips,  exfoliating them  ,Vaseline ,regular chapstick. Anyways I was super excited whenever I read the reviews stating that the stuff was awesome, so I could not wait for mine to arrive in the mail. Needless to say I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 days and my lips are completely healed. I found the perfect product to keep my lips hydrated, and it stays on my lips for a very long time. I have to say this is one of the best lip products I have ever ever used and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Bought it as an add on item, turned out much better than i expected. If you have extreme dry lip like mine, especially living in CA, this one is a good choice, recommend it!</li>
    <li> My mother mentioned how her mother used Rosebud Salve back in the 1930s, and that she wished she could get it again. I googled and was happy to find it&#x27;s still being made. I ordered two tins, and when they arrived my mother immediately recognized them - the tin, the type, the scent, the feel. It is a wonderful salve, lightly scented and not greasy. I&#x27;ll be keeping my mom supplied with this delightful and nostalgic little product from now on.</li>
    <li> A co-worker gave me this for Christmas last year &amp; I love it!  I used it in place of a lip gloss, it makes my lips so soft &amp; doesn&#x27;t goo up like lip glosses tend to do on me.  Because I liked it so much, I ordered it this year &amp; gave it to family for Christmas.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> After trying a number of salves on shingles hot spots on my back and legs, my wife handed me a can of Rosebud Salve.  I figured why not I&#x27;ve tried everything else?  Lo and behold my hot spots faded away after three applications over a period of three days.  Can&#x27;t say that it will work for everybody but it did for me.  I keep a few cans handy because shingles isn&#x27;t any fun. I&#x27;ve since found out that there are creams available on the market specifically for shingles but considerably more expensive.  Didn&#x27;t want to go to the doctor because I don&#x27;t want antibiotics unless I just have to.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used for my lips.  It feels great on my lips and leaves them feeling super moisturized.  I have also used it to soften my elbows.  I have been using it for about six weeks.  Around week three, I noticed that areas of my lips that had become permanently (I thought) rough and darkened from 30 years of smoking cigarettes had begun to return to their natural color and texture.  They are not completely there yet, but they are greatly improved. My hope is that with continued use, my lip color and texture will completely return to normal.</li>
    <li> I was so pleasantly surprised by this salve. I use it every day and my lips are never dry or chapped any more. I also put it on my elbows at night. This stuff works! Love the light scent too. Amazing salve.</li>
    <li> Very smooth.  Part of my bedtime routine every day.</li>
    <li> favorite moisturizer for my lips during the winter. i put it on each night, and this has lasted me over a year already I believe. really great.</li>
    <li> I became a fan of Rosebud Salve years ago when I found it at a local mall. It was nice to see a product made in my home state of Maryland.The salve is very good for easing rough skin patches, little skin abrasions, chapped lips, and softening cuticles. The rose scent is pleasant and light. I have found this salve to be wonderful on my lips as a nighttime balm. The consistency is appealingly richer than a more well-known uninteresting petroleum product. The tin is reminiscent of an old-fashioned design that has proven timeless.</li>
    <li> I heard it from my friend. after using it, i feel so good of my lip. it protects my lip as well as i can expect.</li>
    <li> A family favorite for years.  Nothing better for chapped dry lips.  We also use it on small cuts for quicker healing.</li>
    <li> We got a tin of this when we got married.  I believe my wife stole it from her mother. That was 1993.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been nursing that tin for 20 years, because this is like magic pixie dust.  Whenever we have a sore or rash, she puts just a tiny amount of this salve on, and it&#x27;s all better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the tin is almost out, and this is something of a catastrophe in my house.  We had no idea where to find it.  Why not check Amazon?  Well, here it is!  We bought it, and it&#x27;s exactly the same stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, it has no real expiration date!</li>
    <li> My Grandmother used this years ago and the relief from chapped or rough skin was marvelous.  It is better than I remembered.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rosebud Salve for a decade and will continue using it. At first my friend recommended this product to me, who was then in a loss to find a suitable lip balm for my sensitive, easily-swollen lips when in contact with lip salve containing artificial ingredients. It by far works the best, even outperforms vaseline. For years now I&#x27;ve been using it almost for everything of myself and my kids - lips, dry skin, small cut/wound, burn, diaper rash, as suggested by the instruction on the bottom of the can - and not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It does melt a bit in hot weather, and the cap of the container could be difficult to open sometimes especially after you just put on lotion on your hand. Due to its oily texture and slightly red color, occasionally it stains the clothes. But for me I can absolutely ignore these tiny drawbacks with the fact that Rosebud Salve does improve my daily life.</li>
    <li> This truly works on my lips, they love this.</li>
    <li> I like that I can buy it online. Regular user for over 15 years. Keeps some by my bed. I went to the Town that they make this salve years ago and ordering online is so easy and inexpensive. I give them as gifts too.</li>
    <li> This salve is very easy to apply, and it is very soothing to lips.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like for it to, but the quality&lt;br /&gt;of the product is good, so I just keep applying!</li>
    <li> Hands down favourite lippy for the last 10 years and counting</li>
    <li> Stays on my lips all night!  Keeps my lips nourished and smooth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this individually and in the tin of 3.  (Better bargain if you choose the right seller.)  Absolutely love these balms.  I use them morning and night, and they&#x27;ve really made my lips much, much smoother.  They used to be cracked and would peel, especially when I use the long-wearing lip stains, which is pretty much every day.  Made a huge difference.  Now I&#x27;m giving them out as &amp;#34;happies&amp;#34; to anyone who mentions they have dry lips!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many rave reviews that eventually I decided to try this. I have full lips prone to dryness so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a great lip balm or salve. this was just &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; I like the feel going on, it&#x27;s sheer, slightly pink tint, very smooth and not sticky. but long term it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my lips. they end up dry and slightly chapped unless I keep reapplying... no different than say Chapstick. I also tried it on cracked areas on my hands over the winter, putting on overnight. It relieved temporarily but I saw no difference in the morning.</li>
    <li> I read about this Salve in a magazine.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a go.  The tin is the perfect size and I leave it in my handbag.  I now have a few extra and my kids have one each in their school bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great all purpose product.  I use it for dry lips, stray hairs and dry skin.  The scent is wonderful too.  Very light and delicate, not at all sickly.</li>
    <li> Same old great product.</li>
    <li> So many rave reviews. First heard about this product from a YouTube makeup/skincare guru we like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tragically, we&#x27;ll never know what&#x27;s it like, because the LID DOES NOT COME OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously...if you Google \\&quot;How to open a tin of salve\\&quot; the first thing that comes up is this product. And no, the rubber band trick doesn&#x27;t work, either. Or the butter knife. Or the pliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally got the top off. The entire contents had melted INTO the lid, making a nasty, unusable mess. And then, of course, the top would not go back on. Thank goodness for Amazon - returning it ASAP.</li>
    <li> Whoa. Smells like grandma. Strong smell and not good on me. I&#x27;m not sure about how well the product works because dahym. I just couldn&#x27;t give this stuff away.</li>
    <li> I really loved the rose scent and container of this balm, but right after I got this I went to Walmart and got Vaseline Lip Therapy Lip Balm Rosy Lips for less than a couple dollars and it works SOOOO much better, stays on longer, and costs much less than this product.&lt;br /&gt;It did ship well and I had no other problems or complaints.</li>
    <li> the best salve.  i use it for a lot of things.  lips, under eyes ,elbows,  and my husbands bald head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a picky lip balm/chapstick addict. My favorite is vaseline, but I can&#x27;t quite carry around a vaseline tub with me.  The mini ones are NOT the same. This is a great alternative option. Moisturizes almost as well as vaseline. I&#x27;ve tried everything else and for the price, this is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the tin container is hard to open and also it&#x27;s bad for warm weather places as the product melts and spills everywhere.</li>
    <li> A nice treat for your lips with just a hint of color.</li>
    <li> Makes your lips soft and add a slight mauve tint at the same time.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this balm. It does wonders for my chronically chapped lips.</li>
    <li> Just...the best. It&#x27;s crazy moisturizing and you can use it not just on your lips, but on cuticles, rough hands, your face in a pinch, just about anywhere. I love it and I always have a tin with me. You never know when you might need it!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves this.</li>
    <li> the best salve out there.  the smell and taste is amazing.  it does dry fairly quick on your lips, but it doesnt dry in a BAD way.  it soaks into your lips, and doesnt leave a nasty residue.  and its great for elbows and palms and knuckles and anywhere else you nee d moisture!</li>
    <li> I love this. Got some extras to give to my daughters. Always have one in my purse and by the side of the bed.</li>
    <li> Really, what&#x27;s not to like?  Has a great taste and does it&#x27;s job of moisturizing. Plus I like the glossy look it gives to my lips as well.  I am a long time Carmex user and I do like that product, but, Rosebud salve just feels nicerand definitely tastes better.  According to the tin, it has other uses as well, but I have not used this product other than for my lips.  However, given it&#x27;s ability of being a multi-tasker, definitely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> its okay, has a nice rosy scent. ive been using it as a lip balm/gloss and i like it, dont love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had chronic chapped lips since I was a child. This helps immensely.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Rosebud Salve. I remember my mother using this when I was young. Excellent for many uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I&#x27;m also of Indian decent, so my facial hair grows way faster than most people&#x27;s. I have to shave every single day to maintain a clean shaven look. I also have dry skin, especially lips, elbows, and other crease points on my skin, so having a product that prevents irritation no matter where it is on my body is a god send. I&#x27;ll be honest, I wasn&#x27;t completely sold on the idea of this Salve greatly decreasing any irritation I have, but it really does. Shipping&#x27;s fast, and the product got to me just two days after I ordered it. Very satisfied with this product, would definitely buy again and even recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> We are longtime users of Rosebud, We could not find Rosebud locally and were happy to find a dealer that shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product.</li>
    <li> I am leaning toward a more &#x27;crunchy&#x27; lifestyle so trying to make smarter choices about the products I use on my body.  One of the first things to go had to be the chemical-laden chapsticks.  I was completely clueless about where to start so when I saw this for a good price I decided to give it a try.  It tastes and smells pretty bad, but I decided I could put up with it until I found something better.  I then came across pucker pastes that are AWESOME so the salve has fallen by the wayside.  I still keep it around and use on dry skin on my face occasionally.  I do love the little tin and plan to reuse it once the salve is gone so there&#x27;s a silver lining! :)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these tins for $3.57ish, and bought 2. A few weeks later, I got on here to order more only to find out that the price has MORE THAN DOUBLED! I was getting a decent deal by buying it on amazon, but now I think I&#x27;ll go back to my local Southern States and purchase it for the same price and not have to worry about shipping. :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok product, but nothing special and def not worth the price. I could have bought a whole jar of vaseline for less.</li>
    <li> This is my holy grail of lip balms. Scent is light and fragrant, consistency is not too greasy, and as a bonus you can use it for dry, cracking skin or burns as well!  The tin is also huge so you get a lot of product and the price is more than reasonable.</li>
    <li> Originally I bought this hoping it would be a dupe for my favorite, yet expensive, lip balm: Christian Dior Creme de Rose. The smell of this product is lovely, and very similar to CdR, but the texture was a little less luxurious. As far as lip balms go, its ok; I like it much more than the over hyped Nivea lip butters, but not as much as Nivea milk and honey, and certainly not as much as CdR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On whim, I decided to rub this on my dry, cracked knuckles and it felt amazing! Within an hour the pain was gone. I&#x27;ve also tried this on my cuticles, as my hands in general have been rough this winter, and it was also great for that! After a cold, I suffered from a very irritated nose from all the tissues; I rubbed this around the area, and it soothed the irritation without making me break out, unlike pain old Vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely repurchase, but not really for use on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. I&#x27;ve also sent the poor tin through the washer and dryer a couple times; its melted of course, but still the same texture, and totally usable! haha</li>
    <li> Used it for my lips, work well for awhile, but didn&#x27;t help my super dry chapped lips during winter times.</li>
    <li> soothes terribly dry lips</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good.  I will tell you the small jar of Vaseline Rosy Lips cured me. And drinking more water, I don&#x27;t suffer from ANY cracked/dryness in the lip anymore.  I use this as backup if I cannot find my Rosy Lips</li>
    <li> Just another happy customer regarding this tried and true favorite. Also use on eyes at night and no crows feet yet and I&#x27;m in mid 60s. Super product, reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I use this as a child---love it</li>
    <li> Bought this after hearing about it in various blogs...It works (just like vaseline) with cracked lips and taming eyebrows:-), although I do not notice a hint of pink that others talk about.  It contains 3 ingredients: petrolatum, cotton seed oil, and a trade secret perfume.  The fact that It contains petrolatum can be a concern for many due to the EWG&#x27;s rating it &amp;#34;moderately hazardous.&amp;#34;  They state this claim because of the risk of contamination from cancer causing chemicals found in crude oil and its by-products.  No studies have ever shown a direct link to cancer; however some say a petrolatum byproduct as been found in breast tumors.  So read up on it if you are concerned...</li>
    <li> While the product did moisturize for a short while, every time I used it over night, I would wake up and it would leave my lips feeling extremely flaky. During the day, it would moisturize for around an hour, but after that, my lips would get dry and turn red (not because of the product, but because I have naturally red lips, especially when dry). I personally do not see the hype. I would suggest Aquaphor for anyone that wants better results than this gives. Aquaphor it much cheaper as well.</li>
    <li> I love the product for chapped lips. Slight rose smell that is not overwhelming (I usually hate rose smelling products). Unfortunately, I find the lid is hard to pull apart from the bottom of the tin particularly if you get a bit of the product on the outside. So, I just leave the top resting on the tin in my nightstand (which means I can&#x27;t carry this in my purse, etc).</li>
    <li> I love this salve!!  I had a spot on my face that i could not get to go away.  A kinda dry spot and rosebud salve healed it when the expensive stuff did not touch it.</li>
    <li> This has a nice consistency, not sticky at all, and adds a tiny bit of shine and color without being a gloss. It smells nice and works well on dry skin in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I like the texture but I just can&#x27;t get used to the rose flavored salve.  I&#x27;m more of a fruit flavor or menthol flavored person.  The smell is great, but I can&#x27;t stand the taste.</li>
    <li> This product has succeeded where others have failed! My wife has tried several different brands (some fairly expensive) and all have left her lips drier than before she used them. This leaves them nice and soft and helps get rid or dryness and chapping.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get the lid off but otherwise, I love using this as a lip gloss and then rub it over my hands.  Smells great and is a great looking lip gloss.</li>
    <li> Introduced to this product by a friend at work.  Now I&#x27;m giving as gifts.  I saw it listed as one of the ten beauty products that every woman should try.  I think you should try it.</li>
    <li> Bought this stuff for years and never had a problem. Great quality packaging, clear listing of ingredients and natural. My lips are really sensitive, and this is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make them peel that doesn&#x27;t run me 20$ and up.</li>
    <li> i really don&#x27;t see what all the hoopla is about this product.  recently bought it for the first time and was not very impressed.  it&#x27;s greasy and the rose smell is overwhelming.  the worst part, though, is trying to get the lid off.  there should be a little metal turn thing on the side that will help pop the lid up.&lt;br /&gt;vaseline would work just as well, i think.</li>
    <li> Comparatively my other lip glosses (Clinique and Sephora brand, which were my favorites) don&#x27;t measure up to how this feels on my lips.  It doesn&#x27;t last long, though, it&#x27;s true.  However I also appreciate that I can use it to moisturize my hands as well.  Nice if you like to travel light.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. Just don&#x27;t leave it in a hot car or you will have a metal tin full or melted mess!</li>
    <li> savior for dry cuticles which i suffer with very much in winter, and also in summer.&lt;br /&gt;i apply morning and night to cuticles.  it has helped tremendously in not having such&lt;br /&gt;tough dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this in the tube--much easier for my 5 year old to use.  I been using  SMITH&#x27;S Rosebud Salve for many years.  I have also tried many different lip treatments--this one is the best.  it is the only salve to heal peeling lips.  I am also a nurse--I wash my hands more than the average person.  Although I apply lotion throughout my shift, I end up with red irritated knuckles.  I apply this salve while I sleep and within the next morning the red irritation is gone.  I used this on my son&#x27;s lips, diaper rash or eczema patches---it works.  I love the rich texture, translucent pink color and the lack of fragrance/flavor.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this and I don&#x27;t think I want to know.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great. I have dry skin and this is the only thing that helps with cracked skin. [in my case].</li>
    <li> My wife bought, very good, and she loved it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost literally pink tinted vaseline. It feels very comfortable on the lips but theres a strong chance those mini jars of rose vaseline will also feel good. Maybe I got a dud, but mine doesn&#x27;t smell like roses at all, which I found disappointing. There&#x27;s no particular scent to it.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. Love it. Good size. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this salve, not only for my lips but it is great for keeping your cuticles moisturized. I have tried the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; but prefer the Rosebud Salve. The only negative is that as cute as the tin is, it is difficult to open. The good news is that Rosebud Salve also comes in an easy to use tube, which I keep in my purse. The tin I keep in my bathroom using a rubber band wrapped around the top to make opening it easier.</li>
    <li> Cheap with good quality. Effective product for wind burn, rashes and 1st degree burn. Good buy. Will buy again soon</li>
    <li> This is awesome and I slather it on a lot, because I wear braces and often my lips feel chapped. You can pick this up just about anywhere, Rite-Aid, etc. but it&#x27;s convinient for me to order with Prime. Definitely great product!</li>
    <li> I Love this product ! We don&#x27;t have it in my country (Saudi Arabia)All the lip balms we have make my lips more chapped than they are and they also make my lips peel(like Vaseline and Labello)&lt;br /&gt;but not Rosebud Lip Balm&lt;br /&gt;few days and I notice that my lips feel soft and less chapped than they were before&lt;br /&gt;I used to bite my lips a lot and wet them with my tongue a lot but not anymore&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it ..It smells delicious even my cat would bent on my lips to smell it very keenly!&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it&lt;br /&gt;It also makes my lips look healthy and pink (if I am not in the mood for heavy lipstick I apply it and it gives me a natural look )&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I had a sudden acne and I applied it on the area it soothed it a lot and the red spot disappeared after few hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mai&lt;br /&gt;Saudi Arabia</li>
    <li> The quality of this book is terrible and I wish that they would use a nice-feeling, stronger paper. Then I could give them 5 stars. The story of the Little Red Hen is priceless in what it teaches children about responsibility, but who was responsible for picking out the paper for this book? Fire him or her! Just kidding. I would gladly pay more for a better quality book. And I will, if I find it!</li>
    <li> I love the way this stuff smells, and it feels so Good on your skin! Such a pleasant pink color, and the skin heals naturally.</li>
    <li> first the price is very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;this product is very safe&lt;br /&gt;this product smells good, i used it evey day</li>
    <li> I was trying all these for extra dry skin and for lips.  I just don&#x27;t like this product.  The consistency and the smell turn me off.  I don&#x27;t really know what else to say about it, but am required to write a bit more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth every penny - I&#x27;d even pay much more! I&#x27;ve used it on burns, cuts, chapped skin ....even cradle cap. Best stuff ever!!!</li>
    <li> I saw this item in so many magazines and blogs, and being a beauty junkie I just had to get my hands on it. I love the packaging and the scent is so light. I use it mostly for my lips at night, but also my cuticles. It&#x27;s a little thicker compared to vaseline, which is good, and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy. When I wake up in the morning my lips are still nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This is the only lipbalm I have used that doesn&#x27;t end up causing my lips to get more and more dry, the more I use it.  I use it on my hands, too, when I get extremely dry, near-cracked skin.</li>
    <li> Nothing relieves chapped lips like this Rosebud Salve. Nothing! And it&#x27;s cheaper here than at Sephora or any other shop I&#x27;ve searched.</li>
    <li> The texture to this is similar to Vaseline. It really made my lips soft. I enjoyed applying this on at night. It&#x27;s great to use during the winter when the cold makes your lips chapped and your hands feel dry. You can use it for multiple things.</li>
    <li> I love the salve, but the lid is hard to get off. Every time I tried to use it, it took me 10 minutes to open the tin. I tried 2 different tins with the same results.  You just turn and turn and pull without success. I use it in the tube now without problem. Love the product, hate the packaging .</li>
    <li> Addicted.Great in winter to keep lips and nails/cuticles in good shape.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. I especially use it right before bed to keep my lips moist. Some so-called lip balm products make my lips feel dry and waxy, but NOT Smith&#x27;s Rose Salve. Also has a nice mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> Awesome price! Love the consistency of this salve and how it makes my lips feel. Also, love that there is really no smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff to EVER happen to my nails and cuticles.  Absorbs great, no greasy residue and my nails have never been stronger and I haven&#x27;t had to trim my cuticles in weeks!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, CAN&#x27;T GET ENOUGH, you can use it for lots of things, problem areas on skin and facial area, minor boo boo&#x27;s with the kids, it softens hands and cuticles, and helps cold sores for my daughter, she loves it for lip gloss!!!!! We will be buying more, would be even more awesome if it came in a tube!!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!! I bought it in the tube as well for easy portability and on the go use because I use it for everything from  lips, to cracked skin around my nose in the winter during a bad cold, to scrapes and burns. Magic in a tin &amp; it smells great!</li>
    <li> I have been a Carmex balm user for years.... other balms, lip therapies, etc I had tried just left my lips feeling parched after it wore off - always looking for something better but always went back to Carmex balm. However... i wanted to give Rosebud salve a try... it has been around forever so what did i have to lose? Well, I am sold! It actually leaves your lips feeling soft long after it has worn off. My lips feel better softer than they have in years. I have not had any problems whatsoever with the tin that other buyers seemed to have had some issue with. Really good stuff.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product but it&#x27;s terribly over priced considering I was only able to use it once before the container vacuum sealed it&#x27;s self. I tried multiple ways of opening it but with no luck. The old fashioned tin is cute, but the company should consider making it a screw top.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of rose smelling things, you have to buy this. It smells like rose, but not too strongly at the same time. The texture is a little thicker and creamier than Vaseline. I use it as a lip balm and I think its just wonderful. It gives a nice sheen and makes it look like you put on lip gloss.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s a bit glossy so it can look a bit feminine but the effectiveness of the product far outweighs any cons. My lips were really bad and this stuff kickstarted the healing.</li>
    <li> the gd lid is a beetch to get off.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my lips. At first I thought it was just okay, but it quickly became my fave beauty thing ever. Makes my lips so soft and gives them a very subtle, natural pink color. I use it mostly on my lips but I also use a little to smooth flyaways when i fix my hair or if i have a particularly dry patch of skin. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that Amazon has this product! It amazes me that they actually still sell this product. I remember my late grandmother wearing this on her lips every day like an old fashioned lip gloss. The gentle smell of roses and the classic tin container brings back bittersweet memories of my grandmother. I am so glad and extremely pleased that it is being sold on Amazon. Proving that you can find everything and anything on this site! Thank you, Amazon, for having this product available to buy on this site.</li>
    <li> KInda disappointed in this - there is always so much hype about being a staple for &amp;#34;the stars&amp;#34; and make up artists. I like the consistency, but found it to be very drying on the lips, instead of moisturizing. Doesn&#x27;t stay very long either. Not for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, but you can get it cheaper at Sephora</li>
    <li> My friend bought this for me and now I am addicted :) I have very dry skin on my cheeks and have paid up to $50 on face lotion, that was supposed to help the driest of dry skin but, none do the job just temporarily help. This stuff really cures my issue with the dry skin. I put it one 1 time every 3 days on my face and no more dry, rough patches on my face. I even use it like lotion for my hands.</li>
    <li> Rosebud Salve has been around for years.  My sister used to sell it door to door in our neighborhood.  Not real sure what it sold for but she sold enough to get a Kodak Camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was really itching and I thought, wow, I wish I could still get Rosebud Salve.  Then I thought, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m gonna check Amazon.  They have everything.  Well, sure enough Amazon got it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosebut Salve is the best for chapped lips or any extremely dry skin.  I gave some to my sister who sold it as a child and she was thrilled.  I plan to give some to my son, daughter-in-law, &amp; grandson who all share my problem with Eczema.  It is quite severe sometimes and I think the Rosebud Salve works better than the prescription creams I have gotten for the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon.  You have made a lot of people happy..... Katherine</li>
    <li> Usually I like using Carmex because of it&#x27;s smooth texture before I put on lip gloss so it lasts longer. BUT, when I tried this last night, It felt like i didn&#x27;t even need the lip gloss and carmex to protect my lips. It glided on smooth, smells GREAT, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Would def recommend it. The container is so vintage and easy to open. I really love the design.</li>
    <li> Basically petroleum jelly with a hint of color. It smells like my great grandma&#x27;s beauty products smell. The tint isn&#x27;t significant to act as a lipstain. I tried regular petroleum jelly from medicine cabinet on my lips to compare this product against; bingo! same result.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want this for the cute tin and don&#x27;t mind the oldschool petroleum jelly in it, this is for you!</li>
    <li> It is very good product and I have used it for couple of years. I also got a lot for my friends as a gift. The only little issue for me  is hard to open it sometimes.  It would be better if the company change a little for the container. But I still love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm ever. Period!  Stop searching for a good lip balm that won&#x27;t leave your lip chapped by the end of day.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to open tin container. nice rose aroma. Lovely pink color. Above all, it works!  leaves your lip moisturized all day in a non-greasy way.  What a good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy more - for purse, for office, for girl friends!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be nice for a lip balm but it&#x27;s a little too floral for my liking.  Yes, I realize it&#x27;s rose but so many reviewers claimed the scent wasn&#x27;t strong and didn&#x27;t linger.  Well mine did!  It is literally like putting perfume on my lips and that&#x27;s just not what I was hoping for.  I can slightly taste it too.  The color looks rose/blush in the tin but on the lips it is completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from my own issues with the use of the product, it seems like a good quality balm that would be excellent for softening chapped areas or skin abrasions - maybe rough heels.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a picture that shows the size of the tin and the balm color.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very moisturizing, non-irritating and doesn&#x27;t contain artificial ingredients. I also use their tube product which is handy for on-the-go.</li>
    <li> Works great but not my favorite scent.  I had to get used to putting a rose smell on my lips.</li>
    <li> This product was much nicer than I expected. I was thinking this would be a smelly petroleum jelly. The slave is smooth and smells nice; the moisture stays on the applied area but does not feel greasy. I am definitely a fan and prefer this to other chap sticks. The smell is refreshing and not overwhelming and works completely fine as a unisex product. The sheen is not very strong and looks like the application of any other chap stick. Pigmentation is light and does not alter the coloring or shimmer of the lips other than a natural, moisturized sheen.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balm. For years, I have only been using vaseline - at the recommendation of my dermatologist. I read about this, and saw that the ingredients were very minimal. I risked it, and it works perfectly! Yes, is has a petrolatum base, but it is surgical grade so the texture is more refined. The oils also help to give it more smoothness than straight &amp;#34;vaseline&amp;#34;. After trying this one out, I have the other Rosebud lip balms as well, but this one has the nicest texture and absorbency. Although I&#x27;m not always wild about the smell, I am very grateful to have a lip gloss that I can wear without having an allergic reaction!</li>
    <li> I love the rose scent and it really help me a lot in the winter! Just one thing, it doesn&#x27;t last long on lips.</li>
    <li> I use this exclusively as a lip balm and I&#x27;ve found it to be deeply conditioning. I know Sephora and Bath and Body Works sells this in their stores, but I&#x27;ve found it cheaper on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is like petroleum jelly and isn&#x27;t sticky on the lips. Smells strongly of roses.</li>
    <li> Lips so soft...I purchased this just to see what it was...I am glad that i did...Lips so soft, I wanna kiss myself!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect size to keep with me in my purse or pocket for when my hands are dry from the harsh winter weather. Thanks</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent for so many things.  I use it on cuticles, on my children&#x27;s abrasions, on dry skin, my lips, around my eyes... I use it every day, and often.  Although it seems like a small tin, it lasts quite a long time.  This is a very good price for a product that is so versatile and a necessity for any medicine cabinet or makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not seen this since i was a kid at my grandmother&#x27;s house and she used this for nearly everything..  Great product.. Glad I found it so I can have it in my medicine bag at home.</li>
    <li> Looked for this product for years. Was very satisfied that I finally located it and am very happy with the product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a really good, a few days ago my son&#x27;s face was his fingernails scraping together, I give him for two days, with the mouth at ordinary times, small wound with good immediately, love it.Buy two one is a friend to!Taste or I like roses smell, the next time a discount to buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff worth every penny.  Leaves you with soft pretty lips so kissable.  Highly recommended product.  Very nice and lightly scented.</li>
    <li> This salve works great. I have dry hands esp in the winter but this helped keep them smooth &amp; fine. A nurse recommended it to me because I had some sores on my arms where I had blood drawn, also I had tape marks that wouldn&#x27;t go away. She said Rosebud Salve is good for these. It works and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love these old fashioned tins and the fragrance is wonderful</li>
    <li> I USE THIS AS AN EYELASH PRIMER BEFORE MY MASCARA THEN I CURL MY LASHES AND I ALSO USE THIS FOR MY LIPS ON A MORE NATURAL DAY. THIS ALSO HAS A LIGHT PLEASANT SCENT.</li>
    <li> How do I use it?&lt;br /&gt;To rejuvenate my nails (and cuticles) after I&#x27;ve dried them out with acetone&lt;br /&gt;To moisturize my nose when I&#x27;m sick&lt;br /&gt;To treat small nicks from my razor&lt;br /&gt;To treat any dried chapped skin (including lips,knuckles,knees)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!  The smell is mild and doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume, and my sensitive skin has never had a reaction to it!  It&#x27;s also awesome because it fits in a purse or in my makeup container.  It seems to last quite long.  This is easily one of the most important tools in my makeup kit!  Totally worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I use it during the day and overnight. This is honestly the best lip balm I have ever used. I&#x27;ll never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I love the way this tin looks and will reuse it after i have finished the salve inside. This was an add on item and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I am amazed by this simple product.  My lips were very rough and within hours they were soft &amp; the rough skin had softened.  I could not be more pleased.  I now also use it for chapped areas or scrapes on my hands.  My son is prone to nose bleeds and I plan to get one for him to use to soften the dry skin just inside the nose.</li>
    <li> This salve is amazing! It heals the most chapped lips and skin in no time! I am definitely repurchasing this tin when i run out!</li>
    <li> I love the rosebud salve. It is not overly greasy, as one might expect because it has a cotton-seed oil base. The scent is pleasing. I use it to clear acne irritation overnight and works wonders for that- especially if you use skin clearing medicines that cause dryness. Seems like this small tin will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I thought I would like this, but I don&#x27;t. It tastes chemically to me, doesn&#x27;t leave much of a rose or pink color anywhere (I tried it on my cheeks and lips), and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Also, when I use it it seems to dry out my lips. I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
    <li> This works wonders!!! You can use it for your lips, hands, face, etc. You don&#x27;t have to buy other expensive skin and lip care. All you need is just this and you&#x27;re all set! Must buy!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, not really a big fan of the smell but other than that it&#x27;s the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> not that good. I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> works wonderful and smells amazing....</li>
    <li> I wish the tin were larger because I love this product. When using it as moisturizer for my lips they are super soft and it lasts much longer than chapstick or even my former favorite Softlips. I also use this on my legs after shaving to avoid  razor  bumps and lock in moisture.</li>
    <li> Best lip stuff ever!! I have stopped using lipstick all together now. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, and this brought my natural pink lip color back.</li>
    <li> My new obsession! I heard about Rosebud Salve and had to try it. It has since replaced all of my other lipsticks, glosses, and chapsticks. It definitely has a floral-y scent, which I like but others may not. It goes on smooth and is not at all sticky feeling. If you&#x27;re a lip-licker (like I am), it doesn&#x27;t last a super long time, but I have that problem with anything I put on my lips. Provides a nice shine and a hint of color, and makes my &amp;#34;natural lips&amp;#34; (without any lipstick) look quite fantastic (and prevents them from getting chapped)! I definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> I had super chapped lips due to my first Winter in the Chicago area after years or warm texas..and a friend reccomended this, I used it over nights for 2 nights and my lips were perfectly healed. I will continue to buy this!</li>
    <li> The delicate rose scent and the creamy feel of the salve is just amazing! I actually have softer lips in just 2 days of using it twice a day. Would highly recommend this product to ANYONE who would care to listen!</li>
    <li> It says skin treatment but it&#x27;s not really this is lipgloss if you try to use it on your skin it&#x27;s fine just makes it sticky I personally use it on my knuckles when they are chapped it helps, nice lipgloss tho</li>
    <li> This save is alright -- I had read the review (that spoke highly) and that is the reason I bought it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it on chapped lips or rough cuticles, etc. It has a pleasant light rose scent to it as well. Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This is such a good all in one product.  I wear it as lip gloss, if I forget mascara put it on my lashes, and for dry cuticles.  Does it all!</li>
    <li> a little greasy, but that is expected with a salve! The smell is wonderful. Not that yucky overly perfume smell, but light fresh &amp; sweet roses</li>
    <li> i was worried the tin would be inconvenient, but it truly doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It has great packaging and looks elegant. It is very easy to find at the bottom of my purse because i don&#x27;t have anything else shaped like this. I like the rose tint to the balm, but i don&#x27;t think it really does anything to my lipcolor. The smell is wonderful and I have had it seems like it will last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula makes your lips very slippy and isn&#x27;t sticky one bit. I find it great to apply before lipstick.</li>
    <li> My children tend to get an eczema rash in places where their skin folds, such as the corners of their noses and between their lower lip and chin. I bought this to treat the problem based on a friends advice, and it really did the trick. I dab a bit on and it usually heals in a day or two. It&#x27;s not goopy or messy, and the tin is the perfect size for tossing in my purse or the diaper bag.</li>
    <li> Love this salve!  Perfect for any situation and provides a beautiful gloss that lasts a long time! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;it is too thick to wear over lipstick or just to wear as chapstick..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just wear to bed or see if my mom wants it. I prefer my LUSH lip balm</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful! By the time I get this open and I am so mad and my fingers hurt. The container is a disaster and next to impossible to pry open.</li>
    <li> Horrible stuff in a tin that&#x27;s unopenable - even after it&#x27;s been forced open several times.</li>
    <li> I would rate this between 2-3 stars. Yes, the product smells a little strange and it is very thick like vaseline, but these things don&#x27;t bother me. What does bother me is that 5 minutes after I use this, the product is gone. I bought this thinking it would be a good overnight lip treatment, but it would not last on the lips that long.</li>
    <li> I cut away the plastic seal, and have spent 45 obscenity-filled minutes trying to open the tin.  It&#x27;s oozing goo, it&#x27;s faintly rose scented. It&#x27;s not letting me in.  I admit I have very long, acrylic nails but even the Mr can&#x27;t get the thing tapped. Gaaaaaah!</li>
    <li> The tin was a good price considering several websites sell them for higer than 10 and change. Most regular stores don&#x27;t sell them in bulk like that. I received them faster than the day estimated also.</li>
    <li> Got this product because recommended on dr oz. great product. Really does leave lips feeling great. Hope you like it</li>
    <li> Smells great, looks lovely, easy to appy(I use a lipstick brush) and it is cheap.  Love this stuff.  And you can use it other places, too.  Read the label.</li>
    <li> Rosebud Salve is a &amp;#34;wonder salve&amp;#34; that my grandmother swore by, and that I swear by!! You will not find anything better to heal and soothe dry cracked skin, and lips, and to heal rashes such as diaper or heat rash. I use it for everything!! I cannot say enough about this salve that I have turned to since childhood.</li>
    <li> Love this product, and I have to have on-hand at all times!  Works like a charm, smells yummy, and this little pot lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> Using this for 50 years !</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, a flutist. Since she got this she has had almost no problem with chapped lips. She has quite a bit of trouble with dryness, and says that everything else she had ever tried was greasy. With the Rosebud Salve, she can even apply it before playing, and (as long as she doesn&#x27;t put too much on) it does not make her lips slide off the lip plate on the flute.</li>
    <li> This looks like it is a product that has been around for a while.  The jar looks \\&quot;old-timey\\&quot;.  I have been using it for just about everything.  I put in on my dry cuticles, on a small burn on my arm and my dry elbows.  This stuff really works.  I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s been around so long.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice fragrance and works into your skin without leaving you feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend you consider trying this product.  I think you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
    <li> I really like it for my lips.</li>
    <li> Some of the nicest lip balm I&#x27;ve ever had, and the tin lasts a long time.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Good product. It&#x27;s like a rose scented Vaseline. Mine came melted to the lid so it was hard to open, but I just heated it up and it fit back in the tin. I did find that on a hot day out though it would melt more. It does have a VERY floral scent so make sure you like that smell.</li>
    <li> Been using it for 30 years. Throw away all your other lip balms and use only this. Smells great, works great! The only balm I ever use.</li>
    <li> I like it. Good lip balm and it smells rosy but the smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It stays put and protects my lips from the cold Ohio winter!</li>
    <li> Really great product for my chapped skin. I use it on my face and lips in the winter. Smells lovely! Vaseline consistency.</li>
    <li> The best thing to clear up my sons dry skin on his face.</li>
    <li> If you like vaseline, you&#x27;ll like this. Beautiful rose color and smell. And beautiful vintage style tin. My other chapstick that I used to use looked nice, but my lips still got flaky. This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve used that actually moisturizes them.</li>
    <li> When my lips are really dry and chapped- this works the rest at restoring them back to being hydrated and soft! Works every time and I don&#x27;t feel like I constantly need to reapply and it&#x27;s never sticky! I was skeptic at first, but this really is the best lip gloss. I have one at work and one in my purse and one at home, so I&#x27;m never without one!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It is great for keeping lips soft and hydrated especially during winter, and has absolutely delicious smell.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great seller!</li>
    <li> I bought these after reading about them in a magazine. But, it really does live up to the hype. It works great on my lips. It&#x27;s helped clear up a blemish....and took the sting out of a paper cut! I will never be without one of these little tins!</li>
