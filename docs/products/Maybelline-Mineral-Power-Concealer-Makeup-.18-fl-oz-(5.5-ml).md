### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>excellent service.</li>
      <li>The color cream looks great with my olive skin tone!</li>
      <li>Its the best one i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>And this was perfect for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Discontinued by Maybelline, shame on them, this was one of the best concealers around.  </li>
      <li>Conceals and blends to my skin perfectly</li>
      <li>I use it before and after foundation and it always looks great!</li>
      <li>Great purchase, its practically a steal.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the greatest, but in a pinch - it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and is the best concealer ever!!!!</li>
      <li>I just think it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>, I think that will be it since there is a shelf life for these things, but no doubt about it, this is a good concealer.</li>
      <li>and it has good color.</li>
      <li>I found this at a great price and this is better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this concealer!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I wish there was more color options in shade ranges for all concealers, like this one!</li>
      <li>but then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores and was thrilled to see it for sale on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I am on a special diet (hcg) and this does not react to it and it covers great.</li>
      <li>Nice, very creamy in a nice shade!  </li>
      <li>Glad Amazon offered my color.  </li>
      <li>a while back that was awesome and my favorite concealer.</li>
      <li>love the product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this concealer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for the skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the best rated ones actually.  </li>
      <li>The great news is, it&#x27;s actually a decent concealer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good concealer as well.</li>
      <li>It stays on almost all day and is soooo easy to takeoff.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t burn easily, but I do freckle some.  </li>
      <li>It fits right to my color and the stick applicator is perfect for under eye darkness or red spots yo</li>
      <li>I bought 3 of them, so I will be good for a long time, but I dread the day when I won&#x27;t be able to purchase more.</li>
      <li>It is a wonderful product that covers dark circles and it stays on all day!  </li>
      <li>Overall, just a great product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
      <li>but it was too light.</li>
      <li>I had originally got the light shade which was 1-2</li>
      <li>And it is super super watery.</li>
      <li>Finally found a concealer I love &amp;</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for individuals with moderately clear combination skin, because it does the trick to cover light spots.</li>
      <li>For the price, it really is a bargain and works so well.</li>
      <li>i dont really see the point in this product</li>
      <li>seems really watery.</li>
      <li>This product goes on smoother, covers better and lasts longer than any other I have found.  </li>
      <li>So I got this in the exact same color and it is sooo orange.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that my blemishes totally vanish, but it does blend well, drastically improve my under eye darkness, and doesn&#x27;t enhance fine lines and wrinkles like other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; concealers do.  </li>
      <li>IT goes on smoothly covering with the tiniest amount and its crazy cheap, just wish it was not discontinued.</li>
      <li>I have had dark puffy circles my whole life, and have tried every concealer out there.  </li>

<li> but this product is terrible.</li>

    <li> I LOVE this concealer. Its the best one i&#x27;ve ever used. And it goes well with the rest of the mineral power collection. And this was perfect for my skin tone. Which i have a hard time matching. I use the powder foundation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, dry or wet. IT goes on smoothly covering with the tiniest amount and its crazy cheap, just wish it was not discontinued. Makes me sad, its one of my cheapest beauty products and I hate when I run out of it, makes all the difference!!</li>
    <li> i dont really see the point in this product i didnt notice a difference when i aplied this on my face</li>
    <li> seems really watery. not like the ones i  get in the drugstore</li>
    <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so small. Expected it to be bigger since the price</li>
    <li> Nice, very creamy in a nice shade!  I wish there was more color options in shade ranges for all concealers, like this one!</li>
    <li> love the product. excellent service. thank you!</li>
    <li> This is one of my fave concealers! For the price, it really is a bargain and works so well. I use it under my eyes and instantly makes my eyes look brighter and covers all my unwanted spots! I use it before and after foundation and it always looks great! Great purchase, its practically a steal. The color cream looks great with my olive skin tone! I highly recommend for individuals with moderately clear combination skin, because it does the trick to cover light spots.</li>
    <li> I had originally got the light shade which was 1-2 but it was too light. I found this at a great price and this is better. It&#x27;s a pretty good concealer as well.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the greatest, but in a pinch - it&#x27;s okay.  I think I&#x27;ll try another brand later.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout and it covers everything. It&#x27;s so easy to use and is the best concealer ever!!!! I use it almost everyday and not once did it produce bad results. It stays on almost all day and is soooo easy to takeoff. I also find that when I wash it off, it leaves no residue. It comes all off and no toner is needed. Overall, just a great product that I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It fits right to my color and the stick applicator is perfect for under eye darkness or red spots yo</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time. I am on a special diet (hcg) and this does not react to it and it covers great.</li>
    <li> Discontinued by Maybelline, shame on them, this was one of the best concealers around.  I mean, for dark circles, it covered, and it dried, and it isn&#x27;t sticky or creamy, it has no scent to irritate the eyes.  I have two of these stored away now, I think that will be it since there is a shelf life for these things, but no doubt about it, this is a good concealer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find decent products that are not poison.  This product rates very well on the cosmetic data base for hazardous cosmetics.  It&#x27;s one of the best rated ones actually.  The great news is, it&#x27;s actually a decent concealer.  I can&#x27;t say that my blemishes totally vanish, but it does blend well, drastically improve my under eye darkness, and doesn&#x27;t enhance fine lines and wrinkles like other &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; concealers do.  I looked for this every where and couldn&#x27;t find it.  Glad Amazon offered my color.  I&#x27;m a medium skin tone.  I don&#x27;t burn easily, but I do freckle some.  Hope this helps you!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this concealer!  I had been using it for years, but then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores and was thrilled to see it for sale on Amazon.  I have had dark puffy circles my whole life, and have tried every concealer out there.  This product goes on smoother, covers better and lasts longer than any other I have found.  I bought 3 of them, so I will be good for a long time, but I dread the day when I won&#x27;t be able to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Bought em twice. Conceals and blends to my skin perfectly</li>
    <li> I looked all over for this when I ran out and could not find a store that carried it.  It is a wonderful product that covers dark circles and it stays on all day!  I would not want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I just think it&#x27;s good.It&#x27;s okay for the skin and it has good color. I think I like it. ~</li>
    <li> I dont know if you got the hint from the heading but this product is terrible. I bought one in the store a while back that was awesome and my favorite concealer. But I cannot find in stores anymore. So I got this in the exact same color and it is sooo orange. I do not want to look like a pumpkin face. And it is super super watery. Like half the tube is water. I have never experienced an issue with this product until ordering it off here. I am not sure if this was a bad batch of concealers or what but I am really disappointed. I am now afraid to try to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> Finally found a concealer I love &amp; they are discontinuing it.  I used to use YSL Touch Elat which was 5 times the price of Maybelline. I did a side by side comparison &amp; it was the same.</li>
