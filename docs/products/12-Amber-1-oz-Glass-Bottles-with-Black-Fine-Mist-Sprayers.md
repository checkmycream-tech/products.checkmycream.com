      <li>The bottles were packaged nicely.  </li>
      <li>Perfect size and high quality.</li>
      <li>&amp; I think this may have more to do with the viscosity of the liquid inside than the caps, but the two I filled with a water based liquid turned out perfect &amp; sprayed, as described, in a fine mist.</li>
      <li>Perfect for hair mists, rose water face mists, and pillow and linen mists made of distiller water and essential oils.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m happy to tell you that they are exactly what they are advertised to be.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to order these because it seemed too good to be true.</li>

      <li>They spray so evenly and with a strong spray.</li>
      <li>All bottles worked very handy little speakers and good price.</li>
      <li>I recvd the glass dropper lids instead of the fine mist spray lids.</li>
      <li>I use them with my essential oils and they work great</li>
      <li>They appear to be good quality bottles but several of the sprayers didn&#x27;t work, they just leaked all over when you tried to spray them.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I received this order quickly.  </li>
      <li>as described and quick shipping</li>
      <li>The dropper lids are nice and the bottles are nice and heavy duty though!</li>
      <li>and I will likely buy more, but don&#x27;t expect any miracles of this fine mist sprayer cap.</li>
      <li>Cheap, sturdy (they&#x27;ve survived a few flights) and with a good spray mechanism.</li>
      <li>These are a perfect size for all the little concoctions I make with my essential oils.</li>
      <li>Great quality and deal but only enough inventory for 1 order.</li>
      <li>I have used 4-5 of the bottles so far and all of them have worked fine.</li>
      <li>Packaged very well - thank you!</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing these again when I make more scents from essential oils for friends and family.</li>
      <li>I came back to purchase more</li>

      <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>12 new, high quality, 1 oz amber glass bottles.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how surprised I was at the difference between the type of spray I was getting with the different liquids</li>
      <li>These little spray bottles are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I was almost certain they were going to be a let down.</li>

<li> 12 new, high quality, 1 oz amber glass bottles.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s how surprised I was at the difference between the type of spray I was getting with the different liquids</li>
<li> These little spray bottles are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
<li> I was almost certain they were going to be a let down.</li>
<li> These bottles worked great for DIY insect repellent made w witch hazel and essential oils.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only used a few of these so far</li>
<li> The one I filled with an oil based liquid sprays out as a straight stream &amp; not a fine mist, which was startling (and a little messy).</li>
<li> The tops don&#x27;t work properly, the pump sticks after a few sprays.</li>
<li> It does not fill in the center when you use it.  </li>
<li> , the oil blends come in a stream, which I expected since the viscosity is thicker.</li>
<li> Everything was as expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve put some skin care toners, apple cider vinegar, and other watery liquids in these</li>
<li> Amber bottles stops degradation of skin care products due to sunlight.</li>
<li> I have been having trouble with the rollers staying in .</li>
<li> 2 of my caps were missing.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the package came with 12 bottles but only 10 sprayers.</li>
<li> Nothing too bad, but just be careful to store them properly.</li>
<li> &amp; it was hard to put the caps on the bottle.</li>
<li> Nothing was broken.  </li>
<li> so none of the bottles cracked, chipped, or arrived broken.</li>
<li> Frustrating.</li>
<li> I now have 12 bottles that are useless to me!</li>
<li> I hate to leave 1 star, but these are bad.  </li>
<li> Awful, they leak and don&#x27;t spray.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t even find an email for this seller to contact them about this horrible product.  </li>

    <li> Awesome products for my personal business.</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and high quality.</li>
    <li> The spray pattern in a ring.  It does not fill in the center when you use it.  I hate to leave 1 star, but these are bad.  I missed the return window, otherwise I would have them in my home at this time.  The sprayers also leak.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the package came with 12 bottles but only 10 sprayers. Otherwise, seems like a great product but now I have to purchase 2 individual sprayers. Frustrating.</li>
    <li> Perfect for hair mists, rose water face mists, and pillow and linen mists made of distiller water and essential oils.</li>
    <li> These little spray bottles are exactly what I was looking for. I use them with my essential oils and they work great</li>
    <li> These bottles worked great for DIY insect repellent made w witch hazel and essential oils. Would definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble with the rollers staying in . They keep falling out of about 4 of the bottles.</li>
    <li> These work great. I&#x27;ve put some skin care toners, apple cider vinegar, and other watery liquids in these and they work great. The bottles were all intact on delivery and there weren&#x27;t any quality issues.</li>
    <li> Nice bottles for the price!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product for my store and good quality! ~RomanticScents.com~</li>
    <li> All bottles worked very handy little speakers and good price. Better than plastic</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Love these!</li>
    <li> Works well for her projects</li>
    <li> My go-to bottles for when I mix body sprays. Good materials, consistent in quality, and a great price!</li>
    <li> Nice quality, very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great quality and just what i was looking for!</li>
    <li> Perfect for mixing up essential oil first aid sprays, linen sprays, and more.</li>
    <li> Awful, they leak and don&#x27;t spray.  I can&#x27;t even find an email for this seller to contact them about this horrible product.  I now have 12 bottles that are useless to me!</li>
    <li> These bottles are amazing! They spray so evenly and with a strong spray. I use them for fractionated coconut oil with essential oils and they work perfectly!</li>
    <li> I received this order quickly.  The bottles were packaged nicely.  Nothing was broken.  I have used 4-5 of the bottles so far and all of them have worked fine. I would definitely reorder this product.</li>
    <li> as described and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Amber bottles stops degradation of skin care products due to sunlight. Am in love with these. Cheap, sturdy (they&#x27;ve survived a few flights) and with a good spray mechanism. Won&#x27;t spray 100% oil but will spray emulsified products. GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> I love these. Great size, simple to use, and big enough to add a legible label. I will be purchasing these again when I make more scents from essential oils for friends and family.</li>
    <li> They appear to be good quality bottles but several of the sprayers didn&#x27;t work, they just leaked all over when you tried to spray them.</li>
    <li> I never got thus product. I received droppers instead. Very dissatisfied. Good thing that I had use for the droppers.</li>
    <li> Using to make room sprays using my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Packaged very well - thank you!</li>
    <li> These are a perfect size for all the little concoctions I make with my essential oils. If you want something that&#x27;s for a heavier use blend I&#x27;d recommend a bigger one.  Only issue I&#x27;ve had is they do leak if they&#x27;re left in a purse upside-down.  Nothing too bad, but just be careful to store them properly.</li>
    <li> 2 of my caps were missing. &amp; it was hard to put the caps on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent, just what I was expecting! Superb packaging so none of the bottles cracked, chipped, or arrived broken. Will definitely keep this product in mind in the future if ever needed again. Very, very happy!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order these because it seemed too good to be true. 12 bottles for such a low price? I was almost certain they were going to be a let down. Well, I&#x27;m happy to tell you that they are exactly what they are advertised to be. 12 new, high quality, 1 oz amber glass bottles. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Using this color to put bug repellant made from essential oils in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few of these so far &amp; I think this may have more to do with the viscosity of the liquid inside than the caps, but the two I filled with a water based liquid turned out perfect &amp; sprayed, as described, in a fine mist. The one I filled with an oil based liquid sprays out as a straight stream &amp; not a fine mist, which was startling (and a little messy). I even tried to twist &amp; adjust it as you would on a Windex bottle like a dummy, knowing these don&#x27;t work that way. That&#x27;s how surprised I was at the difference between the type of spray I was getting with the different liquids inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use these and I will likely buy more, but don&#x27;t expect any miracles of this fine mist sprayer cap.</li>
    <li> The tops don&#x27;t work properly, the pump sticks after a few sprays.</li>
    <li> Great bottles. Have been using some already for my oils.Best Bottles</li>
    <li> Good quality bottles with spray nozzles and plastic caps. No leaks. Shipped quickly. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I recvd the glass dropper lids instead of the fine mist spray lids. The dropper lids are nice and the bottles are nice and heavy duty though!</li>
    <li> Excellent for essential oil sprays. I&#x27;ve made multiple blends, some with water/witch hazel, others with carrier oils. The water/witch hazel blends spray nicely with a fine mist, the oil blends come in a stream, which I expected since the viscosity is thicker. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Great quality and deal but only enough inventory for 1 order. I came back to purchase more but it is SOLD out??! Boo.</li>
