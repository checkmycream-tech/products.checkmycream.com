      <li>They recommend keeping baking soda and water handy to stop the acid from working.</li>
      <li>Nice even peel.  </li>
      <li>First let me start by saying this product is very good..</li>
      <li>As for the vendor, I was really impressed with their quick delivery and their thoughtfulness for including a free application brush.</li>
      <li>I do want to say that this is a VERY strong peel and should not be used unless you have been doing peels for a while and know how your skin reacts to them.</li>

      <li>Or you&#x27;ll damage your skin/get darker, so it&#x27;s very important to protect your skin at all times.</li>

      <li>Great product met all my expectations thanks :-)</li>
      <li>I like the fact that the solution had a  thicker consistency than most peels.</li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t add it in mass quantities to any lotions or soaps because there is no instructions for appropriate quantity ratios and again it can scar your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You need to know how to use lactic acid. Go slow , be gentle. You can mix it with a cream to make lactic acid lotion</li>
    <li> Works great.  Visibly noticed smoothing of skin tones :)  It burns a lot though lol</li>
    <li> Be very careful with this stuff if you&#x27;re a newbie to chemical peels!  It literally took off all the sun damage junk from my face and I have had several compliments since healing.  It did burn the outer layers of skin off, so I used a triple antibiotic ointment for a few days afterward and peeled like mad for about 5 days.  It was so worth it!  Follow the directions and if you notice any bubbling of the skin, neutralize immediately!  (baking soda and water did the trick)  Can&#x27;t wait for my next go round with this peel!  I have to wait for a few events we have to go to, then I&#x27;ll be back at it.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful I feel after using this peel.  It literally took 10 years off!  Yay!!!</li>
    <li> It stings while on your skin so I can&#x27;t use it too often am afraid it might back fire if I do.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use and helped to clear my skin.  Personally, I diluted the solution to 44% and left it on my face for 90 seconds.  I made a baking soda + water mix to neutralize the lactic acid.  The days following the peel there was no peeling but my skin was  more sensitive so I didn&#x27;t use face makeup for 2-3 days afterwards.  I did wear some eye and lip products.  The peel helped to minimize hyper-pigmentation on my dark skin.  It evened my skin tone, and I noticed reduced pimples over the next few weeks.  I plan on using this peel every 1-2 weeks until my dark spots completely fade.</li>
    <li> Had to add to a lotion to see results. Not as strong as expected for 88%</li>
    <li> This product worked better for me than the tca. It lightened dark spots although skin did begin to peel 2 weeks later.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I get so many compliments on how beautiful and radiant my skin is, it isn&#x27;t even funny!  I do a very light peel twice per week(2 minute peels).  I follow my peels with Alpha Hydrox 12% Glycolic Souffle and Artra Skin Tone Cream for Oily Skin (used twice per day, every day).  Most people confuse me for being my daughter&#x27;s sister or think that I\\&quot;m in my 20&#x27;s still.  I&#x27;m 39 ; 0)</li>
    <li> Amazingly, this smells really nice. Nothing you would expect from such a product. Also, it leaves your skin ridiculously smooth with a nice scent. At first it might seem like it may not work but after a few days of your apllying it to your skin, the skin begans to peel off. Does not burn or itch or what have you. I know this varies from individual to individual depending on skin type but in my case, it did nothing as far as damaging it. All in all, I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> smooth and tight skin the very next day.  I was amazed by how this product worked overnight for me.  I had used other peels but never lactic acid. I will stick with this.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal.  I have this bumpy ice pick type acne scar on my upper lip that annoys me.  I put a little bit of this product on the area as directed, and the bump has slowly peeled down with very little irritation of surrounding skin over several weeks.  I used the product on open skin (I know!  What was I thinking?)  which made a peeling scab for about a week.  I am working up my nerve to use on age spots.  Baking soda works to turn it off, just as directions say.</li>
    <li> Great praduct and fast shipping I shall order soon</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work, not sure why, but it had no affect on the scar on my leg, I have moved onto skin creams.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a while ago and finally got around to using it. I&#x27;m very happy with the results. Since it&#x27;s unbuffered you can dilute it to create a less stong peel and work your way up which is recommended.  It has improved discoloration as well as texture.  This will be a repurchase and I will try their other peels as well.</li>
    <li> If you want to remove layers of dead skin this is the product for you. I used the 88% of Lactic Acid and the next day I was peeling like an onion. It has done its job. My skin is like a 20 year old. It removed brown spots and exfoliated all the sun damaged skin. I am into my third day and I am through the worst of it.  If I see a brown spot I use a Q-tip and dip it into the Lactic  acid and just apply it to the spot for about 30 seconds. Good bye spots. Once you use it you will want to use a lesser percentage to keep your skin glowing and young.  It is also works extremely well on scars, stretch marks, keloids (I am caucasian and I developed them once in a while.)  I used it on every imperfection I could find and was happy to say good bye to all of them.  If you never used a peel before start with a lower percentage because it could be very uncomfortable to jump in to the higher percentages. Also do a patch test just to be sure how your skin type will react. Once you hang of using peels you can slowly go up in percentages.  Thats how I did it. It will take a little while but the results are fantastic. One last thing be sure to read the instructions on the bottle so you know you did it correctly,</li>
    <li> I liked the glycolic better but the lactic still worked pretty well. I would still buy it again. Good product, nice packaging, fast shipping as always. love Planet Eden!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never done a chemical peel prior to ordering this. I have scarring on my upper arms from having Keratosis Pilaris. Beings the scars are old, I decided to jump straight to this (88% lactic acid) rather than something weaker. First use...no results. Assumed perhaps there was a barrier on my skin...from soap or lotion.... I decided to give it another try. I exfoliated my skin very well and avoided all products in the shower. I applied the LA to dry skin... no results. Thinking perhaps it was just the area of my skin... I decided to use it on a more sensitive area of my body, my face. Following all the directions provided, I applied it. No results. I&#x27;m thinking I received a bad batch of the lactic acid. The fan brush that was provided in my order is junk. Overall not impressed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of lactic acid peels and I ordered this product because my skin has built a tolerance to the percentage as I was using so this product was stronger. When I first applied the product I didn&#x27;t leave it on for no more than 3 minutes and it instantly made my face feel itchy and it burned a little I rinsed it off with cold water and applied the recovery cream and I had small red mounds that burned to the touch on my face. The next day those mounds darkened and scarred  my skin and made me more self conscious about my face. I will never buy this product ever again. It&#x27;s been 2 months and I&#x27;m still trying to fade away the dark spot this acid peel gave me and have even skin complexion again.</li>
    <li> Just as described, this acid peel I can  put it even in summer time. I like it very much, great purchase</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use this any more it is too strong&lt;br /&gt;Feel like burned face is become a red for three days</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this peel! I am blessed with good skin at 57; however, I noticed that my completion lost its radiance, thus the need for this peel. I use it a couple times a week for a couple minutes only; its strong but it&#x27;s made a serious change in the texture and tone of my skin. I would highly recommend it for anyone really; if you have a teenaged child or you yourself have acne or acne scars this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Can only leave on for a few minutes or my face will be swollen afterwards. But with regular use (2x monthly) I find it helps my skin look brighter.</li>
    <li> Thus product is strong and harsh, tried twice but no visible change with my dark blotches. You redlky have to psych yourself before trying.........not so sure about this!!!</li>
    <li> I like this for my skin, I&#x27;m very oily on my tzone  an I also have acne scars that it seem to help with already, I can tell at my first use , so buy october smoove flawless for my first trip to las vagas with my  husband an inlaws Yay. I do use blck soap an st. Ives srub vitamen c serum cocobutter palmers an toner victamin c an yes emu oil  aveeno sunsreen . Glowing skin. I&#x27;m very ligth skinn afrian women so everything shows up . So pcos is my issue . Follow instrutions plz . Fast shiping great all around . Good luck to all</li>
    <li> This is really strong stuff!! I would recommend diluting it by half for the first few times you use it. I am trying to use it diluted once a week and use a cotton pad saturated with water first. The fan brush is terrible &amp; I tried it at first then threw it away.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just okay, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks. And I have not seen any improvements what so ever. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Product diminishes age spots if you used consistently and if you stay away from the sun which is the most critical element to removing age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product can sting and burn -- monitor closely or use a product with less lactic acid.</li>
    <li> I love this!! I tried this a few years back and really didn&#x27;t stick to it. Now, I&#x27;m on my 6th or 7th week of doing this twice a week and my skin looks amazing. At first I must have left it on too long because I would burn, but now I&#x27;ve got it down to a science and I can do spot treatments and combine it with my lotion and moisturizer so that I can use it daily. My pores on my forehead are so small I literally have to stretch my skin to see them. My skin feels smooth and soft and the look is dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned if you oil trapped in a pore, a blackhead, you should treat it first because in my experience this  isn&#x27;t as effective on these areas. After eliminating the bump, you can spot treat the area with this to get it like the rest of your skin. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Best customer service and great product. Fast results. Totally awesome. A must have beauty product. Amazing results in minutes. Cheap and produces instant amazing results.</li>
    <li> Works awesome on acne scarring! Use lotion after though! and do not use every day, patience is key. You will see results after a couple days with proper use.</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it promised! I diluted mine to 44% and it was great. Look on YouTube for great how to videos and learn from the mistake of others.</li>
    <li> Worked wonderfully on my skin.</li>
    <li> Not only is this a great product for your face (be careful you don&#x27;t leave on too long) but I also use on my feet and it just melts away my calluses. Follow the directions so you don&#x27;t burn yourself. Great product.</li>
    <li> It is s simple to use even if you&#x27;ve never been familiar with this sort of product.  Just be prepared.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, but be careful! I have had professional peels done with a medical esthetician and this is much more intense. I never actually peeled with the ones done in the spa, however, with this one I have. And it&#x27;s definitely a lot cheaper. Just be sure not to leave it on longer than the recommended time even if you&#x27;ve had other peels in the past. No matter how prepared you think your skin is, don&#x27;t over do it or you will end up with blisters. I came really close the first time thinking that I knew what I was doing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been on the market for a peel that would be safe for my skin type.  This peel is great. I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t cause serious damage with little down time. I diluted the peel to 40% and experienced light flaking of the skin by the third day.  Skin did feel dry and rough but I used my sun block and oils and by the 7th day my skin is bright smooth and bump free.</li>
    <li> I used  product yesterday and I noticed  a  brighter complexion in one use . I looking forward to diminish sun spots  on my cheeks  and excited to found a good product where I don&#x27;t have spend alot of $ at a spa instead.</li>
    <li> Wow great peel to soften the look of lines on face</li>
    <li> I purchased the Lactic acid peel for my mum, she had burns on her face and neck .  She was very upset with the product.</li>
    <li> It burn my face and my face has horrible dark brown marks!I left it on for 1 min yet terrible  results</li>
    <li> My face has healed and the brown spots have faded since I last did this peel. I figured I could leave it on longer since the first time I put it on it didn&#x27;t do anything. So yes its strong and do not leave it on long id say 1 minute 2 tops.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the lactic acid at full strength, and suspect it&#x27;ll be a little while before I do, but I&#x27;ve diluted it to both 22% and 44% strength and have used those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This acid stings significantly less than any of the other acids I&#x27;ve used (salicylic, glycolic, and TCA).  The sting takes longer to appear, is much more amenable to remediation with a breeze from a fan, and is much more tolerable than that of any of the other acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to peeling and have tried something like the Glycolix pads where you can&#x27;t really mess it up because it&#x27;s pre-soaked and you just smear it on, this is definitely the acid I&#x27;d recommend starting with.</li>
    <li> This is a very good peel. I leave it on clean skin for 6-10 min then wash off with a good face wash (not soap) A very gentile milk wash&lt;br /&gt;is what I have. Then I oil my face/neck with sesame oil, put a very warm almost hot towel on my face/neck to drive the oil in.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased. Have order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this peel for over a month now and it works great. It has really softened my wrinkles and made my skin look smooth and feel soft. It has helped even out my skin tone which is why I started peels to begin with over a year ago. I do want to say that this is a VERY strong peel and should not be used unless you have been doing peels for a while and know how your skin reacts to them. I can&#x27;t even imagine using this peel as a beginner. I started out with a 35% Glycolic peel over a year ago and have steadily worked my way up increasing the concentration I use. I changed over to lactic acid when I did the combo Lactic/Glycolic peel. My skin just seems to like Lactic acid better.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, I left it on for ten minutes which is what I had been doing with my previous peels (Again, having worked my way up from 1 minute to 3..etc., back when I first started doing peels.). It was fine but I would recommend that even with long time peel users DO NOT leave it on as long as you have been with other peels. At least not the first time. Try cutting the time in half and then, if there is no problem, go ahead and increase the  time you leave it on. I should have been more cautious but luckily I was fine. This is an excellent peel that I will order again. The price is great and it was delivered three days after I placed the order. Very satisfied with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> It helps hsving rxperince with medical grade peels. Ilo e the product because of the end results.  I have tough dark spots, so I use it every other day on those days. It exfoliates beautifully. Once s month I do my entie face on Sunday and Tues beautiful skin.  I get compliments on my skin all the time. The dark spots are fading. Soon no makeup.</li>
    <li> This stuff does everything it claims it does. Really watch the time.  I left it on for a little longer than I was supposed to and I was just fine.</li>
    <li> I used it the first time, left it on 90 seconds, no problems other than a bit of tingling and some redness.  After 2 weeks during which I used facial sunscreen, I did another peel, this time for 3 minutes (almost).  I had to rinse it off with cold water &amp; baking soda because my skin was tingling madly, and then the area to the right of my mouth grew very red, peeled, and then turned purplish. I now have to see a dermatologist and yes, the company is going to pay for it because I&#x27;ve contacted them re: this terrible product.  I followed their instructions to the letter and still wound up with burnt skin, and now I have to go out in public with my face messed up. I wish I had just kept to the 90 seconds, because trying to work my way up to 10 minutes as suggested by the company did not work at all.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says. Follow instructions very carefully this product will burn skin. After healing from my misuse, I was happy. I used this product to get rid of acne scarring. Product really works just respect it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago and finally decided to try it 4 days ago. I followed all the directions and only left the product on for about 30 seconds. I didn&#x27;t notice anything except slight redness around the eyes...until 4 days after use I woke up to a bright red swollen face with my eyes swollen shut. I had read that this could happen but it was so bad that my husband made me go to the ER that night. They gave me steroid pills, and Benadryl and let me know how stupid I was to try this myself. The next day the swelling was down a bit but I had hives all over my face. I then saw a dermatologist and had to embarrassingly tell her my dumb mistake. She gave me hydrocortisone cream 2.5% and told me to apply that and Vaseline or aquafor lotion a few times  day to make sure my skin stayed moist. Yet again I was told how dumb this was to do on my own and asked me to show her the product that I bought and where I got it from. She said she&#x27;s surprised it&#x27;s legal to buy something that could potentially completely ruin your skin. She also told me that this particular product of 88% is extremely extremely high to be used at home. This has been so miserable and painful that you could not pay me enough money to try it again...I don&#x27;t care what its supposed to do it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
    <li> very good and easily comparative product quality to the expensive salon quality out there.&lt;br /&gt;its a very potent and high grade acid thats why i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for starters to start with this percentage. The quality is good and results are true to medical grade lactic acid peel.</li>
    <li> Works well if you know how to use correctly! Fast shipping,.</li>
    <li> only giving a 3 star now beccause i only used it once. i havent had results yet to talk about.... will post a follow up review at a later time. the shipment time was 3 days, excellent!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice even peel.  Pretty powerful stuff.  Recommended for folks with past peel experience.  Remember to protect skin from sun wind and weather.</li>
    <li> The peels by my doctor left scars under my chin and discoloration on my cheeks, so I ordered this to try on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After testing this acid alone as a mask, it also burnt and scarred an area of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this as an add-in to a lotion.  I recommend adding this to a lotion that works for you.  A drop of this lactic acid added to a a few drops of a simple lotion, such as oil of olay complete, sensitive skin formula works really well.  Do not get it anywhere around the eyes or eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t add it in mass quantities to any lotions or soaps because there is no instructions for appropriate quantity ratios and again it can scar your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it feels like its burning, it is too strong, so use the baking soda and water wash to remove it immediately.  They recommend keeping baking soda and water handy to stop the acid from working.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a peel connoisseur having spent hundreds and hundreds over the years on medi-spa peels. This is far and away the strongest of them all. I have sensitive skin, only because I am a Retin A user of about 15 years. So, take note: if you use retin A or retinol products, please stop them a week before you use ANY chemical peel. I peeled for 7 days after a 3 day wait for the peeling to commence. Like a continual, fluffy peel. It did improve my forehead melasma brought on by past pregnancies. I would not suggest hitting this again until you are through peeling for several days.</li>
    <li> Peels are great to use on your face/other body parts. I&#x27;ve used this one on my face, neck, hands and my arms as well! The bottle can last you if you&#x27;re able to dilute it just right for your needs/areas you&#x27;ll be using it at! The fan brush didn&#x27;t do anything for me, I&#x27;d had to use my makeup fan brush which is more durable to apply the peel. If you&#x27;d have problems with the fan brush, that comes with the peel. You can use a makeup fan brush or a thin cotton pad! I&#x27;ve used 88% on me &#x27;cause I am used to doing peels, but if you&#x27;re not used to doing them. Make sure to dilute it to the right % for the area you&#x27;ll use it for. I&#x27;d didn&#x27;t peel much with this peel at all, but I&#x27;d did peel a little in certain areas on the face. The instruction are helpful that comes with the peel, which comes in handy for beginners. Simple to follow and easily to apply as well. Make sure you&#x27;ll work yourself up to higher % and also on how long you&#x27;ll allow it to sit on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t have to really sit that long on your face/neck. But if you want to allow it to sit a little on your hands/arms is fine! Just make sure afterwards you&#x27;ll protect/baby your skin, and wear sunscreen before going outside! Or you&#x27;ll damage your skin/get darker, so it&#x27;s very important to protect your skin at all times.</li>
    <li> This product takes a little time an a few applications to peel even tho it&#x27;s 88% it&#x27;s not that harsh at all I expected to peel more but overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the product!</li>
    <li> Works great. Be careful to follow directions for this is powerful stuff.</li>
    <li> Even watered down this still burned my skin and scarred it easily.</li>
    <li> Be careful you can burn your skin!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as the first one that I bought; I  do not dilute it more than I did with the first bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this sparingly on my fair skin. Make sure you jave a repair cream ready for use. I also use almond oil as needed.</li>
    <li> great product. Love to do business with Planet Eden....great prices and care from this seller with plenty of info with any order. Great packaging too. All products look brand new in  their containers. Can&#x27;t say the same for some others.</li>
    <li> what in the world is this ? i should recieve a refund because first of all, it doesnt do anything but BURN the spots where acne is and then scabs up so bad</li>
    <li> Saw visible results with one application.</li>
    <li> I ordered this peel about a month ago and wanted to try it because I never tried a peel before. I must&#x27;ve been crazy to try this strong high grade peel first. Should&#x27;ve started out with a lower percentage but I was looking for faster results. That&#x27;s a bad decision I&#x27;ve made in a very long time lol. Anyways, I rated this peel a 4 out of 5 because it burns bad after you&#x27;ve kept it on for about a minute or two but the results came out fantastic. The very next day my skin started to peel in which that was unexpected. Remember, you must wear a sunscreen after doing a peel if you&#x27;re going to be out during the day to protect your face from the sun. It will be sensitive after the peel. I moisturized also to soothe the sensitivity and dryness of it. After about a week of my face peeling, my skin was much brighter and healthier looking. The end results turned out great. I already recommended this product to my sister who was looking for something to help with acne and dark marks. I would recommend this to anyone else but be careful not to leave it on too long because you can burn your skin if not properly done.</li>
    <li> First time to use at home acid peal.  It worked.  definitely NOT water.  But it wasn&#x27;t so strong that i had rubbery blisters peeling from my face.  I followed directions closely and used cocoanut oil to moisturize heavily and consistently for 4 days following it.  My face was done lightly scabbing after that and all the scabs had come off.  No one else could tell that the dark tint to my face was scabs.  Then the cocoanut oil made the scabs fall off within half a day or so.  There is enough in this bottle for up to probably 6 months of application to your face if you do it every week.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite prepared for how incredibly strong this product is, so my face &amp; I were in a little shock after only a minute or so. I actually thought something really bad might happen. Luckily, I followed the directions they sent along with the order and had my own after-care products ready. It took about 2 full days for my face to go from looking semi-charred to bright &amp; fresh! Be sure to have ready plenty of neutralizer and after-care products made specifically for acid peels.</li>
    <li> i have a caramel skin tone... which is hard to keep even. i bought this originally to put on my underarms( i have dark underarms) my dermatologist suggested using a lactic acid based cream (amlactin) on it, so i thought a lactic acid peel would help also.&lt;br /&gt;this is the first peel i ever tried. i did one once every 7 days&lt;br /&gt;week 1&lt;br /&gt;i cleaned the area with soap and water waited about 30min then applied the peel to my underarms( for 1min), face (for 1min) neutralized with baking soda and water paste, after i applied eucerin lotion.&lt;br /&gt;-results&lt;br /&gt;my skin was a little red, it felt fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;week 2&lt;br /&gt;underarms ( for 3min) face( 3min) feet (5min)&lt;br /&gt;-results&lt;br /&gt;a little red, my face seemed to get more pimples, but i read that the peels bring impurities to the surface. but my underarms where a lot smoothers, the pores where less visible, and slight improvement with the darkness. my feet where sooooo soft!&lt;br /&gt;week 3&lt;br /&gt;underarms (5min) face( 5min) feet (5min)&lt;br /&gt;-results&lt;br /&gt;underarm was a little sensitive, but even smoother and the darkness seems to be getting better and better.my face has cleared up a lot, the pimples of week 2 healed nicely, and my feet are feeling baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am going to take a 2-3 break from the peel ( give my skin time to rest ) but i will most like keep the same routine : once every 7 days, for 3 weeks then, let my skin rest for 2-3weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product!&lt;br /&gt;*make sure not to leave it on to long, IT WILL BURN YOUR SKIN.</li>
    <li> I already order Skin Obsession glycolic acid peel 70% will be finished using after then I another next order which 40% - 88% Lactic Acid Peel.</li>
    <li> I have KP, acne, and uneven skin tone. The first time I put it on my face felt a little tight, I read that is the skin thats going to peel away. On the 2nd day my chin was peeling, on the 3rd the side of my mouth a little, and on the 5th, my cheek my chin (tons of dead skin), side of mouth (lots), and a little bit on my forehead.. This is just on my first try! Oh yeah and before putting it on my face I took it out and mixed it with water (just in case) and I am glad I did! I used,&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000052ZB8 Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Combination Skin, 4 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to put on after and it really relives my skin from dryness and a little soreness I had when it was peeling my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad is that I didnt put enough water and manage to burn, but its all cool because its peeling off anyway!</li>
    <li> I have been using this after running across it on youtube after doing searches for skincare with dark pigmentation (spots), I can see a noticeable difference and will continue to use it to do light peels taking off layers slowly ...you&#x27;re able to go out and be normal rather than like some of the others that cause extremely heavy scabbing before it flakes off, this is truly not even noticeable but gets the job done successfully</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t made a difference.... Not very pleased. I leave it on for about 3 1/2 minutes, I can definitely feel the burn...but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made my skin any better. I use it once every 2 weeks to allow healing time, and my pores are the same as they were before purchasing this product. My skin tone has NOT EVENED out... Still have redness and some minor sun spots/brown patches.. Exactly the same as it was prior to use. Also, my skin is no smoother than before &amp; I&#x27;ve been using this since February. Going to try a different peel.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t work just burnt skin made me darker nd no peel at all</li>
    <li> This is the only company I will order from because I&#x27;ve had nothing but great results every time.  The price is unbelievable and the quality is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, this was what I used as my very first peel. Honestly, I knew to start with lactic acid for a first peel but I went with a higher percentage because I felt I had pretty tough skin.  I&#x27;d been using retin a for 6 months, and personally, I had tried everything under the sun OTC.  So I purchased this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most people, this is a very strong peel, and I will say that I was so inexperienced that I am surprised I didn&#x27;t do some damage.  I put the peel on and waited 5 minutes.  I neutralized and rinsed as per instructions.  My face was red, but it calmed down within a couple of hours.  The next day, my face was just fine.  Stupidly, I thought I had not left the product on long enough.  I guess I expected my face to be dryer or some kind of difference, so I did another application.  This time, my face got really red, very quickly.  I&#x27;m sure I should not have done this because over the next couple of days, my face was dry and patchy, and took about 5 or 6 days to just get back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I did this peel, I left it on 5 minutes and neutralized.  This time I left the skin alone and moisturized.  Now, I saw what a superficial peel is suppose to do.  My skin looked great after 2 days.  It looked fresh and smooth.  This is what a Lactic Acid peel is suppose to do.  I guess the word \\&quot;peel\\&quot; is very misleading for new users.  Your skin might micro-peel, but this is a very gently peel (when used correctly).  However, I do recommend a much lower percentage for a first or second peel.  Just please have some patience, it is your face and you don&#x27;t want it to look worse.  Please try the product out the day before on a small patch of skin.  I use the top of my hand with just a small amount (the skin is thinner there) and get an idea of how long to keep it on.  Also, I cannot stress enough to please neutralize, neutralize, neutralize.  A box of baking soda cost 60 cents, so why wouldn&#x27;t you.  Have a great time with this one.</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying this product is very good.. It dimishes fine lines, brightens face, and leaves the face soft and dewy. However do not leave this product on for longer than 10mins if your face is not use to high grade peels. Because it will burn your skin. Also rinse well and please neutralize after use. I use this product 6wks on every week than 6wks off. I use less in the summer only before events with a good sunscreen which I wear daily. Excellent product if directions are followed and proper caution taken.</li>
    <li> AS usual this product is exactly as described. However it is for experienced people who are familiar with the action on their skin. Test if your not sure! Great Bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> Just don&#x27;t leave on too long, it will burn your skin. I use this every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Works as described, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 4 applications.  Not sure if its continued use will help.  So far, no noticeable results, so neither good or bad.  Will keep trying.</li>
    <li> I used this peel for 3 months I never got any burns or sensitivity but there was no change in my skin.</li>
    <li> Every peel i&#x27;ve tried so far has been good and this one is no different. It works great. Just be sure to follow the directions and don&#x27;t over-do it</li>
    <li> First, the shipping was incredibly  fast!! It said, it would take over a week but was here in 3 days. I was def. happily suprise !! I have used this product twice. This is my first time ever using any kind of facial  peel . The first time i diluted the peel to about 8 percent with purified water.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any burning or discomfort until i neutralized with baking soda and water mixture but it was very minor . Just enough to know that the peel was working. I waited a week but never had any peeling or flaking what so ever. I did notice that after my skin felt tight and was a little red but disappeared an hour later. The next peel i decided to try a little higher percentage so i diluted the peel to about 14 percent. This time i felt it a little more but not allot. I had the same effect as with the first peel a little red and my face felt tight. I also did both my hands but didn&#x27;t feel it as much because your skin is thicker of course. I didn&#x27;t peel or have any skin flaking even though i tried a higher percentage. As of today like an hr ago i did one more peel this time i made it about 28 percent and also did my neck and chest. It was a little more intense but still pretty mild... i did notice my face was more red as well as my chest. I will update if i experience any peeling or flaking. Also, just to let you know make sure you neutralize with a mixture of water and baking soda because it makes the lactic acid stop working. When you do it does make a sizzling kinda noise so don&#x27;t be alarmed. I read other reviews in which they left saying this was Just oil and water i promise u that mine was not you can feel it working. It&#x27;s def worth the time and money. Also remember it takes a few sessions before you start noticing results.. it&#x27;s very very important that you use sunscreen after every peel for at least a week..</li>
    <li> it burned a little but no frosting next day my skin began to flake now it feels better &amp; improved a great deal</li>
    <li> This product does not work on my skin type. I applied it according to the directions but did not notice any results. No burning, no peeling, no change in skin even after 2 applications. I am going to continue to use it. It may show results over time. Next time i&#x27;ll try something else. My skin is combination to oily. It is a bargain and I know it works well for others. However, I need to do more research to find what will work for me.</li>
    <li> The product itself was okay, I didn&#x27;t peel as much as I wanted. I even did the darn peel every week but I just wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the service there was a mix up with the order, they sent me the wrong order but they did fixed it and let me keep the product they sent me along with what I ordered.</li>
    <li> This was my first peel so I was very excited to get to receive this product. The delivery time was not long at all. The first time i used this i left it on for 4 minutes, i got no peeling or flaking at all. I waited a week and tried again this time for a long period of time (8 mins) still i got no results. I would not recommend this product but different individuals have different reactions i suppose.</li>
    <li> Works great, rejuvenates my skin, clears poors,</li>
    <li> When I first use it work...after face broke out trouble.</li>
    <li> After seeing the price at Sally for half strength I figured why not. I do dillute it with water but is awesone for my sunspots or when I start to breakout. I use it about one  week for 5 min then exfolliate. Yes my skin get sensitive but it&#x27;s nothing compared to going to get a micro and with weekly treatment s the results are the same  but much more cost effective.</li>
    <li> really good peel, not super deep, you would have to step up to TCA etc for that, but does a good job, you don&#x27;t get that pinched dry feel after using it whilst waiting for the peel to work either so that&#x27;s a plus, just helps even out your skin tone and &#x27;refresh&#x27; your skin. fit use would leave on only a couple of minutes as most if you&#x27;ve never peeled before, but can be left longer, up to 10 mins I believe they recommend but I personally think up to 5 is just fine. I simply use a cotton bus dipped in the solution to spread it on the areas I want done and after x amount of mins I then wash off/neutralize with a baking soda wash.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t see results in reality I though I was.. I have try 50/ percent but it haven&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> The first couple of times I used this it worked perfectly, brightened my face, and led to very little burning with no recovery time needed. Of course that wasn&#x27;t good enough and I began pushing the limits and actually charring my face a bit. The product is effective but keeping it on too long is something the manufacturer can&#x27;t prevent. The product came with a slip of paper with directions. Another area that I messed up was not using enough water mixed with the baking soda. I had a shallow glass full of baking soda and just a bit of water thinking it would be more soothing. I was terribly mistaken. Stick to the directions and you&#x27;ve got a real winner.</li>
    <li> This worked beyond perfect the first couple of months but after that I saw no change in my skin whatsoever then it started hurting my skin and now my skin&#x27;s back dark with unwanted lines, chemical burns and darkness. If you buy this, either spread uses out to 1 1/2-2 weeks each or stop usage immediately after bad results!</li>
    <li> I use this product every 3 weeks. My skin has improved dramatically. My moderate acne is now no acne after 3 months of using. My skin is more even and toned.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, it made the dark spots peel off and gave me new skin, can&#x27;t handle more that three minutes though, it burns.</li>
    <li> I bought this a a treatment for KP, but it did not help the few spots of acne i had are now gone though so.....</li>
    <li> Great product met all my expectations thanks :-) it really helped me get rid out of my acne scars and dark spots also cleared my skin. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced this might be simply oil and water in a bottle. No results whatsoever. However, it could also be the case that I take such immaculate care of my skin that there simply is not any shedding to be had.  It is true that when I went for a facial the aesthetician told me that I has no clogged pores and thus needed no extractions; instead, she substituted a longer facial massage (I really wanted to experience an extraction, but that is getting a bit off track).  I cannot, with certainty, say the product it ineffective since the other reviews tell me that it does indeed work for some.  For me, nada.</li>
    <li> So it worked on some parts and burned other parts of my skin in the same region I&#x27;m just glad it didn&#x27;t burn my face. Part of my neck was burned.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job I suppose I just don&#x27;t know why it burned the area I put it on last so badly.&lt;br /&gt;The part that wasn&#x27;t burned seems smoother and clearer.</li>
    <li> Most intense chemical resurfacer one will find under twenty dollars! Fan brush allows product to be applied smoothly and evenly to problem areas. Nuetralizaion can easily be done with baking soda and H2O mixture.</li>
    <li> Very strong. Scabs formed on my face that took weeks to come off. Overall, you would see a tightening and brightening effect , but the next day it was gone. I would not purchase this again. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I used this for my own facial yesterday. I washed my face and toned, did a exfoliation first to prepare the skin. Not necessary, but I wanted spa results. I left it on for 6 minutes because I have had peels before. I recommend 2 minutes for the 1st time users.&lt;br /&gt;You feel a little burning like a normal spa peel. You can fan your self with a paper fan while you wait, and don&#x27;t use to much. To rinse, I used cold water first then a baking soda solution on cotton pads to deactivate. My face is amazing. TIPS:: PUT VASELINE OR LIP BARRIER ON LIPS BEFORE STARTING, KEEP EYES TIGHTLY CLOSED WHILE RINSING. BE CAREFUL NOT TO ADD TO MUCH AROUND THE NASAL FOLD AREA. If you have thin or tender skin, be sure to test it on the inside of your arm before trying on your face.</li>
    <li> I love love this bottle of acid! It so powerful and effective. It has made my pores smaller my skin smoother and brighter all in just one application. As for the vendor, I was really impressed with their quick delivery and their thoughtfulness for including a free application brush. I will definitely order again. But, I need to stress that this is really powerful not for the beginner. I have been using lactic acid for about 5 years on and off, So I have very high tolerance, but I was only able to leave this on my face for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> Burnt my skin will not chance trying this again....</li>
    <li> I used ny peel on Sunday and started peeling only on my neck on Friday, the skin underneath is looking great. I micro peeled on my face.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Rinses off good.</li>
    <li> This a good peel. I used it on my forehead once every 2 weeks. I see improvements after every peel. Make sure you don&#x27;t forget your sunscreen!! Very important</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product every day for a week nothing has happened and no change what a waste of money!</li>
    <li> So i tried this twice already within a 3 weeks, it was the worse pain i&#x27;ve ever experienced. It&#x27;s a shame because i read such great reviews about this product and the effects it gives to your wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Professional-strength  product.  After one use, my daughter asked if I&#x27;d gotten a forehead lift.</li>
    <li> I used this on my face and my feet. it really works great, but you must be careful not to burn skin by leaving on too long or not neutralizing it. I use baking soda paste for that.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin around my mouth that darkens from too much sun exposure making me look like I have a mustache. I have tried many products to try to lighten the skin and this by far is the most effective method. I apply it to the dark spots once a week, and after a few weeks my skin has lightened to my regular skin tone. As long as I wear sunscreen whenever going out I don&#x27;t have to worry about my skin darkening anymore.</li>
    <li> is strong and you have to listen to the instructions that come with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous peels (jessners, tca10-30%) glycolic 40, and other brands of lactic in 30%. I&#x27;ve seen results with all of them but none that have targeted my post inflammatory hyper-pigmentation like this one! I applied it and waited the entire 10mins( not recommended for first time users). The next morning after showering, I noticed a thick layer of skin had peeled on my cheeks and t-zone. Slight peeling around neck area. I mean it shed like snake skin. I like the fact that the solution had a  thicker consistency than most peels. Really helped with ingrown hair bumps... Will continue to buy only this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I did this wrong, but after one 3 minute session, I had blister type sores in a few places. Had to hide inside until they healed, it looked gross. And left light red scarring, which defeated my purpose!</li>
    <li> My bottle did not work but my friends bottle did.  A bit of a hit or miss but if you do get a good bottle, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I don&#x27;t spend 100&#x27;s for my facial.  There are some videos on you tube that shows how to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have excema, so after burning the crap out of my face with just normal lotion and regular products I decide to buy an acid, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it makes sense now, maybe it balanced the PH of my skin or something, but my face is fine while using this product, and inflammation is reduced, which is the main cause of my breakouts and excema!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It&#x27;s been so far the best peel I&#x27;ve ever bought, but I do have to say you need to be very careful because It is very strong I did got some blisters although they did go away and I have no marks. Just do a test before you put it al over your face!</li>
    <li> I recently used this Lactic Acid peel and I see no change in tone or clarity. I&#x27;m an african american woman with hyperpigmentation on the body. Which means my body is different tones and textures.  I used this on my body. I made my own Lactic acid lotion by dumping the whole bottle of this product in my Nivea lotion bottle and using it everyday and I see nothing no peeling or anything..</li>
    <li> I used the lactic acid peel full strength to give myself a facial peel after a particularly long day at work. I received this product in the mail today and when I got home I had to open it right away and test it out. I absolutely love this stuff. I left it on my face without dilution for about four minutes before I started getting scared about causing a burn, which I had previously experienced around the delicate mouth area with glycolic acid. This peel hardly burned at all, however. I used the fan brush included with the acid to apply after washing my face and applying toner. I noticed right away that this acid has a strong odor, but it&#x27;s not unbearable. Also, it has a thick consistency unlike salicylic acid and glycolic acid. I was surprised to discover that lactic acid is actually very mild even at 88%, but I have read that. Anyway...after I neutralized and rinsed, when I looked into the mirror I was sooo impressed. My skin is *ridiculously* soft, smooth and it glows. Unlike with other chemical peels it did not make my skin rough feeling, which I understand is by virture of the fact that there is no &amp;#34;downtime&amp;#34; with lactic acid. My face looks very clean and feels refreshed. I moisturized heavily with hyaluronic acid, royal jelly and Vaseline intenseive repair lotion to keep the skin hydrated and supple. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with the main intent of giving myself a full body peel, which I&#x27;ll try on a later date. In the mean time I mixed some of the acid with my regular body lotion without diluting it and slathered it all over my body. Like I said, this stuff kinda stinks so I&#x27;ll be sleeping with it on and washing it off in the morning. The immediate results were just as satisfying: incredibly soft skin. I can&#x27;t wait to try this as a chemical peel for my entire body...</li>
