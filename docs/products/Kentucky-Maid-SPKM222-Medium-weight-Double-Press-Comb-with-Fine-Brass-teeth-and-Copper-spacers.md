    <li> I bought this as an replacement, however I was a bit disappointed that the weight of the comb is too light. I have found it rather difficult to gauge when I am pressing the back of my head. I will order a heavier comb soon until then I will use my old one.</li>

    <li> Excellent hot comb. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I loved this product and was very pleased after it took forever to arrive.</li>
    <li> Close to the hot comb that my grandmother used to use on my hair.  Fine teeth, so I didn&#x27;t have to keep running this pressing comb through my natural hair.  There is no snagging &amp; pulling with this comb which is why I insisted on the Kentucky Maid brand. Maintained a consistently even heat during usage.  I was able to get a smooth press with minimal product usage.  My hair remained bouncy and silky.  I recommend using with a ceramic oven, rather than stove top for more even heating.  Remember not to overheat so that you don&#x27;t ruin the tempering, as I did with my first one.</li>
    <li> after using many months it&#x27;s now seasoned, I like it.</li>
    <li> The bestbest pressing comb I have ever bought. work in beauty salon and use daily.just love it.the best pressing comb.</li>
    <li> I have 4C hair and I am natural.  This hot comb makes it easy for me after a wash to get my hair straight.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this comb because of the two rows of teeth...gets the job done quicker!  I wish it came in more sizes.</li>
    <li> This Press comb is amazing it grabs all the rough spots as it straightens the hair. JUST what I was looking for it to do. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and it arrived EARLIER that promised. Great bonus</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been going from beauty store to beauty store but they don&#x27;t have press combs and if they do then it&#x27;s not even close to the one I&#x27;m looking for. Though this was the exact thing that I had in mind and it works amazingly.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product I wont us any other pressing comb.  Gets my hair straighter than any other pressing comb and any flat iron.  Hence the name &amp;#34;DOUBLE PRESS.&amp;#34;  Make sure you use it properly as with any heat utensil using it improperly can cause some damage.  I bought four; gave two to my mother (since she doesn&#x27;t have one), I gave one to my sister (since she has one already), and I kept one for myself (because I have one I&#x27;m using already).  You can have them for a long time if you take good care of it.  Hope you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mine.</li>
    <li> Love these combes will keep buying from the Kentucky maid fromnow on. Doesnt catch my hair leave me feeling all silky..LOVE</li>
    <li> Good price and I like it.</li>
    <li> I like the extra comb part on the edge. .get when getting close to the scalp</li>
    <li> I have been using this tool for quite a long time, usually getting it from the local Beauty Supply.  Time has changed and this tool is no longer as popular, at first it was ordered for me as I purchased one every other month it seems.  The beauty supply that I brought the 222 from discontinued the order; as I became the only client and I had to go on line directly to the company, which I did, but after a time they no longer had this item in stock either.  I just took a chance and thought I would check with Amazon, as they seem to have everything else I want.  Am I dealing with a fraudulent company (Kentucky Maid)?  How is it that you have this in stock and they don&#x27;t?  Do you have more in stock that I can order?  Thank you</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and made of great quality. Heats evenly and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
