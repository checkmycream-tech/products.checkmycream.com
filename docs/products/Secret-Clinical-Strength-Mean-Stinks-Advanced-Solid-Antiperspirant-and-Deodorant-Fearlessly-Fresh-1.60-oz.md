<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great deoderant/antiperspirant for those with sensitive skin and nervous sweating.  Provides all day coverage and doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash like most other products and brands.  A little pricey for it&#x27;s size.  I like the sot solid as it goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothing and feels more natural to me than solids, sprays and roll-on gels.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome will def buy this again</li>
    <li> Smells great, and i put it on before bedtime. Works really well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Keels me pretty dry and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I had high expectations of this Secret Clinical Protection deodorant. I&#x27;ve used other brands of clinical protection like Dove and even Suave with great success, and use those on a regular basis. I&#x27;ve used other regular deos from Secret and always had a good experience so I got this Stress Response version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice tropical fragrance but it does not have good wetness control. My underarms were not dry, it felt like I had no deo on let alone clinical protection. Usually clinical protection will keep my underarms dry even on a warm day but this deo failed me on a relatively cold day. So won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> I used Degree for years, but it stopped working for me. This does the trick, and it doesn&#x27;t have that wet, sticky feeling you sometimes get from a more liquid formula.</li>
    <li> I love the smell - it&#x27;s a soft citrus scent, reminds me of orange cream soda. I am so tired of baby powder scents, love the refreshing citrus kind.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a few years now and will continue to do so as long as it&#x27;s being sold. It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing. I sweat pretty heavily during summer and this protects better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried (and I have tried a huge variety). I shower in the morning and put this on afterward; it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. It works so well, and smells great. It has a light, but lasting, citrus smell. You don&#x27;t get a lot on the container, but a little goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need to heap gobs of this stuff on or reapply a million times a day. Its a great antiperspirant, and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for me as an antiperspirant, but I think I sweat more than the average woman.  I do really like the smell though!  I&#x27;m not a big floral or baby powder smell person, I&#x27;m more of a fruity girl, &amp; love citrus which is probably why I like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried many deodorants over the years, but none seemed to work well for the &amp;#34;stress&amp;#34; sweat.  I tried this product when it first hit the market and love it.  It is awesome - no more odor from stress sweat.  I normally buy it at my local stores, but it was on sale one day on Amazon, so I ordered it.  If you have issues with odor and wetness as a result of stress - try this - it works!</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing and it lasts me all day and night. No joke. I will be buying this product over, and over, and over again.</li>
    <li> This makes me sweat. I do not like it at all</li>
    <li> Smells great, reminds me of the summer, i love it</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time today and it smells so good! Went on smoothly and has been very effective so far. No irritation so am pleased so far. Got it at a great price with Subscribe and Save and a coupon, so no complaints there!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful - product is great.  Unfortunately shipping took forever! hence the 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about a deodorant smelling badly or too strong. This one has a nice scent and keeps me dry as well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely stop perspiration, but helps more than other deodorants!</li>
    <li> I have never \\&quot;worked up a sweat\\&quot; in my life.  I am in very good shape, I don&#x27;t even sweat doing physical work-out activities.  One day, something was wrong.  I could not figure it out, went to 2 of my doctors and said this was stress-sweat.  I had never even heard of this before.  They said it comes from very high anxiety, which I did/do have with ailing parents and other issues - by extreme, I mean my hands were shaking, I couldn&#x27;t type, couldn&#x27;t spell, etc.  When I was calmer it was fine, but I went to overdrive mode, it was back.  I saw an advertisement for a bunch of different Secret sticks they offered. I tried it, and it works.  The only drawback for me is the little wheel that you turn to advance the deodorant is somewhat hard to push.  I recommend this and keep one in stock at all times.  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret brand deodorants for as long as I can remember.  When their Clinical Strength line was released, I switched over to that and have been using the smooth solid Stress Response version for many years now.  As a female that sweats more than the than average woman, I won&#x27;t say it is 100% effective in terms of odor and wetness protection. It doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours for me, half a day perhaps, less depending on how hot it is out. This scent is one of the better ones, slightly citrus-y.  For true wetness protection, I&#x27;ve had to use prescription strength solutions.  Secret clinical is useful for cooler weather/not so stressful days.  Also, I would avoid the Secret Clinical Clear Gels; they&#x27;re pretty useless.</li>
    <li> This is the best!  I have been a Secret fan for years and this certainly does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I was using the Natural Crystal deodorant stick for several years but it seemed to quit working for me. I live in CA where it gets to be 110 degrees in the summer. I have tried just about every brand known to woman. I&#x27;ve even tried some men&#x27;s deodorant&#x27;s as well. Believe it or not, Old Spice &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; works pretty good, but I am always searching for the holy grail of deodorants. I was at Walmart and browsing the deodorant isle and saw the infamous &amp;#34;Oprah&#x27;s Lifeclass&amp;#34; symbol on Secret Clinical Strength Deodorant so I scanned it on Amazon&#x27;s website and started reading reviews. They were mostly positive so I took a second look. The price was $7.94 for a 1.6 ounce stick, which was higher than all the other deodorants, especially considering the size. Not to mention, when I opened the box, the product is only filled 1/2 way up. But we all know, if it has Oprah&#x27;s stamp of approval on it, you are going to pay the piper! I decided to give it a shot. As the reviewers stated, it does have a citrus scent, however, I do not find it to be overpowering, nor do I find it to linger all day. I did find that it works, but it is only March here (about 75 degrees) so I will have to update everyone in July when it is 110 degrees. I usually sweat a bit at night and I find that I have no odor in the morning, and with this deodorant, I could get dressed and not even worry about re-applying if I had to.  It has staying power and will hold its own.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, so far, this one actually earns the Oprah seal and is worth the $7.94 at Walmart, but I went on Amazon and if you Subscribe &amp; Save it is only $5.99 so that&#x27;s exactly what I did.  Give it a try for $6, if you don&#x27;t like it you can always cancel the S&amp;S.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, by the way, one of the most important things I forgot to mention that was very important to me. Funny enough, no one on the box does it say &amp;#34;no white marks&amp;#34; as many do, but I have tried so many that say &amp;#34;no white marks&amp;#34; and they lie. I wore this deodorant with a black tank top my first day on purpose to see if it would leave marks and NOTHING! The one thing they should have mentioned on the box that they didn&#x27;t. Maybe they figure that no one would believe them, since every other product that says that, lies (including some other Secret products).  Anyway, a very pleasant surprise.this deodorant with a black tank top my first day on purpose to see if it would leave marks and NOTHING!

    <li> Best deodorant for me</li>
    <li> I do not get wet and sweat very little, but I do have odor.  This is awesome for both but I particularly notice that it has great odor control.  Better than any deodorant I have used.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant that works for me!</li>
    <li> Seems the same as original</li>
    <li> I hate the fact that I sweat more than your normal woman. It has driven me absolutely insane for years and I finally caved and got this. I put it on before bed and use my regular secret deordorant during the day. I have noticed a big difference in the amount of sweat under my arms and I am no longer embarrassed to lift my arms!</li>
    <li> Does not seem any better than basic deodorant</li>
    <li> At last, all day protection!!  I finally caved &amp; purchased this which I consider expensive for a deodorant and I am so glad I did.  I always knew that compared to other girls I always sweat more in the armpit area and after a long day could smell myself.  After getting laser hair removal in the armpit region this problem worsened exponentially to the point where I had to wash my armpits and reapply deodorant by lunch time.  I work for a large global bank and there are about 100 people on my floor. Needless to say, this killed my confidence and was embarrassing.  For reference, I&#x27;ve used Dove Baby Powder scent for years which I was mostly very happy with until getting Laser Hair Removal. Since using Secret Clinical Strength I go ALL DAY with one application in the morning!!  What&#x27;s even better is the smell.  It is so lovely and refreshing.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works well for me. I never seem to sweat, even from stress, since I started using it. It is more expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice and it works well but i think this product is overpriced and i will never pay full price for this but i would purchase again IF at a good deal.</li>
    <li> THIS.  STUFF.  WORKS!  Exceptionally well, I might add.  Nothing works for me, but this does!  I could almost skip a day, but I have a lot of armpit aroma, so almost but no cigar.  I don&#x27;t care what else I use, NOHTHING, and I mean NOTHING works like this.  Finally, no more stinky pits!!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant, I work in a hectic environment constantly on my feet moving around and I sweat a lot because of that, especially in the summer time, this is my go-to-work deodorant.</li>
    <li> Great protection without the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; smell!!</li>
    <li> This product works well for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work. I used it and within and your was sweating more than I usually do. Also it made my underarms stink which they never have</li>
    <li> I tend to have issues with underarm wetness at the start of my menstrual cycle, as well as in social or stressful, hectic situations. Certain clothing (i.e. items I have perspired in before) seem to aggravate this issue even after washing. This product did NOTHING to control wetness, even with multiple applications on dry skin. I don&#x27;t have any issues with odor, so I cannot say if it works in that capacity, but I have been able to produce some ghastly underarm rings while using it. I am trying the nivea product next, as I would really like to find something that works.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I do perspire alot with the job that I do, so this product keeps me dry even on the most hottest of days.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with stress perspiration for years. I have a pretty stressful job and assumed my situation came from stress because until about 7 years ago I never perspired at all.  It came to a point I was so self conscious about it that it would make me perspire that much more.  This product is what I have been looking for!  I have used it for about a week and not even one single issue with perspiration!  This is amazing stuff!!!  Some of the reviews were not good so I am wondering if maybe stress is the key factor??  I had used Mitchum deodorant for years because I was told it was the strongest but basically did nothing and the key ingredients are the same so not sure why Secret Clinical Stress Response Citrus Scent works so well, but I do love it-love the smell too.</li>
    <li> Usually hard to find. Totally keeps u dry.</li>
    <li> This is way expensive for me. So when its on sale I&#x27;ll get it.</li>
    <li> love the scent and last longer then other deodorant.</li>
    <li> This has been working really good for my daughter. She&#x27;s had issues since a teenager with sweating a lot and it showing through her clothing. Now she has been using this for about a week and a half and has had dry armpits! It really works and is worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with this product because it don&#x27;t last the entire day.</li>
    <li> Pay attention to the size of this item as it seem not a lot bigger than the travel versions available.&lt;br /&gt;Nice fresh scent and no (as far as I&#x27;ve noticed..) stains on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend if of regular size but this smaller version make it more expensive than it shoul or need to be.</li>
    <li> I hate switching deodorants all the time, I haven havin&#x27;t found one until now that gives me all day protection. Other deodorants I find myself reapplying them more then 2 times a day. I have been looking for one that would last all day and possibly throughout the night. I have a huge embarrassing issue where I sweat so bad that deodorants  doesn&#x27;t stay on leaving me fresh. I  got a sample of this Clinical Strength deodorant I chose the clear gel as I am picky with solid kinds. I am so glad to receive this because it is everything I was looking for and needed.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free from stresssweatchallenge.com</li>
    <li> Without this (so sorry this is gross) I just drop sweat, when I am working hard or under stress! Thank goodness I found this product! I purchase it over and over and over again!</li>
    <li> Have ALWAYS had issues with body oder and so far this has been the best for me. Smells great and rolls on easy.</li>
    <li> It seems like my deodorant stopped working after I had my last baby- not sure what the deal is, but I blame it on hormones! At any rate, I got tired of feeling like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any so I tried this. LOVE it. You&#x27;re supposed to put it on at night, which sometimes I do, and other times I forget and just put it on in the morning. I feel clean and dry all day. Love the scent too!! Will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> I love how this product feels. Definitely a thumbs up and I will be recommending it to friends and family. Like the fact that it does not stain my clothes, leaves no clumps on. I can sweat and not smell through out the day. Definitely does the job.</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry in this crazy humid heat and I love the scent!</li>
    <li> the original has a some what unpleasant smell.  It&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;, so I&#x27;m adding sprays to cover that up.  This works well and it has a nicer scent.  the only think I hate is that my clothes get white deodorant all over them.</li>
    <li> Love Secret Clinical - especially in summer months.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I have never had any luck with deodorants effectively covering the scent of my sweat. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of deodorants over the past decade, but usually I still smelled gross, just with a fruity/flowery smell \\&quot;over\\&quot; it, which doesn&#x27;t really help. This is the first deodorant I have found that seems to work well with my body chemistry or whatever to result in significantly less sweat-odor. As far as wetness protection, I do think it helped a little, but I still had wet underarms sometimes. Since this isn&#x27;t my main concern, though, I highly recommend it for people who have the same odor issue that I had. (If you buy in-store, though, be sure not to mix it up with the also-orange \\&quot;sport\\&quot; variety. I just made this mistake...)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, I hardly break a sweat and keeps me smelling fresh if not delicious all day. I am living in a very humid country and not until now nothing seemed to work. But this is my secret confidence boost! I sometimes interchange it with Sure 48 hours spray, a few days. And when i switch back to it, its like rediscovering fruitcake for the very first time again :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore the scent and it reminds me of a summery-fresh body spray. I just wish it would last longer than a couple of hours. The sweat protection is also not quite as good as the clinical strength deos by Dove.</li>
    <li> A great powerful antiperspirant.  I sweat from my far head and use this to solve that problem.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. I used to always get sweat stains on my shirt, but this actually completely stops them from showing. It lasts long and does not leave streaks on my dark clothes. Really love this.</li>
    <li> Is on my to buy again list. It actually works and I live in Florida where the climate demands a truly great deodorant.</li>
    <li> 3 stars for the price. It&#x27;s expensive for the little bit of deodorant that comes in the container. However, this is the only deodorant that I use. This fragrance is wonderful. And it holds up great.</li>
    <li> Works great and I love the scent!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SMELLS GOOD AND WORKS GOOD! shipped promptly!! this review is based solely on my opinion after using the product, would recommend to a friend &amp; very glad I ordered</li>
    <li> Sorry Oprah but this did nothing for me. I didn&#x27;t like the smell, it left huge white marks on everything and at the end of the day I was a sweaty mess. Again sorry Oprah, I think we just have to come to grips with the fact that we are two different women and we can&#x27;t use the same deodorant.</li>
    <li> I am still enchanted by the scent of this deodorant even though its been weeks since I first used it.  In terms of the protection, I still experience some slight unwanted moisture but it takes a lot of stressing to get to that point.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a groomer and these clinical strength deodorants really work well, last all day. I love this scent, I usually get freshwater orchid, but this one is also good for the summer.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and last half the day for me.</li>
    <li> clinical strength??? nope!! I find i sweat as soon as i put this on!! then it has this horid smell of BO and way to strong smelling deodorant.  I think its the worst clinical deodorant I have ever used... almost the mean stinks one from secret is nasty.  I was hoping it would be ood have used it for months but NO it does not work well for me :(</li>
    <li> I always had issues with deodorants. And this is the best one i&#x27;ve ever used. It also last for a long time. really great product!!</li>
    <li> My daughter was very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with my armpits, but I will find a deodorant that works and then out of the blue it will stop working and I have to scramble to find a new one. This is the next new one. It works well. I love the smell. I will put this on and later on I will say to myself, &amp;#34;what is that wonderful smell?&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll sniff around for a bit and then remember it is this deodorant. Do you have any idea how many times I have done that? A lot. It is actually ridiculous that I keep getting duped into thinking something wonderfully fragrant has crossed my path only to realize minutes later I&#x27;m just smelling me. Anyway, I love the smell and now all you smell from my armpits is fabulousness!</li>
    <li> I purchased this not so long ago for the first time, I was surprised at how very well it did work! will be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this &amp; it lasts!</li>
    <li> I use this at night, then use Ban solid in the mornings.  This really helps to keep my armpits dry during the day.  I really like the fragrance of this as well.</li>
    <li> My girlfriends use this and recommended it.  I ordered, it arrived within 2 days and it truly is a great product.</li>
    <li> I like this deodorant, it does keep me from sweating better than Secret Outlast. It&#x27;s difficult to get used to putting it on at night, and a couple of times I&#x27;ve used it in the morning. Also, I&#x27;m not a daily bather. I usually take a bath every other day. If I put this on in between, while it does stop me from sweating just as well as when I use it the night I bathed, I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work QUITE as well with odor control. It&#x27;s still adequate, it&#x27;s just something that I&#x27;m aware of because it&#x27;s my BO. All in all, this IS a product I&#x27;d recommend. I like the convenience of ordering and having it come to my door, as opposed to having to go out and buy it.</li>
    <li> This lasts for a long time and works great.  I will never go back to any deodorant again.  Love the scent also.  I don&#x27;t like anything that smells too strong.</li>
    <li> This was a great price, product works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great!</li>
    <li> Not only was it too hot at work, but the director was cruising and abusing.  My Irish got up -- I was boiling -- but my deodorant held out.  This works &amp; you don&#x27;t need too much at a time.  My first one was a sample and I used it up way too fast.  Use a little &amp; it will protect you.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant.  I had lazer hair removal and feel it made me more prone to smell.  This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> works just fine, I just like the invisible solids better.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good-- better than most, but I must need Industrial Strength formula.... I have found that if you shower and use it at night, it seems to work better than using it in the morning.  Smells good, though.</li>
    <li> Scent is amazing!  Functions similar to every other clinical strength brand I have tried.  I just wish the product was larger!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the citrus smell of this but I LOVE it. It&#x27;s now my go to deodorant and I use it everyday. Totally helped with the excessive sweating!</li>
    <li> I have used several other deoderants, and found this one to be the best working for me. Doesn&#x27;t get on clothes if wiped down with a napkin afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant!!  And it is waterproof, still smells great after being in the pool for hours!  Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every deodorant on the market..even men deodorant. I work outside on a boat in Miami heat and this is the ONLY deodorant that has worked on me. No more stains on armpits from a hard days work. I love the smell as well. Defiantly worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this deodorant since I received it. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with sweat stains on my clothes, and I find it to make me completely dry throughout the day as well as no weird smell between your sweat and your deodorant combining. It was a bit expensive for the amount you get, so that&#x27;s the only downside, but it seems to be worth it so far. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more in only this scent though. And you barely need to use much of it.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to deodorant! I am a dance teacher (and dancer myself) so I know that I sweat tons, especially during my 9am-4pm days. This has been really fantastic about not making me feel wet, uncomfortable or sticky at all. I was actually surprised to see this more as a cream than a solid stick that I thought it was. You basically twist it up and it squeezes through the holes/lines and apply it like that. The scent is pretty nice, it&#x27;s not too strong at all, didn&#x27;t make a weird combination with my own scent (yes we all have that) and its kinda citrusy. I would definitely recommend it. You don&#x27;t need a lot for each application. one small twist and you&#x27;re good to go! I do not re-apply during my day and it has held up well. It really is water-proof as well so when you&#x27;re showering at the end of the day, use a good amount of soap to remove it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.  It will help stop sweat if you put it on morning and night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I reapply this 2-3 times in a 24 hour period because the fresh smell doesn&#x27;t have staying power, but I love how good it smells initially.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite scent of all the line.</li>
    <li> Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I sweat easily. This is the only deodorant/anti-perspirant that helps me. It smells fresh. I just wish it came in a larger size. Other than that. 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> I love the rest of the Secret Clinical Strength deodorants, but this one just isn&#x27;t to my liking.  Works fine as far as I could tell.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells amazing! As far as decreasing the amount of sweat produced...it&#x27;s not that great. I haven&#x27;t really found anything that works for me.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously small amount of product here. It&#x27;s already 2/3 the size of a standard woman&#x27;s deodorant, but literally HALF of the container has no product. It does work well, though. 1 swipe under each arm lasted for the entire day, including a mad cleaning frenzy in the 110+ summer heat. I was definitely sweating, but barely at all from under my arms. No reapplications were needed, and all I smelled was the deodorant scent. It&#x27;s a nice smell, very &amp;#34;rose meets lemon.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and she loves it. Smell is very good and the protection is superior. Once you get in the habit of using it regularly, it will help reduce unnecessary and unwanted sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> It smells like Fruit Stripes gum.  Not bad, just weird and not my thing.  Will use same brand in future, but a different scent.</li>
    <li> These are like $12 each at CVS!  I get the subscribe and save and they end up around $6 each here.  I like this smell, and they never let me down.  I think you an skip a day like those old mitchum ads used to promise!</li>
    <li> Five star, two thumbs up. I&#x27;ve had to switch deodorant every couple of weeks, for years. This stuff is great. No sweat, no smell. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This scent is so pretty - very sweet and feminine.  The stress activated feature works wonders.  This is my new must have deodorant.</li>
    <li> Seems to work the same as the other traditional Clinical Strength products.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, works well &amp; a great price, arrived very quickly, would buy again</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great! Definitely works way better than regular strength. Will never go back to the others.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite smelling deodorant.  The scent is awesome.  I find it does a good job doing what deodorant is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> My Daughters swear by Clinical strength Secret</li>
    <li> Used the tube, its smelt weird on me. Changing to a different brand</li>
    <li> The deodorant works exceptionally well, however, the roll up container is less than half full. I am disgusted that I paid this much money for 1 inch of product in a 4 inch container. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the orange scented Clinical Strength deodorant.  I can smell it and feel protected all day.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I have tried every product under the sun to stop wetness under my arms. I used products my doctor prescribed that didn&#x27;t help at all but gave me terrible rashes. I had resorted to wearing black all the time because nothing controlled it. I am so happy with this product. My under arms are always dry. The one negative is it gets a weird smell by the end of the day. But I can deal with that.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling clinical strength antiperspirant I could find.  Citrussy but not overkill.  Does not interfere with perfume I use.  Works better than, or at least in my opinion, than regular antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> This smells pretty good and I haven&#x27;t seen myself sweat as much. It does stain my clothes though, but I&#x27;m willing to do extra laundry and handwash my good items so I don&#x27;t smell or sweat. Either way</li>
    <li> No heavy scent. Nice pleasant scent. Goes on nice...no residue, or sticky feeling. Almost like lotion. And it does what it&#x27;s designed to do :)</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this product. It is nice but not overpowering. It works and I don&#x27;t have to think about it.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Works wonderfully. The price here us unbeatable. Stock up!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 2 years and nothing, I repeat NOTHING has come close to it. As a full-time working mami, who often works out after work, I need an antiperspirant that can keep up with me. Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength does that. I also have sensitive skin, so finding an antiperspirant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarm skin is difficult. This is the only one that actually does what it says it will do and the only antiperspirant that I trust.</li>
    <li> The 20% active ingredient works well, but the citrus is seriously strong. Suggestion is to apply at night  for next day effectiveness. The next day you will still be a citrus! I&#x27;ve used this product in other scents for years and been very, very happy, but will stay away from citrus in the future. Now I know why there was a coupon for this scent!</li>
    <li> The Clinical Strength Smooth Solid antiperspirant was either old, or not the genuine product. I&#x27;ve used this before, from a local store, and the texture was totally different. What I got from Amazon was gummy and dried to the consistency of melted cellophane. It actually has a plastic look and feel when dry, definitely NOT invisible, and not smooth. I&#x27;ll buy from other sources next time.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS and this scent is wonderful. I have trouble with most &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; antiperspirants, but this one fills the bill!! Like the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; option on it, too!</li>
    <li> Secret clinical is the ONLY antiperspirant I use.  It takes some getting used to putting this on at night before bed, but I have noticed a huge difference since switching to this from a traditional product (applied after showering/in the morning).  If you are putting it on and get dressed, it helps to let the product dry before dressing.  This eliminates residue on your clothing.</li>
    <li> I just started using this solid yesterday and it has been amazing for me. Up to this point I had tried every deodorant out there and nothing would keep me fresh for more than a couple of hours if I was under stress or sweating due to my body temp. This stuff kept me fresh all day at work, through my stressful commute home and after going to the gym! I have to give only 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t keep my armpits dry and since it&#x27;s a solid I can&#x27;t wear it with sleeveless apparel. Works better than lemon juice for me thus far. I accept that nothing will stop me from sweating but not stinking during my sweaty times is good enough.</li>
    <li> Works better than most others. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very, very, very mad at the quantity you get for the price you pay!!  Twisting till you get the actual product out of the plastic container and you are at the half of the actual size of the container.  It is transparent so you can actually see how much you got ripped off!!  Other than that, yes it works, but I will never buy again!</li>
    <li> I used Mitchum for most of my life-always worked. Then last year I was sweating right through it.  I saw a commercial for this, and I realized most of my issues were from stress.  This stuff is a Godsend.</li>
    <li> This works great! I sweat a lot and this keeps me smelling clean all day.</li>
    <li> It did not give me the extra protection I  was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasts a while!  No odor here....</li>
    <li> Works well. Really helps control my sweat. Nothing else has worked as well for me.</li>
    <li> I always buy unscented deodorant but I tried this and really like it. The scent is only slightly noticeable when you first put it on a.nd then the scent goes away. It is a very pleasant, mild scent.  The deodorant works just as well as my usual unscented clinical strength Secret.</li>
    <li> This smells good and works.  However it is super small, like trial size small so I would probably not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The best. Will last all day.</li>
    <li> Always loved secret products but needed that extra protection in the summer. This does the trick. Nice smell, too!</li>
    <li> Works great, I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I never realized what a difference there could be between antiperspirants!  Besides the pleasant citrus scent, this product really DOES help reduce sweating.  It costs a little more than I used to spend, but very well worth it.</li>
    <li> This product was good, not great.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m not sure why the picture shown on the main page for this product doesn&#x27;t match what the actual product is - the real label is mainly yellow and doesn&#x27;t have a thing to do with aloe - but my review will be for the Stress Response Serene Citrus antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s scent is wonderful: it&#x27;s a light citrus scent - it smells like it&#x27;s not just orange, but a mixture of a variety of citrus fruits - but it has staying power.  In fact, this is the best aspect of the product: if you&#x27;re worried about the scent of stress sweat, you won&#x27;t have to worry after using this; the scent stays with you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue that I had with the antiperspirant was that it left a lot to be desired in the actual antiperspirant department.  I purchased this specifically because I knew that I would be facing several super-stressful events over the past month, and I wanted something that would effectively deal with the resulting sweat.  This didn&#x27;t do a thing in that regard. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a product that will keep you completely dry or even just alleviate some stress sweat-related wetness, you might want to keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this product would be great if you don&#x27;t have any issues with sweat but are just looking for a great scent that will last all day.  If you want a product that truly combats stress sweat, you&#x27;d be better served trying something else.</li>
    <li> Love it love the smell feel so good and it works thank you</li>
    <li> So, its not perfect.. hey, what beauty product is!  But of all the clinical strength deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, its been the best.  In fact, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now.  Do I still sweaty and get stinky?  Of course.  However, if you shower at night and put it on right after and then go to bed, the next day I&#x27;m usually good to go with no issues.  Doesn&#x27;t work as well when you use it in the morning, but still better than everything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I like the scent too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hoping that it would be a stronger antiperspirant and maybe one that would actually work for me. The &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength is apparently only 1% stronger than non-&amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; strength antiperspirants and deodorants if you actually look at the active ingredients. Sadly, that extra 1% didn&#x27;t do anything for me - there was absolutely no noticeable decrease in wetness compared to any other deodorant I&#x27;ve used. On top of that, the fact that they really only give you half a container made this absolutely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> It does work much better than regular deodorants.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Sometimes I need something a little stronger than regular deodorant.  Love this new scent!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Jamie</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that really helps me stay dry. I&#x27;ve used everything including other so called tough deodorants and they just don&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> After an illness that messed with my hormones, I now sweat like never before. I have tried other &#x27;&#x27;clinical&amp;#34; strength deodorants, I have found this one to work best for me. I don&#x27;t feel all &amp;#34;pitted&amp;#34; out in a hour, it last&#x27;s all day for me. I do not want to smell like a baby or some of the other scents these companies use. As I&#x27;m particular to scents, I like this one, it smells pleasant and fresh.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. The smell is nice, but didn&#x27;t last and I was as sweaty as before</li>
    <li> This is the only deoderant that has worked for me. I had to switch to this deoderant when I started having hot flashes. I will never go back to my previous brands after using this brand.</li>
    <li> Dry all day. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  My daughter has hyperhydrosis.... and this works even better than the prescription stuff.</li>
    <li> Deodorant is insanely personal - please keep in mind that what works or doesn&#x27;t work for one person may be completely different for you. All I can do is describe how I use this and the results I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty skeptical when I decided to buy this, but figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. Background: I sweat under my arms almost constantly. It must be stress-related, as I don&#x27;t sweat much at home, but I&#x27;m a programmer and as I sit at a desk all day barely moving, I&#x27;m sweating! I&#x27;ve tried Certain-Dri, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much, and smelled funny to me. It also stained my t-shirts. One prescription antiperspirant I tried actually smelled like B.O. to me, stung my armpits, and stained my t-shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to be a middle-ground between standard antiperspirant (which does virtually nothing for me) and prescription antiperspirant which for me had more downsides than benefits. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks, roughly every other night to start out with. It says to put on two-clicks worth (it&#x27;s the soft type that you twist and it comes out little slits on the top), but I&#x27;ve used one click&#x27;s worth most of the time; it seems to go a long way. The smell is nice, and putting it on at night allows it to get to work while you&#x27;re not active (sleeping) and so in theory not sweating a lot. In the morning I take my shower, then put on regular deodorant (not antiperspirant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week (4 or 5 applications) I noticed a significant reduction in the amount of underarm sweat I had during the day. If I were more diligent about using it every evening, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it were eliminated (or very close to it). I haven&#x27;t noticed any shirt stains, because I don&#x27;t have many white or light shirts, but I&#x27;d imagine if you DO still sweat through this, I&#x27;d assume it would cause stains, as it is the aluminum compounds used as antiperspirants that cause this, and \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; strength antiperspirants generally have a higher percentage of these. However, that may not be a big issue if you&#x27;re putting it on at night and not worried about staining your nicer clothes, or work shirts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, and I think I actually paid a few dollars more. Anyway, I think it&#x27;s certainly worth giving this a shot. I recommend it, it works for me, but you&#x27;ll never know if it works for you until you try it. The review I gave is 4 stars because of the small amount and the higher price than regular antiperspirant... but you&#x27;re not buying regular antiperspirant, so it&#x27;s just a matter of whether it&#x27;s worth it to you.of these.

    <li> I really love the smell an how great the clinical strength solid  women&#x27;s deodorant  works it keeps you dry all day Long an doesn&#x27;t leave a yellow stain on your shirt under your arms like some of the others do an has a great smell an goes on soft not sticky like it a lot .</li>
    <li> Good protection  during the hot and long with lot of sport activities day! Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;I will order againe &#x27; definately</li>
    <li> This works wonderful and very long lasting</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product and it does last a long time unlike some of the others I&#x27;ve tried (read: a lot).  It&#x27;s gentle, too, if you have sensitive skin which I somewhat do.  I&#x27;ll always stick to this one in future as keeps me dry and fresh for the whole day, if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those where you rotate the bottom and the stuff pumps through the holes in the cap, so it&#x27;s not a stick or roll on, more like a dispenser that you &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; onto your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is I think it could be more full but to be fair, you don&#x27;t need to use loads to get the full effects.  I love this and the pink (orchid, was it?) ones of this product.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it was</li>
    <li> The worst!  It balls up, clumps up, and leaves white residue on skin and clothes. I love the Secret Outlast, but this stuff (I gave it at least 10 tries) is going into the garbage.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand of &amp;#34;sweatless&amp;#34; antiperspirant.  This version has a very nice citrus/orange fragrance.  I can go 2-3 days without reapplying unless I scrub my underarms in the shower.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great!  Lasts a while because you don&#x27;t have to use very much for it to be effective.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand/type of deodorant that my daughter uses, and says it&#x27;s the best that&#x27;s ever been made.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this deodorant.  It is kinda tropical, but not overpowering at all.  Normally when I try a new kind of deodorant, I feel like I am smelling it all day long.  I only noticed this one a couple times during the day.  However, I don&#x27;t know that the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; worked any better than my normal Michum deodorant.  I liked it all the same, and would buy again if the price is right.</li>
    <li> sent promptly. good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but I did not like the smell too much</li>
    <li> I had been told how wonderful the Clinical Strength worked, but never tried this until recently.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  I will be purchasing this over &amp; over again.  I wish I would have tried this years ago.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to test and find it to be a very effective antiperspirant, more so than regular products.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, my husband doesn&#x27;t, so that&#x27;s a matter of personal preference. But it&#x27;s really strong when the scent gets &#x27;activated&#x27; by sweat. People have noticed and asked if I was wearing perfume from four feet away. And that&#x27;s really not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Has this great citrus-ish scent to it. I was looking to switch to another brand b/c their other clinical scents smelled kind of yucky when I was putting them on after awhile (no, I don&#x27;t have BO that bad, they just, I don&#x27;t know, got gross after awhile). But I&#x27;ve used this for a month or two and it&#x27;s this great pop of scent every time.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works!</li>
    <li> Only deodorant I use.</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful: it&#x27;s a light citrus scent like a mixture of a variety of citrus fruits and the scent lasts. In fact, this is the best aspect of the product: if you&#x27;re worried about the scent of stress sweat, you won&#x27;t have to worry after using this; the scent stays with you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue that I had with the antiperspirant was that it left a lot to be desired in the actual antiperspirant department. My wife was looking for something that would last all day long. This didn&#x27;t do a thing in that regard. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a product that will keep you completely dry or even just alleviate some stress sweat-related you should look elsewhere. If you reapply every 6 hours then this is a fine product but it can get costly. Advice is to look elsewhere honestly.</li>
    <li> I love Secret Clinical Strength Deodorant.  It works best for me and smells really great!!  This one works extra for stress and smells like citrus.  This is my #1 deodorant, and for a great price, even better than Walmart!!  And I got it quick!</li>
    <li> It does work for me, and it smells great when I put it on. I can&#x27;t really smell it after I&#x27;m dressed, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind it if others could! All I really want in a deoderant is to not stink, and this fits the bill!</li>
    <li> works great, smells great.  Keeps me dry.  Once I used Secret clinical strength I haven&#x27;t been able to use another product.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t quit on me.</li>
    <li> A very good product. Last a long time.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is way overpowering and honestly not that appealing. It gave me a headache after half an hour and I just can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and goes on clear!</li>
    <li> Much better than degree.....</li>
    <li> unfortunately this is not as good as the original or the gel.  I wouldn&#x27;t get this one again.  The scent isn&#x27;t as good as the original either.</li>
    <li> I got this at a discount to review. I really enjoy this secret deodorant because it really is good for 48 hours even though I take a shower usually before 48 hours so I have to reapply. Where I live we are getting 90+ degree weather and it wasn&#x27;t taking me long to start sweating with my other deodorant. However, with Secret Clinical Strength Smooth Solid I wasn&#x27;t smelling my stinky, sticky, &amp; smelly self that couldn&#x27;t wait to get off work and take a shower. I remained fresh all day long! I also loved the smell of this product! #StressSweat</li>
    <li> Keeps you dry on those hot humid days when you really need deodorant.</li>
    <li> Good but making the area dark</li>
    <li> I am always hesitant to order scented items online, but this smells amazing and works wonders. It does a good job of keeping a strong scent all day and keeping me smelling good!</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is so strong I can&#x27;t use it.  I threw it away after trying a few times.  Also, &amp;#34;Clinical Strength?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not so much.  Regular Secret works better.</li>
    <li> Great scent and keeps me dry.</li>
    <li> Smells like spoiling pineapple.  Bleh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a medication that makes me sweat more than I usually do. Love this product as it really works, smells good and long lasting protection. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great Price! It works.</li>
    <li> I must say, as a disclaimer, that I rarely review! However, I&#x27;m so thrilled with this product that I went out of my way to add a review to this site!  I bought this product after dutiful research at my local Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. I would&#x27;ve ordered off of Amazon, but from the reviews it didn&#x27;t make much sense to order/pay shipping and handling for something that was right down the street.  I choose Secret because I&#x27;ve used Secret products (Shower Fresh) along with many other deodorants. I have had a LONG history with body odor. Once puberty started kicking in during my middle school/HS days I&#x27;ve had horrible body odor. Were you to ask my close friends and family - that&#x27;s the truth. However, shower or no shower, without some barrier my pits start to reek. I&#x27;ve resorted to washing my pits with hand soap and water in public bathrooms; and having an arsenal of deodorants hidden in backpacks and purses to deal with it. I used Secret for a long time and on a casual day it is enough but, when it&#x27;s extra hot or I&#x27;m extra layered and I perspire more, regular Secret products just don&#x27;t hold up. After many embarrassing incidents in my life time I decided to finally investigate these &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; deodorants. I thought they were a fluke and I was doomed to be a walking locker room on hot summer days.  However, I decided to give this a try from a brand I&#x27;m loyal too and I have NO regrets. The only regret I have is that I didn&#x27;t buy this four year ago.This deodorant is truly amazing. I had a trial run, where I&#x27;d put this on in the wee hours of the morning (5am) and still be smelling pretty darn good by 8pm at night. Mind you I was doing busy nursing clinical rotations meaning that I was busy on the floors and stress and despite those factors this still held up! Sure, by the end of a 12 hour shift I had a faint scent but it was hardly detectable unless up close and it wasn&#x27;t repugnant by any means.  Now, this deodorant is meant to be used before bed and in the morning. I&#x27;drecommend doing that. Also showering of course or at least washing the pit area should be done and I still carry an extra deodorant just in case. In just a month since I purchased the problem I&#x27;ve had no problem with body odor UNLESS I forget to put it on or if I went without bathing for over a night. You can&#x27;t go wrong.  Yes, you may quirk your eye at the price and wonder why it&#x27;s worth it, but this one $7-$8 is worth it and I would pay millions more to erase the embarrassing memories. So purchase this if you have odor issues - maybe not to my extent but then this product will work wonders. Now I don&#x27;t know how well it is for sweating per say, as I&#x27;m not a big sweater and I&#x27;ve never had over active sweat glands. You can give it a trial run and move on to other products. I do intend sampling other clinical strength brands like Gold Bond and even Gillette to determine what works best for me but this is a damn good start.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! I have a bad odor even fresh out of the shower and other deodorants. I have tried many shower gels, soaps and deodorants over the past couple of years and i still can smell an under the arm odor. So embarrassing that I hated being near people to close.&lt;br /&gt;I even at times cringed at the thought that My grown Daughter or Teenage Son could smell it when i hugged them. Couple of times I asked My daughter and she said I smelled fine. And With My teenage Som I would tell him Mommy don&#x27;t smell so good, I have been sweating. He would turn his head and just smile at me and let out a little chuckle. See My Son is High school Football and Soccer. So it was funny to him. He would smell worse than me after practice. But I many times even after his practices I still felt i could still smell me not him. It is a different scent.  Now I smell So Beautiful. Can&#x27;t wait to give him a hug after practice. :0) Now Mommy&#x27;s hugs will be nice and fresh not as sweaty yucky as him.&lt;br /&gt;Putting My hair up I am greeting with a sweet beautiful citrus smell instead of a sticnky yuck musky smell. I reach over My desk to grab something and I am greeted now with a beautiful smell.&lt;br /&gt;Been in a lot of stress over the past few years. As now reading more of the product details, that Stress Sweat smells the worse. I was so worried it had something to do with old age or something that i didn&#x27;t even think of and unfixable. So SOOOOO Happy I took the chance to purchase this! Totally going to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love using the clinical strength line from Secret.  This one is great!!</li>
