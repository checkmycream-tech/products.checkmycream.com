      <li>The package was great and it came from it&#x27;s original box.</li>
      <li>I love that the light rose spell is perfect, not too strong.  </li>
      <li>It is much lighter, but still long-lasting and very pleasant throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>If you love rose smell, try Floris(London)</li>
      <li>If, like myself, you enjoy the timeless femininity of a good, well-composed floral scent, this is the fragrance for you.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very fit for my mommy.</li>
      <li>My wife is really enjoying the scent.    </li>
      <li>I thought since it&#x27;s a parfum the smell would be more noticeable.</li>
      <li>Glad to receive a gift card to shop at Amazon (from my niece on my bday)</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful perfume that has been my favorite for several years.</li>
      <li>My wife fell in love w the aroma</li>
      <li>and I love</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>my favorite perfume</li>
      <li>I love this scent and I get compliments.</li>
      <li>i get so many compliments when i wear it....</li>
      <li>Need I say more...</li>
      <li>I love this perfume</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was bummed out that I paid more.</li>
      <li>but I am glad that I bought this perfume.</li>
      <li>, if i had a dollar for every time someone has told me they love my perfume i would be able to stock myself with this for life.</li>
      <li>the scent matches my other Bulgari Rose Essentielle perfectly ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably the closest you&#x27;ll ever see anyone get to literally bottling the aroma of a rose in full bloom.  </li>
      <li>Nice bottle, but doesn&#x27;t really smell like what one thinks of as rose at all.</li>
      <li>Now - Bvlgari Rose Essential is a very wearable fragrance that delights the nose and pays off with excellent staying power.</li>
      <li>This is a great soft smelling Bvlgari fragrance.  </li>
      <li>, I wanted a nice rose perfume and this was recommended by the SA at Sephora, but I ended up completely hating the scent (and the migraines) and swapped it.</li>
      <li>But it was way too strong, made me sneeze, and gave me a migraine every time i wore it.</li>
      <li>Rose Essentielle is such a gorgeous scent.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try Bulgari Rose as an alternate for spring and summer, and I am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s great while it does last.</li>
      <li>The soft rose fragrance is a soothing variation from more citrus-oriented colognes.</li>
      <li>This is a vibrant rose that is lightly sweetened by the scent of blackberries.</li>
      <li>It makes you want to keep smelling it the way you would a fresh cut bouquet of roses!</li>
      <li>I was so excited after my order for this item and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to get delivered.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing BLV and the original Bvlgari fragrances for years.  </li>
      <li>The box and packaging came in the perfumes original box.</li>
      <li>love this scent and the price is reasonable!</li>
      <li>I fell in love with it at first sniff.  </li>
      <li>how simply sweet and understated it is.</li>
      <li>Wonderful smell, delicate and feminine.</li>
      <li>Bvlgari&#x27;s Rose Essentielle is totally feminine - light, but not too sweet.  </li>
      <li>I am quiet sure it is authentic</li>
      <li>Got it at a fantastic prize, certainly wife&#x27;s fave perfume right now!</li>
      <li>I knew it was going to be my new favorite perfume</li>
      <li>and it was EXACTLY like the original bottle I bought from the store.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>I have worn Bulgari for many years, especially during the winter months because it is a strong fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper than Duty Free Shops in the Caribbean.</li>
      <li>POWERFUL stuff.  </li>
      <li>This is the type of find that makes it all worth being a prime costumer.</li>
      <li>The rose is almost nonexistent after the initial spray.</li>
      <li>Not last long perfume, smells just okay, not as good as others said.</li>
      <li>All their other women&#x27;s fragrances are so good</li>
      <li>China Rose a little too strong for my taste</li>
      <li>Please note I am a very satisfied customer to all other purchases I have made through Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>This perfume reminds me of when I first met my husband and that is why I got it.</li>
      <li>First saw this when a friend got this for his wife on their wedding anniversary at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne; I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
      <li>My wife has been using it for some time, This was a refill order the first time from Amazon.</li>
      <li>First shipment was damaged, Amazon promptly send out a replacement.</li>
      <li>the scent is light and rosey without feeling old fashioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First - the store.  </li>
      <li>From the first time I smelled this perfume</li>
      <li>I sampled it in sephora first</li>
      <li>The smell does not last for more than 2 seconds</li>
      <li>It is a very subtle, delicate fragrance that smells beautiful and makes me feel beautiful when I have it on.</li>
      <li>Liked it, so want to try other smell.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for the full rich dark red rose scent.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is okay to wear everyday and the scent is good enough to last for 8 hrs.</li>
      <li>She loves so much</li>
      <li>It is definitely a head turner for those who catch its light fragrance.      </li>
      <li>fast shipping...</li>
      <li>Really appreciate the price.</li>
      <li>People really like it on me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I liked this..in the store. But it soon became so cloying, that I could barely stand to smell it on the bottle. The scent neeeever dies, it stays with you all day, which is great if i liked it. But it was way too strong, made me sneeze, and gave me a migraine every time i wore it. I couldn&#x27;t remember why i ever bought it, I wanted a nice rose perfume and this was recommended by the SA at Sephora, but I ended up completely hating the scent (and the migraines) and swapped it. PS I agree with some other reviewers who describe this scent as chemical, bathroom air freshener, etc. The rose is almost nonexistent after the initial spray. :/</li>
    <li> i get so many compliments ont his perfume that i would be hard pressed to switch. the scent is light and rosey without feeling old fashioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seriously, if i had a dollar for every time someone has told me they love my perfume i would be able to stock myself with this for life.</li>
    <li> I was going to take this as a learning experience for purchasing perfume on-line but since you offered to hear my opinion this is how it goes.  I only have the why questions for the money I spent on this bottle.  The smell is hardly there, I practically soaked my arm&amp;the smell would be gone in seconds. I want a perfume and not a body splash!  The scents of my body splash from Victoria Secrets&amp;Bath &amp; Body Works are way..stronger but they don&#x27;t last very long either although longer than this Bvlgari Rose Ess. bottle I purchased, and they are a lot cheaper.  I am using other Bvlgari perfume which I love, strong and last several hours.  If you love rose smell, try Floris(London) China Rose a little too strong for my taste but I love it anyway and only use it a little at a time.  Please note I am a very satisfied customer to all other purchases I have made through Amazon.com. so far.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and I get compliments. I did a lot of deliberating before I bought this. I sampled it in sephora first but it is WAAYY more expensive there. I got the 3.4 OZ EDP. I am quiet sure it is authentic and i like the bottle. The only BUMMER was right after I ordered this I went into TJ MAXX and found that they are selling this product for !45 DOLLARS!!! (same size I bought)&lt;br /&gt;I was bummed out that I paid more. But still, this is a good price and...this scent is simple and pleasing. People really like it on me. I don&#x27;t want to fuss over how I smell. This is classic.</li>
    <li> The smell does not last for more than 2 seconds It is not real. It was a bummer and the bottle came half empty . I was so bummed because it smelled great at Macy&#x27;s . This one there is no smell for it .</li>
    <li> First shipment was damaged, Amazon promptly send out a replacement. My wife is really enjoying the scent.    Thank You!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this from Macys but it&#x27;s quite expensive. Glad to receive a gift card to shop at Amazon (from my niece on my bday) and I immediately looked for this. The package was great and it came from it&#x27;s original box. This fragrance is okay to wear everyday and the scent is good enough to last for 8 hrs. I wore it to work and when I got home, I could still smell it. If you like that floral scent with a little mixture of Cashmere Mist by Donna Karan, this is for you. I love it and I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
    <li> If, like myself, you enjoy the timeless femininity of a good, well-composed floral scent, this is the fragrance for you.  It&#x27;s not cloying or heavy; it doesn&#x27;t smell of old women or some schlocky candle company&#x27;s idea of what roses smell like. It&#x27;s probably the closest you&#x27;ll ever see anyone get to literally bottling the aroma of a rose in full bloom.  Do yourself a favor: buy it.</li>
    <li> I have worn Bulgari for many years, especially during the winter months because it is a strong fragrance.  I decided to try Bulgari Rose as an alternate for spring and summer, and I am very pleased.  It is much lighter, but still long-lasting and very pleasant throughout the day.  The soft rose fragrance is a soothing variation from more citrus-oriented colognes.</li>
    <li> Not last long perfume, smells just okay, not as good as others said.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite scent for a few years.  Hesitated buying this size due to complaints about it not be the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.  it is.  the scent matches my other Bulgari Rose Essentielle perfectly ... packaging &amp; bottle, too.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent. My wife has been using it for some time, This was a refill order the first time from Amazon. Really appreciate the price. Much cheaper than Duty Free Shops in the Caribbean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful aroma.  My only complaint is it really doesn&#x27;t last very long.  But it&#x27;s great while it does last.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, delicate and feminine. My daughter wanted this fragrance so I got it for her birthday. She loves it. The price is also very good so it all worked out well.</li>
    <li> I have used Bvlgari Rose Essentielle for over a year now. It is by far my favorite perfume and I love how simply sweet and understated it is. I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Rose Essentielle is such a gorgeous scent.  This is a vibrant rose that is lightly sweetened by the scent of blackberries. The lasting power is 4-6 hours and will last all day if sprayed on hair or clothing.</li>
    <li> very nice fragrance..fast shipping...Highly Recommend this product to anyone looking for this to give as a gift or for self</li>
    <li> When I found out Bvlgari did a scent based on rose, I thought what could go wrong? All their other women&#x27;s fragrances are so good, I assumed wrongly, it wasn&#x27;t worth taking the time to test the scent before purchasing.  Nice bottle, but doesn&#x27;t really smell like what one thinks of as rose at all. or perhaps one of those tea roses - very average. I was hoping for the full rich dark red rose scent. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re expecting, then this is not for you.  I like the bottle, but I&#x27;ll stick to the other Bvlgari women&#x27;s fragrances in the future. This ones a bust.</li>
    <li> Bvlgari&#x27;s Rose Essentielle is totally feminine - light, but not too sweet.  I fell in love with it at first sniff.  It is definitely a head turner for those who catch its light fragrance.      The best recommendation came from a colleague... The gentleman in question had to use my desk phone for a conference call.  When the call ended, he stood with a slightly glazed look on his face.  In stunned tones he said, \\&quot;Your phone smells sooooooo GOOD!\\&quot;  As I backed away, trying to decide if he were harmless or if I needed to call security, he continued, \\&quot;I could barely concentrate on the call, all I really wanted to do was to smell your phone...\\&quot;  With that, he DID!!    Yeah... POWERFUL stuff.  But, he&#x27;s banned from using my phone again... EVER.      My only complaint is that Bvlgari doesn&#x27;t make more companions - I&#x27;d love to purchase soap, bubble bath, shower gel, bath powder... I&#x27;m totally addicted... and the man in your life will be also.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wedding, and I have received nothing but compliments, anytime I wear it, I always get at least one person tell me \\&quot;you smell good!\\&quot; :)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume but I&#x27;m not sure about this because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I purchased before. I thought since it&#x27;s a parfum the smell would be more noticeable. Could this me a knock off</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very fit for my mommy.She loves so much</li>
    <li> Why did I receive eau de toilette when the description clearly said EDP for this product. I thought I would get perfume,</li>
    <li> From the first time I smelled this perfume I knew it was going to be my new favorite perfume and that is saying a lot because I had used the same brand of perfume for about 27 years.  I had seen a lot of Bvlgari perfumes in airports in Europe but had never bought any but I am glad that I bought this perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the type of find that makes it all worth being a prime costumer. It was authentic and priced at 45% less than it was in a &#x27;discount&#x27; store.</li>
    <li> This is a great soft smelling Bvlgari fragrance.  I have been wearing BLV and the original Bvlgari fragrances for years.  This is a keeper.[[ASIN:B000VOHNZ0 Bvlgari Rose Essentielle by Bvlgari 3.4oz 100ml EDP Spray]]</li>
    <li> I was so excited after my order for this item and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to get delivered. I had used a smaller trial pack for the same fragrance and simply fell in love with it. So when I saw that Amazon was selling it at half the original price, I couldn&#x27;t resist getting a bigger bottle.   But I was utterly disappointed with what I got. The one I ordered smelled nothing like the one I had tried. It was a way milder fragrance which did not even last long enough. If I knew I&#x27;d get this, I would have got the more expensive version from Sephora instead. At least I could smell what I was taking first.</li>
    <li> First - the store.  I&#x27;ll be buying from Dead Sea Beauty as a regular customer from now on.  The package was delivered incredibly fast and in perfect condition.  I don&#x27;t even need to emphasize the value - the price reduction under retail is extremely attractive.  Now - Bvlgari Rose Essential is a very wearable fragrance that delights the nose and pays off with excellent staying power. A mist sprayed into the air and then simply walked through is light, but lasting.  Both the seller and the fragrance earn a 5-star rating from me!</li>
    <li> The box and packaging came in the perfumes original box. This scent is floral but not overpoweringly so. It has a hint of subtle fragrances that are suitable for any season and occasion.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne; I&#x27;m on my second bottle. It is a very subtle, delicate fragrance that smells beautiful and makes me feel beautiful when I have it on.</li>
    <li> I thought i would get a complete packaged spray.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I got a bottle without the cap packaged in a random box with the description \\&quot;tester\\&quot; on it.&lt;br /&gt;If this is a tester, you should tell us it&#x27;s a tester before we even buy it.</li>
    <li> Need I say more...it&#x27;s Bvlgari! They&#x27;ve masterly captured the delicate scent of roses with the luxury scents they are known for to produce a heavenly combination that is not overpowering, yet it lingers all day. Most perfumes tend to give me a headache after a while, even those from some of the best brands. Normally, when I do wear perfumes (I tend to use natural oils) I&#x27;m a Chanel or Dolce &amp; Gabbana girl though not as often because of my sensitivity to perfumes. So, this Bvlgari scent was a perfect find for me. I can wear it as often as I like, it is a lovely scent! It makes you want to keep smelling it the way you would a fresh cut bouquet of roses!</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled when I saw this on Amazon and thought the price was so fair. I was so unhappy when I received it - It had hardly any smell- certainly not the smell I anticipated from the samples I had smelled at Sephora. It was diluted and smelled like water.  Sometimes if it looks too good to be true it is!!!!</li>
    <li> First saw this when a friend got this for his wife on their wedding anniversary at Macy&#x27;s. My wife fell in love w the aroma and I looked up the product on amazon. Got it at a fantastic prize, certainly wife&#x27;s fave perfume right now!</li>
    <li> The bottle had no top also it was a tester and none of this was stated. For the price, this should not be.&lt;br /&gt;So I feel this a con artist job and they admitted that this should have been stated. It is very old for it is&lt;br /&gt;not the quality that I have little left in MY OLD BOTTLE...so what is to be done? They offered no adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;Bvlgari Perfume is not something one buys often...and sending it back is a problem but not suggested&lt;br /&gt;for refund. I think they should simply send me a decent bottle...and replace this. It is old and without top.&lt;br /&gt;Cheapo transaction.&lt;br /&gt;Please help.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Catine E. Perkins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. S. Just figthting to get our Nation back to ethics and some truths. We are slowly turning back to where we&lt;br /&gt;must be to survive or we perish..</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance gifted it one of the best floral i brought for my wife till now very nice search for deals.</li>
    <li> This perfume reminds me of when I first met my husband and that is why I got it. Wow. It still reminds me of those days. I am still in love with this and the price is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my mother for a birthday gift and I must say, she loved this one and so did I!  I love that the light rose spell is perfect, not too strong.  I&#x27;m planning to buy for myself.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I bought the EDT not knowing the difference. It was terrible, I was so disappointmed. After speaking with friends I discovered that Eau De Toilette isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; but it is a cheaper version of the fragrance then Eau De Parfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the EDP and it was EXACTLY like the original bottle I bought from the store. I am complimented several times a day on my scent and will NEVER wear anything else.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! Very soft yet it last the whole day</li>
    <li> Excellent, 100% Recomended</li>
    <li> An elegant and delicate fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance. This is one of my favorite  scents!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful perfume that has been my favorite for several years. I love its delicate, fresh scent. I get tons of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 kinds, different smells. This one is my second bottle. Liked it, so want to try other smell. Well, still like this one. But can&#x27;t last very Long.</li>
    <li> Since high scents make me sick,this is mild enough for me. However, people still compliment me on the smell of my perfume long after I put it on</li>
    <li> love this scent and the price is reasonable!</li>
    <li> i get so many compliments when i wear it.... it smells heavenly and i am going to buy it forver and always...</li>
    <li> It is the best profoum</li>
