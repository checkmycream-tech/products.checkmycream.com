      <li>and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>Great Product</li>
      <li>thats just about it.nothing good about this product.</li>
      <li>, thank good ness</li>
      <li>doesnt work,smells good &#x3D;,</li>
      <li>I thought I could tolerate it until things got better, but they never did.</li>
      <li>Most of my face problems were from severe sun burns</li>
      <li>My skin never felt better.  </li>
      <li>I love this skin cream.  </li>
      <li>NADINOLA gave me more acne.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say it worked good at fading older spots or anything that was not an immediate scar.</li>
      <li>It absorbs easily, has a light smell and no greasy residue.  </li>
      <li>This product has no demonstrated effectiveness so far, so I am heading to a dermatologist on Monday to try to find a more effective treatment.</li>
      <li>i was so excited to use it because I truly believed it would work.</li>
      <li>Because my acne was flaring up so much and just resulting in more scarring, I had to stop using this product.</li>
      <li>I bought it because of the great reviews I saw on YouTube and other places.  </li>
      <li>I think it does work on immediate burns though and clears it up quickly...</li>
      <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
      <li>put it on your whole face, be precise on the problem areas.</li>
      <li>It smells funny, but I have seen quick results.</li>
      <li>Right after I get out of the shower, or after I wash my face.  </li>
      <li>But overall I love this cream &amp; it really works!!</li>
      <li>mom n boyfriend stare at me in disbelief and claim they didn&#x27;t realize how pretty</li>
      <li>It s really my chin, laugh lines and jaw n forehead with spots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more because I ran out ...</li>
      <li>Perhaps the product needs more time to be effective, but this is an embarrassing condition, and I am not willing to wait that long.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping ..</li>
      <li>, on a YouTube video I saw someone comment that the real Nadinola cream that they sell in like the Caribbean (where it originated)  is an off white/ yellowish tint.  </li>
      <li>I Didn&#x27;t really see this do anything really...</li>
      <li>and the stuff sold on Amazon is pure white in color; that might be another explanation, though whose to say that it is true.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a decent face moisturizer</li>
      <li>Also, you will need to keep the top on tight when not using.  </li>
      <li>and so far it really works.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money and actually works.  </li>
      <li>And that you can tell if the cream you bought in the states is not the real deal if it is pure white...</li>
      <li>now the first thin ppl notice is my beautiful almond shaped eyes instead of the black ness around my mouth</li>
      <li>Not to mention it has a subtle, yet garlic-y/chemical-y kind of smell.  </li>
      <li>I have large pores on my cheeks and the cream makes them larger</li>
      <li>SO FAR IT&#x27;S</li>
      <li>So far I am already seeing a difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t make me breakout , worked for  my sensitive skin .</li>
      <li>On my back, again with that ac, with no ac, I will wake up with very swollen face and pores</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t go overboard and make your face light and body</li>
      <li>I had gotten into a serious car accident and had many facial lacerations and because I am colored the scars had darkens and after usin Nadinola</li>
      <li>If your trying to bleach or lighten your whole skin complexion , this isn&#x27;t the right product , however if your trying to get rid of any dark spots such as, acne marks, strech marks, or any dark scars in your body</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far I am already seeing a difference in my skin. I have dark spots on my face and they seem to have gotten a bit lighter in color after just 2 days!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Nadinola Skin Creme to treat melasma on my upper lip, and I have seen no improvement in the 4 weeks I have been using it. Perhaps the product needs more time to be effective, but this is an embarrassing condition, and I am not willing to wait that long. This product has no demonstrated effectiveness so far, so I am heading to a dermatologist on Monday to try to find a more effective treatment.</li>
    <li> doesnt work,smells good &#x3D;,thats just about it.nothing good about this product.I wouldnt tell anyone to buy it,its just not worth the money</li>
    <li> SO FAR IT&#x27;S OKAY,I HAVE HAD THIS FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND I MUST SAY I HAVE SEEN SOME IMPROVEMENT IT LOOKS LIKE MY M ARKS ON MY ARM ARE FADING.</li>
    <li> I used Nadinola for two weeks, didn&#x27;t notice any difference, and finally gave up. Maybe it takes longer than that? I finally went to the dermatologist and got a prescription. I plan to toss the rest of my bottle of Nadinola.</li>
    <li> If your trying to bleach or lighten your whole skin complexion , this isn&#x27;t the right product , however if your trying to get rid of any dark spots such as, acne marks, strech marks, or any dark scars in your body this is the perfect cream for you. I used this for my dark underarm problem and I been using this for about two n a half months and so far it really works. I am seeing some results still hasn&#x27;t went away but its lighter than before.  I have tons of discoloration in my body so although this worked for me I still wanna see what else is out there . Maybe a soap or home remedies.  But overall I love this cream &amp; it really works!! Didn&#x27;t make me breakout , worked for  my sensitive skin . I will definitely buy more because I ran out ...another thing the jar is very small but last for about two months depending on how much you used . Fast shipping ..also good price!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had gotten into a serious car accident and had many facial lacerations and because I am colored the scars had darkens and after usin Nadinola I have notice a big difference, everything is truly fading away and I have only been using this product for 3 short weeks. Well worth the money and actually works.  &#x3D;:*}  The only downside was the delivery, this product took 1 month and a bit to arrive now I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in Canada....hmmm</li>
    <li> In terms of what I bought it for, I have not seen any results in its effectiveness.  I bought it because of the great reviews I saw on YouTube and other places.  It is supposed to fade dark spots and scars/marks, etc.  I have used it on my face to try and fade the typical slightly darker areas around the eyes (eyelids, under the eyes) and nose;  I also have a scar on my right arm that I had for about a year that I was trying to get rid of.  I have literally been using this for months, applying it about every other day.  Right after I get out of the shower, or after I wash my face.  There has been no change to the scar, or to my face.  I &#x27;m a dark brown in complexion; so maybe that is a factor...idk. But I have not seen any difference.  Not to mention it has a subtle, yet garlic-y/chemical-y kind of smell.  it&#x27;s a decent face moisturizer, that&#x27;s about it; but I will not be buying it again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;Also, on a YouTube video I saw someone comment that the real Nadinola cream that they sell in like the Caribbean (where it originated)  is an off white/ yellowish tint.  And that you can tell if the cream you bought in the states is not the real deal if it is pure white... and the stuff sold on Amazon is pure white in color; that might be another explanation, though whose to say that it is true.  Just something to take into consideration.</li>
    <li> I Didn&#x27;t really see this do anything really... I stopped using it and probably wont use it again.I think it does work on immediate burns though and clears it up quickly... as for anything else . I can&#x27;t say it worked good at fading older spots or anything that was not an immediate scar.</li>
    <li> I use this twice daily, under my moisturizing regimen and I have noticed that the hyperpigmentation has lessened since I started using this product about a month ago.  It absorbs easily, has a light smell and no greasy residue.  My moisturizing mix of lotion/organic oils absorb really well over the thin layer of Nadinola.  My skin never felt better.  A must try.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a while in hopes of helping with my hyperpigmentation, but didn&#x27;t see any results. Actually, because the formula is so greasy and cloying, it made me break out. I thought I could tolerate it until things got better, but they never did. Because my acne was flaring up so much and just resulting in more scarring, I had to stop using this product. Doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, I guess.</li>
    <li> This definitely worked for me. This has got to be one of the best fade cream for me, I know everything don&#x27;t work for everybody but it definitely works for me and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I love this skin cream.  I can see my dark spots getting lighter and I have only used this product for about 3 weeks.  I have really dark mark and they have lighten up.  I will continue using the cream until they disappear. Great Product</li>
    <li> As a child teen I always had a lot of acne., when the acne would heal I was left with horrible black spots on my brown skin. Then pregnancy gave me a beard and dark skin in that area from tweeting my chin. I&#x27;ve tried skin succes, ambi and othine. Othine works but slow. I tried nadinola and after 2 days there is a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;Do not use the in the summer months, the heat will make the cream burn u instead. I put it on only at night and run the ac all night.&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 weeks and the black spots and dark patches are almost gone&lt;br /&gt;I use a q tip foro the small spots. I have large pores on my cheeks and the cream makes them larger, thank good ness my cheeks are not to uneven . It s really my chin, laugh lines and jaw n forehead with spots.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it a night in the ac. I would not use it during the day especially in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;Having even skin makes me look younger and now the first thin ppl notice is my beautiful almond shaped eyes instead of the black ness around my mouth n jaw that resembled a five o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;My dad, n mom n boyfriend stare at me in disbelief and claim they didn&#x27;t realize how pretty I was.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t put it on your whole face, be precise on the problem areas. Don&#x27;t go overboard and make your face light and body dark&lt;br /&gt;I put nutrigena 50 sunblock made for face during the day and wear a big sun hat when I go out&lt;br /&gt;I also put the nadinola on thick I don&#x27;t rub in, I put a thick layer and sleep. On my back, again with that ac, with no ac, I will wake up with very swollen face and pores</li>
    <li> I have ugly red post acne marks(hyper pigmentation) and I read reviews on so many products before buying anything to treat the acne marks and I ended up buying Nadinola because of the 3% hydroquinone......i was so excited to use it because I truly believed it would work. I stopped breaking out a long time ago;I&#x27;ve had my acne under control but guess what? NADINOLA gave me more acne. Do you understand how frustrating this is? Breaking out from a product that is suppose to help with acne spots? Big fat waste of money,completely and utterly useless. Please invest your money in something else. I&#x27;d give it -10,000 stars but I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use if for skin discoloration on my underarms. It smells funny, but I have seen quick results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for years. It works. Point blank. And I am a very dark skinned woman with lots of completely black scars. Just make sure u get a separate sunscreen. !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and I&#x27;m noticing a BIG difference. Most of my face problems were from severe sun burns and I&#x27;ve always had dark cheeks, but a week of using this I notice my face ligntening up. I also use it on my neck too, I have really uneven skin tone. Everyones&#x27; skin is different so expect different results. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and my melasma isn&#x27;t gone 100 percent. still trying to achieve best results.</li>
    <li> Nadinola skin cream was bought to diminish some age spots that were showing up on my hands and face.  It did fade the brown spots, but after about a week, I starting getting skin irritation when using on my face.  I have never had a sensitivity issue with make-up, creams or anything of the sort, but I did with this.  I will continue to use on my hands and arms, though.  Also, you will need to keep the top on tight when not using.  I thought that I did, but after some time, the cream started to turn brown and smelled like it had gone bad.</li>
