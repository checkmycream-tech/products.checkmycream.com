<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this for 2+ years now and its the only facial cleanser I will use.  I am a 37 year old Caucasian female with medium tone skin.  Since I began using Vivite, I rarely break out anymore.  Another bonus has been the reduction of the appearance of my pores.  I use a dime sized amount on &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Advanced-Cleansing-System-1-Count/dp/B0043OYFKU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1415680431&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;oil+of+olay+pro+x\\&quot;&gt; the Oil of Olay Pro-X &amp;lt;/a&gt;exfoliating brush, which I think allows the Vivite to work in a more targeted way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am stoked on this product.</li>
    <li> Vivite works.  My dermatologist recommended these products and I can see the difference it makes.  I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Best exfoliating facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Best skincare line out there.  Fab!  Cheaper to. Buy online than in Dr.s office.  Glycolic is the best remedy for teenage skin and older women with lines</li>
    <li> I bought this after a bad laser job that left my skin all blotchy and hoped this would help even up the skin tone.  It is helping with regular use.</li>
    <li> I believed what was written on the product but the results were poor. My skin has not changed since I started using the product. I would appreciate a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> My dermotologist recommended this product.  I have now used it for over 1 year and you can hardly see my pores.  It has tightened my skin and reduces fine lines.  I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I love this product ... I&#x27;ve seen major improvement in the texture of my skin. I relocated from CA to TX and noticed with more sun exposure and severe warm weather as well as aging, just had my 28th birthday - the texture and tone of my skin was becoming drastically uneven since I was 23/24. I&#x27;ve always had great skin without doing anything. Until my mid 20s I started getting dry, flaky skin and had to up my water intake and use a heavy moisturizer with lanolin and SPF 15+. Basically like baby oil and then some. With this product it&#x27;s helped with the uneveness around my chin area and the rest of my face is glowing. I&#x27;ve been to Sephora. I&#x27;ve been to Ulta there is nothing with this high a glycolic content 15% in any product out there. The highest I&#x27;ve seen is a 5% glycolic cleanser and a 10% glycolic toner for about $40+ a piece. This is a bloody bargain. I&#x27;m saving up for a Clarisonic as I wonder if using the brush to apply will increase the benefits rather than just my hands or a wash cloth. It can dry out your skin so I do not use it daily but every other day and I always use a heavy moisturizer daily. It definitley brightens your complexion. I still use the same foundation, same bottle and I noticed before I was sallow looking which is is what made me notice the changes in my skin and literally after the 1st application of Vivite I had an inner glow. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from my coworkers and everyone thinks I&#x27;ve had sex right before I walked in the door, I look so happy, fresh faced. LOL! I&#x27;ve never had a glycolic peel, I&#x27;ve been reading reviews and still ended up on the sidelines this is a gentler more gradual approach then the lunch session which I heard for some people can leave you looking like road rash and requesting last minute time off from work. I just wish I had bought 2 to save on shipping. FYI - I Think it arrived end of June, start of July and I think the bottle is going to last me 2-3 months. I haven&#x27;t even used 1/3 of the bottle yet.</li>
    <li> Using this for years.  Have tried others, but I always have this on hand and go back to it.  I have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Vivite is the best skin care product I have ever used. It comes in a kit, however this facial serum runs out twice as quickly as the rest of the kit, so be prepared to buy an extra tube. The exfoliating cleanser is the best I have ever used, and you only need a small amount to do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price is 1/2 of what my dermatologist charges for the exact same product ... and worth every cent, if you purchase the kit you can expect it to last at least six months.</li>
    <li> Maybe if I were constant with it, it may work better.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin but my nose particularly seems like&lt;br /&gt;pore city and this product didn&#x27;t rid me of that issue</li>
    <li> i use this product at least once a day and i am really happy with it. I have oil issues and it cleans and removes dead skin and lets my moisturizers work better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 19, never had acne my whole life, only a little zit every few months. Once I hit 18 my hormones came all at once and I started to get all kinds of oil on my face and my pores got huge around my nose and cheeks next to my nose. I used neutrogena products twice a day but it didn&#x27;t do much, just dried out my face. I found this wandering around amazon one day and because of its great reviews I decided to try it out. Well my pores have greatly diminished and it&#x27;s really helped with the oil problem too. I finally can look at my face and see the girl I always used to see before I hit 18! It&#x27;s nice not to have ugly big pores anymore, plus it makes my skin wicked soft. I use it everyday but the bottle says only 3x a week. I haven&#x27;t noticed any problem using it everyday, maybe some people just need it more than others? Either way, it&#x27;s an awesome product!</li>
    <li> Vivite products are available online and I have purchased several this way a few times.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with any of the products, including this one.  Pricing is far better than any salon/clinic, and I find there is no downside to the products.  I have had only one bad product that I sent back due to an off smell as noted by other customers, but this was another vivite product than this cleanser, and was by a vendor no longer selling on Amazon.  Good product for an excellent price.</li>
    <li> I love the entire line.  I also use the daily facial cleanser and swear by the nightly renewal cream.  My skin looks better than most people that have work done!</li>
    <li> gentle exfoliate yet does the job</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good cleanser but I bought it thinking I could use it daily and it&#x27;s only supposed to be used 2-3 times per week, so I ended up having to spend more money on the daily facial cleanser too.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my mom and she loves it. she says it makes her face feeling very smooth and isnt irritating</li>
    <li> A great exfoliating cleanser. Very worthy of price!!</li>
    <li> A longtime fan of Allergan&#x27;s MD Forte products a friend suggested that I try the Vivite exfoliator cleanser as I have fair acne prone skin, age 40+... Using this once a week for a few months, noticed my skin was brighter, less sun/freckle spots/acne spots, and noticably less acne.  Love how it has the gycolic as well as salcylic acid, plus some type of grit to lightly remove dead skin cells. I use this in conjunction with the Allergan MD Forte gycolic wash and daily face serum - levels III.</li>
    <li> A famous and expensive New York dermatologist sells this from her office for $30 more that found on Amazon.com... what a joke.  But anyway, excellent product.  Exfoliates gently and leaves skin feeling soft and new.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers would recommend them to anyone</li>
    <li> I was recommended this by my dermatologist and found that it is MUCH cheaper to order through amazon than at her office.  I have noticed a difference in my skin since starting to use it.  At first my skin was very sensitive to it and I had to take a week off - but now I&#x27;m fine.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all anymore and my skin is very smooth.  Would definitely recommend it over other exfoliants.  It has glycolic in it which makes it more effective.</li>
    <li> Vivite is a serious skincare line!  If you are looking to brighten up your skin and get great exfoliation then this is your best bet~!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, one of the nicest I have used.  It leaves your face well exfoliated, but not dry like Apricot Scrub which is pretty harsh.  I would not pay full price for it though, shop around, there are some good deals here on Amazon.  My dermatologist sells this in office for a much higher price.  I use this several times a week and alternate with plain Olay facial cleanser which is about 8.00 a bottle and good.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !  I use it daily and my face feels soooo clean. Washes off makeup also. Recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vivite line for the last year and have noticed some subtle differences, but nothing major.  I do like this deep cleanser because it sloughs off the dead skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin feels very smooth after I use it. I may go to using daily instead of every day and see if I obtain even better results.</li>
    <li> Just love this product!  Nothing like it.</li>
    <li> I use this about twice a week to keep my face exfoliated and smooth. At first, the chemicals were a bit harsh and my skin felt dry and tight afterwards, but now that I&#x27;ve used it a few weeks, the results are much better. A thorough scrubbing seems to clean my skin better than other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, and it rinses off easily, leaving me feeling smooth and clean with minimal fuss. In addition, the product is almost unscented, so there&#x27;s no fragrance in the way - just a nice smooth clean result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended, and Amazon&#x27;s price is about the best I&#x27;ve found for this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. This is the best exfoliating product, whether cleanser or mask, I&#x27;ve ever used. After 2 or 3 uses, I notice my skin looks brighter and the texture is much smoother. I use it every third day and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin flakey like most exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for three years.  I really like it.  It exfoliates and cleanse my skin.  I used it twice a week and it leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliating cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Works great! Leaves your face looking smooth,even, and radiant</li>
    <li> This cleanser keeps my skin bright and even.  I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of cleansers including most high end cleansers and this is my all time favorite. HOLY GRAIL!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have purchased this product as well outside of my doctor&#x27;s office, and again..very pleased! :)</li>
    <li> This makes your face feel super clean and soft. It cleared up my acne &amp; got rid of all the blackheads. Love it!</li>
    <li> It works great.  I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 because there was something I didn&#x27;t like about the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I have a LOT of hyper-pigmentation on my back and it had gotten to the point where it covered almost my entire back so far I have used the exfoliating cleanser once a day and my back has not only lightened up considerably but most of it is actually clear now and I have only been using it for barely a month so i cannot wait to see the results in a couple more months time :)</li>
    <li> I was first given this by my dermatologist after I had an IPL laser treatment on my face. It really smooths my skin out and helps my rosacea. I highly recommend and have been buying regularly.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use this every day - use 3 times a week at most - I do Mon, Wed &amp; Fri.  It will help your texture for SURE, help pores shrink, keep your skin clear from acne, help with anti-aging too.  Don&#x27;t push too hard - the scrubby beads will do the work for you. Expensive though - another one to try is Replinix clarifying brightening polish- it has glycolic acid as well, but also has salicylic acid, green tea, arbutin(brightening/lightening) and more but it&#x27;s more abrasive as far as the scrubby beads go so be even more light handed with that one.  Glycolic acid is something you need to use consistently - forever - not just one bottle.  You also have to use some kind of Retinol product to get anti aging benefits, but don&#x27;t use glycolic acid and retina-A within an hour of each other, I&#x27;d recommend even longer - because they cancel each other out. I use this in the AM, retina-a at night.</li>
    <li> great exfoliator for all types of skin, even my teenager is able to use it on her sensitive skin. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! I can&#x27;t go without it. The scrub is extremely effective while still be gentle to the face. I use it daily with no irritation. It leaves my skin smooth and bright after every use!</li>
    <li> Gently exfoliates my skin! It&#x27;s so smooth after using this product and helps keep my pores clean. I will continue to use and recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for 6 years, nothing worked.  I started using this every day, twice (sometimes once) a day and it has cured my acne and the exfoliating part helps fade my scars.  Amazing product.  I will always use this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face scrub. I have used many differed products over the years, Rx and regular but this is the only product that keeps my acne at bay, clears my pores and scrubs away dead skin. I used this twice a day everyday and my skin looks great, the best it has ever looked. There is no chemical smell and my skin is super sensitive and this doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It can sting a bit if skin is broken or you have an open blemish but it’s totally worth it. I have been using this for a year now and it’s the best. 1 tube also lasts me 3 months so it’s worth the money. Do not get this in your eyes, it will sting a lot. Also has a bad taste so watch out for that too. But other wise, this product is amazing.</li>
    <li> The exfoliator is a key ingredient that works very well with the serum, eye cream and night cream to obtain excellent results.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I am a 31 year old male and have blackheads on my nose.  This has not eliminated them but had diminished them quite a bit.  I use it morning and night to wash my face.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with other Vivite cleansing products. This one however, caused my face to become really dry and &amp;#34;sunburnt&amp;#34;, with peeling skin and everything. I work in an office, it&#x27;s winter so there&#x27;s no sun, and I&#x27;m outside maybe only 1 out of 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped use and my face healed, but then I gave it another chance and thought that maybe the first time was a fluke... and even though I used very little, the symptoms came back again.&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side -- aside from all the pain, red, peeling skin -- my acne is gone. So I guess it worked... in a way.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable savings.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t live without this soap. it does the greatest job of cleaning and exfoliating.  i haven&#x27;t found a better product,.....as an acne sufferer, i&#x27;ve tried a LOT.</li>
    <li> Really makes my face red, but seems to exfoliate like crazy!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this about 1x per week(2x per wk at max) to help keep any break outs away; if I use it more often, my skin has a tendency to dry out, especially around the nose area. But I found out the best way it works for my skin and it most certainly keeps any blemishes at bay and is great for summer months and weather.</li>
    <li> Has a strong smell but works well. I use it with my clairsonic brush every other day.  Might a little strong for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Vivite Exfoliating Cleanser is a very good in that it removes dead skin cells.  For those with sensitive skin it should not be used mpre frequently than every other nightI alternating with a vivite cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Vivite!!  Makes my skin look and feel great!!  Can also use with a Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a number of years. When my Dermotologist retired, my new one doesn&#x27;t get this particular one, but, is OK with me still using it. The others I tried weren&#x27;t working for me. By the end of the day my face was feeling oily. It doesn&#x27;t do that with this one. Truthfully I only use it in the morning everyday.</li>
    <li> The only thing that works to clear my skin.  Great exfoliant to remove dead skin cells to help keep your pores clear. Got rid of my adult acne.</li>
    <li> With oily skin, this product can b used daily.</li>
    <li> This is literally like the finest sand mixed in a bottle with your favorite facial wash.  It leaves your skin smooth and shiny without any over drying or oily residue.  The best part is also that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  Just a small penny sized drop and rub in small circular motion on your face and you&#x27;re good to go.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE all Vivite products.  Since I started using this gentle, but effective scrub, I have improved the smoothness of my skin to the point that other people have commented.  No more little clogged pores (milia)!  It&#x27;s the best scrub on the market in my opinion. The particles are tiny and don&#x27;t scratch the skin like in many scrubs. This tube lasts a surprisingly long time, too.  I use a dime size dollop twice a day and it lasts for a few months.</li>
    <li> I love this product! it is a great exfoliator for your face. It leaves your skin shiney and smooth.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a construction worker by any means, quite the opposite - I live in a cube. However after noticing the damage the UV light had been inflicting I gave this product a shot. I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to, but my skin is noticeably smoother and softer after incorporating this product into my face washing regimen. (2-3 times a week) I&#x27;d give it a shot if you would like smoother skin. 30/m.</li>
    <li> been using this product for a year and a half. love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Exfoliating Cleanser for a couple months now.  I like the feel, the grittiness is good on the skin.  There are no dramatic differences in my skin, but i don&#x27;t expect to have the skin of an 18-year old anymore.  But it works well at keeping my skin fresh, exfoliated and nicely toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use most all of the Vivite line. I just love this cleanser. It has just enough of the exfoliating beads that feel like they really work. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot... just a little drop so it should last a while. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> very good product,skin feels nice and smooth, i have been using this product over year. has been delivered on time! very happy about it!</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister. She had a a problem with acne. She says its good and really helps her skin. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, i have used for several months and have gotten great results.  This is my 5th bottle to order</li>
    <li> Just received this cleanser and absolutely love it after the first use.  It feels great on your skin, like you are scrubbing away all those dead skin cells.  I suggest applying in gentle circles as you scrub to avoid irritation until your face gets used to the grittiness.  My skin looks so fresh and bright, can&#x27;t wait to see how it will help with fine lines after continued use.  One final note: I paid $17.70 for this product on Amazon last week and noticed that it is now selling for $27.  Will have to shop around when it is time to repurchase!</li>
    <li> This product is not vivite. Contacted allergan to confirm that the product was in fact fake. Will not buy again .</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean. My husband especially likes this product. It cleared up some blackheads for him.</li>
    <li> This product has 15% true, pure glycolic in it. It sells for $65 a bottle in some plastic surgery offices. I can&#x27;t believe how soft of makes my skin. It also works very quickly on fine lines, discoloration and scarring. I have struggled  with cystic acne for years, I now get it occasionally and this product has been the only thing out of the thousands of dollars I&#x27;ve spent on products and laser treatment that&#x27;s give a fast visible reduction in the scarring. If a cyst pops up I dab this product in and let it sit for a few minutes and rinse, unbelievable results compared to how severe and how long they cysts would commonly last.  The price of this product on amazon is a real steal, my estatician couldn&#x27;t believe I found it, thanks Amazon! Do be aware, if you have any permanent makeup, as I do, refrain from getting it on those areas it will lighten over time. This product is something everyone could benifit from!!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I don&#x27;t use the entire Vivite line, but this I really like. It cleans thoroughly and removes eye makeup. This is one I always have on hand.</li>
    <li> All 3 of them came and i was somewhat dissappointed to see how old the packaging appeared to be and the fady prints on the lables were. Didn&#x27;t think much of it and already gave one away as a gift. After about 2 weeks went by since i received these and was just opening up to wash my face and.... i noticed the product was made 9 yrs ago, in 2006! They should not be selling something this old since the ingredients of the products must have changed. they musy be so desperated to sell off even almost 10yrs old product for $$. I am returning all 3.&lt;br /&gt;Watch out Amazon shoppers! This is not my first time getting an old Vivite product. I had sent back 6-7yrs old same exfoliating cleanser before. Shame on you Amazon for filtering thru bad quality product. Does not deserve any star.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price and I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product! Leaves my face smooth and looking great. I use it every other day with my Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> love it!  Use it twice a week in conjunction with my Avene  Soap Free Cleanser and it is AMAZING!  Keeps skin exfoliated without irritating, great for acne prone or sensitive skin and the glycolic is great for collagen growth and cell renewal / anti aging benefits!  Great price as I was spending double at my dermatologist.  You don&#x27;t want to use this daily and just lightly rub so you are not scratching your skin...but I recommend!  Use about twice a week and you will notice a glow and difference in your skin, as well as a clearer complexion!</li>
    <li> My skin feels really soft after using this. I highly recommend this exfoliant. Really! I have tried so many thing from Sephora. This one is great!</li>
    <li> This is my go to fave wash, it is a scrub and I love the clean feeling I get after every use. Not greasy at all, just leave an overall clean face. Helps to keep away ant acne and it is great for aging skin because it has glycolic in it.</li>
    <li> I received a small sample of this from my dermatoligist, and I used it for 3 days with my clarsonic brush on my forehead and it got rid of the bumps on my forhead.  I think this is and amazing product.  I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> It is a very good price for a cleanser that my dermatologist recommended. I was happy to find it online!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this cleanser wrecked my complexion.  It left my skin color pasty, and I developed dry patches, even after using a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this product each morning and within a week of the initial use my acne cleared up. It is a must have in my daily routine. I rarely buy cleansers twice, always looking for something better. This is as good as it gets. I am on my 4th bottle. Amazon carries it for a great price. . . at the med spa it can be quite spendy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed some of my brown spots and melasma appearing lighter.  Without a doubt it is a very slow process.  But this cleanser seems to work better than any lightening cream my dermatologist has recommended in the past.  The directions suggest using it 2 - 3 times a week.  But I use it almost every day with a Clairsonic skincare tool while in the shower.  The combination definitely makes my skin feel smoother and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m outdoors quite a bit, so I make a point of wearing at least SPF 20 sunscreen to alleviate any further sun damage.  Wrinkles are a part of life and aging, as are dark spots.  So they will never completely disappear.  In my opinion, this cleanser helps my skin look better than it would otherwise.  I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I did not have product issues like some have posted.  There are many sellers from which to choose.  I purchased mine from Brands for Less, if that helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before &amp; stopped using it because my skin became irritated.  However, it was winter at the time and that seems to have been the difference.  I recently started using it again and it completely cleared up my complexion.  I can highly recommend this product.  My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I have used this previously.  It works great as an exfoliator.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  I paid much more for it from her.</li>
    <li> I love most Vivite products and this one is a keeper.  I have problem skin and use this to improve my acne/lines.</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliating cleanser. I have sensitive skin and it keeps it looking bright and clear. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My go to when greasy. For the glycolic lines, this truly one of the best</li>
    <li> A+ for service and product. This is my 2nd order with this seller and I&#x27;m really pleased. I love this exfoliating cleanser. It&#x27;s helps keep my pore clear and skin smooth. Apply it dry for more intense results (rinsing with water/soft washcloth), add water for more gentle cleansing. 100% authentic and I&#x27;ll keep repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I bought the travel size for this to try it out.  I am completely sold on this.  I don&#x27;t care if it doesn&#x27;t do any thing else.  I am just so happy with the way my skin felt after using this exfoliater.  My face felt baby soft the first time I used it.  If you use make up and other products on your face.  It is especially important to exfoliate for healthy skin.  This product will deep clean your pores without any irritation.  Your skin will thank you by looking great.  :-)</li>
    <li> does a good job scrubbing but not too harsh. little on the expensive side could maybe just get a drugstore brand that would work the same,</li>
    <li> I am a 23 year old female with very acne prone skin. I do not have full face acne, but get break outs on the average/high side and feel like i have oily/dry skin (differs throughout face.) Most of the face washes I was using were either drying out my skin or making it feel clean for a minute and then after a few minutes I would start to feel the oil coming in again. My dermatologist recommended this product and I bought thinking 16 bucks wasnt as cheap as st ives but that there was prob a reason for the price difference. I have been sooo happy! Havent had any break outs, the oily skin (t-zone) are much more relaxed/cleaner, and it is not dry although I will wait a little longer to confirm that because i know dryness takes a while to kick in. I am very happy and DEF recommend this product for anybody who feels like they want better results and are a willing to pay a few dollars extra. Save yourself the money in the long run and avoid all those st.ives, neutrogena, etc.</li>
    <li> I am a skin care lover(Clinique mostly) and was looking for a good aha exfoliator that I could use twice a week, I use it when I don&#x27;t use my Clarisonic. This product has been a nice addition to my routine! My skin looks fresh and glowing. :)</li>
    <li> I loved using the Vivite Hydrating Cream and wanted to try some of their other products.  I LOVE this Exfoliating Facial Cleanser.  I have sensitive skin and have to be careful with the products that I use.  It makes my skin feel very smooth and clean and moist.  I use it about 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  Beyond the obvious bullet points of this product, I want to mention that this is a good sized bottle.  It seems that the phrase, \\&quot;a little bit goes a long way\\&quot; is very applicable in this case. I got a solid 3 months (if not more) out of this bottle and I use it once daily.  So, really, that&#x27;s a higher quality product, AND a better deal than the \\&quot;top shelf\\&quot; products at the supermarket.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased Vivite Exfoliating Facial Cleanser from my physician.  This product is a combination of manual and chemical exfoliants that leaves my skin smooth and bright.  I have oily &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m 53) skin and Vivite really helps with fine lines, age spots and uneven skin. I&#x27;ve been told my skin is &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; and I feel I owe it mostly to my daily use of Vivite. To find such an amazing product at an Amazon price...now that&#x27;s perfect! :-)</li>
    <li> I love this.  It is gentle and effective.  A very fine exfoliate.  I will buy it again until I find something better.</li>
    <li> The best cleanser ever  - good for all skin types!! You can feel a difference - use about 3x per week - even my very picky brother lovessss it!!</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a week on my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; to keep that youthful looking skin.</li>
    <li> It was fine. I&#x27;ve used it before and really liked it so that&#x27;s why I purchased it agsin. It works eonderfully.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliate. Makes skin radiant and soft.</li>
    <li> This may be a rip off of the actual product. The packaging is different than I what I have had before and the product seems different.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it.  However, the one I purchased this time seemed to be watered down.  Either the manufacturer has changed the formula or I just happened to get a bad tube.  At any rate, based on this experience alone, I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, just a small amount a couple times a week keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliator, not too harsh on skin and I love it. I&#x27;m now using most of this line and have seen wonderful improvement in my skin. Love it</li>
    <li> As a writer for GOD, I need to experience all the best results in CHRIST  [[ASIN:1432748335 A Soul Sealed at Character Perfection: God&#x27;s Eternal Love Empowering Victory Over Sin]]. I purchased this product over a month ago: and, it does produce great results. I highly recommend this, as a facial skin cleanser.</li>
    <li> The best exfoliating cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used!!  My dermatologist got me started on this brand and I love them!!  It truly is an exfoliator, very gritty... I really feel it working on my skin!  Easy to rinse off and leaves my face feeling so fresh!</li>
    <li> Eh, havent really noticed a difference as much as the product and reviews claim?</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliating cleanser.. it is professional and salon treatments use Vivite.. no irritating the eyes.. and my face feels so nice after washing.. my skin is smooth and bright.. This product is much cheaper on Amazon then other sites.. for Vitite products are the best for me.. My daughter is in the beauty industry and this is the product her medical based spa uses.. It helps with younger people also who have acne.. it has high a glycolic content 15%  most products do not have this high amount.. it just works.. and makes you feel so fresh and bright.. it is for all ages.. my daughter and I both use it  and other products in this line..  you don&#x27;t need much of this product so it lasts a long time.. I have tried many many other products  this is the one  for me.... well worth the cost... if you are on the edge of if you should buy this.. do it.. you will like it so much..</li>
    <li> I love it,make my face glowing and clean and no irritation no red spot,and the good thing is cheper than my clinc price which i used to buoght from.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vivite products along with VI Derm products for a few years now and I have no complaints at all. This seller is also one of the cheapest,reliable and honest seller of the Vivite products. I hear some saying that the Vivite actually broke them out more and caused more acne/skin problems. With any great product that&#x27;s actually working, you are going to break out when you first start using it for a couple weeks to a month,but I promise you after that time has passed and your skin has adapted, you will love how your skin looks and feels and you will hardly if ever have a breakout or the skin irritations you were experiencing before you used the Vivite. Any doctor will tell you that when using a product for your skin problems,it will get worse before it gets better, but that lets you know the product is working for you. I would recommend this product to anyone who has skin problems such as acne, wrinkles, freckles, pigmentation or to anyone who just wants to keep their skin fresh and glowing. All I can say to others who feel different about it is &amp;#34;give it time&amp;#34;. The prices this seller has for the products is wonderful also and I&#x27;ll be back again soon, Thanks and good luck to all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and it is by far better than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I use this with my hand held electric facial cleaner and the grit is so very fine.  It never dries and my skin feels wonderful.  Use with the Vivite night cream before bed.  Love both products.</li>
    <li> I have battled Rosea for years and this stuff has worked better than anything that any dermatologist has ever prescribed for me. Not a outbreak in 4 months, but I do use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I first tried this face wash from American Laser and Skin Care, it works better than ones I would but at the drug store and I was happy that I could order it off of Amazon because my appointments at American laser were done! If you wash morning and evenings it will really help clear up acne and blank heads.</li>
    <li> Love the scrub. Gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin. Gets rid of minor white heads in one or two uses. It lasts me a long time since I only need a small amount. Don&#x27;t need to use everyday but can be used every once in a while in cases of acne flares or clogged pores in the summer.</li>
