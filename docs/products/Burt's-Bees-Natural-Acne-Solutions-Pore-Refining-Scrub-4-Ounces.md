### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>All the wonderful products and</li>
      <li>is looking wonderful.  </li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t stop using it and very happy that I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>which was great!</li>
      <li>and my skin feels so wonderful.</li>
      <li>I find that it is also very effective in controlling my acne!  </li>
      <li>For me, this was actually a very pleasant surprise.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS A GOOD THING!  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it</li>
      <li>And, I&#x27;m getting fewer breakouts, so that&#x27;s a win in my book.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was nervous about abandoning a product I loved that I had used for years, but this is a great replacement.</li>
      <li>and I am good to go.</li>
      <li>It does, but for me that is a good thing.</li>
      <li>Smells good too.</li>
      <li>And no, it&#x27;s not the pleasant kind that comes with oil washing.</li>
      <li>This product and line is wonderful, smells great, gentle</li>
      <li>love the feeling and it makes me look great</li>
      <li>I LOVE this face wash!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I noticed the smell wasn&#x27;t the most pleasant.</li>
      <li>is amazingly soft&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>Does a nice job cleaning out my pores.</li>
      <li>Plus, a nice damp wash cloth does the trick with washing any excess cleanser off of your face.</li>
      <li>It does kind of make your face feel like it has some sort of a film on it, but didnt bother me after I put on my moisturizer and makeup.</li>
      <li>the scent is pleasant and clean!  </li>
      <li>I was taken aback at how delicious and natural this product smells.  </li>
      <li>but it is kind of oily and leaves me feeling even more oily than before my shower.</li>
      <li>If you want a gentle scrub that exfoliates and leaves a nice moisturizing after-effect, you may be happy with this product.</li>
      <li>One more time, oil does not cause acne.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks more radiant and my acne scars are clearing out a bit.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t spend more time in my review on this, but you can research for yourself.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I purchased the gel cleanser to use with this.</li>
      <li>You just need to make sure that you keep up using it like it is directed to or it won&#x27;t work has well, so it takes time</li>
      <li>As for just focusing on this scrub, I think it could use more of the scrubbing beads, but maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m just used to thicker scrubs.</li>
      <li>Lovely stuff,</li>
      <li>The smell isnt the best, but I didnt find that too much of a big deal.</li>
      <li>I use a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and love them, but this product does not match up at all.</li>
      <li>I have been using those two products for over a month now and my skin looks fantastic!</li>
      <li>and I love what it does for my skin.</li>
      <li>I thought this product would be more of a cleansing scrub</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>, if you have problems with the aggressive clean soaps and creams and whatever they want you to buy out there, try this scrub! :)</li>
      <li>and I got used to that waxy after-feel, but the new one&#x27;s great too.</li>
      <li>Great product that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and has a nice texture to it</li>
      <li>The product does not have a large about of \\&quot;scrub balls\\&quot;, I kind of wished it had more of them.</li>
      <li>:)  Nothing like having your face clean before leaving the house.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any lather, but spreads rather easily on the skin.</li>
      <li>It is easy to spread across the face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Though I wanted a more exfoliating experience, I think the size of the scrubbing agents is still useful for this purpose, and I do LOVE the waxy film it leaves on my face afterward.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting my skin to get completely clear, but man was it a nice surprise!</li>
      <li>Though this product is less than desirable and I would not recommend it, Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser is wonderful and though it does not have the exfoliating aspect, it clears acne successfully.</li>
      <li>, it made me feel very calm, clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>and my acne prone areas begin to smooth out.</li>
      <li>Smells delicious, has nice scrubbing action - not too rough.</li>
      <li>I love it very much.</li>
      <li>This product seems very promising for me, I may have to buy more if this continues to work as well as it has been.</li>
      <li>Okay, here are some facts you will notice after your first use:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>its keeps my face clean &amp; beatifull</li>
      <li>A lot of acne scrubs leave your skin feeling squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>Make a scrub with sugar instead, it&#x27;ll actually clean your pores out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does not feel clean after using.</li>
      <li>This product utilizes jojoba oil which closely mimics the skin&#x27;s own natural sebum.  </li>
      <li>It helps my skin to \\&quot;relax\\&quot; and makes it soft and just nice.</li>
      <li>Proactiv helped me tremendously during my teens but once I hit my 20&#x27;s, it stopped working altogether.</li>
      <li>This scrub is good for dry skin as its moisturizing and it leaves me skin feeling clean.</li>
      <li>but then it quickly went away.</li>
      <li>The scrubbing particles are very gentle and smooth, as scrubbing particles go.</li>
      <li>I liked the idea that this one was for acne, and although I haven&#x27;t really had any breakouts since using it, it just left my skin not feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>For someone looking for a nice cleanser that leaves your face feeling clean and fresh , this is definitely not it .</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is an oil based product, it is easy to use too much</li>
      <li>/&gt;There were not enough jojoba beads to provide effective exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I first tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27;Deep Cleansing Cream&#x27; with chamomile and soap bark, which really grew on me and I loved, but decided to switch things up when I ran out.</li>
      <li>, I think I&#x27;m so used to other companies putting fragrance into their products to make them smell good.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m still using the stuff, but I have to use a gentle cleanser afterward to feel my face is clean.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say the first night that I used it and woke up the next morning</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin tone and color even, gets rid of dry patches, doesn&#x27;t over dry, and smells lovely - light, almost citrusy, not as strong as most Burt&#x27;s products.</li>
      <li>Another review here mentions that it&#x27;s due to a certain product in it, which ultimately is good for your skin, so knowing that it feels more justified, but still...not my favourite facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this face wash because jojoba scrubs are supposed to be fantastic.</li>
      <li>I agree with the other reviewer about the thick film it leaves on your face, but I thought it was great because it was very moisturizing and felt great.  </li>
      <li>The smell is not bad, but Burt&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t really add a ton a fragrance for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I must say, I absolutely love the smell, it is very soothing, as are many other products by Burt&#x27;s Bees that I have tried.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still gentle on my skin and seems to help with my mild acne.</li>
      <li>This scrub was very gentle on my skin and left it feeling healthy.</li>
      <li>With how soft this product has made my skin, it makes applying my foundation and concealer much more easily, and as a new day comes I can see more improvement in my skin, which means having to use less make up</li>
      <li>and, my personal favorite, their blemish stick.</li>
      <li>the best one ill try</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like that at first either.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using this scrub.</li>
      <li>You just need to take extra care in making sure those beads are washed off, as they like to hide along my hair line and in my eye brows.</li>
      <li>When I first tried it</li>
      <li>I do really like it!  </li>
      <li>I noticed that my skin was much softer, which rarely happens for me, and my skin started to look much better overall in condition, despite the spots of acne, which is unusual for me to experience in a product.</li>
      <li>Give it a try and don&#x27;t worry about the &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s full of rich emollients that will help your complexion and as long as you&#x27;re not in really hot weather it&#x27;ll not make you feel greasy at all.</li>
      <li>But after sticking with it, it&#x27;s done a good job of keeping my skin clear and not drying it out as much as other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No, it won&#x27;t leave your skin squeaky clean (or dried out for that matter) like many cleansers do.  </li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is very hit or miss.</li>
      <li>Think i&#x27;ll buy the whole set..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I didnt get this product off of here, I got it in a store. I personally have dry skin. This scrub is good for dry skin as its moisturizing and it leaves me skin feeling clean. Smells good too. I have never seen a white film ever using this</li>
    <li> This had a completely different consistency than the one I had previously bought at the store. It seemed to have significantly less jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what this &amp;#34;white film&amp;#34; everyone is talking about is. I&#x27;ve been using this scrub a few times a week for a while now, and I&#x27;ve never gotten a white film on my skin. Maybe they&#x27;re not rinsing well enough? It does take a bit more effort to rinse this off than other scrubs, but I just use a wet washcloth to help it along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do know is that this is one of the few acne scrubs I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight and dry, yet my skin still feels clean and soft. The scrubbing particles are very gentle and smooth, as scrubbing particles go. They are not harsh and scratchy. And, I&#x27;m getting fewer breakouts, so that&#x27;s a win in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub is almost like the consistency of cold cream, if you&#x27;ve ever used cold cream. If not, think a very thick but not heavy feeling lotion. It doesn&#x27;t have any lather, but spreads rather easily on the skin. Like I said above, it does take more rinsing than usual to get this off your skin, but a damp washcloth makes this a non-issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin or even normal skin this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you. But if your skin is dry, combination, or sensitive, give it a try. I&#x27;m really happy with it and it will be a regular part of my routine for the forseeable future.</li>
    <li> Over the last year or so, my acne has changed.  Instead of getting a few large, easily popped pimples that clear up mostly on my cheeks, I seem to have a smattering of very tiny but plentiful pimples across my forehead that are extremely difficult to pop or get rid of.  Any time I squeeze them, they would fill right back up the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would help right this change back to normal and after using this cleaner for a couple of weeks, I believe this (combined with the spot treatment stick) have done it for me.  I was taken aback at how delicious and natural this product smells.  It is really sweet and nature-y, and a little hard to describe but very good.  (The spot treatment stick, on the other hand, smells exactly like licorice.  Bleh!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say something about the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling people have mentioned.  No, it won&#x27;t leave your skin squeaky clean (or dried out for that matter) like many cleansers do.  This product utilizes jojoba oil which closely mimics the skin&#x27;s own natural sebum.  THIS IS A GOOD THING!  For me, this was actually a very pleasant surprise.  Your skin won&#x27;t be dried out after washing and while it may feel weird at first, it is quickly absorbed and you don&#x27;t peel, itch or flake as a result.  I will leave you with something to think about and research, so keep an open mind when I say this: oil does not cause acne.  One more time, oil does not cause acne.  Dead skin cells and bacteria trapped in the pores cause acne.  I won&#x27;t spend more time in my review on this, but you can research for yourself.  It is called The Oil Cleansing Method.  Please look it up.</li>
    <li> Leaves thick film on your face that is impossible to get off. I had the water on for 2 minutes trying to wash this stuff off (not so environmenatally friendly) and still had film left on my face. I think I am going to just throw this stuff away!</li>
    <li> This scrub was very gentle on my skin and left it feeling healthy. It didnt make my skin feel tight at all or dry which was great! The smell isnt the best, but I didnt find that too much of a big deal. It does kind of make your face feel like it has some sort of a film on it, but didnt bother me after I put on my moisturizer and makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three days now, im on my fourth day. I can honestly say the first night that I used it and woke up the next morning I saw a difference. Everyone complains about the waxy layer feel that it leaves behind, I love it, it makes my face feel soo soft and my skin is never dry and it eventually gos away, I mean come on its BURTS BEES, kind of expected if you ask me..Definitely feel like I got my moneys worth and this is the first product ive tried that i can tell a difference, and in the past few months ive tried many different products. It says use it two to three times a week but I use it every night. BUY IT! You wont regret it. Think i&#x27;ll buy the whole set..</li>
    <li> I bought this product in a pharmacy in the US, used it at home and I must say It is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;Struggled with red under-skin-pimples, tried Clerasil and all the aggressive facial cleaners but my skin always felt itchy and irritated or dry after using them. This product is different, it gives me the feeling of gently removing old cells and really cleaning the skin without irritating it. Someone here said it leaves a film on your skin. It does, but for me that is a good thing. It helps my skin to \\&quot;relax\\&quot; and makes it soft and just nice. The fact that it&#x27;s all organic makes me giving this producs 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;It is just a natural way to clean and prevent your face from getting ugly big pimples again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you have problems with the aggressive clean soaps and creams and whatever they want you to buy out there, try this scrub! :)</li>
    <li> I just bought this product and have only used it once so far, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness in terms of reducing acne, but.....  I do really like it!  I agree with the other reviewer about the thick film it leaves on your face, but I thought it was great because it was very moisturizing and felt great.  My skin felt extremely soft after using this scrub.  If you want a cleanser that leaves your face squeaky clean and dried out, this product is not for you.  If you want a gentle scrub that exfoliates and leaves a nice moisturizing after-effect, you may be happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Def scrubs away surface impurities and evens out the skin tone.  My husband says it works for his body acne.</li>
    <li> Both husband and I felt our oily faces were left far greasier after using this - and had to wash our faces afterwards to get the grease slick off. Ick. Don&#x27;t know how one would call this a scrub. Tried once and thats it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face wash! It leaves your skin feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> This is my fourth time ordering this scrub and I love what it does for my skin. I&#x27;ve found that it is gentle enough to use daily and I apply it in the shower after cleansing with my Clarisonic. I would recommend any of the Burt&#x27;s Bees acne products.</li>
    <li> Like others, I had been researching alternative facial cleansing products after having used Proactiv for years. Proactiv helped me tremendously during my teens but once I hit my 20&#x27;s, it stopped working altogether. I began using a natural facial scrub by Desert Essence, along with diluted tea tree oil as a toner. This combination worked for a little while but the acne came back. I ran across Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Solutions while perusing at Target, read some reviews before purchasing anything from the line. I finally bought the Pore Refining Scrub as my daily cleanser (gel and cream cleansers don&#x27;t work on my skin) along with the Toner. I have been using those two products for over a month now and my skin looks fantastic! There was a small initial outbreak once I first started using these but then it quickly went away. Now all that&#x27;s left on my face are a few acne scars that I cover up with Bare Minerals Bisque Concealer (fabulous, by the way). I would recommend the Burt&#x27;s Bees cleansing line to absolutely anyone. I wasn&#x27;t expecting my skin to get completely clear, but man was it a nice surprise! As for just focusing on this scrub, I think it could use more of the scrubbing beads, but maybe that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m just used to thicker scrubs. Someone below me stated that they felt as though this is just a cold cream. No, it is not thick like a cold cream at all. It is easy to spread across the face. Someone also said, maybe the same person, that it is hard to wash off. I don&#x27;t find it hard to wash off, nor does it leave a film on my skin afterwards. You just need to take extra care in making sure those beads are washed off, as they like to hide along my hair line and in my eye brows. Plus, a nice damp wash cloth does the trick with washing any excess cleanser off of your face. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying this scrub, or any products from this brand, just do it! You need to give it a month or longer before giving up, as sometimes the skin breaks out when a new cleanser is introduced to it.ntroduced to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Pore Refining Scrub to exfoliate my acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were not enough jojoba beads to provide effective exfoliation. The cream-base of the scrub was a too moisturizing for my skin. Also, the coconut oil in the formulation is a bad idea for acne-prone skin -- coconut oil is known to be highly comedogenic. I did not realize it was on the ingredient list or I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Pore Refining Scrub to my little sister. I will not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: water, grape seed oil, salicylic acid (1.0%), stearic acid, glycerin, hydrogenated jojoba oil, willow bark extract, coconut oil, sodium borate, fragrance, bilberry extract, sugar cane extract, orange fruit extract, lemon fruit extract, sugar maple extract, sucrose stearate, xanthan gum, glucose, sodium chloride, glucose oxidase, lactoperoxidase</li>
    <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees products a few days ago and I seem to have broken out a little more. Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the products, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see if it improves.</li>
    <li> I too bought this product because I wanted a natural alternative to facial scrubs out there  . I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and figured I would this give this a try after comparing it with their other facial washes . This is like a thick cold cream that does not come off your skin easily . I washed my hands over and over again after using it and still the thick film was there . I do not have heavy acne ( barely any at all ) and I can not imagine putting this on skin with acne , it is so heavy . I could see if you have extemely dry skin that this product would help . For someone looking for a nice cleanser that leaves your face feeling clean and fresh , this is definitely not it . I prefer to use lotion seperate from my cleanser , not in it . Maybe it does help other people , but not me . Even opening the door after washing my face with this and washing my hands left a residue on my doorknob . Greasy filmy messy stuff , so just know what you are in for with this stuff .</li>
    <li> love the feeling and it makes me look great .. :)  Nothing like having your face clean before leaving the house.</li>
    <li> My very dry skin loves it, and misses it when I run out! It keeps my skin tone and color even, gets rid of dry patches, doesn&#x27;t over dry, and smells lovely - light, almost citrusy, not as strong as most Burt&#x27;s products. I use it every evening, followed by coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Out of nowhere came a horrendous breakout of acne on my face just recently, being that I had nothing at home and with only little money to spare I immediately bought this online. This is my first time using this scrub. I must say, I absolutely love the smell, it is very soothing, as are many other products by Burt&#x27;s Bees that I have tried. Initially I was not too fond of the cream itself, seemed a little messy but I gave it a try anyway; it definitely scrubbed away a lot of dead skin and my face began to heal after the first wash, the wonderful smell that I could seriously sniff all day long stuck around for quite some time, it made me feel very calm, clean and healthy. I noticed that my skin was much softer, which rarely happens for me, and my skin started to look much better overall in condition, despite the spots of acne, which is unusual for me to experience in a product. I had several small pimples under my nose / across the top of my lip which began to dry up and flake off after the first use - not \\&quot;dry up\\&quot; as in my skin became excessively dry, it is quite the opposite actually - my skin feels very well hydrated yet not at all oily. I have only been using this product for three or four days, once or twice a day and my skin feels so wonderful. After washing I dab just a tiny bit of moisturizing lotion and I am good to go. With how soft this product has made my skin, it makes applying my foundation and concealer much more easily, and as a new day comes I can see more improvement in my skin, which means having to use less make up (no, my makeup did not cause the break out, have been using the same stuff for a long time with zero issues, I think it was caused by heightened stress!). This product seems very promising for me, I may have to buy more if this continues to work as well as it has been. I realize it is perhaps too soon to tell, but never have I ever used a product that has given me these kinds of results. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this product for awhile before I gave it a review, have been using every other day for a month and I LOVE it.  I got a facial and they used only A@#$a products an told me to buy over $120 worth of products that should only last about 1 month.  Instead of spending a lot of my money I started to research other brands that were all natural and had pretty much the same main ingredients.  After countless hours I came upon this natural acne defense line and got every product from the line.  The first 2 weeks my skin got worse but that is common when starting a new treatment but I didn&#x27;t stop using it and very happy that I didn&#x27;t.  Had really bad acne after my son was born and was sick and tired of using harsh products on my face and not getting the results I wanted.  This product and line is wonderful, smells great, gentle but yet can feel it woking and cleansing the skin.  I use it with the Natural gel cleanser, Natural Toner, blemish stick, Natural acne spot treatment and my skin is looking wonderful.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong all my acne hasn&#x27;t disappeared but it almost has, you can barely see it and I usually treat it right away so it doesn&#x27;t get that bad.  You just need to make sure that you keep up using it like it is directed to or it won&#x27;t work has well, so it takes time but when it coms to clear/clean skin I don&#x27;t really care how long it takes!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I think the formula has recently been changed, because the bottles now say &amp;#34;99% natural&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;100% natural,&amp;#34; and the scrub no longer has a waxy feel. With the new version, you definitely get that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling that everyone likes so much. I think I actually preferred the old version, because it felt a bit gentler and I got used to that waxy after-feel, but the new one&#x27;s great too. It&#x27;s still gentle on my skin and seems to help with my mild acne.</li>
    <li> Terrible...wish I could return it! All the wonderful products and I wasted money on this horrible stuff. Leaves a thick filmy residue that does not rinse off my face! Just a few sad particles in the product that is supposed to help scrub/exfoliate? There is barely anything in this product except thick gooey crud! Yucky. I just use this thick nasty stuff on my body to use the product up. Definitely do not like any filmy gooey residue on my face. Does not feel clean after using. Rate F</li>
    <li> This is an awful product. I really don&#x27;t know how it has 3 and 1/2 stars. Two major cons about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: The waxy film. It leaves a disgusting waxy film on your face. Be prepared to wash your face several times after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: The scrub, or rather the lack thereof. In my mind, scrubs are supposed to have lots of little sand-like pills inside. Instead, there are about thirty of them in the bottle, and they&#x27;re quite large and soft. Make a scrub with sugar instead, it&#x27;ll actually clean your pores out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steer clear of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention the smell. It smells very... unnatural, which this product claims to be.</li>
    <li> This product left a thick residue on my skin. I thought maybe something in the scrub had reacted with my \\&quot;long lasting\\&quot; foundation, but that wasn&#x27;t it; the second time I used this product, I removed my makeup before using the scrub-- still got the film. So I&#x27;m still using the stuff, but I have to use a gentle cleanser afterward to feel my face is clean.</li>
    <li> Often people don&#x27;t like this because it leaves your skin feeling somewhat oily. I didn&#x27;t like that at first either. But after sticking with it, it&#x27;s done a good job of keeping my skin clear and not drying it out as much as other cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See if you like it. Not everyone&#x27;s the same.</li>
    <li> i love this product very much ill used every day&lt;br /&gt; its keeps my face clean &amp; beatifull&lt;br /&gt;its the best one ill try</li>
    <li> Okay, here are some facts you will notice after your first use:&lt;br /&gt;- Scrubbing particles are too big and not abundant.&lt;br /&gt;- After washing off, your face is covered by waxy film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I wanted a more exfoliating experience, I think the size of the scrubbing agents is still useful for this purpose, and I do LOVE the waxy film it leaves on my face afterward. I have combination oily skin with a tendency to having breakouts often and this scrub has been working wonders. It does NOT make my face oily, quite the contrary, it&#x27;s been helping my complexion. My skin looks more radiant and my acne scars are clearing out a bit. I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer after this, but I do like to wash my face thoroughly and using an astringent toner before applying, though that&#x27;s just me. Give it a try and don&#x27;t worry about the &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s full of rich emollients that will help your complexion and as long as you&#x27;re not in really hot weather it&#x27;ll not make you feel greasy at all. In fact, your skin absorbs it in minutes!</li>
    <li> Addicted to this!  Love it and it&#x27;s cleared up my face and controls oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love it very much.I will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, has nice scrubbing action - not too rough. Does a nice job cleaning out my pores.</li>
    <li> I honestly do not understand how this got a single good review, especially from people with acne prone skin. I had high hopes for this face wash because jojoba scrubs are supposed to be fantastic. This was awful. It really leaves a thick, white, very hard to remove film on your face. And no, it&#x27;s not the pleasant kind that comes with oil washing. No, it doesn&#x27;t mimic your sebum. It&#x27;s extremely unpleasant feeling. I had to wash and scrub my face several times after using it with soap afterwards. I ran a finger nail over my skin and a bunch of white gunk came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking it was a fluke, I tried it again the next day. Same thing. Terrible. Burt&#x27;s Bees is very hit or miss. This is a definite miss. Their other acne products are hits, like purifying the gel cleanser and, my personal favorite, their blemish stick. I don&#x27;t know what happened here, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Lovely stuff, but I didn&#x27;t read all the fine print (my bad), so it&#x27;ll be going to someone who isnt allergic to several of the ingredients, and I&#x27;ll be going back to the chamomile cleanser.</li>
    <li> I first tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees &#x27;Deep Cleansing Cream&#x27; with chamomile and soap bark, which really grew on me and I loved, but decided to switch things up when I ran out. To put things simply, even after buying this product, I found myself trying to squeeze whatever was left from my deep cleansing bottle. I liked the idea that this one was for acne, and although I haven&#x27;t really had any breakouts since using it, it just left my skin not feeling very clean. Definitely agree with the greasy feeling it leaves. Another review here mentions that it&#x27;s due to a certain product in it, which ultimately is good for your skin, so knowing that it feels more justified, but still...not my favourite facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I bought this scrub to give it a try. I recently decided to try going natural on my face products in an attempt to alleviate my acne problems. I&#x27;ve yet to find the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; product for my skin, but this scrub has helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me tell you, this stuff is THICK. You really don&#x27;t need as much as you would think. The little microbeads help scrub into your pores and leave my skin feeling smooth. However, this stuff does leave a film or residue after using it. So glad I purchased the gel cleanser to use with this. I cannot stress enough buying the two together if you decide to make this your face regimen. The smell is not bad, but Burt&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t really add a ton a fragrance for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? Probably not. I find that the Neutrogena Naturals Cream Cleanser works just as well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scrub for almost 3 weeks and I love it. I&#x27;ve integrated the scrub into my nightly routine 3 days out of the week. When I first tried it I noticed the smell wasn&#x27;t the most pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell, I think I&#x27;m so used to other companies putting fragrance into their products to make them smell good. The smell reminds me of a natural plant odor. The product does not have a large about of \\&quot;scrub balls\\&quot;, I kind of wished it had more of them. After thoroughly washing my face (I have combo skin) my skin felt healthier and did not get tight (which normally happens after I dry my face). By the third day I noticed some of my pores where smaller then before and my acne prone areas begin to smooth out. I defiantly recommend trying it!</li>
    <li> Hard to find in our small town. Works well</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product had the opposite affects of what I was hoping.  It felt like I was rubbing lip balm on my face and I immediately broke out after using it.  I too had to wash my face immediately after use to get the film off.  Though this product is less than desirable and I would not recommend it, Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser is wonderful and though it does not have the exfoliating aspect, it clears acne successfully.</li>
    <li> This scrub makes my skin feel like it is covered in goo while using, though it leaves no residue after use.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  What I really like about it is that it is only very gently exfoliating yet the scent is pleasant and clean!  I find that it is also very effective in controlling my acne!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is awful. I&#x27;m echoing a lot of other reviewers but want to make sure no one else falls into the same trap. I use a lot of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and love them, but this product does not match up at all. It leaves a thick goo on your face which is seemingly impossible to wash off and feels gross. To answers the reviewers who say that this goo means you don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer - I would MUCH rather use a moisturizer than have white ick on my face that I literally can&#x27;t remove. I&#x27;m sad to say that I have to throw this out after only a few uses - it&#x27;s THAT bad. Don&#x27;t buy it - you will regret it!!!</li>
    <li> Hate it. Leaves a nasty slimy residue on my face that I can&#x27;t seem to wash off and didn&#x27;t clear acne.</li>
    <li> I switched to this after learning that my old scrub had plastic microbeads. I was nervous about abandoning a product I loved that I had used for years, but this is a great replacement. At first it felt as though it was leaving a slight oily residue after using (I imagine because it&#x27;s a natural product), but I have gotten used to that. I give four stars only because I am still in the first tube. I&#x27;d give it five if after a couple of months the results are the same.</li>
    <li> I hate how it made my face very OILY and it didn&#x27;t even work for weeks.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my granddaughter who has begun the acne outbreak.  Many other products she could not use because she would end up with a rash or a red face.  This one works when she remembers to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne.I dont feel like it&#x27;s waxy at all. I&#x27;ve used it in shower and just at sink. I think it&#x27;s a great product and my face has definitely cleared up.</li>
    <li> Great product that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and has a nice texture to it so it exfoliates.</li>
    <li> A lot of acne scrubs leave your skin feeling squeaky clean. This scrub is to one of them, BUT it works. You have to give it a chance. Do not use this product daily or you may experience break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No heavy smell&lt;br /&gt;Skin is amazingly soft&lt;br /&gt;Easy to dispense&lt;br /&gt;Works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not enough scrubbing beads, use a washcloth instead of your fingers&lt;br /&gt;It is an oil based product, it is easy to use too much</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be more of a cleansing scrub but it is kind of oily and leaves me feeling even more oily than before my shower.</li>
</ol>
