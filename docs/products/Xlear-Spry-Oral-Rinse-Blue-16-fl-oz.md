      <li>I really love this mouth rinse.</li>

      <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  </li>
      <li>I love this mouthwash.</li>
      <li>And, it&#x27;s easy -</li>
      <li>Overall Spry mouthwash tastse great, and hopefully is worthwhile...</li>
      <li>Even though my mouth is tender and this has alcohol, it&#x27;s not too strong, so</li>
      <li>Bottle goes runs out way too quick, but love the xylitol products for your teeth.  </li>
      <li>I got 6 bottles for $25.20 with free shipping, instead of paying the Amazon price of $4.79 plus th4 $4.99 for shipping for ONE bottle.</li>
      <li>Go to the Vitamin Shoppe website, and you can buy 6 bottles of this mouthwash to qualify for the free shipping.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Having said that, I had an excellent dental exam after using this product for the past 6 months.</li>
      <li>I thought it was too sweet</li>
      <li>The nasal sprays work super well too.</li>
      <li>Great product... just gotta get SPRY products to come down in price.  </li>
      <li>So glad that I found this and that it&#x27;s loaded with natural ingredients and also has xylitol.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use regular toothpaste and floss and see if truly xylitol is the magic bullet it claims to be.</li>
      <li>Xylitol, the sugar used in this mouthwash, is a great local antibiotic without having to use the harshness of alcohol like other mouthwashes.</li>
      <li>Xylitol is a natural sugar-alcohol (from birch trees), that is sweet tasting, but cannot be metabolized by bacteria for food (and humans cannot metabolize it either).</li>
      <li>You can google the benefits of xylitol and will see it is just &#x27;everywhere&#x27; a very beneficial addition to dental care.</li>
      <li>and it seems to do the job really well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommeded mouthwash!</li>
      <li>What is unique about Xylitol is that when bacteria ingest it, it does not provide any nourishment and the bacteria actually starve to death!</li>
      <li>Xylitol, its main ingredient is a sugar substitute that doesn&#x27;t  metabolize so bacteria literally starve.</li>
      <li>Recommended by my dentist who prefers more natural, less volume-manufactured stuff.</li>
      <li>And, this mouthwash does make my teeth feel a little stronger - so I&#x27;m pleased so far.</li>
      <li>(I think he&#x27;s trying to buy a new car)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve done some reading and learned that this particular alcohol sugar (Xylitol), when it combines with your saliva, creates an alkaline condition, and in an alkaline environment (rather than pH neutral like most other alcohol sugars), your teeth can actually \\&quot;regenerate\\&quot; or build up new enamel.  </li>
      <li>This is not any sort of clinical review, but I have had increasing sensitivity in my teeth most likely due to drinking and eating lots of citrus (according to my dentist).  </li>
      <li>Also, it tastes way better than any other mouth wash I&#x27;ve ever used, and doesn&#x27;t make foods taste as strange if you find yourself eating soon after using it.</li>
      <li>I am going to use this for the three months until he wants me back to see if this regimen worked.</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t dry out one&#x27;s mouth and is very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this rinse, and highly recommend it.</li>

<li> guess you&#x27;re supposed to try these products for a few weeks before you notice anything.</li>

    <li> This is not any sort of clinical review, but I have had increasing sensitivity in my teeth most likely due to drinking and eating lots of citrus (according to my dentist).  After using Spry for a few weeks, this condition had improved dramatically.  I&#x27;ve done some reading and learned that this particular alcohol sugar (Xylitol), when it combines with your saliva, creates an alkaline condition, and in an alkaline environment (rather than pH neutral like most other alcohol sugars), your teeth can actually \\&quot;regenerate\\&quot; or build up new enamel.  This sure fits with what I&#x27;m experiencing.    Also, it tastes way better than any other mouth wash I&#x27;ve ever used, and doesn&#x27;t make foods taste as strange if you find yourself eating soon after using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son its supposed to be really good, was recommended to us by the dental hygienist. I thought it was too sweet but he loved it. I&#x27;m not sure the price is right for this, you could try a Jason natural one for less.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and believe it is one of the best mouthwashes available and is a good complement to a comprehensive approach using xylitol products.  The advantages of using xylitol based products is well documented for oral health and to some extent regarding ear/throat related infections.  I also use xylitol based toothpaste without fluoride, xylitol mints (and gum at times) and xylitol in foods/cooking.  I recommend trying to find sources from non-GMO birch trees in the US or Northern Europe and avoid the China products made from corn.  I decided to buy birch sourced bulk xylitol (50 lb.) from a vendor in Seattle which will last us for at least a couple of years.  Mouthwash would be 5 stars if not for being pricey but will consider changing to 5 stars due to Spry&#x27;s intentions of going to birch sourced xylitol.</li>
    <li> I really love this mouth rinse. When I go to the dentist they cannot believe how great my teeth are!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased xylitol sweetner (for morning coffee) mints, gum and now this Spry mouth wash because I just came back from the dentist who said I have the beginnings of 6 small cavities! (I think he&#x27;s trying to buy a new car) After reading up on preventative care obviously xylitol came up...I am going to use this for the three months until he wants me back to see if this regimen worked. I will continue to use regular toothpaste and floss and see if truly xylitol is the magic bullet it claims to be. After my check up in 3mos time I will repost to share my experience. Overall Spry mouthwash tastse great, and hopefully is worthwhile...I&#x27;m optimistic after all that I have read online.</li>
    <li> Xylitol is a natural sugar-alcohol (from birch trees), that is sweet tasting, but cannot be metabolized by bacteria for food (and humans cannot metabolize it either). When bacteria feed on sugars in the mouth, they ingest them and produce acids, which dissolve the enamel and produce cavities. What is unique about Xylitol is that when bacteria ingest it, it does not provide any nourishment and the bacteria actually starve to death! Thus, it helps to lower the levels of disease-producing bacteria in the mouth.  The directions state to use the rinse in the AM and PM, rinsing for 30 seconds each time.  The rinse can alternatively be used between brushings to keep bacterial counts low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a xylitol toothpaste as well:  [[ASIN:B000P0560O Spry Toothpaste (Spearmint w/ Flouride) - 4 oz - Tube]].  Brush 3-4 times a day to keep those bacteria dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend the use of Xylitol Gum (2-3 pieces a day between brushings) to keep killing harmful bacteria Spry Cinnamon Xylitol Chewing Gum 100 Count, Trident Cinnamon Flavor Chewing Gum with Xylitol 18/ 5-stick Paks Sugarless Gum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the revolutionary products with Xylitol and your oral health will improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jim Koenig, DDS</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is excellent.  Having to pay $4.99 for shipping is a RIP OFF!!!  Go to the Vitamin Shoppe website, and you can buy 6 bottles of this mouthwash to qualify for the free shipping.  I got 6 bottles for $25.20 with free shipping, instead of paying the Amazon price of $4.79 plus th4 $4.99 for shipping for ONE bottle. The shipping costs more than the mouthwash!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I had an excellent dental exam after using this product for the past 6 months. Highly recommeded mouthwash!</li>
    <li> I use all Spry products since my dentist recommended it years ago. This is an excellent rinse, nothing comes close to it.</li>
    <li> Spry Oral Rinse contains xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Xylitol is a \\&quot;toothfriendly\\&quot; sugar substitute. In addition to not encouraging tooth decay (by replacing dietary sugars), xylitol may actively aid in repairing minor cavities caused by dental caries.\\&quot; quote fromWikipedia the online encyclopedia.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash. Even though my mouth is tender and this has alcohol, it&#x27;s not too strong, so it&#x27;s not a problem. It&#x27;s great seeing more and more products with Xylitol - food for the teeth! I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this rinse, and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this  has  xylitol, which is good for teeth!  so we figure we can&#x27;t miss when we use  it.  we  would have given it 5 stars except  for  the  fact  that we don&#x27;t use a lot  of mouthwash and question its usefulness</li>
    <li> I looked and looked for a good mouth rinse that did not have a zillion chemicals in it that I couldn&#x27;t even pronounce.  So glad that I found this and that it&#x27;s loaded with natural ingredients and also has xylitol.  I ordered 6 bottles to last me a &#x27;little&#x27; while.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.  My dentist has told me that all of his patients (including me) who use this don&#x27;t get cavities.</li>
    <li> An excellent product.  Spry has a very nice taste that leaves your mouth feeling  clean.  Xylitol, its main ingredient is a sugar substitute that doesn&#x27;t  metabolize so bacteria literally starve. When i told my dental hygenist that i was using this rinse she commented that it also reduces the temperature of one&#x27;s mouth by 3 degrees. Spry is alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t dry out one&#x27;s mouth and is very reasonably priced. Buy this!! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> A great mouthwash with a preferred sweetner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve known about Zylitol for a while but haven&#x27;t been using it religiously. On a recent visit to the dentist, they&#x27;re now recommending products like this one to help me re-mineralize my teeth. I don&#x27;t remember all the details but I&#x27;m sold. And, this mouthwash does make my teeth feel a little stronger - so I&#x27;m pleased so far. And, it&#x27;s easy - yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you&#x27;re supposed to try these products for a few weeks before you notice anything. I noticed a change immediately but it could be wishful thinking.</li>
    <li> Great product... just gotta get SPRY products to come down in price.  Bottle goes runs out way too quick, but love the xylitol products for your teeth.  The nasal sprays work super well too.</li>
    <li> This is the best way to fight tooth decay.  You can google the benefits of xylitol and will see it is just &#x27;everywhere&#x27; a very beneficial addition to dental care.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist who prefers more natural, less volume-manufactured stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for a well and it seems to do the job really well.</li>
    <li> Xylitol, the sugar used in this mouthwash, is a great local antibiotic without having to use the harshness of alcohol like other mouthwashes. And it tastes great.</li>
    <li> My family loved this product.  It was too minty.  My children use this product all the time.  I was told by my Dentist and my children&#x27;s dentist to use a product with Xylitol in it.  The sugars in Xylitol help with cavities.  Try it.</li>
