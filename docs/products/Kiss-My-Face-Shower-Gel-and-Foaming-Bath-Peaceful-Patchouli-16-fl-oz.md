<li> Put your nose to the bottle and it hits you hard, but on the skin it lingers in a more subtle and not too spicy way.</li>
<li> Actually, this version of patchouli is not as heavy or bitter as the essential oil everyone was dabbing themselves with back then.</li>
<li> , it is obvious that it is a watered down version.</li>
<li> * ☆ a little goes a long way</li>
<li> Even my boyfriend like it on me, and he was skeptical at first.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the scent is not strong enough.</li>
<li> but this product does lather nearly as well as grocery store bath gels that are much less expensive.</li>
<li> It has very little scent to it, which was disappointing because that was the main reason for buying.</li>
<li> I must admit our house has hard water</li>
<li> stars because the patchouli scent is waaaaaay to faint...</li>
<li> The scent seems artificial however it is not overpowering.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed</li>

    <li> Doesnt have a very patchouli scent to it. Probably wont order again.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like patchouli. I was very disappointed</li>
    <li> great smell. natural. cruelty free</li>
    <li> Works well as both a gel and bubble bath.  Does not dry my skin or irritate it.  All these things I have come to expect from \\&quot;Kiss My Face\\&quot;.  The scent seems artificial however it is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> My favorite shower product for years.&lt;br /&gt;I do not wear cologne or perfume.....just bathe with this and people are always saying &amp;#34; Gee, you smell good ! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Quick delivery. Would order again.</li>
    <li> It definitely did a good job to smooth the skin, the only thing is that not everyone can be accustomed to the smell which is very strong.  If you don&#x27;t care much about the fragrance, this is a good product.  You will see the change of your skin.  It really works.</li>
    <li> Wife really like this product.</li>
    <li> Ahh... I remember the \\&quot;hippie&#x27; scent quite well having grown up in the sixties and seventies. Actually, this version of patchouli is not as heavy or bitter as the essential oil everyone was dabbing themselves with back then. Put your nose to the bottle and it hits you hard, but on the skin it lingers in a more subtle and not too spicy way. Even my boyfriend like it on me, and he was skeptical at first. I will take a chance with the body moisturizer and hope I don&#x27;t ruin a good thing!</li>
    <li> nice texture....NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS☆ * ☆ * ☆ a little goes a long way...bubbly lather...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3  stars because the patchouli scent is waaaaaay to faint...for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a really REALLY long time ago, it was much stronger</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorites.  I arrived in a white bottle and the wonderful patchouli scent seemed much weaker that previous purchases.</li>
    <li> Did not have a strong enough scent.</li>
    <li> They have changed the recipe damn it!</li>
    <li> A family favorite! Lovely warm scent and loads of foaming bubbles, and not drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> The newer kind only gets 4 stars.

    <li> Other reviews of this product seemed positive so I decided to try it. I was underwhelmed. It has very little scent to it, which was disappointing because that was the main reason for buying.

    <li> Love the long lasting lovely scent of patchouli on my skin! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff a lot. My only complaint is that the scent is not strong enough. I may try adding some patchouli to the bottle. Appears to be a very simple glycerine soap with a scent in it. Doesn&#x27;t really have any moisturizing properties.</li>
    <li> A good product. The patchouli scent is great without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> The fragrances is very light.  I would of liked something stronger.</li>
