    <li> LOVE this product. Absorbs quickly, and yet is very moisturizing. Smell is pleasant and not over-powering. Wake up in the morning with soft skin. Love the whole line, just wish it was less expensive!</li>
    <li> Smooth, moisturizing Creme .  Will recommend it for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;Give the skin a clean soft feel.  Priced just right without paying too much.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream!  It smells wonderful and my face looks smoother and fresher.  I have tried many creams and this is definitely worth the price. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I guess i need more time to see results but up to now it&#x27;s ok. My skin is soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. Its not oily like many others and spreads evenly and smells fresh. Good buy for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> this is gramma&#x60;s favorite cream.  I bought it for her.</li>
    <li> I love Shiseido is a true miracle.  Once u begin using it u have great results.  I definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> One of the better night creams I&#x27;ve used.  It has a nice scent and did not break me out.  While it&#x27;s a more expensive item, it lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> This product really enhanced my kin, and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great product but it&#x27;s not that much cheaper here.  Department store sells it for $56 of same size.  Here is said consumer would save about $44 which is not true.  Wonderful product nevertheless but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it here.</li>
    <li> I tried to go without using Shiseido night cream...big mistake! Why go without? Living in Northern Maine impossible to find Shiseido products so foolishly I thought I will go with a lesser brand.  Then I went on Amazon and found Shiseido products...I will never go without again.  Shiseido makes my face look and feel amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so great. Highly satisfied!</li>
    <li> A+ Transaction, very nice product!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> quick delivery. love this product</li>
    <li> Although this line of products is spendy, it&#x27;s well worth every cent because of the quality.  And  they last for quite a while because you use just a tiny amount with each application.  Another huge plus, is that my sensitive skin has never  shown any signs of irritation or inflammation.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, live in midwest winter, still woke up with dry flakes on my skin, way too much fragrance, I would not purchase again,</li>
    <li> For a middle-aged woman of Asian origin, Shiseido works well for my skin.  I have been using it for over a decade, but it is not available in regular drug stores, so I always had to drive to a mall to buy it.  Found this on-line vendor, and the mailed-in cream looks and feels authentic.  saves me a trip to the mall.</li>
    <li> it seems contaminated with dark particles.</li>
    <li> Amazing, hydrating, just perfect</li>
    <li> The cream is runny and not as good at providing hydration as Bio Performance. If you go for Shiseido, get Bio Performance.</li>
    <li> great buy. perfect for my skin.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product.  I applied it only once, and my skin was dried out the next morning.  It took one week of using heavy moisture creams to make my skin recover.</li>
    <li> It works!! It moisturized my skin. Moreover, My face is also brightened and pink. I heard a lot of good reviews of Shiseido but this is the first time I try it and realized just now.</li>
    <li> Yes I like it. j.Nichol</li>
    <li> Love this product. It makes my face feel like it&#x27;s moisturized all night long, yet light-weight enough so I don&#x27;t feel like my face has gunk on it. I love the scent as well and overall is a great product that has made me fall in love with Shiseido products.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Good price and it arrived fast</li>
