      <li>Beautiful colors!</li>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>Excellent buy.</li>
      <li>Great quality and price.  </li>
      <li>good to keep your hijab in place</li>
      <li>These have the best grip I&#x27;ve ever seen and holds all of my hair exactly where I want!  </li>
      <li>I love the variety of colors, and they hold all day!</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>Cute to have around to play with your hair!</li>
      <li>Love these bobby pins!</li>
      <li>Love the bright colors.  </li>
      <li>The colors are nice and the bobby pins keep their shape...</li>
      <li>The colors are great and exactly as on my screen.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stay that well in slippery, silky hair, but are cute for the time they are in.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>THE most sturdy hair pins I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I love the colors but they could have been longer and have a rubber tip so as&lt;br /&gt;not to hurt the scalp.  </li>
      <li>many complients.</li>
      <li>These pins are so cute.</li>
      <li>Wanted something like a bobby pin &amp; these are more like a Barrett.</li>
      <li>Better than other bobby pins if you want a great grip!</li>
      <li>arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>Heck, if the paint falls off I may even spray paint them myself because they are THAT strong.</li>
      <li>Really cute and useful.</li>
      <li>Not to mention they were delivered quickly</li>
      <li>They hold tight and are great for that in between length.</li>
      <li>had I seen it in person first.</li>
      <li>They are exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>I love the slight curve of their shape and the colors are bold.</li>
      <li>but these are VERY curved too.</li>
      <li>Normal bobby pins always seem to fall out.  </li>
      <li>The colors and coating is nice, but they are VERY hard to open to put in or get out of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re curved to fit your skull rather than flat, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and they&#x27;ve none of the ridges typical bobby pins have.</li>

<li> I did not receive the red or pale pink bobby pins in the picture and overall the actual colors are a little more dull in person.</li>
<li> Just thought that seemed a little unnecessary for bobby pins that could have fit in my mailbox.</li>
<li> These are bigger than I thought they would be &amp; are very stiff.  </li>
<li> They are quite small and hard for adult hands to manage.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep using them till they snap in half.</li>
<li> These hold my hair tight, and I don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting throughout the day.  </li>
<li> NOT WHAT I THOUGHT VERY HARD TO OPEN.</li>
<li> Full-sized hair slides like these are hard to find.</li>
<li> I have really thick hair that defies bobby pins, barrettes, etc.  </li>
<li> even in my thick hair.</li>
<li> Also, they are very difficult to open and remove.</li>
<li> They stay in hair well but typically difficult to remove and pull out a few hairs attempting.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair!</li>
<li> Also, kinda random, but when shipped a signature was required</li>
<li> They would be doubly difficult for childrens hands.  </li>

    <li> The colors and coating is nice, but they are VERY hard to open to put in or get out of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I have a flat head but these are VERY curved too. Not that comfy.</li>
    <li> These are terrific. I bought them for myself I can use on my granddaughter without pulling tangling. Beautiful colors! I would purchase from seller again . arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great quality and price.  The colors are nice and the bobby pins keep their shape... even in my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the red or pale pink bobby pins in the picture and overall the actual colors are a little more dull in person. Also, they are very difficult to open and remove. They stay in hair well but typically difficult to remove and pull out a few hairs attempting. Also, kinda random, but when shipped a signature was required so I wasn&#x27;t home and had to pick them up at our local post office. Just thought that seemed a little unnecessary for bobby pins that could have fit in my mailbox. I would not have purchased this item had I seen it in person first.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I THOUGHT VERY HARD TO OPEN.</li>

    <li> My daughter loves these!</li>
    <li> I love the colors but they could have been longer and have a rubber tip so as&lt;br /&gt;not to hurt the scalp.  I use them when I wrap my hair at night and at the nape of the neck.</li>
    <li> Really cute and useful. Better than other bobby pins if you want a great grip!</li>
    <li> These were to short for me.  I will use them but wish they were longer.</li>
    <li> each clip is larger than anticipated.</li>
    <li> THE most sturdy hair pins I have ever used. Not to mention they were delivered quickly and I have been using them for some time now. I&#x27;ll keep using them till they snap in half. I love them. Heck, if the paint falls off I may even spray paint them myself because they are THAT strong. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Love these bobby pins! I have very thick hair! Normal bobby pins always seem to fall out.  These hold my hair tight, and I don&#x27;t have to keep adjusting throughout the day.  The colors are great and exactly as on my screen.  I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> the clips work well and are simple. I would definitley reccomend buying this.  They look the same as on the package.</li>
    <li> Perfect! They hold tight and are great for that in between length.</li>
    <li> Love the bright colors.  Wish they were wider.  Hold hair in place, though.</li>
    <li> good to keep your hijab in place</li>

    <li> They&#x27;re curved to fit your skull rather than flat, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and they&#x27;ve none of the ridges typical bobby pins have. Works well though and I like the colors!</li>
    <li> These pins are so cute. many complients.</li>
    <li> They are quite small and hard for adult hands to manage.  They would be doubly difficult for childrens hands.  They don&#x27;t stay that well in slippery, silky hair, but are cute for the time they are in.</li>
