    <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t stopped buying these things and she seems happy doing her own nails and her sisters</li>
    <li> Well it did come a few days early.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it and think you&#x27;re going to have 5000 rhinestones!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed because I didn&#x27;t receive what&#x27;s in the description!&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing anything else from cheeky beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&amp; I only gave 2 stars because they came early &amp;&amp; they&#x27;re cute!&lt;br /&gt;Guess you get what you paid for!&lt;br /&gt;FALSE ADVERTISING!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price. Thought there would be more stones in the boxes but still good amount. Only problem is the lids are extremely hard to open.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! Tons of gems! This will keep me busy for years! Took a while for delivery but arrived safe.</li>
    <li> Just like picture. N the pencil works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this to do my clients nails they love them... came early than expected date. now the other staff members want to order one for them...</li>
    <li> Not what I expected&lt;br /&gt;Gems were mixed together,or came out of individual dividers and were loose in the pastic packaging. Gems were way smaller than I anticipated</li>
    <li> Horrible! Just horrible&lt;br /&gt; I ordered this because it said 2000 rhinestones. There may be 100 in the colors and 2 or 3 hundred in the clear and black.  In the colored stones there&#x27;s pieces of colored plastic. Are they counting that as a stone? Just very disappointed for waiting a month n a half for this!</li>
    <li> I love these rhinestones but the container is so difficult to open. My nails are weak so I have to have a friend open it if I want to use them without breaking my nails. I&#x27;m going to be getting someone different to keep them in.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent seller</li>
    <li> The lids were so hard to open.</li>
