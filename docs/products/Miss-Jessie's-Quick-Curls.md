      <li>say I love your hair.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many products and this is no miracle cream</li>
      <li>Eh, its ok.</li>
      <li>love this stuff....</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure if it was from the product or from dying my hair.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Just to be sure, I asked my roommate which side of my hair looked better and she said they looked</li>
      <li>Get a long-sleeved t-shirt to wrap your curls up on top of your head.  </li>
      <li>You would think they could make more money selling volumes at a lower price.</li>
      <li>it cause now i wont use anything else since this is my favorite product.</li>
      <li>The lemony scent is okay...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m caucasian and love using this cream on my hair on days that I want to go curly or wavy.</li>
      <li>As a curly haired girl, I have been through a lot of different curl creme&#x27;s trying to find the best one for my hair.</li>
      <li>but when i went to get more they were sold out.  </li>
      <li>and I like this combination better.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even say that the price is a con as this product did exactly what it said and then some!!!  </li>
      <li>I have fine wavy hair and have tried many curling products.  </li>
      <li>I just wish the product was more accessible and cheaper.  </li>
      <li>Good product however, I recommend getting a sample first before investing $22 In the full size version.  </li>
      <li>It does have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>And even if you like the scent, this stuff smells too strongly, you will get chased out of work and the grocery store for fumigating the place.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it with Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Smoothie under it, but I may try the Pillow Talk creme soon with it (mainly because the smell of it is fantastic-like clean laundry).&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used quick curl for 2/4 times and i love it.</li>
      <li>My afro is authentic and neatly manicured using Miss Jessie quick curl creme.</li>
      <li>Yay Quick Curls!</li>
      <li>And it dries very soft... not crunchy... and it smells good.  </li>
      <li>size lasts 2-3 months, which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>Then, and extremely important: GOOGLE: \\&quot;PLOPPING.\\&quot;  Or also referred to as \\&quot;plunking.\\</li>
      <li>I love the smell of ginger, it&#x27;s so fresh.</li>
      <li>Nothing is ever 100% frizz free for me, but this came close.</li>
      <li>this product does exactly what is says it does, it&#x27;s great for soft curls</li>
      <li>I got this product originally as a sample in my Birchbox about 2 years ago.</li>
      <li>which was perfect because I didn&#x27;t walk into work looking &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; and not like a drowned rat like I usually do, haha.</li>
      <li>I get frequent compliments on my curls - many more with this product than any others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have heard wonderful things about Miss Jessie&#x27;s products and was SO excited to try this cream, especially because the label specifically says it works for wavy textures like mine ... but honestly, after using this product for a week I&#x27;m ready to go back to my $5 Herbal Essences mousse.</li>
      <li>A really good gel, dries fast and almost completely frizz free</li>
      <li>not a bad product, but</li>
      <li>sample sizes available if you don&#x27;t want to commit right away.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE my favorite styling product for my thick super wavy hair.</li>
      <li>(I know it sounds counter active, but it works for me, lol).</li>
      <li>sculpting gel is a lot cheaper than MJ&#x27;s Quick Curls.</li>
      <li>Great for getting ready for work or needing my hair to be done if I&#x27;m going out at the last minute.</li>
      <li>With that said I will buy the quick curls again.</li>
      <li>I use about a quarter-sized dab of Quick Curls distributed evenly to the ends.  </li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t like the smell of Quick Curls.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worked for me regarding Quick Curls.</li>
      <li>It gave me an instant headache and smells sort of like laundry detergent and lemons and is very overwhelming.</li>
      <li>not very cheap, but great to use.</li>
      <li>I would recommend Jessicurl products, which have a much more natural and soothing scent while performing better on curls than this stuff, or you could try Giovanni Direct leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>the price, it’s definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>I was able to test this product on wavy hair, relaxed hair, and natural hair all at once.  </li>
      <li>but worth</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product, as I had heard great things about it, but it was not a good match for my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product and have curly hair your missing out.  It really makes my curls not frizzy and my hair is soft!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product, as I had heard great things about it, but it was not a good match for my hair.  I have long, loose curly hair.  While I didn&#x27;t get the hard, scrunchy feel, this product made my hair greasy and weighed it down.</li>
    <li> Would recommend for women that have tight curls, it helps release curls! The hair looks shining and soft,it doesn&#x27;t leave hair dry.</li>
    <li> Best product for curls</li>
    <li> I love the jelly soft curls &amp; pillow soft curls by miss jessie but this one was too heavy for my curls... still love other style products in this line though.</li>
    <li> The product label says it is for relaxed hair also. What exactly will it do on relaxed hair? My hair is relaxed and in short cut and it did not curl with the product. Has anyone who has relaxed hair tried it ?</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have short naturally curly, soft textured hair that tends to be unruly and difficult to manage, especially when it&#x27;s humid. My hair is also chemically color treated. I firmly believe that everyone has a different experience with their curls, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find the right combination of products. For my hair I found that I still have to use a small amount of leave-in conditioner after I wash it.  While it&#x27;s still very damp I use about a quarter-sized dab of Quick Curls distributed evenly to the ends.  I scrunch and shape it, and sometimes I have to add a little more water.  I follow up with a very small amount of Miss Jessie&#x27;s Jelly Soft Curls for a little extra frizz control on the ends, and other places that tend to be problem areas. I always air dry because blow drying has never worked for me, even with a diffuser. Some reviews have complained about the smell of Quick Curls, and it does smell a little strong when you first put it on, but it goes away after 20-30 minutes. It contains a lot of natural plant extracts instead of chemicals, so it smells more like aromatherapy, or essentials oils, which I actually like.</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick hair and this product works great. My afro is authentic and neatly manicured using Miss Jessie quick curl creme.</li>
    <li> I have heard wonderful things about Miss Jessie&#x27;s products and was SO excited to try this cream, especially because the label specifically says it works for wavy textures like mine ... but honestly, after using this product for a week I&#x27;m ready to go back to my $5 Herbal Essences mousse. First, this product does nothing to define my waves/curls. It leaves them limp, crunchy, and frizzy, to the point where I was struggling to pin back my (chin-length) hair just to look presentable. And second, this stuff REEEEEKS. Think cheap public bathroom air freshener with a dash of PineSol. Even my partner commented on how gross my hair smelled after using this. Ladies, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I would give this less than 1 star if possible.  My hair is naturally curly, and I usually have no problems with frizz or softness when using inexpensive drugstore type products on it.  I gave this a shot thinking it must be great if they are so confident as to charge an arm and a leg for it.  It was the worst product I have EVER used on my hair.  It made my hair frizzy and it felt dry and coarse.  I didn&#x27;t change any other part of my hair care routine, so I know it was this product.  It gave it 2 chances, and both days my hair ended up in a ponytail.  I was very disappointed.  I would warn people to save their money, it doesn&#x27;t even smell that great.</li>
    <li> A really good gel, dries fast and almost completely frizz free</li>
    <li> I’ve been using Miss Jessie’s Quick Curls for about a year now, and haven’t found a better product to define my type 3A, medium-length, thick curls. It’s a light cream that doesn’t weigh my hair down or get sticky in humidity. I originally tried this product after my previous go-to changed their formula. I&#x27;ve tried other products since, but I keep returning for the tried-and-true results Quick Curls gives me. My curls are defined and definitely less frizzy. I get frequent compliments on my curls - many more with this product than any others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve had to find a styling routine through trial-and-error for best results - now that routine consists of Miss Jessie’s Quick Curls, a moroccan oil and leave-in spray conditioner, then a diffused blow dry of my wet (nearly dripping) hair over a low-air, high-heat. It&#x27;s a process, but it works every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using it alone and do not get the exact same results, but that is typical of my hair type. Also, I’ve found that if I let it air dry with Quick Curls alone, the curls are defined and mostly frizz-free, but with less body. Regardless of diffusing dry or air-dry, it does hold up in humidity and even after an afternoon nap with a quick scrunch and fluff afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it’s definitely worth it. I’ve spent much more on salon products that don’t live up to their hype, and the 8oz. size lasts 2-3 months, which is a huge plus. I highly recommend trying it. There are 2oz. sample sizes available if you don&#x27;t want to commit right away.</li>
    <li> After lots of research on curly hair care I decided to order this product.  It really is great on my curls!!!  It keeps them soft, bouncy and curly for days.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts b/c it leaves my hands greasy and kind of sticky after I touch it.  My hair doesn&#x27;t tangle like it did with foams or gels and it smells great to me!</li>
    <li> I have 3C hair. My curls came out nice when I used this..... but I got exactly the same results when I used my Garnier Fructis Curl Sculpting Gel, and GF Curl sculpting gel is a lot cheaper than MJ&#x27;s Quick Curls. I parted my damp hair in sections and applied GF to one section and MJ to another and I couldn&#x27;t see any difference. Just to be sure, I asked my roommate which side of my hair looked better and she said they looked the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t like the smell of Quick Curls. It smelled like vitamins. There is nothing wrong with vitamins, I just don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a pharmacy all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not a bad product, but I can get the same results for my hair type by using a product that is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> The ingredients in the 2.0 ounce one are different. Literally. I checked. And the 2.0 ounce one works better. :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m caucasian and love using this cream on my hair on days that I want to go curly or wavy. I used to describe my hair as naturally curly, but now its more like naturally wavy. If I let it dry on its own, I don&#x27;t get ringlet curls -- just a lot of volume and frizzy hair. I usually wear my hair straight because its easy to dry mostly straight with a big round brush and blowdryer. However, in the summer especially, its nice to have to the option to do something different without too much frizz from all the humidity (I live in the south). I found that this cream is very lightweight, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, but it does an amazing job of controlling frizz. I even use it sometimes when I blow-dry it straight just for frizz control. If I use this for curly days, I apply the cream allover my hair. Then I separate my hair into smaller sections and re-apply to each section, twist each section away from my face, and then let it dry. When the section are mostly dry, I shake them out for soft and gentle ringlets. This is the only product I have found that works for me. Also, it smells really good. I recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair curly &amp; soft.</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy hair and have tried many curling products.  Some dont work at all and some work but leave hair too crunchy.  This product works well-  gives my hair curl and hold, without the crunch, and smells great.  I bought it in target but when i went to get more they were sold out.  Only downfall is its expensive... but worth it cause now i wont use anything else since this is my favorite product.</li>
    <li> I was able to test this product on wavy hair, relaxed hair, and natural hair all at once.  I wear a virgin Indian wavy weave that was not waving to my liking and wanted a product to enhance the wave without leaving my hair hard and without body.  My leave out is natural with about 2 inches of relaxed hair left on the ends.  I washed my hair and conditioned as usual, separated into two sections and applied a volumizing liquid leave-in diluted with water (sprayed on to towel dried hair) on to one section and ran a quarter size amount of Quick Curls product through the hair, making sure to sink my hands into the \\&quot;roots\\&quot; (base of weave).  I finger combed the product through thoroughly and scrunched from bottom up into the roots and repeated the same steps on the other side.  I could immediately see the waves forming into curls, especially at the ends of the hair!!!  I used my diffuser to dry the hair and my roots and ran my hands through with a little shine serum to break up the curls /waves and add the volume I like.  My leave out was soft and the curl pattern of my natural hair was elongated to a nice wavy texture.... (4a hair) and the relaxed ends which I had only given a little twist with my finger had retained that little twist at the end.  My hair was bouncy, soft, and had curls so luscious that I wanted to just bite into them!!!!  My hair was great all day and I even slept without my bonnet and woke up to soft sexy wavy bed head, even on my leave out!!!!  I am on 3rd day hair with this product and have only reapplied my water/leave-in conditioner mix to the ends and allowed to air dry.  The rest of the hair is still bouncy, wavy and beautiful.  I highly recommend this product.  I can&#x27;t even say that the price is a con as this product did exactly what it said and then some!!!  It will be a staple in my great hair arsenal!!!  Can&#x27;t wait to try to Pillow Soft curls next!!</li>
    <li> Lovely product.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Definitely designed for African American hair. Does not promote curls, leaves hair somewhat tacky and has a eucalyptus smell. Does not leave hair soft like advertised.</li>
    <li> Received this in my birchbox a few months back and absolutely love it!  Leaves my hair soft but with great curl!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!! After straightening (aka frying) my hair for years, I&#x27;ve recently decided to go back to my naturally curly roots (pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this product once so far, but could not be happier. I used about a dime sized amount in 5 seperate sections of my damp shoulder-length hair, let it air dry with barely any scrunching, and....OMG my hair has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;It felt a little sticky as my hair dried, but it was so soft and silky all day.&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I wake up and my hair looks crazy and frizzy, but this morning, my hair looks just as good as it did yesterday.  It feels soft and healthy, and I can actually run my fingers through it. Love, love, love it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it with Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Smoothie under it, but I may try the Pillow Talk creme soon with it (mainly because the smell of it is fantastic-like clean laundry).&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> not very cheap, but great to use. your hair is still soft after using and your curls very happy! Will buy it again</li>
    <li> First impression: Good product however, I recommend getting a sample first before investing $22 In the full size version.  It definitely worked as advertised, but it made my hair dry and I had to put extra moisture where normally I would not have to. The dryness is the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars. The 4 stars is still a good rating though.  I will finish the tube but I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase. I have some of the other miss jessies products, the quick curls is the first I&#x27;m using.  I will experiment with other leave ins. I will admit to not experiencing hard hair or breakage. It also smells good, kind of lime or a combination of lemon/lime. Third use: I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 days in a row this products does tame frizz (I have used it for 3 days in a row and the curls overall look more and more tame),  it does dry quickly as advertised (mine was completely dry overnight, which is not normally the case) and there is a medium hold (although some may think its crunchy/makes hair hard or have a stronger hold).  I still stand by my comment of getting a sample first, and needing a lot of extra moisture after application. This is my second week putting this product in my hair. There is a big difference between the leave in conditioners you combine with this. The first time I used this I used Paul Mitchell the conditioner with this product. The results were ok, I actually got compliments, but the Paul Mitchell was not a good combination with the quick curls, my hair looked dull and dry but the there was a lot of curl definition. This second time I used dark and lovely au naturale slick n slip leave in and I like this combination better. My hair was soft and moist. There was still curl definition but it just overall felt different. With that said I will buy the quick curls again.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair, and normally it just has one small wave in parts of the hair, this product makes my hair very wavy, almost curly.  And it dries very soft... not crunchy... and it smells good.  This is THE best curling product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used quick curl for 2/4 times and i love it. My hair is thick and wavy but i wanted it to be curly and miss jessie&#x27;s quick curls did perfect. I love it and would definitely recommend it. Tried several other products and this is the only product that worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products and this is no miracle cream and I probably am not purchasing this again, especially for $40... I am half Mexican/half white and I have super thick curly hair. I tried this product a number of ways and it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.. I had my hopes very high for this because it cost so much! But when it comes down to it, I can get the same results with Suave Mouse..</li>
    <li> My hair is a 3c.  I have tried several of MJ products but this and the Butter Creme are my favorites.  My curls come out perfectly well defined everytime.  Wet it, apply quick curls, scrunch and go.  I alternate using no flake, alcohol free gel because it&#x27;s cheap and works well making my hair look fuller.  On days I don&#x27;t want to wet my hair I use Butter Creme.  It softens the curl into  wave pattern.  My hair is so gorgeous  I catch people staring and occasionally they&#x27;ii say I love your hair.  I just wish the product was more accessible and cheaper.  You would think they could make more money selling volumes at a lower price.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product !  Leaves hair soft, detangled but very very curly.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes to tame my wildly curly hair but I can barely even stand the smell of the product. It gave me an instant headache and smells sort of like laundry detergent and lemons and is very overwhelming. Besides the smell, the product works okay to keep frizz down I guess. It feels very thick in my hair and dirty. I had to wash it out after a few hours because I just could not stand the smell and my hair felt waxy almost.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible. I opened it and didn&#x27;t even put it on my head.</li>
    <li> Eh, its ok. Not much frizz control and too heavy for my wavy/loose curly hair. Also the smell is incredibly strong and not very pleasant.</li>
    <li> Not for every hair type. Definitely not for kinky hair. If you&#x27;re African American with mixed hair fine outside of that, no.</li>
    <li> The best for curls!  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in my Birchbox and discovered that it is the only product that really works on my thin, permed hair.  It make the curls look gorgeous.  It&#x27;s expensive - that&#x27;s the only complaint I have about it.  They finally sell this at select Target locations, which cuts out the shipping.</li>
    <li> love this stuff....i have seriously dry frizzy hair, and this makes my curls look shiny and smooth! A little expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Four stars because it stinks. Not exactly peppermint, more like peppermint medicine. Yuck.  But the smell dissipates quickly and you only need a very small amount, like less than a dime size for a thick head of shoulder length hair. Don&#x27;t overdo it, but find what works for you. And EMULSIFY!  It has a nice consistency and I like the crème, but EMULSIFY before you apply. Crème applied directly will weigh curls down.  Then, and extremely important: GOOGLE: \\&quot;PLOPPING.\\&quot;  Or also referred to as \\&quot;plunking.\\&quot; Two stupid names for an amazing technique to get your hair styled from wet. You&#x27;ll have the happiest, bouncy curls.  Watch YouTube to see how.  Get a long-sleeved t-shirt to wrap your curls up on top of your head.  It&#x27;s revolutionary.  You&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> Its ok, it was less product in tube than I thought&amp;#34; Thanks any way</li>
    <li> The best product ever...... I love it.... Other products make my hair dry and frizzy not this one...highly recommended. I love the smell of ginger, it&#x27;s so fresh.</li>
    <li> I am an Af-Am woman with curly hair--but not the traditional super-tight curls. (I&#x27;d say I have type 3C curly hair. Like tight corkscrews.) I searched for a long time for the right product to define my curls while keeping my hair soft. This gets the job done! Not only do I have zero complaints, but I recommend the product every time someone asks me about my hair, which is often thanks in part to Miss Jessie. It&#x27;s much more expensive than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. There is no substitute that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have to use every day and there is no smell or build up. Next day spray water and done. Love this product and will recommend it happy.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair, with at least two inches of new growth (I&#x27;m not transitioning, just haven&#x27;t gotten around to relaxing it yet, lol). I&#x27;ve always used a mixture of leave-in conditioner and gel, occasionally a hair oil for shine, and I scrunch my hair until I get the desired effect. However, I have to wait hours for it to dry, and I&#x27;m talking like 4 hours (sometimes MORE). This morning as I got ready for work, I decided to give Quick Curls a shot, but put some Simplicity Hair Oil through my wet hair first. Despite it being a creme, I thought it would be more like a leave-in conditioner, because my hair didn&#x27;t feel as malleable as it usually does when I put an L-IC in, but I went with it, and scrunched. I think my texture (party curly, partly wavy) came out a lot better with Quick Curls, and my hair was basically dry IN AN HOUR (!!!) which was perfect because I didn&#x27;t walk into work looking &amp;#34;finished&amp;#34; and not like a drowned rat like I usually do, haha. I think the Simplicity Hair Oil helped with the shine, and I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m frizz free, but the frizz is definitely a lot less. I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying that it made their hair hard and crunchy; well it made my hair hard and crunchy too as it dried, but I&#x27;ve learned from my conditioner/gel days that when it&#x27;s dry, softly scrunch the hair and it should break up the gel and soften it up. It&#x27;s worked for me regarding Quick Curls. I mean, this is only my first day using it, so I&#x27;m sure the more I use it, the better I&#x27;ll get with it. I also think once I relax my new growth, I can manage my hair a little better and it&#x27;ll look better too (I know it sounds counter active, but it works for me, lol). Great for getting ready for work or needing my hair to be done if I&#x27;m going out at the last minute. Yay Quick Curls!</li>
    <li> very good stuff love it</li>
    <li> I love this curl creme because it smells amazing, gives me curls instead of frizz, and it is a good size to throw into my swim bag.</li>
    <li> Does not control all my frizz but helps and then I don&#x27;t have to use as much of Curls Rock which does control frizz but leaves hair stiff. Hair is controlled with combination and not stiff and sticky.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE my favorite styling product for my thick super wavy hair. keeps the frizz down and gives my waves more definition. Cant live without this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff works sortof semi-OK, I guess, for keeping the frizz down, but it made my curls limp and flat rather than bouncy.  The worst thing, though, was the smell.  It REEKS!  It smells like old-school bathroom air freshener from the 70s--fake chemicals trying to smell \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; but really just overpowering.  And even if you like the scent, this stuff smells too strongly, you will get chased out of work and the grocery store for fumigating the place.  I would recommend Jessicurl products, which have a much more natural and soothing scent while performing better on curls than this stuff, or you could try Giovanni Direct leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. I have wavy curly hair or loose curly hair. Leaves my hair crunchy and feeling tangled. I like the pillow soft curls better if you don&#x27;t need such a tight hold.</li>
    <li> I got this product originally as a sample in my Birchbox about 2 years ago. It&#x27;s one of the few things I continue to use. I love it. It gives my hair curl &amp; body. It&#x27;s leaves my hair soft....unless you use too much. A little is all you need. The tube lasts a long time. 5 stars for sure.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Thank u!</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and has some natural curl. I found that this product enhanced the curl so that I didn&#x27;t have to blow dry it and then curl it. I could let it dry naturally and the curls were enhanced...kind of Meg Ryan look with more curl to it. You apply to damp hair and I hand crimped my hair several times during the natural drying period which set the curls.</li>
    <li> As a curly haired girl, I have been through a lot of different curl creme&#x27;s trying to find the best one for my hair. I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore. Miss Jessie&#x27;s is absolutely the best. Even if I leave my hair in the towel for too long and it looses moisture, Miss Jessie&#x27;s totally tames the frizz and brings out the curl. I have recommended it to all my friends, and even people looking at curl creme in the store!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this product and the help it gave my curls. However, I found after using this product for a while that I had OUT OF CONTROL split ends. I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure if it was from the product or from dying my hair. I&#x27;ve since stopped using the product and had a trim. 6 months later and still no split ends. I&#x27;m still feeling leery about this stuff.</li>
    <li> Finally ,  a product that keeps my curls from going to frizz at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;Just do not use too much.  More is not better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years already, because it works really nice on my hair. However, I&#x27;m not happy with the last one I bought! The texture is different and it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair much.  It feels like a different product! I stopped using this one, bc I&#x27;m afraid it may be expired, but it&#x27;s difficult to know bc it doesn&#x27;t show any date on!! Hope I could get a better product next time I order this!!</li>
    <li> I like it for my wavy thick hair. It does have a strong smell. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smells so i couldn&#x27;t wear this daily. Smells just like irish spring soap</li>
    <li> this product does exactly what is says it does, it&#x27;s great for soft curls</li>
    <li> Worked well but extremely drying.  Had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I use these for my 5yr old daughters crazy curls. it really is amazing. I bought this a couple of months ago and still have most of it left.</li>
    <li> brings my girls right back to life!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mixed and wear my hair natural in 2 strand twist out</li>
    <li> Very good but too expensive!</li>
    <li> This really is &amp;#34;the best darn curl cream ever!&amp;#34;  I love this product.  It dries faster than my other curl creams and is light.  It does not leave a residue on my hair.  I tried this product on one side of my hair and another on the other side and found that this side was softer with nice curls and body.  I have 3b/3c curls.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have very long, dry, coarse and curly hair. It is not all kinky, sometimes it&#x27;s more wavy, but with the right product and my diffuser I can get crazy curly hair that everyone loves. If I let it dry natural it&#x27;s a more loose curl. Anyway, this product is amazing. Nothing is ever 100% frizz free for me, but this came close. The lemony scent is okay... I don&#x27;t care for that. It can feel way too goopy if you coat your hair with too much, but with some experimentation you&#x27;ll learn what works best for your hair. I use this with my diffuser and my hair comes out looking totally awesome. I finish it off with some bedhead after party or it&#x27;s a 10 for those random frizzy parts and it looks great. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, either, which is a definite plus. I would highly recommend. Seems like it&#x27;ll last awhile as well (I got the 8oz).</li>
    <li> Great service... Excellent product.</li>
