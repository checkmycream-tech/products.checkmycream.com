<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought a brush was just a brush but this one works better than any brush I&#x27;ve bought from the drugstore. It glides through my hair and detangles. It doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair like other brushes do. I have long black, thin straight, Asian hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our toddler would flat out refuse to let us brush her long curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we have gotten this, she doesn&#x27;t even realize when we are brushing her hair.  Even if it&#x27;s tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you wet brush!!</li>
    <li> Great brush. My daughter calls it her magic brush. It is pink though so you might want to be careful ordering it on Amazon without a color selection possibility.</li>
    <li> I wish my hairdresser would buy this because every time I get my hair cut or colored there it is torture!  This worked even better than I expected.  I have frizzy, easily tangled hair, and before I bought this brush I was using a detangling comb on my hair after washing it.  The comb would pull my hair and there was always lots of hair in the comb.  This brush glides through easily without pulling and so far I haven&#x27;t seen hair in the brush, which means it isn&#x27;t breaking my hair like the comb did.   Update 4/11/15: This also works well for me on dry hair, especially if my hair is frizzy or tangled.  I have had this brush for 6 months now and I still love it and use it every day.</li>
    <li> this works great as long as your hair is really wet.  I ended up getting 2 because my husband took my first one for himself.</li>
    <li> This brush smells like petroleum/plastic.  It smells stronger than others that I have purchased.  My first wet brush (I still use it!) has a harder finish.  The newer versions smell, including &amp;#34;knock offs&amp;#34; or other brands.  I don&#x27;t think it is a problem specific to this vendor.  I looked on Wet Brush&#x27;s FaceBook page, and they did have some people complaining about the smell. Their response (paraphrasing here) was that because the rubber is so new, it can be difficult to know which ones may still have a stronger smell.  They suggested putting it outside in the sun for several hours to alleviate the smell.  I have tried this, but its turned cold here, and I have trees overhead in my back yard.  Next up I may try putting it under a heat lamp for a bit, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave three stars because I do not think the odor is a problem from this vendor, but rather the Wet Brush itself, as there have been repeated problems, even when buying directly from department stores, etc.  I will continue to try new things (short of baking the brush!) to get rid of the smell.  Until then, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Works great in my daughter&#x27;s hair. It used to take a really long time to pick through her hair with a comb and would cause her a lot of pain, this brush goes right through her hair in a minute or two. Her hair is very straight and she doesn&#x27;t have a lot of it, but it is fine and gets very tangled and almost matted in the back as she sleeps. But it&#x27;s less tangly now after we&#x27;ve used this brush for a few months, I think because there is less breakage.</li>
    <li> This brushed has saved us a lot of screaming after showers. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush because it does not pull her hair! I also love the drama free brushing !</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. I would have a screaming match with my daughter every day over brushing her curly hair. We would use a lot of detangler and she still had huge knots that took forever to get thru and it was torture. The wet brush is UNBELIEVABLE!! It took 5 minutes to go thru her hair which is pretty curly and is halfway down her back. There was no screaming, no crying and even she said &amp;#34;this brush is amazing&amp;#34;!! Best purchase ever!</li>
    <li> Love love love this brush. Gets through all the tangles without pulling and hurting at all.</li>
    <li> detangles hair with little pain, but alot of hair comes off onto the brush</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd wet brush. I want to give it 5 stars, but after a while the bristles start bending, almost in an L shape. Not all of them, but some of them get misshapen. The brush is cheap so I just replaced. I love this brush overall and doesn&#x27;t hurt when I am detangling my wet, tangly hair or brushing over extensions. Also great for brushing out extensions, most other brushes pull the hairs out of the threading.</li>
    <li> this brush really does work when my hair is wet in the shower or damp after towel drying. not so much with dry hair but it is soft yet sturdy enough to brush the hair without pulling too much. i like it a lot and would recommend, especially to moms or dads that have to remove their kid&#x27;s (bird nest) knots, haha. i remember those days with my daughter, not fun, lol. the company picks a color for you and sends it. i got the pink one, very cute. may not be worth the $9 and change, a little overpriced, but it works and i probably would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the second brush I have purchased! My daughter s can&#x27;t live with out it! We really Love this product!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I have ordered 5 now (for myself and as gifts) and I plan to order more. My 2 year old god daughter has a sensitive head, but she likes this brush! I also got one for my best friend and her 8 year old loves it as well. This brush works wonders for adults and children. I get horrible migraines, and the last thing I want to do is brush my hair when my head is throbbing. This brush is so gentle that I don&#x27;t have any problems using it with a migraine!</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this magical product sooner.  This thing has saved time and energy I would have otherwise spent arguing with my child about brushing her hair.  It works amazingly well on both wet and dry hair. No more arguing and no more tears.  Woo hoo!  Thank you Wet Brush!</li>
    <li> This hairbrush came highly recommended to me by several friends.  I used to use a comb for wet hair and brush for dry hair but now I only need to pack this wet brush and it does it all.  The size is very compact and great for tossing in a bag on the way out the door.  I got the yellow one which would have been my last choice but oh well!</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  At first look I thought it looked cheaply made.  It definitely is not.  This brush does not pull or strip out my hair and cleaning it is simple.  Handle is very sturdy and comfortable to hold.  This is a great brush.</li>
    <li> I bought a smaller version of this brush a year or so ago... but my daughter moved out &amp; took it for my granddaughter to use.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the brush &amp; was lost without it so I bought another one</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brush. I actually use it on dry hair. It has done a wonderful job detangling my thick, long hair, my 6 years old thick straight hair and my 4 years old curly long hair. No more whining! Will order more!</li>
    <li> This brush is wonderful.  It is very gentle and feels great on my scalp.  It takes tangles out of wet and dry hair very easily and does not snap/break my hair.  I would definitely recommend this brush.  Great value and great product.</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I bought two brushes for my 10 year old daughter. This brush and the detangled brush. She is very head sensitive and I was tired of all the pouting when I was brushing her hair. This brush worked the best. If you have thick hair you will have to do it in sections to get underneath.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Tangle Teezer on my daughters fairly thick  3c curls for years. They have served us well, so I was a little hesitant to try anything else, but with the good reviews, I thought I would give wet brush a try. I LOVE it! It works just as well as the tangle Teezer for detangling. I can&#x27;t share brushes with my daughter because of the creams and oils I use in her hair, so I plan to get my own wet brush because i like it so much. The only negative I will mention is not something specific to wet brush, but sometimes when detangling, a few hairs will snag and catch a little clump of bristles because of the little beads on the end of the bristles. The tangle Teezer doesn&#x27;t have this specific issue because it doesn&#x27;t have the beads on its bristles, but regardless I really like the wet brush. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and this brush is pretty good at brushing through my hair without pulling. I like it and&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to anyone with long hair.</li>
    <li> Every time my hair started to grow long I would chop it off because I could not comb through it for life of me. I dye my hair fairly often so it is somewhat damaged, but it is naturally very straight.  It gets super ratty, it takes 15 minutes just to get through it with a wide tooth comb.  THIS BRUSH IS MY SAVIOUR.  I combed through it, it only took max 3 minutes!  I only lost a few strands of hair, there was no pain at all.  I am so glad I bought this brush, I would recommend it to anyone with tangly, ratty hair.</li>
    <li> i have course kinky curly hair. detangling in the past has been a painful nightmare that i avoided. now, i use the wet brush and detangle everyday. thats improved my hair health and my look because i dont mind styling it now.</li>
    <li> After fighting with my daughters&#x27; tangled hair everyday, We started using this brush - it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;No more crying during brushes (whether the hair is wet or dry) - and that&#x27;s after trying a lot of other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This brush worked well enough for about 4 months but it&#x27;s getting janky. It was not a magical tangle curing brush like it is made out to be, but it is definitely better at getting things un tangled than standard brushes. The problem with mine is that the bristles of the brush have not held up to its light use. Many of them have become unsupported and just sit pushed into the brush. I don&#x27;t even brush my hair that much. That&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s so tangly...anyway, I don&#x27;t imagine it would hold up to vigorous brushing or daily brushing very long. Maybe I just got a bad one, who cares.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush. it truly works on wet hair for gently getting tangles out. I own 3</li>
    <li> My daughter has had thick, unmanageable hair since she was a child. She loves wearing it long, and it has always been extremely difficult for me to find her a hair brush that can keep her long locks tangle free. She swears by this and I have purchased a few extras because like most children, she has a way of losing these brushes, and she just cannot go without them to long, and no other hair brush out there that we have tried even comes close to this. The price is fantastic as well.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who has a problem with keeping their hair from getting snarled up. It works.</li>
    <li> My hair is really fine and gets tangled very easy. It can easily take me twenty minutes just to brush my hair after washing it. My hairstylist recommended this brush and I love it. I can now brush my hair in two minutes or less without the pain from pulling.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever owned.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes ever. You can brush wet hair and not pull all your hair out. The colors are great and shipping was fast. It is a good price. They are 20.00 dollars in salon.</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously thick, straight, and resilient hair. All I was looking for was something that I could use in conjunction with a blow dryer that wouldn&#x27;t snap in half. Now, while I prefer a paddle brush because of surface area and faster drying this brush gets the job done. I think I recalled someone saying that the bristles melted and I&#x27;m not sure what dryer they were using but I have a Babyliss Pro BAB2000 and they don&#x27;t melt. The brush hasn&#x27;t popped out of its confines which with my thick hair is a common occurrence. I can&#x27;t really comment on breakage because my hair does that all the time because I don&#x27;t really get split ends when it breaks (to the ire of my friends) but the brush glides through easily without struggle through wet tangled hair.</li>
    <li> It really does make a difference, especially on hair that is prone to having tangles</li>
    <li> A must for long hair... Bought one for my daughter, myself and one to leave in the beach bag.  Takes less time than a pick.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This brush does not effortlessly remove tangles from wet hair or dry hair. It does it&#x27;s job, but it is still painful for the kids. I had a brish at one point from a local salon that did a great job, but I forgot the name and they no longer sold the item.</li>
    <li> I very rarely write reviews about products, but this brush merited a glowing one. For forty years I have bought the sturdiest, most stable bristled brushes I can find. My hair is extremely thick, naturally curly/wavy and to-the-butt long. My hair has been known to break wooden brushes, plastic brushes, combs, picks and once on an extreme mass even an ice pick! I have had to cut bunches of snarls out and I&#x27;ve sat with my hair slathered in mayo under a styling cap. I read every review available for these brushes and I still had major reservations. When the brush arrived, I had my doubts as it just didn&#x27;t look sturdy enough to deal with my hair. To my surprise, in 15 minutes I had easily dry brushed through all my hair, including two clumpy thickets of snarls that would have taken me a half hour to forty five minutes to work through. I thought at first it couldn&#x27;t be going all the way through my very thick hair because it was brushing so easily, but it was. There was very little pulling and not much hair loss at all. It worked beautifully on damp, after the shower hair with very little effort. I most certainly will be ordering more of these brushes and recommending them to my thick haired friends!</li>
    <li> Works great with my daughters hair</li>
    <li> I have crazy, curly hair and a whole lot of it! I only brush my hair in the shower because of my curls and it always takes forever to get rid of all the ridiculous knots I get! I had heard many good things about this brush so decided to buy. Upon arrival I looked at it in disbelief. It looked so small and the brush prongs were so short I thought it would never work! I can brush out every knot in what seems a minute or less every time! I don&#x27;t know what is so special about this brush but it just works!</li>
    <li> Great brush, glad I found it on here.  I have two young daughters with long hair that cry bloody murder with other brushes, but not this one.  They even pick it up and use it on there own with no arguments.  I just came back on to buy another one, because I love it so much.  It works so great after I put conditioner in my hair and need to brush through.  I need 10 of these in my house because kids walk away with them.  Has a bit of an odor like cheap rubber, but whatever it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what my expectations for this brush were.  I guess I was expecting it to be amazing and it is.  I saw a commercial for a brush on TV that had the same description.  I looked it up on amazon and it was more expensive. This one is the least expensive of all those brushes so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser described my hair as &amp;#34;very long fine hair with a lot of hair follicles&amp;#34;.  This causes my hair to tangle at the slightest provocation.  I&#x27;ve always had a difficult time finding a brush that I can get through my hair without feeling like I was breaking my hair.  Usually it takes me between 20 and 30 minutes to brush my hair.  With this brush I am able to completely brush my hair in just a few minutes. This is a huge improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve noticed about the brush is that is has very thin bristles which are somewhat maliable. This, I think, gives it the ability to go through my hair without breaking it but somehow (magically) completely detangles it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time brushed it I think I expected it to slide through my hair and not to feel any of the tangles.  Well it did not go through like butter but the more I use it the more I like it and am impressed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to brush their hair quickly and who has difficulty brushing their hair. I&#x27;d even recommend it to parents of small children.  I&#x27;ve used it on my two year old who balked for a minute but  doesn&#x27;t mind it at all now.</li>
    <li> i have really wavy/curly &amp; frizzy hair, i always dread brushing/combing it. i have no idea how it gets so tangled but it does &amp; this brush works really well &amp; really quickly. with a normal brush or comb it would take me at least 2x as long and I&#x27;d rip out 5x as much hair in the process :/ This is pain-free really, and works on dry or wet hair. very good purchase, highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter who has extremely long hair.  Although it does not work for her (nothing does), I tried it and brushing my own hair hurt much less.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My daughter now loves this brush and will sometimes even use it after a bath!!!!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my daughters who had difficulty with tangled hair after showers. It has worked perfectly for them and myself. No need for pulling and tugging. I wish more colors were available when I bought them, tho.</li>
    <li> This is not a real &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a Wet Brush Pro - and it is just like any standard hairbrush that takes chunks of your head with it. I am very disappointed because this is advertising for The Wet Brush and as soon as the brush went through my hair I knew I had bought something else as I own a true The Wet Brush and not this knock off that I received.</li>
    <li> My hair always is a pain to comb out because I have fine hair and it gets so tangly, even my stylist has a hard time combing it out. I told her that is the only thing I hate about having long hair is I dread combing it out after a shower and I switched from a pick to a de tangling comb but it didn&#x27;t really help and actually made it hurt worse trying to comb it out. I have used set detanglers but they don&#x27;t seem to do much either. She suggested I try a wet brush and said they really work and I had never heard of them. I ordered one and just used it and let me tell u it&#x27;s like God himself invented this brush it works that well. Instead of 30 min of section in goff my hair and trying to comb through it this thing effortlessly combed out my whole head in less than 5. I also got some leave in conditioning spray from the salon that she used on my but I think it was mostly the brush. If u or anyone u know has a hard time combing through wet hair, I know with little girls it happens allot, get this brush!</li>
    <li> OH MY GOSH. Ok just to start, my hair is very thick, LONG, and gets tangly very quickly and easily...like I brush it, walk down the hall and back and it has tangles. Yup. That bad. Even after I shower and condition, as I brush my hair I can feel many strands being pulled from my scalp and OUCH that hurts. I just got this and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. WOW. Wet hair worked absolutely perfectly, no tangles, pulling or snagging and pulling out half my head of hair! Even on my dry hair after this windy day it got all the tangles out, no problem and very quickly, PAINLESSLY!! I absolutely LOVE this brush and cannot wait to keep using it forever!</li>
    <li> I loooovee this brush. I bought this after my hairstylist used it. I have straight, relatively thin hair, but a lot of it, so brushing my hair when it&#x27;s wet is a pain because it tends to get tangled. The bristles on this brush are really flexible so it helps to not pull my hair anywhere near as much as other brushes. I bought one for my daughter also who has really thin hair and it&#x27;s great for her as well, and have recommended it to others as well who also loved it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t review on the effectiveness of the product as it&#x27;s a Christmas gift, however, I was unhappy that I thought I was purchasing a black brush and it came in bright yellow. My daughters most unliked color! Who picked this color for me???</li>
    <li> This brush was a gamble of a buy. I was looking for a good solution to make brushing mine and my daughters&#x27; hair less of a pain, and I htought I&#x27;d try the Wet Brush. The gamble paid off, b/c somehow this brush is effective and relatively painless. I&#x27;m not sure what is special about it. The bristles are a little soft...but not extremely, they still get through your hair. It feels like maybe it&#x27;s not working at first, b/c, no pain, then, before you know it, the tangles are out. I&#x27;m considering getting a second one so we can keep one in the shower, and one on the dresser.</li>
    <li> I have long hair- its almost to my butt and straight. It tangles very easily and I have to brush my hair before I wash it otherwise I will not be able to get it untangled after I wash it. I used expensive thick conditioners just so that it makes it somewhat easier. but still it would take me at a very long and painful time to finally get my hair smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this and I tried it immediately on my dry hair, that had been brushed earlier, and the brush went thru with ease and the bristles did not get caught and pull my hair hard at all.&lt;br /&gt;I then tried it after I washed my hair- without brushing it right before washing it like I normally would- and I had no issues what so ever- it was the fastest and easiest time I have ever had brushing my wet hair, and there was no pain. I was afraid that maybe it wasnt getting everywhere because it just seemed to be working too good, so I took the brush I normally used and brushed it after and it was smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am extremely happy with this brush and I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Ohhh I also at the same time bought a detangling comb... and that didnt work- it kept getting stuck in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great Item, the little one loved</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is special about this brush but it works!  I have very thick curly hair.  I bought one for myself and one for my sister &amp; grandaughter at the salon price.  Buying more for stocking stuffers for everyone I know with wild hair:)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brush ever!</li>
    <li> I was told about this product from my hairdresser.  She saw it at a trade show and stated it was wonderful.   I have two daughters with long hair and brushing their hair is always a fight.   This brush is awesome!   My 7 year old brushes her hair in the shower with it herself and comes out tangle free!!!  In the mornings I just apply a little water to her hair and use the brush and her hair comes out great!!! my older daughter&#x27;s friends call it the \\&quot;wonder brush\\&quot;.   I bought 3 and keep one in each shower.  I have been very pleased and recommended to other friends who purchased.  They have expressed similar satisfaction with this brush.     The brush itself is very lightweight and feels similar to other brushes.  Nothing strikes you as great about the brush until you use in on your hair.  Not sure how it works different than other brushes, but somehow it does.    Great product</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  My 2 year old won&#x27;t let me brush her hair with anything else.  It gets the tangles out so easily with no pain.  She even tries to brush her own hair with it.</li>
    <li> Can I say ..I was doubting the brush when I first touched it? It&#x27;s bristles are so soft . But then again my dad would say don&#x27;t judge a book by its cover!!! This is the best brush ever!!! My hair would always tangle and I would take about 30 min to do my hair after the shower. Can I say that now it only takes about 5 min or less to do my hair now and my hair hits my waistline. I will be buying myself another brush since I am always forgetting where I leave it. This is the best hair brush ,every girl must have . You will not regret your purchase !!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after a friend raved about it. I have curly hair, and I&#x27;ve never been able to brush it without it becoming frizzy. The Wet Brush helps smooth out my curls without any of the frizz and \\&quot;poofiness\\&quot;. THe only problem I had was the packaging - when it was shipped to me, it was in a paper envelope and had been squished and some bristles were bent. But I do recommend this brush for all hair types, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had fine, easily tangled hair since childhood and so does my daughter.  This brush is absolutely wonderful for wet, tangled hair &amp; also great for fine, dried hair as well.  Am thinking about buying another - maybe a few more!  I have bought dozens of detangling brushes &amp; none work as well.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. No matter how tangled my hair is, it runs SMOOTH right threw it. I have medium length hair that is very difficult to comb threw after I wash it. I ALWAYS breaks after I use my &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; very expensive brush. This brush is AMAZING. no pulling, no tugging, no knots, no hassle!  I have watched my babysitter comb threw her nieces long (waist length) hair without any problems (she is 4 years old). I wish that my Mom has a brush like this when I was growing up. I might have let my hair grow out when I was growing up..LOL. Enjoy this brush..every household should have one like this.</li>
    <li> I have fine, color-treated hair that gets tangled very easily. Brushing my hair following my shower used to be a long, very painful experience that left behind clumps of hair in the trash bin. Now, I love combing my hair- it&#x27;s as easy as knife through butter. This product is amazing for its price.</li>
    <li> I got this brush based on the good reviews and it does work. I recently got highlights in my medium length hair and couldnt get a comb through it after the shower. This brush goes right through on the first try and leaves hair knot free. Dont know how it works, but it does.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was recommended by my sister-in-law and hair-brushing time with my daughter has always been a battle.  I had hoped this would make it a little better, and it has to a degree. When my daughter&#x27;s hair is dry, this brush pulls less than any of the other brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.  There is still some snagging, but not nearly as much as there used to be.  My daughter has thick, fine, curly hair.  When my daughter&#x27;s hair is wet - this brush is just as bad about pulling as any other brush on wet hair.  I won&#x27;t be using the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; brush on her wet hair ever again.  Since it&#x27;s also labeled for adult use, I&#x27;ve tried it on my very thick, curly hair and found it didn&#x27;t work very well.  I&#x27;ll stick to thick-tined combs.</li>
    <li> My six year old has thick curly hair and this brush goes right through it. Love it! Going to order several for gifts!!</li>
    <li> Finally, a hairbrush that my 8 year old daughter will willingly use.  She has very fine hair that tangles easily, and hates brushing it because it pulls so much.  This brush isn&#x27;t perfect, but it does allow her to get out most of the tangles herself before I have a go at it, and it has cut down on the whining considerably.  I still have to brush her hair a little after she does because this brush requires a few passes to get all the tangles out, but I do it with this brush and it works without all the pulling of other brushes.  I&#x27;m not really sure how it works because it doesn&#x27;t look much different than any other brush, but it does.  I&#x27;ll buy another one when this one gets worn out.  I just wish there was an option to choose your color when purchasing.  It&#x27;d be much easier to find a bright pink one in my daughters room than a black one that gets easily disguised under other things.</li>
    <li> We LOVE this brush! My 3 and 5 year old and very thankful for it! ;)</li>
    <li> I have long thin hair that tangles very easily. Each day it was a painful chore brushing my hair, especially after showering. When I used this brush I was truly amazed at how my tangles came out with no pain at all. I have since purchased 6 of these brushes as I dont ever want to be without one wherever I am.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this brush works, but it does! It looks incredibly similar to our last brush, which caused my 4-year-old to cry the entire time we brushed her hair. Now we can brush it wet or dry, and she tells us it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Amazing! Her hair feels so silky afterward. We are very happy with our purchase. Of course choosing a color would have been nice, but for such a good price it&#x27;s definitely not a deal-breaker.</li>
    <li> This product looks very cheap and flimsy; however, it definitely does it&#x27;s job! My hair felt extremely smooth and detangled very easily with this brush.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are skinny, which means for very thick or very long hair (when dry) they don&#x27;t stay straight enough to get tangles out.  The small bristles also have small tips, which means they&#x27;re more irritating against skin or scalp.  It does work dry, but it&#x27;s not an improvement over thicker-bristled brushes.  It does work nicely on wet hair, but we have found that brushing long hair while it&#x27;s wet tends to leave it straight as a stick, and the description mentions \\&quot;works great on wet and dry hair\\&quot;.  If you don&#x27;t mind brushing while wet, it&#x27;s great, but minus two stars for minimal effectiveness on dry hair.</li>
    <li> I received the yellow wet brush.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the color difference is.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not wowed by the brush. My hair comes out as it does with my current brush &amp; comb.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed overall...</li>
    <li> My daughters hair gets caught and it pulls like elastic. Not a very strong sturdy brush especially not for knots of curly hair</li>
    <li> This brush really does what it says. My hair is pretty thick long and straight. trying to get a brush through my hair is tough.especially when it wet. it usually just rips my hair apart. but this brush made it completely free of all of that.</li>
    <li> It looks and feels like a regular brush...but somehow it manages to glide through all those tangles without pulling or breaking the hair.  Incredible!  If you hair is super knotted then you need to brush it out in smaller sections.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush.  My 3 year old has hair to her bum and hates me brushing her hair, but she loves this brush.  I don&#x27;t know what makes it work so great but it is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Me and my mom love these hair brushes because they save us time and money. I used to take fifteen minutes to brush my hair, but now I only take 2! It saves us money because we don&#x27;t have to buy detangling spray anymore. It doesn&#x27;t even hurt to brush with, even when my hair is wet.  It&#x27;s fun brushing my hair now, because its so easy.  I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> works great.  I like that it is non-slip--I got the black, so I am not sure if the colored ones are non-slip as well.  I also bought the Michele Mercer brushes and do no like them.  They are cumbersome and you can&#x27;t use them in the shower as they are hard to hold on to---due to the shape of the handle as well as being very slippery. It also cost double what this brush cost.  P.S.  I have a mop of thick, crazy long, wiry, tangled hair---sometimes it will take10-15 solid minutes to comb it out in the shower using conditioner and a wide-tooth comb---using the Wet Brush I can do it in 3-4 minutes.  Fantastic.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would end all hair battles with my 3yo, but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m reserving five stars in case there is ever a brush that will do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of us have fine, curly hair. It works great on my hair both wet and dry. It worked great on her hair wet after I used conditioner and a wide-toothed comb to get out some of the bigger tangles. She didn&#x27;t like it at all on dry hair. That&#x27;s not a big issue since I don&#x27;t usually brush her hair when it&#x27;s dry. I&#x27;m glad I bought it, but I&#x27;d be even more thrilled if it had ended all bathtime crying.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST brush in the WHOLE WORLD!  My daughter has very thick floor length hair.  Before i found this brush it use to take me over 2 hours to brush her hair with a LOT of screaming and yelling.  Now with this brush, it takes me 15 minutes tops!.  i now buy 2 at a time.  I learned the hard way, the brush lasts a long time, but when it \\&quot;wears out\\&quot; it wears out fast!.  just wish you were able to pick your own colors.</li>
    <li> True to the promise this brush will de-tangle your hair without getting caught. I have long hair that goes well below my waist and it works very well. It&#x27;s a good supplemental brush you still need a good hearty bristled brush to use with the hair dryer because this ones a little delicate.</li>
    <li> This brush successfully combs through the curliest hair without pain. Perfect for tight, curly locks on small children. It also feels wonderful as a scalp massage. I love it and so do my small kids.</li>
    <li> Love this brush.  It detangles my thick, long, curly hair better than anything else yet.</li>
    <li> My kid liked it so much I had to get another one so my wife wouldn&#x27;t have to track hers down. I&#x27;m told that these brushes don&#x27;t pull the hair and that the tips are comfortable on the scalp... I just write what I&#x27;m told since my hair isn&#x27;t long enough for a comb let alone a brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush!</li>
    <li> This is the only brush that all three of my kids will use!  I have two boys, ages 4 &amp; 6, and a 2 1/2 year old girl.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush.  It makes brushing my kids wet or dry hair pain free!</li>
    <li> I have bought these at my local hair salon for almost 3 times as much  great brush...feels wonderful...great price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have long hair that needs gentle brushing after washing and have had other \\&quot;wet hair\\&quot; brushes.  This one is very good although the last one I had I liked better.  It isn&#x27;t quite strong enough, but it is still good.</li>
    <li> OH my goodness.... all I can say is this brush is a lifesaver. Having 2 daughters both with wavy hair that was always tangled, this has really helped. I don&#x27;t even need detangler any more, this brush works so well. I will definitely order more of these brushes, and will recommend them to anyone. I even like to use this brush. It makes my hair feel like it was just cut when I brush it.</li>
    <li> I loved this brush so much that I ordered another after the first one fell apart. But then the second one fell apart, too, and fast both times. I finally asked my stylist if hers had ever self-combusted the way both of ours had and she said, nope. finally broke down and bought a third one, from target this time. works even better and is definitely more rugged! the one from target looks notably different from the two that I ordered from Amazon. are they knock-offs or what?!</li>
    <li> My daughter was always in tears about her thick hair...problem solved!</li>
    <li> I bought four of these. One for myself and three for my daughters.  They work like a charm.  My 10 year old has always fought me when it came to brushing her hair after a shower.  Now she does not mind at all.  She can do so easily and no tangles are left behind.  I have fine hair that tangles easily and the brush works for me as well.  My oldest takes the brush to the beach with her.  Awesome product, fast shipping.  Everything a consumer would ask for in a transaction.</li>
    <li> If you have purchased a REAL Wet Brush in the past you will not be happy. The brush that is being sold by this seller is a knockoff. The packaging does not match that of what is being advertised. The brush you receive does not have the trademark as part of the logo on the brush handle and is missing the logo and trademark on the top of the brush handle. It is not nearly as soft as the real thing. Buyers beware! If you&#x27;re looking to save money but expecting the real thing don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> No more tears for my daughter.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing for tangles.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works but it does.  I have very tangled hair after I wash it and this is the only brush that can brush right through it with out pulling all my hair out.  I would highly recommend this for anyone who struggles with tangles.  Especially super fine hair!</li>
    <li> Looks cheap, but is actually a surprisingly good brush - works great with my 2 year olds hair who hates having her hair brushed.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after visiting a salon. The hair stylist used this brush and I didn&#x27;t feel like she was pulling out my hair or hurting the scalp when brushing hair wet. It definitely brushes nicely on wet hair like no other brush I have owned. My sister used it and loved it as well so I bought one for her. Now her kids are hooked too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this brush! The only negative is when you use the brush on dry hair it does cause a bit of static. But, most brushes do so this is fantastic for wet hair!</li>
    <li> This brush is a must have for children with long, curly hair.</li>
    <li> This brush definitely gets the knots out and detangles, however, my hair is fine but I have a lot of it, so I noticed sometimes when I use it - it creates these little tiny knots in my hair that a few times I had to actually cut out...wierd. Anyway, I still use it as that only happened twice, just be careful to brush slowly so it doesn&#x27;t snag your hair.  Other than that, it is pretty great - I think if my hair was short it would work even better.</li>
    <li> I have four children with four different types of hair.  This is the first brush that all of them were fighting over.  We now have four brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes painlessly my son&#x27;s long curly hair. I have one and I sent countless wet brushes as gifts. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. It is really easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t yank through my hair. They work great on wet or dry hair. WARNING: it only comes with one and i don&#x27;t think you chose colors cause i did not.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what all the fuss is about.  It&#x27;s a good brush, but it&#x27;s not anything spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, detangling, and it doesn&#x27;t pull too much.  Just know that if you&#x27;re looking for some kind of miracle brush, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t get thru tough knots but works fine if hair isn&#x27;t too knotted</li>
    <li> This hairbrush really works on my daughters fine hair. Before buying this hair brush she would always cry when I tried to detangle her hair no matter which brush or comb I used. With the Wet Brush, detangling her hair is very fast and it doesn&#x27;t bother her at all! She also likes that is pink. I&#x27;m very glad I found this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> How is this so amazing when it looks like any other brush with plastic bristles?  I don&#x27;t know how they make this work, but it works.  I actually almost returned it when it arrived because I thought I mistakenly just bought a regular brush like all the other ones we own.  I&#x27;m so glad I decided to risk it and actually take it out of the (somewhat corny) packaging and try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine and fragile long hair, and it is so nice to be able to brush my hair with a brush when I get out of the shower.  I use this for styling my hair while it&#x27;s wet, too, and have not noticed any breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has fine curly hair that tangles if you look at it funny, and this is the ONLY brush she will let me use on this hair.  She likes having long hair and that would not be possible without this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fancy Seattle hair salon actually sells this for about twice the price, and every time I see my very particular hairdresser, he raves about it.  I understand why.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST BRUSH ever. It does what it&#x27;s advertised to do!! Ive ordered the same brush from the wet brush and they look ,feel,and work the same.</li>
    <li> I have waist-length, naturally curly hair.  This is the first brush that has detangled my hair with no pain.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it is amazing.  It still takes work to get out bad knots, but I don&#x27;t have a sore spot from yanking the tangles out anymore.  I use this to brush in my conditioner in the shower, which helps work out tangles as well.  My hair looks great once it&#x27;s dry, and I&#x27;m happy!  I do wish that I could have selected the color, but I was happy with the two black brushes I got.</li>
    <li> Trying to comb through my 6 year-old&#x27;s hair after a shower was a nightmare.  She has long, thick, curly hair that was constantly tangled.  My hairdresser suggested it and it gets through the knots in wet hair easily!  Now she can brush her own hair and loves that it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I definitely suggest it.  I paid a lot more at the salon - I think I will have to stock up on more at this great price!</li>
    <li> My 6 year old daughter has hair to her waist. Combing wet hair has been a horrible and painful experience, until we were told about this brush by our hair stylist. It is AMAZING.  I am able to comb thru her wet hair, even when it looks like  a tangled mess! It is painless and quick! I cannot say enough about this! I bought it from a salon for $20 and would do it again...so this price is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is the best brush ever!  It&#x27;s the only brush I can use where my daughter won&#x27;t cry and I can brush right through my washed, wet hair with no problems.  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. I borrowed my sister&#x27;s when I was visiting, and I just had to have one. Actually, I had to have two - one for me, and one for my daughter. It goes through my hair so easily after a shower. My daughter&#x27;s too. And we both have tangly hair. I love this brush!</li>
    <li> The brush is fantastic. I have long, fine, very tangly hair and would go 3 or 4 days without brushing just to avoid brushing. Not anymore. This brush gets through the biggest tangle nests with ease and without pain. I ordered a second one to keep at home and keep my original with me at all times. Great product and comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe how well this works on fine, waist length hair. Received very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I would not have picked yellow, but I haven&#x27;t lost it.  It may keep it from getting borrowed.  It is great on wet hair.  It I find it gone after my daughter visits, I will order another one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but oh my God, this brush is AMAZING. My daughter and I are cursed with hair that tangles very, very easily and over the last few weeks, my daughter&#x27;s hair got to the point of absolute frustration for her and myself. She would start crying as soon as I pulled the brush out to brush her hair, and I would grit my teeth and beg her to just give me a few minutes. It was upsetting. Nothing was working, we tried all different types of hair detangler and different hairbrushes and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time we used it, it got almost 100% of the knots out with very little pulling. The next morning, my daughter actually asked me to brush her hair, and within three days of using, she brushes her own hair, because it&#x27;s SO EASY. It works when your hair is wet or dry, which is great for both of us, and it makes both my daughter and myself happy. I mean it when I say WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING AND THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT HAS WORKED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH VERY LITTLE/NO PAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying about 5 more so we&#x27;ll have extras around the house, because this is a brush I never want to be without again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it with a detangler, it does help, but you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is 100% pain free, but it is definitely less painful than a regular paddle brush. I have long, fine hair that tangles easily and this brush has helped reduce hair breakage. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush ever invented! It works...we have 3 in our house! It is gentle on the scalp but takes out the tangles without any tears! My Mother even bought one, this is the best brush everyone should own one! 5 Star!</li>
    <li> I have been growing my hair out for sometime, and struggling with to detangle my hair, even with the most creamy advanced conditioner, this is the answer.  It makes brushing my hair much less painful and saves a lot of hair!  I do have to brush in layers because my hair is moderately thick, but still highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I tend to have problems finding good brushes that actually work.  This one is fantastic and is great for tangles.  My hair tends to tangle anytime I wear hoodies or any type of coat with a highish collar.  With other brushes it&#x27;s been painful and aggravating to get my hair untangled.  This brush makes it much easier and less painful.</li>
    <li> This product is *ok*. I noticed it worked great for the first 3 or 4 times, then it is like any other brush. It just pulls.</li>
    <li> This brush is worth every penny.  I highly recommend!  I have \\&quot;dry clean only\\&quot; hair and this is very gentle while still more effective than anything else out there. BUY 10!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes for tender headed children.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair.  This brush is a huge time saver.  It used to take about 15-20 minutes for me to pick or comb through it, now it takes less than 5.  I plan on purchasing another one for the cabin and one to keep in the gym bag.  Really inexpensive too!  Nice product.</li>
    <li> I have fine, blond hair that is colored, and highlighted and is weak. This is the ONLY thing that will NEVER pull tangled, wet hair. My daughter refuses to allow me to approach her head with anything other than the Wet Brush. We have tried detangling combs recommended by stylists but we keep returning to the Wet Brush. It does not damage the hair shaft and is great for teens who don&#x27;t want to use conditioners or detanglers due to oily hair. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has fine hair and a sensitive scalp. Price is great at Amazon compaired to the salon.</li>
    <li> The bristles are thin to begin with, but after being smashed a bit they fell out... doesn&#x27;t seem like a quality brush to me. We sent it back. Definitely not worth paying for.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found a reasonably priced brush that works! I paid much more at a salon for a brush that was guaranteed not to hurt yet it still does. This brush does what it says.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  I bought a cheaper version at Walmart and it did not work as well.  My daughter&#x27;s hair would break off when she brushed her hair.  I got her this brush and have noticed her hair is longer now.  Her hair has not grown in length for years!  So surprised a brush could make this big of a difference.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush to use on my long hair that would be gentle and get out the knots without breaking my very fine hair. So far this brush works great and is very gentle on my hair. The bristles are very soft and hopefully they won&#x27;t start bending out of shape as I keep using the brush, but so far, works really great and was a great price. I just wish I had been given a choice in the color so I could have picked some other color other than the black I received.</li>
    <li> Brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair is always war. She has very curly, fine hair and it always ends up with copious rats&#x27; nests and trying to brush it results in me being frustrated and my daughter crying. I didn&#x27;t believe that anything would change that, but when I ran across this on Amazon by accident I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glided through her wet hair like silk. It caught on a few tangles but I was able to brush those out very easily without my daughter screaming or crying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive scalp and will be buying one of these for myself.</li>
    <li> I will be taking this brush to all my hair appointments. It&#x27;s the only brush that goes through my snarly, stretchy wet hair. My daughter loves it too. No more wincing and cringing while detangling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a gentle brush to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair &amp; a friend told me to try this one. This brush is life changing!!! Now my girls barely make a peep when i brush their hair in the morning. I&#x27;ve bought one for my sister, niece, &amp; several friends and they are all obsessed!!!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair, my hair stops just above my tailbone, and this brush has no problems getting the tangles out.  I like to brush my hair when I am fresh out of the shower, before I have used a wide tooth comb, and this brush works way better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush to a friend for themselves or for their children&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> My twins have curly hair that is tangled ALL THE TIME. I have tried every fancy shampoo, conditioner and detangler out there.  I heard about the Wet Brush found them online for $5 bucks!!!  Bought three and have been so extremely thrilled with how they work.  Nothing fancy, just soft bristles that as you brush (with out tears) the tangles disappear. One friend who came over and tried the brush said, \\&quot;this is life changing\\&quot;. I plan to get more as gifts and for my pool bag!</li>
    <li> Granddaughters who swim with both very thick hair and with finer hair loved the brush!</li>
    <li> Best brush my daughters have ever owned</li>
    <li> Comfortable and it works. Great for thick long hair! I think I paid a little too much, but that being said, I would do it again!</li>
    <li> Makes combing wet hair a breeze.....love it!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for all the ladies in my family, too!&lt;br /&gt;Received only yellow ones, but would ave liked other colors as well.</li>
    <li> Bought 4 of these brushes and wish that I had gotten a couple more. I have hair past my waist and very thick. This brush is like a miracle in getting the tangles out! I would highly recommend this brush to anyone who gets bad tangles or just has lots of hair.</li>
    <li> Best de-tangling brush I&#x27;ve found.  I also &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; the hair with a lot of detangling spray.  This is the only brush my daughter will let me use on her hair.</li>
    <li> I have the most over processed, damaged, dry, and snarly hair and this brush is great for it. Gets out tangles easily without pulling. I have so much less breakage while combing my hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, I use it all the time. I have found that my hair does not break so much.</li>
    <li> We are HAPPY CUSTOMERS of the Wet Brush. ( it says wet but also great on dry hair, however, I did dampen and used detangler spray) Also Brush starting at the bottom and go up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My daughter is ASD, ADHD, Sensory Integration. Brushing her hair was a NIGHTMARE! But This brush is a Lifesaver! I Highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has litterly gone from Screaming, Crying, having to hold down while she was screaming and pulling away, to a calm relaxing brushing.</li>
    <li> We love this brush! We have four girls in our house with all different kinds of hair and hair thicknesses. This brush works well for all of us. My only regret was that I didn&#x27;t buy two!</li>
    <li> I really like this product; my hairstylist used it on me but didn&#x27;t have any available to sell.  I have a lot of problems with tangled, matted hair when I wash it; I think from hard water.  This is the only product I have found that works through this mess without damaging your hair or flinching with each stroke.  Now if I could only find a hair clarifier that works well to remove hard water and product without causing it to look dull and lifeless.</li>
    <li> The brush is a great size, not too big, not too small. The handle feels very soft and smooth. The bristles are very soft too.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the bristles are a little too weak. Sometimes it struggles to grab hold of my hair to comb it back. But other than that, it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick hair that takes forever to dry, and she consistently has knots in the underneath layer because our old brushes didn&#x27;t reach all the way through her hair. I saw the reviews for the Wet Brush and decided to give it at try. It is by far the best brush we have ever tried! Even though we have loved other brushes in the past, as I said, they never got that bottom layer brushed -- this one does. We will be buying additional brushes and recommending this product to our friends.</li>
    <li> I have medium length thick coarse hair which is very frizzy. Normally after washing my hair, I would let it dry out and then use a wide-toothed comb to brush my hair. The comb would detangle my hair but there was still a lot of hair fall due to tugging and pulling. After looking at all the glowing reviews on Amazon, I decided to buy the wet brush. And I was impressed the first time I used it.The bristles are soft but firm and it goes through hair smoothly-both wet and dry. Hairfall due to brushing and combing has been reduced a lot. I have also noticed less static hair, and as a result fewer flyaways.   Its a good bursh for its price. If you are looking for a hairbrush to buy, you have nothing to lose by buying this one. Even if it doesn&#x27;t work as well on your hair as it did on mine, at its worst, its still just a hair brush which burshes.</li>
    <li> When My Tigi Pro paddle brush fell into the bath and somehow broke, I was forced to buy a new brush. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t have TIGI brushes from reliable sellers here in the USA, so I purchased this based on the reviews. It&#x27;s not a bad little brush especially for the price. Combs through wet and dry hair easily. I have very fine hair and the breakage is minimal with this! I&#x27;m not saying its the best brush in the world, but it certainly does what it says. I would prefer if the bristles were a little sturdier as they seem somewhat flimsy.</li>
    <li> It is a good brush, and I received it in a lovely purple shade. I don&#x27;t really feel like it detangles my mass of waist length, wavy, medium fine but kind of coarse hair any better than a regular brush like this from Walmart or Rite Aid. I think it may be every so slightly gentler, but I still feel the pain of detangling the knots under my hair that come from wearing a hood or scarf and I still am losing plenty of hair. I think it is slightly less painful when my hair is wet, but overall not some miracle brush.</li>
    <li> BEST brush for my thick, long wavy, chemical treated hair! does not rip hair out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so dissatisfied. This brush is a knockoff! Beware! It doeant have the logo branded in it just the ink logo. I compared it to my original one and it&#x27;s definitely fake! So sad what people will do to make money and rip people off!</li>
    <li> I love the \\&quot;Wet Brush\\&quot;!!! I have long hair and it always gets knotty when it is wet, this really helps to brush my hair without breaking it.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was very young, brushing my hair after a shower was a complete nightmare.  My mother would have to chase me around the house, and I would cry and scream because I have EXTREMELY thick, wavy hair.  For the past several years, I was accustomed to spending about ~20 minutes brushing through my hair after getting out the shower.  It would be painful, annoying, and time-consuming.  I saw this brush on Amazon, and decided to give it a try because of the high ratings.    It is truly amazing.  It is almost hard to believe how well this brush works.  I spend about 1 minute brushing through my hair after the shower now.  I have saved so much time and frustration with this brush, and I highly suggest it to everyone.</li>
    <li> So I ordered this brush after reading the other reviews and was expecting it to instantly detangle my daughter&#x27;s knot-prone hair. It didn&#x27;t. It does work well on children&#x27;s hair (and my own as well) when it is wet or dry. But, if the hair is very knotty (as my daughter&#x27;s is), this does not work wonders. It&#x27;s ok for the price but will not do anything super.</li>
    <li> I got this and the tangle teezer at the same time.  This brush does not work.  My daughter has fine, silky hair and I have medium, wavy hair.  It took me forever to get tangles out with a wide tooth comb.  I saw someone from the long haired communities review on the tangle teezer so I thought I&#x27;d get that and try this (since it was cheaper).  The tangle teezer is really amazing.  I&#x27;m done in 1/2 the time with 3/4 less hair in the brush.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this...go for the tangle teezer!!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s the only one I have ever owned that doesn&#x27;t pull and hurt when brushing.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I bought one for my daughter over a year ago and she loves it, so I recently bought one for myself. Why did I wait so long???? This detangles your hair with ease.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft and therefore doesn&#x27;t pull hard on knots but it also takes MANY more strokes to brush through hair. it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I have old, over processed, pitiful hair.  I used to have wonderful hair but that was then and this is now and good golly,&lt;br /&gt;honey, do things change.  I try to deal with what I&#x27;ve got but this was getting tricky.  Brush or comb my hair and have it&lt;br /&gt;break and split and just plain fall out. OH#&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;**^€€€¥¥¥¥¥!!!!! Don&#x27;t brush or comb my hair at all?  Well, that&#x27;s attractive.&lt;br /&gt;(sarcasm)&lt;br /&gt;So.  I ordered this brush believing something must be better than the slightly used stuff at CVS and Target and my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful!  It&#x27;s fantastic!  It&#x27;s better than Fritos! First time I used it on dry hair it slipped right through without a single tug,&lt;br /&gt;or pull, or horrid snapping sound. Just a soft, gentle glide dissolving tangles with no effort whatsoever.  I considered crying but&lt;br /&gt;discarded it as inappropriate. I AM SO HAPPY!</li>
    <li> I needed something my 5 year would use or at least let me use without a tantrum.  It does the trick.  I do find that after the first run through, I need to go through with a second brush to get the lower levels of her thick hair.</li>
    <li> My 11 yr old daughter has back-length hair that tangles very easily and often.  She looked at the brush with a scowl and \\&quot;not ANOTHER brush that tears my hair\\&quot;.  She tried it and with a rare look of shock -LOVED it!!  She (and my wife) tell me this is the only brush they have ever found that gets through her hair with no issues.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed how well this works.  I have fine long hair and this brush made brushing so much easier.</li>
    <li> Great brushi. Just what I was looking for. Can use on dry hair as well as wet. I use it daily</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when this brush arrived, but it&#x27;s great.  No more tears from my daughter.</li>
    <li> When I worked in the salon we would call hair like my daughters horse hair. But really, horse hair is much better!  My daughter is 11 and brushing her hair has always been a nightmare. It is most of the way down her back. The top is straight and the underneath is curly. She brushes the top and will flip her head upside down and make a half hearted attempt at brushing the under neath. Leaving the middle looking like a big, gigantic dread lock.  I took her to the salon last time I got my hair done since I am no longer working outside the home.  It took the poor girl 30 minutes to brush through my daughters hair so she could shampoo it.  I bought this on a whim at Kroger and it would not scan. They gave it to me for $4.99 which was the price of the next closet looking brush.  After using the brush this morning, I am going back to buy a couple more. My daughter has a habit of loosing brushes and this one is PRICELESS!&lt;br /&gt;I will post pictures of my daughters hair later so you may be amazed at what this brush gets through.  I would recommend it 10x over and I have had countless brushes, most of them for professional use and none have held a candle to this brush.  We used it on dry hair this morning because my daughter was going to Horse Camp, if it can get through her dry, matted, green from the chlorine at camp hair, it will be able to get through wet hair like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to buy this brush, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I wondered how a hairbrush could get five stars. I will say that I wish I had known about this brush sooner. My daughter is four and she has curly fine hair and every morning wakes up with a birds nest in the back of her head! Also, as the day progresses, so does the tangled mess on the back of her head, even after it has been brushed out. Then, when it&#x27;s time to brush, it&#x27;s always a fight and takes forever because we have to spray it with detangler, then brush very slowly and delicately to avoid pulling and tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairbrush is so amazing, that my 4 year old daughter asked me to order a box full in case they run out. She loves this brush and has told everyone about her hairbrush that came in the mail that doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I have been using it too after I get out of the shower. As a test one day, when I was showering, I didn&#x27;t condition my hair and when I was shampooing, I intentionally made it a tangled mess just to see what this brush would do. It went right through the tangles, and I have a very sensitive scalp. within minutes, my hair was completely brushed through perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $6.98 for this brush, and honestly would pay $30 or more for it, just because it has been such a lifesaver for my daughter. Now, she doesn&#x27;t fight me when it&#x27;s time to brush, and it saves so much time. Not to mention, this hair brush is going to pay for itself in the amount of money I save not having to buy detangling sprays (which don&#x27;t work nearly as well, btw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the brush, I know some people have complained about it. I think the bristles are &#x27;cheap&#x27; feeling because of how they have to be made to get this brush to work the way it does. I don&#x27;t think it was made intentionally cheap, but I have never seen a hairbrush with bristles like these, and I think that&#x27;s how it gets the tangles out. The quality of the brush is actually nice. The brush has a nice rubberized feel to it and thebrush feels weighty, not just a light cheap throwaway. I can see this brush lasting for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, my daughter has shoulder length baby fine, hair with light curls. My hair is very fine, straight, and thick. From the tangled thick mess my hair was in for my experiment, I would definitely say that anybody with ultra thick curly hair would be able to use this also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one more tip: I have noticed, that this brush does work remarkably better on damp or wet hair. We have used it on dry hair, but it does pull on tangles somewhat when it is dry. If you want to use this without having had a shower, just keep a small spray bottle and lightly mist your hair before brushing. It doesn&#x27;t have to be soaked, it works really good with just a light spritzing. I have to clarify though, this is for hair that is extremely tangled. It does fine on dry hair that is not tangled much.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for our 4 year old - the bristles don&#x27;t snag on knots and they are flexible enough so they are gentle on her scalp.  My wife tried it on her (dry) hair and is going to buy one too!  They both have fine, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I had gotten this brush from my friends salon, and it&#x27;s great if you have hair extensions. Extensions can be pricey as I know! The Wet  brush won&#x27;t rip at them, and it brushes right through with no snags.  :)</li>
    <li> This brush arrived in 2 days with Amazon Prime and it does the job well. We had used conair and vidal sassoon vented brushes, but they caused my daughter (6 year old) to cry out from the pain when trying to work out the tangles. She has mostly straight, medium thick hair and lots of it. When she has a ponytail, it&#x27;s about 1 inch thick in diameter. Her hair is a little past her shoulders. By the end of the day, it&#x27;s a tangly mess at the ends. We use Suave children&#x27;s smoothing shampoo that has some kind of conditioner in it. I think the soft bristles help with not pulling the hair. My husband was raving about how well the brush worked out the knots easily and how gentle it was when blowdrying her hair. No more crying! What a relief for the parents!</li>
    <li> My daughter has a very tender scalp.  She has a very hard time getting through her thick, naturally wavy hair with other brushes without pulling her hair.  I have tried many other brushes and combs. This is the best and fastest way for my daughter to get her hair done.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love it!!!!! I loved it and decided to try another brand thinking they probably all work really well. And saddly I didnt like the other brush nearly as well. So I ordered another one of these. I have  recomended them to friends and family. I was amazed how much nicer this brush is than my old one.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for my daughter it is great no longer tearing her hair brushes through nots and detangles without pain or pulling her hair out bought four more for a friend whose daughter always screams when her hair is brushed with this o e not even an ouch</li>
    <li> I am not sure what makes this brush different from others, but it is! My children have hair that is thick and curly, always tangled. This brush has done wonders on their hair, wet or dry!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush.  My daughter has long curly hair which is very hard to detangle.  This brush works so well and is so much faster than trying to use a comb.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  They work great on wet or dry hair.  I no longer hear my daughters complain about their hair being brushed.  They can even brush their own hair now.  These brushes also work great for dolls.  My only wish is that I could pick the colors or at least be sent various colors.  Not the end of the world though.</li>
    <li> My daughter has curly, tangly hairs. This brush has made our lives so comfortable. No more cries during brushing hairs.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my little sister had recently bought one and I love it! Gets the knots out of your hair without ripping your hair out. Its a miracle brush!</li>
    <li> Lifesaver! My daughter is mixed with curly THICK hair and so far this is the BEST wet brush I&#x27;ve found to go through Her hair when wet. I will be purchasing another one to keep as a backup just in case we loose the first one.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush!!! My daughters have long hair and this is the very best! No tears after bath time.  I thought they were just partial to the purple color  so I tried it for my self after a shower... Now I have my very own! I recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> What?! I wish I had this brush a looong time ago. It goes through my naturally curly and tangled, wet hair like butter. Magic MAY or may not be involved when using this product. Wow</li>
    <li> This hairbrush is so soft and it works. Its amazing. I have bought one for my daughter and granddaughter. They cant believe how well it works.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these due to the great reviews and was amazed at how quickly and painlessly it detangled my hair and my two daughters.  Since then, I have purchased at least five more for friends.  Everyone tells me THANK YOU!!  It works well on long, short, thick, fine, wavy and curly hair.  My only comment is that I found these at my local BBB and they had a hole in the handle making it perfect for hanging in the shower.  I don&#x27;t know if I bought them all but they&#x27;re gone and not in stock anymore.  The first time you use it, it sounds like you&#x27;re ripping your hair out, yet it&#x27;s so gentle you think it can&#x27;t possibly be working.  Well, follow up with a comb and you&#x27;ll see it indeed worked very well!</li>
    <li> Yes! This is the brush! I bought two, one for me and one for my daughter.  This brush detangles our long fine hair quickly and with minimal damage.  Easy to keep clean, too.  I am planning to buy a bunch, to give as presents!</li>
    <li> This brush works great on wet or dry hair.  The bristles are forgiving thus less hair breakage.  I got tired of combs for wet hair being too stiff for tangles.  This brush is much gentler.  Hair will always fall out and the brush holds the hair rather than it getting all over the floor, unlike a comb.  Leaves hair smooth.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000L596FE Wet Brush Rubberized]]I have four little granddaughters who hate to have their hair brushed.  Yesterday, I used my wet brush rather than the one they had and it was like a miracle!  No fussing or \\&quot;ouch!\\&quot; cries.  I LOVE this brush so much I&#x27;ve gotten one for each of them to have at home and an extra to keep at Grandma&#x27;s house.</li>
    <li> I took a risk blowing $7 bucks in hopes this brush was a miracle.  Guess what, it&#x27;s not.  If you have fine, long hair it will snag and tear at it.  You&#x27;re better off getting a Goody \\&quot;No Tears\\&quot; brush if you&#x27;re looking for something that won&#x27;t tear and still get out the tangles.  I have hair past my bottom, very fine but thick and this just isn&#x27;t what is being advertised in these reviews.  Gotta wonder if every employee of the brush manufacturer got on here proclaiming this brush some \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not, and a $5 buck Goody brush is much better.  Boy, truly tired of hyped out reviews which are questionable convincing me to spend my hard earned dough only to get another \\&quot;not as advertised\\&quot; useless product.</li>
    <li> when my mom first purchased this for my daughter I laughed at her.  My daughter caught lice from school so I threw this brush out.  Needless to say it was only about a week with another walmart brush until I got online and bought this one again!  Works great!!! :)</li>
    <li> When I first received this brush a couple of moths ago, I had my doubts because the bristles seemed not strong enough. However, after putting through its paces with long wet hair (even after-the-beach wet!) I must say that it does work wonderfully! I really don&#x27;t how it does it, but the bristles somehow detangle hair without pain and almost without effort. And it does it also with dry hair. 5 stars, definitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (Dec 4, 2013): Still going strong! And still loving it! The lettering is starting to fade, but this seems normal after 2 years. One word of advice: When travelling, pack it carefully, mine was crushed inside a suitcase and the bristles are now uneven, although without adverse effect brushing - my fault. Also, I must add that the bristles tips are still there (unlike many other brushes).</li>
    <li> I use to have battles with my daughter every day trying to get the tangles out of her hair.  One of my friends told me about wet brush.  I use it to brush my daughters hair all the time now and it get tangles out so easily with little pulling.  Very happy with this brush!</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this brush for my son&#x27;s unruly curly hair.  All I can say is WOW.  It works so well and he doesn&#x27;t complain when I brush conditioner through his hair.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my daughter&#x27;s straight hair and no complaints from her either.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine told me about a \\&quot;wet brush\\&quot;, and I immediately went online to try to find it. I was very skeptical, but my hair is so knotty after the shower that I was willing to try anything. It definately makes brushing my hair a million times easier when it is wet. I reccomend to anyone whose hair tangles easily in the shower. I bought one for my sister too.</li>
    <li> It works well-very little hair loss and it goes through my usually tangled long hair &#x27;like butter.&#x27; I was just talking with the grls about how difficult it is to keep long hair nice - not dry, not oily at the roots, with a little bit of volume. Try a bit of back-combing and this one is quite a hair tool, as well.</li>
    <li> This is just a good brush.  Doesn&#x27;t do what I was told it does (which was you can brush your hair with it when it&#x27;s wet and it keeps it such as curly hair vs making it frizzy).  I am using it just as a brush now and nothing more,</li>
    <li> Great gentle detangler!  I have very fine hair and like this brush for detangling it when wet, with minimal breakage.  I&#x27;d recommend this brush for use with small children too.  However, I think the bristles (short), and the design, make it too soft for those with thick stranded hair (how I wish that were me!)  But if you are looking for a painless way to detangle very fine hair, this brush works and I recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a brush for my permed waved hair. I first bought the DENMAN Paddle Brush because the reviews. It works but still pull and hurt my hair. Then someone recommended this wet brush. Since it is cheap so I got one. It has been a good experience to brush my hair since then. No dificulties and no hurt at all. I highly recommend this one!</li>
    <li> My 4-yo girl used to hate getting her messy &amp; tangled hair combed despite investing in different conditioners, combs and brushes.   I love this brush as I do not have to chase after her to get her hair combed.   After running this brush through her \\&quot;bird-nest\\&quot; hair less than 5 minutes, her hair is no longer tangled and looks lovely.</li>
    <li> when I got it, it looked like just another brush. but I haven&#x27;t heard crying for the past 4 days from my daughters. My daughters are bi-racial and have curly and most of the time frizzy hair so to have this go through their hair with ease, it was amazing. I would and probably will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and this is the best price around!&lt;br /&gt;I have two girls with long curly hair and the Wetbrush has been so great and saved many hours of tears and time combing their hair!</li>
    <li> I was very close to literally cutting ALL of my hair off, until I bought this brush! My sister had told me about it a while ago, but I thought that there was nothing to help me in my knotty hair situation.  I would spend at least 20 minutes trying to brush my hair when I got out of the shower and even had to have someone help me.  Now, with the Wet Brush, it takes me less than a minute and there are NO knots this brush can not get through! LOVE IT! It is a must!</li>
    <li> This is the only brush we use on my daughter&#x27;s hair!  Her hair is thick and this brush works great wet or dry.  I purchased 2 and both were black.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This brush works great as long as my daughter&#x27;s hair is wet.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush it like all the other brushes we have tried.  I have no idea how it works- but it does!</li>
    <li> Fantastic brushes, I&#x27;ll never use another kind! No hair pulling and painful detangling!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, thick hair &amp; brushing it was always a fight.  This brush works great on wet or dry hair &amp; now when I tell her to brush her hair she does it right away with no arguments at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for about 4 months now. I absolutely love it because it defines my curls 100X better than my wide tooth comb. Like WOW. I have about 1/2&amp;#34; diameter curls and usually my hair gets frizzy but this brush allows my curls to form in a way that when my hair dries I have less frizz and more curl. Very satisfied. And yes it detangles my hair as well.  Update: August 1st 2015.   I do like this brush however I rather there not be balls at the bottom of the bristles. Hair can easily be wrapped around it causing for hair to become stretched and misshapen, if pulled hard enough.</li>
    <li> I have 4 young daughters and we love this brush but you do have to use it on wet hair or get it wet otherwise it will get stuck in your hair. This is a must have for long hair, it works just like a comb only much faster and better; I also use it damp to smooth their flyaway hairs.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing brush I have ever used. I have bra-strap length mixed (African-American and Caucasian) hair (the kinky kind, not the nice curly kind)that is treated with a chemical relaxer and my hair is always impossible to brush when wet.  Detangling usually involves lots of product, a wide tooth comb and a whole bunch of patience.  This brush glided through my hair with ease and detangled with no effort at all.  I have never had such an experience with my hair in all my life (35 years).  Truly amazing!!  Before you think it won&#x27;t work for you because you don&#x27;t have this type of hair, it was recommended to me by a Caucasian girl with straight dyed blonde hair and she said it was the only thing she has used that didn&#x27;t rip and or break her hair off.  So there you have it, straight hair, nappy hair, whatever you have, I&#x27;m sure this thing will work for you.</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING!!! My daughter no longer cries when I brush her hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my $15 Lemon Drop by Drybar brush, which was dead after about four months of use. The bristles are a little bit thinner, but otherwise it&#x27;s pretty much the same brush for half the price. It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug at my hair, whether wet or dry, and I used it with extensions and had no problems at all. The little plastic dot on the ends is holding up much better than the other brush too. Definitely worth the purchase and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> works great when used in shower</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m recommending this to all my friends with little girls!  It&#x27;s a miracle brush, in my opinion.  My daughter screamed and cried at every brushing, but no more thanks to this brush.  I have no idea what makes it get the tangles out so easily and pain free, but it definitely works for us.  Wish I had found it a few years ago!</li>
    <li> I bought these because I have a daughter with thick, course and extremely curly hair.  This brush works best when starting from the ends and working your way up to the root.  It does help a lot but does not cure all curly hair woes.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, works great! I have thin hair that tangles easily,this brush is amazing! Definately would reccomend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this brush works, but it is pseudo magical.</li>
    <li> This brush has held up against my daughter&#x27;s tough, tangled hair! It easily brushes out with a few strokes, and we don&#x27;t pull out as much of her hair as we did with regular brushes. The soft bristles are easy on her tender little head (she&#x27;s only 4). It just happened to come in her favorite color: yellow! That made it so much easier to get her to use it herself, and to let us use it on her.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I ever had.</li>
    <li> As someone who has fine, but a lot of it, hair.. it tangles EASILY. My hair stylist has noticed a huge difference in hair breakage from when I started using this brush. My ends are less split, my hair is shiny, and over all healthier. I recommend this brush to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing and is much better than my trusted Mason Pearson that I have owned for years!</li>
    <li> Freaking amazing! I bought one of these after my hair stylist recommended it. I have very thick and long hair so it tangles easily and is quite hard to brush through sometimes after I shower, but this brush makes it so much easier. I use it on my dry hair too and it still is better than my old one.</li>
    <li> This brush is good, i gave it a 4 star rating because it is stiffer than the other &amp;#34; wet&amp;#34; brushes I have used.</li>
    <li> Skeptical, I was; however, I am now a believer!  My girls and I lovingly refer to it as &amp;#34;the magic brush&amp;#34;--there are magically no more tears!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this brush (I may have to buy two more to make sure we&#x27;re never without one).</li>
    <li> Great brush for thick curly hair. I never noticed any damage to my long hair like some other reviewers</li>
    <li> WOW! This brush is unbelievable! I went to a new salon today and the girl cutting my hair noticed how tangled it was just from washing it. I have a lot of very fine blonde hair that is down to my waist, and it knots up very easily. I usually have to brush it (after spraying it with detangler) for half and hour to 45 minutes when I get out of the shower. She tried the Wet Brush on me and within 10 strokes, all my tangles were out, without any detangler! Incredible! I bought one at the salon, and I just ordered a few more from here. If you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this, DO IT!</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Great for wet or dry hair. Just wish I could pick the color!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long hair and is a swimmer.  This brush is amazing!  It glides through her hair, even the toughest tangles.  No tears!  No breakage!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush because of the great review. When I first opened up the package I honestly thought that the bristles were very soft and were going to be too soft for my hair. My hair is fine, but thick, as in I have a lot of hair and it is long. I am amazed that the brush does go through my hair but the soft bristles are firm enough to tug, but soft enough to not break the hair. I find that it probably takes extra strokes To get the tangles out, but this brush is gentler on my hair and I&#x27;m having less breakage. My hair can have a tendency to get somewhat poofy especially in damp or humid weather, so I use conditioner and leave in Argan oil. This brush has actually seems to have a smoothing effect that has reduced the need for the oil.</li>
    <li> Never thought I&#x27;d actually love a hair brush so much as this one. I am growing out my hair to donate, and it is about half way down my back at this point. I had gotten used to the tangling knots and tearing my hair out every time I brushed it... My old brush started loosing bristles so I thought Id give this one a try - not expecting it to be too much different, but WOW!! Yes, there is a (slightly) strong smell at first - smells like the rubber soles of new shoes or new tires. This is because there is rubber in the brush - so, naturally, it will smell like rubber. But the smell is not overpowering and fades after a few days out of the package, so its not nearly as big of a deal as other reviewers have made it.&lt;br /&gt;It glides through my thick long hair with ease, and keeps it shiny and smooth. As apposed to my other brush which was MUCH more expensive, but would painfully tear at my hair creating more knots than it let out! I think the secret is that the bristles are thinner and therefore move easier than most brushes of a similar type. We will see how this stands the test of time, as I only just got it. But assuming it doesn&#x27;t fall apart - I will likely never buy another brush!</li>
    <li> Not sure if they are real, the bristles were way harder than anticipated</li>
    <li> This brush has saved me a ton of time in the morning because I no longer have to spend 10 minutes carefully combing out all of my tangles. I&#x27;ve recommended it to quite a few people who have all loved it. I&#x27;m not sure how healthy it is for your hair, but it&#x27;s worth it to be able to easily brush through my hair after a shower!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for a friend to replace one she has lost. I couldn&#x27;t believe how happy she was. Over a brush! I&#x27;m one of those annoying people that doesn&#x27;t need to brush my long curly hair at all. I don&#x27;t even own a comb. So I started teasing her about her &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; brush every time I saw her. That is until she issued the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She dared me brush half her hair with the expensive brush she had been using, and the other half with the Wet Brush. She has bra length wavy hair, and even though it&#x27;s fine, there is so much of it it is thick. To begin she purposely used clarifying shampoo and roughly &amp;#34;dryed/matted&amp;#34; it with a towel. Trying to use the expensive brush was awful. I think I could have made more progress with a flimsy fine tooth comb. In fact I gave up on that brush 5(!) minutes into it. Then, with frustration and dread I picked up the Wet Brush. Halfway through the first stroke I understood. I&#x27;m not going to say it went effortlessly. But what little effort I did have apply was minimal. With the Wet Brush I was able to get through the entire mess, even finding tangles the other brush left behind, in less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I now agree that this brush is amazing? Absolutely! And even though I won&#x27;t be buying one for myself, I will be telling everyone else to buy one.</li>
    <li> The granddaughters will willingly brush their hair after showering and there isn&#x27;t the tears and opposition that went on before.</li>
    <li> Absolutely one of the best buys we&#x27;ve done. My daughter had long hair and this went through it like it was butter. Every time I had brushed her hair before this she would cry. Not anymore. I may even purchase more.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! After every shower my hair is one big mess of tangles. My head is really sensitive, and with hair down my back it takes forever to brush out!! But with the wet brush, it brushes right through my tangles and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair! I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this as a gift for one of my sisters. She absolutely loved it, so much so that she convinced me to buy one for myself! I have very long, thick hair, and after using this brush, I will never buy any other brush again. I was skeptical at first because the bristles are so soft, but this really works without pulling and ripping my hair out! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this brush and never thought it would work on wet hair and I&#x27;m sold on it.  Buying more for gifts.</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft and gentle. I&#x27;ve never used a brush this good. I personally prefer a good firm brush that will massage my scalp as I brush my hair. This brush is soft and almost tickles as it does it&#x27;s work. I would call this a magic brush. Try this if you have a super sensitive head.</li>
    <li> To be honest I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work as well as claimed because I have such thick curly hair and have had no luck with brushes in the past. Still I was desperate to find a brush that would get through my tangles without pulling our or breaking my hair off. When I got it, I tried it on my dry hair..it was ok, gentler than my last brush to be sure, but nothing to rave about. However in the shower on wet hair it was nothing short of miraculous...lol  The brush almost glided through my tangles without any fuss or breakage at all! :D</li>
    <li> While nothing can eliminate tangles from forming or make them disappear without a little tugging, this brush was a definite improvement over our other brushes.  Not sure how it works, but even my daughter instantly commented that this brush didn&#x27;t hurt as much.  That&#x27;s a great review from a 5 year old!</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes ever! My girls have long hair that tangles easily. They have no problem detangling with this brush. We ordered three more to have on hand for whenever someone needs them!</li>
    <li> So in love with this brush! I wish I knew about it when I used to be a swimmer. It goes right through wet or damp hair without causing tangles.</li>
    <li> Seriously, I don&#x27;t know what this brush is made of, but it is magical! I won&#x27;t pretend I wasn&#x27;t at least a little skeptical, but I was excited to give it a shot. This thing combed right through my hair like butter, and I HATE combing my hair after a shower because it is SO.DARN.TANGLED! I&#x27;m most definitely taking this work of art to my next hair appointment!</li>
    <li> Works great, I won&#x27;t lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they gave me pink... I&#x27;m a guy... had to give to someone and order another one... I know colours vary but I feel like they should at least be a little conscious of pink colour...</li>
    <li> I was ready to cut off all of my hair but this brush helped save the &#x27;do.  My hair is waist length and tangles horribly.  This brush allows me to brush it out with a minimum of fuss and actually take care of my hair.  I was very close to cutting it all off and this brush was the thing that allowed me to keep my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush was recommended by our hair stylist. It is fabulous. It looks like a plain old brush but it detangles wet hair incredibly well. Highly recommended....you wont regret it if anyone in your home has hair that needs detangling. It also smooths dry hair and helps keep the frizzies away.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these because my daughters are always stealing my hair brushes so I have to flood the house with them to make sure there&#x27;s always one on hand.  Last time I got these it came in green.  This time both were black.  This is a great de-tangling brush.  I also have a Knot Genie, which I bought at a kids hair cut shop, but this works much better.  The kids say it&#x27;s more comfortable and since this has a traditional handle, it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand all the time like the knot genie.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best invention since sliced bread!  Bought one for my daughter based on my stylist&#x27;s suggestion.  She told me, &amp;#34;it makes all the difference in the world&amp;#34;.  It had been several years since my daughter raved over something I bought her, so I had to get one for myself.  I love it just as much. I&#x27;ve since bought several and passed them out to relatives and friends.  If you have long hair, you&#x27;re NUTS if you don&#x27;t get one of these.</li>
    <li> My dog likes a lot better than wire brush.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair that has always tangled. I use this brush after washing my hair and using my leave-in detangler product, and it works fine. I still shed the same as with my other paddle brush, but the wet brush does go pretty smoothly through my hair.</li>
    <li> I have difficulty finding a good brush for my thick, wavy/curly hair. This one works well on both my wet and dry hair. It snags a lot less than my other brushes, so it creates less frizz. My hair tangles very easily, so it still is hard to brush after I&#x27;ve been out in the wind or rain or have been very active, but it definitely works better than my other paddle brush. I wish you could choose the color you want - when I ordered it, it showed a blue brush, but the one I received is black. However, that is a small complaint, not one worth being upset over.</li>
    <li> My 7-year old daughter has long (past her waist), thick, curly hair and brushing time is torture for both of us. When I first opened this brush, I thought no way is this going to get through all of her tangles, some of which border on being dreds, let alone be painless, so I tried it on myself first, as my hair is also long and the same texture and I was amazed -- this brush works!  It did not reach some of the deeper tangles in my daughter&#x27;s hair, but it got almost all of them and yes, it was painless and very fast. Instead detangling by hand and taking breaks every ten minutes to wipe the tears from both of us, we were done in less than five minutes. The only drawback is that does leave hair a bit \\&quot;frizzy,\\&quot; instead of smooth, but we have leave-in product to solve that. I am ordering a spare -- LOVE this brush because it doesn&#x27;t make my baby cry.</li>
    <li> I use it both on wet and dry hair and it works great.  Perfect for my thick curly hair and for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
    <li> Not so impressed with this brush&#x27;s detangling abilities! My daughter&#x27;s thin hair tangles easily and this brush was fine, just overrated!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair brush. I used to use cheap brushes from the drugstore or dollar store. But getting tangles out was ridiculously painful.  With The Wet Brush, that pain is gone. (Geez, I sound like an infomercial.)</li>
    <li> This brush sort of glides over the crazy tangles in my hair and after several passes, miraculously manages to work its way through my hair.  One of my girlfriends bought herself one after trying it.</li>
    <li> I have a daughter with a sensitive head.... Brushing her hair is a challenge.  This brush makes her want to brush her hair.  It really is worth the money!</li>
    <li> Even after reading many of the reviews before I bought this brush -- I didn&#x27;t have the highest of expectations.  Boy was I WRONG!!  I absolutely love this brush.  I have long curly hair that would knot so terribly at the nape of the neck (actually looked like the beginnings of dread locks at end of day).  Would cringe having to get into shower because the first 20 minutes were spent working these painful knots out of my hair -- using the best of deep conditioners, detanglers....you name it...I tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day my brush arrived, I ran it through my hair 3 times...THAT&#x27;S IT...just 3 times, and all knots were gone!!  I think I may have had tears of gratitude in my eyes!!!  This may sound a bit dramatic, but I don&#x27;t care ----THIS BRUSH CHANGED MY LIFE IN IT&#x27;S OWN SMALL WAY!!  No more painful showers ripping hair out of my head...life is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and btw....bought two more for my daughter and little sister.  Have been singing it&#x27;s praises to every woman with long hair that I know!</li>
    <li> Works well in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  No more complaining that it hurts!  Bristles are pretty flimsy for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright brush, no doubt, but I am not bewildered by it&#x27;s detangling power.  To read the reviews, you&#x27;d think it was nearly magical!    It is one of the better brushes I have owned, espeically for the great price, and it does help with tangles, but not enough for me to give it more than 3 stars for this purpose.    But if you&#x27;re looking for a good brush that is better than most you&#x27;ll pay for at this price, this is it!</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I was amazed how much gentler it is on not only wet hair, but dry as well. It really gets tangles out fast!</li>
    <li> I love this brush I ordered one for me and my daughter and granddaughter We all have very thick hair which is hard to brush when wet this brush makes it so easy to do I have spent a lot of money on exspesive brushes that dont work half as well I defently would buy this brush again well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I heard about this brush from a friend and decided to try it. At almost forty, I&#x27;m old-school in taking care of my long hair - brush it at night when it&#x27;s dry, comb it out in the morning when it&#x27;s wet. Never brush wet hair. But this brush changed all that. It&#x27;s easy to get it through my long wet hair and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m breaking it or pulling it out. It&#x27;s absolutely painless and effortless. I originally bought it for my daughter&#x27;s long hair, but now I&#x27;m buying 2 more, one for myself and one for after swimming. Oh, how I wish I had this brush when I was her age!</li>
    <li> Not only do I love this brush, but I purchased 4 more to give as gifts to my friends and family. Great job on making something amazing for women who have hair that is difficult to brush when wet or dry.  ++++</li>
    <li> You will love this brush. Doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull your hair out. My kids love it! This brush is definitely going on my list of favorite things!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I have very long (past the middle of my back) fine textured bleach blonde hair. It used to be that even if I brushed my hair before I washed it and used plenty of conditioner, clumps of hair would come out in my brush when I brushed it wet. With the Wet Brush, it just goes right through. I have no idea how it works, but it does! And it doesn&#x27;t hurt or rip out my hair at all. I wish I had this thing when I was little. But it definitely has prevented breakage for me, and my hair looks a lot better and healthier because of that. It doesn&#x27;t work when your hair is dry, though. I think it&#x27;s worth having two brushes, though, if one of them is this.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the very fast delivery of this excellent brush! I ordered one for each member of my household and we all just love this brush! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 brushes, 1 for my 5 year old daughter and 1 for me. We both have curly knotty hair. This brush works great on my extremely tangled and frizzy hair. I brushed each knot section by section and was able to have tangle free hair without pulling out tons of hair in the process. And no pain!! We also use this on my daughter and it seems to work well for her also. There are less tears, yelling and pulling away. It used to be she wouldn&#x27;t even let me get near her with a brush and now she can handle me brushing her hair and lately she has even been brushing it herself and getting her own knots out. I hightly recommend this brush to anyone who has tangled, knotty hair.</li>
    <li> We liked this brush so much we bought half a dozen more. (We have a teen and they tend to disappear...)</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. I have one in every bathroom and one in every bedroom of the house.  I have two daughters with long thick hair and this is the only way to brush through it without screaming and drama.  Couldn&#x27;t live without them.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I was skeptical at how well it would work with wet tangled hair, but I fell in love with it the first time I used it. I work at a pool, so my hair is constantly getting tangled and always seems to be wet and this brush was able to go through it all. I have never used something that goes through and manages wet hair so easily (and yes, I own a collection of wide-toothed combs). It sounds too good to be true, but it really is amazing.     I heard about this brush in one of my fitness magazines, and that is what made me want to try it out. It works on both wet and dry hair, and I do not feel like I am constantly yanking the brush through my hair.     Also, the company was very helpful. I had an issue with my order and they responded quickly and reshipped my brush the next day.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this brush to me for my daughter who has long curly hair.  Before using this brush, it was very unpleasant to comb through her hair after washing it.  Now that we have this brush, it is no longer a chore to brush through her hair.  We purchased one for grandma&#x27;s house and I bought one for myself.  It&#x27;s great!  No more whining, pulling, or tangles.  I would highly recommend for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  I have long hair that when wet brings tears to my eyes to run a brush through it.  After reading the reviews on this brush, I decided to give it a try.  This brush is great and goes through my tangles with ease.  The seller was fast at shipping and I received excellent service.</li>
    <li> I should really post a video review of me using the brush so you can see how terrible it is, but I&#x27;m not home at the moment.  I bought this brush based on the fabulous reviews, and was immediately disappointed. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t really hurt, but it&#x27;s also not very effective at detangling. By the time I can get it through my hair with ease it&#x27;s already ripped and broken a ton of hair. Because it&#x27;s breaking my hair, I&#x27;m getting even MORE knots.  Even though I recently bought this, I&#x27;m now in the market for a better brush. This one is too frustrating and makes my hair frizzy from the breakage. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with a brush before, but it&#x27;s enough to make me write a review.</li>
    <li> My four year old daughter has very very fine, straight and long hair. Lately her hair has been getting a big rats nest in the back every morning after sleeping. This brush really is a miracle brush! It makes combing so much easier, and doesn&#x27;t hurt her head. It also makes her hair look very pretty!</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick wavy hair with so many tangles! This is the only brush that I can use on her that doesn&#x27;t hurt plus it gets the tangles and knots out fast! Her hair has never looked better! Plus I don&#x27;t have to fight with her to brush her hair, she actually likes it!! I have tried 2 different brushes that were specially made for tangles, neither worked. Highly recommend this brush to everyone no matter what hair type! It even works on my super curly thick tangled hair! Another life saver is it&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner!</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush is INCREDIBLE! I have been plagued by tangled, very fine hair my entire life. I still use a de-tangler after showering, but this brush cuts the time in half that it takes me to work through it. I have purchased 3 brushes now in the past 2 years... They are not made to last but they are inexpensive and highly valuable. Eventually, the nubs on the end of each bristle will wear off, allowing the brush to become rough - a small price to pay to brush my hair without any pain. I will warn that my hairdresser reminded me to never use while blow drying - just to brush through wet hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush!!!!!! It brushes my thick, wavy hair ( very tangly) with ease! I&#x27;m very tender headed and have gone through lots of different detanglers that made my hair oily and sticky. with this brush i can brush it wet or dry with no detangler! will defenitly be buying more! VERY HAPPY!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! Even my husband starts to use this brush now. No hurting, no struggling with the tangled hair any more. Thank you so much, Wet brush!</li>
    <li> I accidentally ruined my last WetBrush that I received in a subscription box service, so I knew I immediately needed to replace it!  This is hands-down the best detangling brush on the market today.  No tug, no pull, no gimmicks.  It just works!  The company i bought it from doesn&#x27;t let you select a color, you just receive at random.  I used to have the pink one (hoping for teal) but I received the black one which is completely fine!  When I use this brush just after the shower, I feel like I am brushing normally, but then I try to use a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hairbrush and every knot and strand of hair is being tugged and caught.  You can definitely tell the difference once you compare to a normal brush otherwise sometimes I forget that I even have knots and tangles because it works so well!!</li>
    <li> hate it pulls all my hair out, even worse when wet. would not suggest for fine haired curlies</li>
    <li> Great product. Perfect for long hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! It doesn&#x27;t pull or catch at all. My daughter loves it. My mom tried it and I had to get her one too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush....granddaughters say it doesn&#x27;t pull their hair like many others. &#x27;Nuff said</li>
    <li> My husband has a thick, coarse beard that tore bristles from brushes and teeth from combs until he got this brush. Now he can brush it easily, wet or dry, and his beard is more luxurious for it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This Wet Brush is amazing!  Daughter has shoulder length hair and always struggled with tangles.  She can now brush her own hair with ease while wet!!  Hair stylist recommended this product and it is well worth the money. Great for wet hair out of the pool too.</li>
    <li> This brush is a life saver for me. I am past 70 and am l&#x27;m loosing my hair and don&#x27;t need to loose anymore with tangles in my long hair. It works great on both dry and wet hair. I like it so much that I bought 3 more as Xmas gifts.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair that tangles easily. I have to brush it before washing, comb it in the shower with conditioner and spend an hour trying to brush it before blow drying. I recently went to a salon where they used the &#x27;WET BRUSH\\&quot; on my hair. It has changed my life. I paid $10 for the brush, but would have paid $100. The brush easily detangles my hair with little effort and no pain.</li>
    <li> Anyone with longer hair needs this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING. My hair is always getting tangled because I wear it up a lot and often sleep with my hair up. It can get some really terrible tangles underneath my messy bun. My hair is really long (down to my butt). This brush makes it so that it is not painful and works really well on both dry and wet hair. I even used it on my sons VERY curly hair as he is mixed race and only 3 and he will not cry or complain when I am brushing his hair. Paired with it&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner makes it even that much easier for us!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  Pulls through my hair smoothly every time.  If there is a knot, it just seems to bounce over it instead of ripping it out like all other brushes.  You will not be disappointed.  Ordered another one for my wife.  Going to buy the little one for travel.  Love this brush.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this brush. Therefore, I ordered 4 times in the past a year or two, hoping to have different colors. However, I got 2 blue and 2 black.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical about this brush working wonders because my hair is a nightmare! I have really long, medium-fine hair, but my hair is thick. The texture is wavy and it tangles within 5 minutes of brushing it. I HATE washing it for the sole reason of having to try to brush it out. I decided to try this brush after my hairdresser used it on me. I LOVE IT. I use it in conjunction with my normal paddle brush. I use the wet brush first to get out crazy tangles and to brush it completely, then I use my paddle brush to get the remaining knots out and underlying knots out. Using the wet brush with my paddle brush has cut my hair brushing time in half. I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very long and rather thick hair but it&#x27;s oily so over conditioning to deal with tangles just makes my hair look dirty. I&#x27;ve had the same issues with detangling spray and pretty much everything else I&#x27;ve tried. I also don&#x27;t like a lot of product in my hair so this brush has been ideal. I use it in the shower to comb through conditioner and I use it after my shower to brush out the tangles. Works great and I would recommend it to anyone who has issues with tangled hair.</li>
    <li> Seriously?!?! This is like night and day.  No kidding, I can&#x27;t believe I could actually brush  my daughter&#x27;s hair, wet, dry, I could blow it dry and style it...and we&#x27;re still on speaking terms.  My girl has a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine...and it tangles just by looking at it hard, and tears and screams and hatred were always the result of any attempt to brush.  So I kind of gave up.  My daughter typically went to school a little tousled looking.  My hair stylist casually mentioned the Wet Brush, I read some reviews... decided I could afford to take a chance for $7.  The BEST $7 I&#x27;ve ever spent in my life.  I&#x27;m thinking about buying stock in this company.  It&#x27;s a miracle for our family. If you have hair brushing problems with your child and you decide not to buy this brush, you&#x27;re just asking for pain and heartache.</li>
    <li> I have a suspicion that this brush may be the cause of recent breakage I&#x27;ve been experiencing. I would encourage those that love it, because I agree it works wonders on detangling hair, to try and notice if they have frizz or breakage where they may have not before. Just a thought. After seeing a few other reviewers mention this I am going to stop using it for a couple months and maybe I will update then if I&#x27;ve seen an improvement.</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush is awesome!  I no longer feel like I am damaging my hair when using this brush.  It combs easily and smoothly through WET and DRY hair!  My little girl is loving it too, because I am no longer &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; her hair when I brush it.  Will definitely be telling my friends and family about this brush!</li>
    <li> This hair brush really detangles wet hair.  I have a young swimmer with long hair and when she gets out of the pool, it is a real mess.  With this brush, we have no more tears!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for brushing my 3-year old&#x27;s long, curly hair after bath time.  She says it hurts way less and there are significantly less tears.  I wish I would have bought one sooner!</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite brush. I originally bought one for my daughter due to a friend&#x27;s recommendation. It worked so well and she liked it so much that I ordered one for every family member. It lasts about 2-3 years before the covered ends start falling off. My daughter and I have long, thick hair which contributes to faster wear. My son &amp; husband are able to keep their&#x27;s longer.</li>
    <li> As the owner of curly, waist-length hair, this brush was wonderful. When chemo made my hair start falling out, and every strand was precious, it became my best friend. Now that I have short hair, I still adore it, and my 7 year old hardly screams at all when I brush her birds nest ;)</li>
    <li> This brush is really great for wet hair.  I didn&#x27;t think it could really work/not tear my hair out.  It&#x27;s awesome.  I want to order another to try on my dogs.</li>
    <li> I ordered a few brushes and combs for my longish curly, thin, weak hair at the same time. I didn&#x27;t think i was going to open this one until I needed to wash mousse out of my hair in the shower. (I&#x27;ve gone shampoo-free, so this is more complicated than it sounds.) I needed a brush I could take into the shower with me to be sure the mousse was completely out. I was surprised at how easily these soft but strong bristles moved through my hair. I have used it on my wet and drenched hair a couple of times now, and am quite pleased!</li>
    <li> This brush is smooth as silk on wet hair!  Not sure what the technology is, but I have no hesitation brushing out my daughter&#x27;s hair after bathtime with this brush. It glides through the hair and tangles.  I&#x27;m getting another one for me!  I just wish I could pick the color.</li>
    <li> As a time-saver, I often put my long hair in bun while it&#x27;s still wet. This can be tricky, because I&#x27;m brushing \\&quot;against the grain.\\&quot; However, the wet brush is quite simply the best brush for this. It goes through my long, wet hair significantly easier and smoother than any other brush I&#x27;ve owned, with less hair-breakage too. This brush is also great when I&#x27;m just brushing out my hair for any reason, whether wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third-grader also loves the wet brush, and he has short hair, so it&#x27;s good for the whole family. Hmmm...maybe I should buy him his own so we don&#x27;t fight over it. Oh yeah, and one for my husband too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already looking toward Christmas, so I can buy these as stocking-stuffers for friends and family, especially those with long hair. This brush is THAT nice.</li>
    <li> Would definitely buy more!! Never again do I have to chase my 3 year old around to brush her hair! I also have very thick hair and hate using too much conditioner in shower and spent a lot of money on detangler sprays. Now I can brush my hair without pain after a shower and stop buying those leave in sprays! I will be giving this as gift to my gfs who have baby girls!! Great great brush!!</li>
    <li> I got this brush to use with my daughter.  She hates to have her hair brushed, wet, dry it doesn&#x27;t matter.  This brush works like magic.  As long as it is wet like it says there are no issues.  I am ordering a few more for backups since I cannot live without it anymore.</li>
    <li> I have kinda curly longggg blond hair, works REALLY well. I get really upset when i can&#x27;t find it and have to use my \\&quot;other\\&quot; brush.</li>
    <li> I do have to say this brush does make it easier to go threw my granddaughter hair, My daughter also tried it and wants one</li>
    <li> I have long hair, right about to my waist. It&#x27;s fine (although I braid it often, so it feels coarser and thicker once I unbraid it), but once it gets this long, it tangles easily and often, even though I use more conditioner and try different ones as well, inclduing ones claiming to detangle. I can&#x27;t comb through my hair, no comb can handle it, so I need a brush. Wet or dry, detangling it is always painful, I have to go through small sections at a time and hold my hair away from my scalp to avoid pulling and pain.   I bought this brush and also Tangle Teezer, hoping one or the other would help. I am seriously shocked at how well this brush works. I can run this through my hair, wet or dry, and about 90% of the time there&#x27;s no snagging or pulling at all, just glides right through and detangles perfectly. Occasionally I do have to work a section more carefully, but it takes much less time than before, and more importantly, it&#x27;s not painful the way it was before.   Tangle Teezer is also good, but I prefer the Wet Brush because it has the traditional handle, which I like and is more comfortable for me to use. As a bonus, they sent me the brush in purple, my favorite color, but for this kind of effectiveness, I would gladly have taken any color they make.   Seriously, Wet Brush makers, whoever you are, THANK YOU!!! In the past, I&#x27;ve always cut my hair when it got this long, because I couldn&#x27;t deal with the tangles anymore. Now I can leave it long if I like, and brushing my hair is no longer a (literal) pain. BEST BRUSH EVER!!!</li>
    <li> Great brush. I got one for me and one for my family. I use it on both wet and dry hair. My hair tangles and this works right through it. I am sold on this brush and will have to buy another one when or if this one wears out!</li>
    <li> I have two daughters who have very long slightly wavy hair.  I needed something that would work out their tangles.  You know the kind of tangles they get from bed-head, using pony-tails, wearing hats, and flipping their hair in and out of their jackets.  It worked wonders on my youngest daughter&#x27;s hair and she is so so pleased with it that she takes it into the shower with her and brushes by herself.  We&#x27;ve had lots of brushes and, for her, this is the best brush.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well with my older daughter&#x27;s hair, which is slightly finer and silkier than my youngest daughter&#x27;s.  I find the brush bristles bend too easily to get any of her tough hair tangles out.  Granted, it didn&#x27;t pull her hair or hurt her either, but it took a longer time to work the snarls out.  It works great on my own medium length curly/wavy hair.  I think it all depends on your hair type if this works for you or not.</li>
    <li> Glad that they sent me purple but that is all I like about. First of all, the impression I got from the description is that I could use it in the shower. But I don&#x27;t think you can, on the BACK of the package it says use right AFTER the shower. Secondly, the bristles are short and thin. And that is probably the only kind of hair it works on - short and thin. It will probably work great a little girls hair too. I think I&#x27;m going to give it to my niece since I cannot use it at all. Glad it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;end stubs\\&quot; of the bristles (the part of the bristle that bends back up through the rubber pad and are cut sharp-short) hang up and pull the hair strands; too much hair breaking.  I&#x27;ve seen this \\&quot;lock-off\\&quot; technique before; wish I had known.  Only tried it once; doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better at \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; than the large-teeth plastic combs. Shape is nice.</li>
    <li> We have purchased several Wet Brushes. I love these brushes with the exception of...after a short time...some of the bristles pushing down into the base of the brush head. It&#x27;s extremely frustrating to have to pull all the bristles up only to have them end up quickly getting pushed back down again while brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair. I have not contacted the manufacturer yet but plan to do so since this has happened with more than just one of the wet brushes. Otherwise...they are great especially for long fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
    <li> This brush has changed my life. Before I bought this I had kinky brunette hair.  No one would talk to me and I was afraid to go out of the house because I was embarrassed by the state of my hair.  I sat inside and just stared at a mirror wishing that I had better hair. Then I saw this brush and I was instantly attracted to it&#x27;s color and I mean it hangs in the shower that&#x27;s a game changer!! I ordered it over night because I knew that I needed it right away. I was not disappointed. My life has become so much better now that I have this brush. My hair is now knot free, smooth, and a beautiful golden blonde. I can&#x27;t stop touching it and neither can the boys. I&#x27;ve been going on so many dates because of this brush. It really has made me so happy and I wouldn&#x27;t want any other brush. EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS BRUSH!!!! It really is the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made and I don&#x27;t want to think about how my life would be without it.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush really is \\&quot;The Wet Brush.\\&quot; I have very curly hair, and brushing it while it was wet was a pain, yet leaving it to dry before brushing it out would make me look like I just got electrocuted. This hairbrush works wonders! It doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair, but rather brush it. There is no pain, and it takes just seconds to brush the hair out completely! Strongly advise on buying it, especially those with curly hair like mine!</li>
    <li> I paid $12 for one of these brushes at a local salon, after using it we were hooked.  This brush doesn&#x27;t pull hair, gets out tangles with no tears!  I came to Amazon and found these for $6 and some odd cents....ordered 5 more!  Put one in every bathroom in our house and had an extra for a friend with small children.  I asked her how her kids liked the brush and she said \\&quot;That thing is a miracle!\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t know how it works, I just know it does work!!!!</li>
    <li> It really works!&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of fine hair and it always tangles up. I usually use a wide comb in the shower and deal with lots of snarls and tangles. With this, it just brushes out with no pain and face squinting ... note that if you have a lot of hair you should separate it  as the bottom layer of hair doesn&#x27;t get brushed when you brush from the top.. so I find myself doing the top layer of hair.. and then going back and doing the bottom separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my daughter (31months) as well..  it&#x27;s now called the &amp;#34;magic brush&amp;#34; because &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t hurt&amp;#34;. Her hair is almost to her bottom and it&#x27;s very fine and wavy/banana curls; it snarls up pretty good after a day or so so this brush has been a huge help in brushing her hair. No more tears!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has beautiful long hair but at age 5, not real fond of letting me brush her hair to get the rats out.  This brush held tremendously!  Would recommend....works much better than a regular brush!</li>
    <li> Had this recommended to me and it has become my daughters favorite brush to use.  Our mornings are much easier.</li>
    <li> This brush is great on wet or dry hair.  Doesn&#x27;t pull so kids are happy.  I liked it so much, I bought one for me, too.</li>
    <li> I own a beauty shop and use this brush on my clients. I can&#x27;t believe the ease of combing out their hair now. Saves me time and my clients can&#x27;t believe how painless it is. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews I decided to try this. I have long,dry, curly hair and it gets all knotted up. It is slowly beginning to dread. Tried this brush and when I first used it I could hear the bristles going through my tangles. Made me think that it was getting through them and detangling them. But when I used a hard comb I realized that it wasn&#x27;t detangling them. What was happening was because the bristles were soft they were bending so it made it feel and appear that they were getting through my tangles! Sneaky!</li>
    <li> this brush is great for long or short hair. it doesn&#x27;t scratch your scalp no matter how thin or thick your hair is. it works great on wet or damp hair as well as dry hair. it&#x27;s by far the best hairbrush i&#x27;ve ever used and it&#x27;s at a great cost! this brush is $20 at professional hair salons so i really feel like i got a deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to rate down because I ended up with the yellow brush (which is a horrid color), but I can&#x27;t because this brush is actually phenomenal. I have fine hair that tangles easily. I also brush immediately after the shower. Typically this involves copious amounts of a detangling spray and still I end up with a brush full of hair. This brush changed that. I still do a couple sprays of detangling spray and then brush my hair easily--no pulling and no brush full of hair afterwards. It&#x27;s a great find!</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for my 8 year old daughter who has very long hair that tangles easily. I purchased another &amp;#34;detangler&amp;#34; brush before this one and what a difference! I thought the other one worked well but there is no comparison. The Wet Brush by far is the best we have used yet! No more yelling &amp;#34;you&#x27;re hurting me&amp;#34;. Im actually going to buy another one to keep downstairs.</li>
    <li> I have 2 daughters, 1 has long very curly (ringlet type)hair and 1 has long  wavy hair. This brush works great on both. Use it right out of the shower and it makes detangling a dream. I don&#x27;t even need detangling spray anymore. You do need to make a final run through with a comb because it doesn&#x27;t 100% of the tangles out, but about 95% and it makes for a scream/whine free time. You need this brush!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Makes my hair look like a movie star.</li>
    <li> I still cannot believe this brush. It is insane how it removed the tangles from my daughters head, wet or dry. Seriously. Best. Brush. Ever. My daughter is 13 and every time I asked her to brush her long curly hair she would cry. Every time. I get it, my hair is hard to tame and brush and it hurts, but no more! I can get through her hair so fast and get all the tangles and not get a single tear! Amazing!!! I&#x27;ve been using this brush on her for several months now and haven&#x27;t lost a single bristle yet.</li>
    <li> Not exactly a miracle brush but this is definitely better than a conventional hair brush for my four year old who always complains about the daily torture of hair brushing.  Smelly plastic, material on the cheaper side.</li>
    <li> Wish I could have picked my color. This is a great hair brush, it doesn&#x27;t pull and it easily brushes through my long, fine hair.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist mentioned how great this brush worked for her nieces who have long tangly hair so I searched on Amazon and figured \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;. Between my daughter and I we have no less than 10 different kinds of hair brushes and combs and picks for our long, unusually thick, and natural wavy hair. Every one if them pull and hurt. My daughter flat out refused to brush or comb her hair at all and ended up with dreadlock-ish mats and knots which would take me an hour to untangle. Then I bought this brush...Thank you oh hair Gods!!! It is absolutely amazing. My daughter now brushes her hair by herself and beams when she gets complimented on how beautiful and shiny her hair is. I love it so much all the other brushes have ended up as grooming tools for the dog or horses. In fact, I may have to get another for the horses, it works that great through snarls and tangles wet or dry. Don&#x27;t debate, don&#x27;t delay, get this brush! You will love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is an absolute lifesaver for combing my preschooler&#x27;s hair! I wish I would have heard about it years ago. She has curly Shirley Temple hair and bath time/hair brushing time was a complete nightmare. This amazing brush makes it 20x easier to get through her hair!</li>
    <li> Anything to make fixing my three little girl&#x27;s hair easier I&#x27;ll buy! This was a good buy. Not a miracle worker, but helps for sure. The flexible bristles give when going through tangles on wet and dry hair. Nice and smooth for drying too!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hairbrush EVER! I am amazed at how easily it brushes through tangles. No more crying or fussing from my little ones. I no longer use a \\&quot;de-tangler\\&quot; spray, just a few strokes through hair and you are done! I love this brush!</li>
    <li> Amazing product for me and my kids.  Love, love, love.  I have 5!</li>
    <li> Even though I was fully aware of the positive reviews, I was still stunned/thrilled when I got to use it on my wet hair.  Incredible. No more serious hair loss. So easy. Just WOW.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly, thick hair so to have a brush that doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out is great.  The color is cute and Iove how gentle it is.</li>
    <li> For the low price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this brush is a wonder!  It is gentle on the hair (medium thickness) and only takes a few minutes to brush out shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as well on dry hair as it does wet hair.  I&#x27;m not sure why the call it the &amp;#34;Wet...Shower Brush&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the Detangling Brush, the squirrels have been evicted from their nests! :)</li>
    <li> Hands down the best brush I have ever used.  Bought for my 5 year old who hates having her hair brushed.  Wanted to take a pic of her using it on her own the first night.  This has helped so much.  There are no more tears and arguments about brushing her hair.  My oldest son who has think longer hair has asked me to get him one too.</li>
    <li> This is a nice detangling brush for after washing your hair. Won&#x27;t get out the tough tangles but loosens them up for a regular brush. I would recommend it. Soft bristles make it nice for getting out tangles without pulling out hair out harshly.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! My daughter half Hispanic and half Black, and her hair is thick and gets very tangled. Brushing her hair has always been a challenge until we got this brush. She actually looks forward to brushing her hair and actually does a GREAT job, thanks to this brush. The one and only negative remark I can make about the brush is that while the bristles are very flexible, they feel a little rough when they come in contact with the scalp, forehead, back of the neck, etc., so you have to be careful not to scratch yourself when using it. But, that wouldn&#x27;t keep me from buying more of these brushes. I think I&#x27;ve found our forever brush! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The best brush EVER. The girls in my family have fine hair that tangles easily. This brush gets through the tangles with ease. Cannot wait to see the long term effects of less hair breakage due to brushing. I will be buying more to give to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Not good in the shower at all</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my curly hair! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have three granddaughters, each with different textures of hair from straight to curly and this brush worked well on all of them..  Their was no more crying from the one who has very fine curly hair.  One has extremely thick wavy hair and she was very pleased with the brush.  The other two have straight hair and they were pleased as well.  Their mother was also pleased with the brush, the way it handled and got out the tangles.</li>
    <li> Love love love love!!! I have long extremely easily tangled hair and this brush works like a charm when used as directed. My husband with thick hair even likes to use it bc he thinks it feels good! Awesome find!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but the wet brush is worth one! I have waist long, medium thickness, curly/wavy hair. I got this brush from target and it is AMAZING! I used to have to comb my hair while in the shower after letting conditioner sit in it because it got ridiculously tangled extremely easily. I have been fighting with my hair for years and I got to the point where I was brushing so hard I would rip my hair out because I wanted to get it over with. This was so damaging not to mention painful! Since I started using this brush I no longer have to even comb my hair with conditioner and I don&#x27;t need to use any leave in conditioner either. This brush WORKS WONDERS and is almost PAINLESS! This is probably the best hair purchase I have ever made! I LOVE this brush!</li>
    <li> Really does work on wet hair. Not so impressive on dry hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the tangles, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to complain as much about brushing her hair now.</li>
    <li> Purchased another for travel since I had one at home that I loved already. This one seems to be legit but it smells horrible. Even a week later after using and after washing it with hot water and soap it still smells terrible. If the smell goes away I will bump it to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a miracle brush! And for the price you can&#x27;t pass this up. I have long, thick hair and my hair is always so tangled after I wash it, but the wet brush seems to glide right through my hair without a problem! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Really wish I  would have found this brush sooner. I did not know they even existed.  I have to spend more time in bed than most people, due to health concerns and awaiting surgeries and it is hard on my hair.  My long, blonde, very fine hair gets matted quickly, even though I pull it up.  After I wash it, its is a nightmare, despite the &#x27;no tangle&#x27; products I use on it.  It was very thick... but now, it is not.  My arms hurt from trying to brush the tangles out.  I get impatient and try and hurry, thus, losing lots of hair.  I have literally lost half my hair I have been growing for ten years and am so sad about that.  I had considered cutting it all off before I found this.  I love the rubberized handle as it is easier for me to hold on to when my hands get wet while brushing wet hair.  This brush is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold to me, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased another type of &#x27;no tangle&#x27; brush on Amazon which is all plastic kind of kidney shaped one,  all one piece, without a handle on it.  It works the same, as well, and although it might last longer,  I like having the handle on it.  It is easier on my hands.  With these brushes,  I can actually feel the bristles against my scalp when I brush my hair and I couldn&#x27;t before.  That is nice as it feels so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think of no negatives about this brush.  Just hurry and get one before you lose anymore hair!</li>
    <li> I have heard rave reviews about this and have tried other options for my 3 year old daughter without huge success, so I bought this.  honestly, this is no better.  it is a good brush, but I do not think it is much different than several of the other detangling brushes on the market.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself - I have long, fine, color-treated hair.  I had to use LOTS of leave-in conditioner &amp; detangler before, with this brush I still use some product, but MUCH less.  It also works great on my three-year son&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> painful to use, defeats purpose of a detangling brush.</li>
    <li> I love!!! this brush I have really curly hair and with this brush I have been able to detangle my hair in no time. I swear the brush just goes thru your hair like nothing. Very smooth and I barely lose/leave hair on the brush.</li>
    <li> My niece with fine hair loves this! Only one that worked!</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this product in search of something that will de-tangle my natural thick, curly and coarse hair. When I received this product; it had a strand of blonde hair in it and the packaging was stapled down as if the product was used prior. I ordered it as a new product but that&#x27;s neither here or there. The &amp;#34;WET&amp;#34; brush does what it is suppose to do and then some. This brush went through my hair like butter; no stops, very very few snags and frizz free de-tangling when used on my hair (wet and dry). I discovered that the snags were cause by the manufacturing of the bristles within the brush. It looked like the bristles were bent and stuffed into the padding of the brush; like bending a drinking straw to fit into a small test tube. Since using it; some of the bristles on the brush became pushed down into the padding of brush. When used on my mothers hair which is very thin, curly and coarse due to health reasons. When I used this on my mothers hair (wet and dry); the product de-tangled very well but left a bit of frizz and some snagging of the hair along the way. The only downfall is that the WET brush doesn&#x27;t smooth the hair; it might create little to no frizz but that differs from the type and grade of hair YOU have. This brush is truly meant for de-tangling and NOT for styling purposes; i&#x27;d recommend a Denman 8 row brush for styling. Overall I give this product a 4/5 star rating for that the product needs a better, more sturdy manufacturing; other than that i&#x27;d recommend it to all members of a family; it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I have crazy, often dry and kinky hair, and this brush neither breaks it nor rips it whole from my scalp, which is nice (and this holds true whether it&#x27;s wet or dry). I&#x27;m not sure what makes this better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used, but it is; the bristles are noticeably thin and flexible, so that might be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, it works.</li>
    <li> Love love love. Gentle on hair and really combs it out well. I think it has decreased my hair breaking. Recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
    <li> I just wanted a brush. Wasn&#x27;t looking for anything special, just a basic brush to do the job after too many bristles kept breaking off my old brush. It works best on wet hair, but it does okay on my fine blond hair while dry too. I haven&#x27;t used it in the dead of winter yet, but I have a feeling it would create a lot of static. I notice it a little right now and it&#x27;s been pretty wet out lately. Either way it&#x27;s a nice brush and doesn&#x27;t tug on my hair too much or cause pain when I use it. I do have a sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t rip out as much hair and is much nicer with wet hair than a traditional brush.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that is very snarly after I wash it.  I was hoping this would be some kind of a miracle brush after reading all the good reviews, but unfortunately I feel like it stretches my hair shafts out causing all sorts of damage as it goes.  The search continues.</li>
    <li> Very good brush eliminates all tangles easy.........highly recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this for the kids, love it so much i need one for me now. Very thin bristles make detangling easy and it feels great on the scalp!</li>
    <li> I love the wet brush!!!  It was recommended to me after getting hair extensions but I would use it no matter what!  It detangles easily and efficiently without pulling or tugging.  I imagine this would be great for little girls with long hair.  It&#x27;s the only brush I&#x27;ll be using for awhile!  Very gentle.</li>
    <li> I used the same paddle-style brush for over 10 years until it finally disintegrated. Based on reviews, I bought this hoping for the same level of use and durability. However, this does not smoothly detangle my hair and it has been aggravating the psoriasis on my scalp. Additionally, the plastic/rubber covering on the bristles has completely rubbed off after only 6 months and makes brushing a painful experience. Now I need a new brush and I am not happy with this experience.</li>
    <li> We have a few, now.  Our daughters hair is ultra long, and she always cries about brushing.  This brush, combined with a detangler or spray conditioner, has GREATLY reduced anxiety when it&#x27;s time for me to brush her hair.  I haven&#x27;t had a better brush than this one.  My kids grandma agrees (she likes to brush their hair too, and put it in nice ribbons), and so I bought one to leave at her house, as well.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!! After reading the father&#x27;s review....had to have it! My daughter seen this in use at the beauty salon.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but decided to try.  I have waist length hair and trying to comb my wet hair was a trial.  I would routinely rip out a brush full of hair.  This brush easily slides through my wet hair.  My daughter and grand-son who have kinky hair also love it.  It also works great on dry hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, thick hair and said it works very well.  Looks like a regular brush but it really works for her!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this brush in \\&quot;for a cure\\&quot; version. This brush does its job, it detangles hair well. However, I noticed that it&#x27;s not made in the best quality, Some of the rubber balls that coat the bristles are not doing its job, revealing the sharp bristles which can scratch the scalps. The paint was kind of chipping off.. i wish it was made in a higher quality. also, i wish it came in lighter colors.</li>
    <li> Received two brushes as ordered.  Delivery was prompt and accurate.  Packaging was adequate.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is severely handicapped and has beautiful, long, thick hair.  Brushing her hair was always quite painful before but with this brush she tolerates it very well.  It takes a little longer to work out the big tangles but to do it without pain is worth the extra bit of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and recommend this brush to anyone who struggles with brushing wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush that my two daughters will use.  They both have wavy hair and are prone to tangles.  This brush takes care of the tangles painlessly and smoothly.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST detangling hairbrush ever!  It really was amazing to see how easily, quickly and gently it works and how pleasant it is to use.  I initially bought two... one for my adult daughter who has long hair, and one to keep here for when she visits so I can brush her hair.  We were both so impressed that I bought several more for Christmas gifts for her friends with long hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when hair is wet, it is extremely important to be as gentle as possible when detangling it, or the hair will stretch, weaken, split and break... Detangling with a different comb or brush can be very painful, especially for children or anyone with conditions such as fibromyalgia.  This brush is so gentle and works so quickly that it is nothing short of amazing to me.</li>
    <li> I have curly a African american hair type that tangles soo easily. I wet my hair in the shower, used this brush, and it started to detangle my hair, and soon combed right through! It&#x27;s a pretty good brush.</li>
    <li> This is a must for anybody who has a little girl with long hair and you have to argue about brushing it. Also great for big girls with fine hair that tangles easy, like me. The only reason for  4 instead of 5 stars? The little ball-tip thingies tend to fall off and it will have to be replaced. I just wish I knew about this when my kids were little, or when I was little!!!</li>
    <li> I read the glowing reviews and thought this was the brush that was going to work perfectly on my thick, wavy, midlength hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is meh...ok. The bristles are very thin and not strong. I imagine that they will break soon. It does seem to de-tangle hair quite well without ripping the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fabric where the bristles come out of gets wet in the shower, and takes a long time to dry out - not what I would think would be a good thing for a brush claiming to be a good wet brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a series of brushes that are all the same brush here on Amazon - I purchased several at the same time, and they are identical except for the branding.</li>
    <li> Both of my girls have long thick hair and my granddaughter has fine hair. This brush really helps in brushing through the tangles without pulling out the hair.</li>
    <li> I only gave 3 stars because I ordered 4 of them and 3 of them are black. Would have thought they could mix the colors up a little bit. Will give as gifts at Christmas, so can&#x27;t rate whether or not they work.</li>
    <li> the bristles on this brush are extremely harsh, if you run it along your arm, for instance, using moderate pressure, slightly raised, red welts will appear. i really don&#x27;t want to be causing abrasions to my scalp, as that can lead to dandruff. gross. also, the brush detangles well..to a point. when i use it closer to the roots of my hair, it really does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Ok, this brush is awesome!  I first saw it at a boutique by my house for $21.99 !  And I bought 2 for $15.00 on Amazon...  My hair is long and fine and it gets terribly tangled, especially after washing and even after conditioning.  I would spend alot of time detangling my hair..but no more!   This wet brush makes it a breeze to detangle my hair!  Buy one (or two) you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my wife. She loves it, she says that she can brush through her hair so much easier now and she has less hair pulling off with the brush than she did before.</li>
    <li> This does go easily through your hair but it definitely leaves hair with snarls.</li>
    <li> I love the softness of its bristles! makes combing an instant massage!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive my brush. I have long blonde curly hair that tangles quite a bit. The brush did not hurt  much, however it doesn&#x27;t untangle the knots, but simply go through the tangles without removing them.</li>
    <li> Love this new brush.  I use it everyday .  I have very tangly hair and it brushes through without damaging and is painless.  This brush will help keep my hair healthy for sure unlike other brushes that can cause lots of breakage to my blonde hair</li>
    <li> Did not like... To flimsy</li>
    <li> Oooooh let me count the ways in which I LOVE my Wet Brush.  Wait.......there are too may.  Let&#x27;s go with the Top 3.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I have long thick hair&lt;br /&gt;1. I can now brush my hair wet without grimacing, squeezing my eyes shut, tearing through my hair.  Did you hear that people?  I CAN BRUSH MY HAIR WET!  Imagine that!&lt;br /&gt;2.  I am no longer breaking my hair by tugging and pulling those darn tangles out&lt;br /&gt;3.  My kid isn&#x27;t screaming at me while I pull and tug her tangles out either. My life has gotten easier and I no longer use No More Tangles on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this brush and have bought numerous more for gifts for friends and family!</li>
    <li> Only brush my daughter doesn&#x27;t cry with..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter with curly blonde hair that was always getting tangled and leading to tears anytime we tried to comb it out.  Now, we comb it out after her bath, and within seconds we are finished with no tears!</li>
    <li> This brush works way better than I even thought it would. Ilan to buy another one to travel with. The handle is not too big so it would be good for kids too.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly long hair and have always had an issue with it getting itself all wrapped up when I am sleeping. It often results in a giant clump on the back of my head, making it both difficult to reach and difficult to see. That has always made getting the tangles out quite a chore. I first noticed this product upon the &#x27;Related Items&#x27; section on Amazon while looking at detangling sprays and figured why not. More importantly, I was intrigued as to how this product could work, it looked just like any other paddle brush. Frankly, it sounded more like a gimmick than a legitimate product.  After using it for a few days, I think I know why.  The bristles are a bit longer, softer, and more flexible than that of most brushes. I suspect that is the key. When each bristle hits the tangle, it moves towards where the hair itself is headed versus forcing the hair to where the bristles are. This would result in moving the tangle down and slowly causing the clump to dissipate without tying it further into a knot like a regular brush or comb might. It might seem slow at first because of it, but the knot itself isn&#x27;t tightened and I think that&#x27;s more important than instant headway. Due to that key fact, the tangle in the end is easier to brush out, it has less kinks in it, and overall the process is much less painful.  I am very pleased with this purchase and would purchase more in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> My kids love these brushes because they do not hurt when their hair is tangled. I originally bought one for myself but when the kids tried it, they took it from me! We ended up buying several.</li>
    <li> painless and effective even on matted hair.</li>
    <li> Too soft bristles to make it through curly hair - just glides overtop</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. My two daughters who used to dislike combing now keep brushing their hair because \\&quot;with wet brush it is fun and painless\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first got the brush. I was actually amazed at how it goes through knots and tangles. The high reviews are actually accurate!</li>
    <li> All I can tell you is that my Girls always had a big problem brushing their hair out when wet. My kids have very sensitive heads. This brush works great and prevents any pain they use to have brushing out wet hair.</li>
    <li> This brush helps to detangle my fine wet hair, doesn&#x27;t snag or pull!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love it! But got in black and would prefer lighter color but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the actual detangling brush. In fact, it&#x27; s a waste of money and I bought 2, one for each of my daughters.  It can barely grab any of my oldest daughters thick hair and when it&#x27;s tangled and wet, forget about even trying this brush. It does absolutely NOTHING.</li>
    <li> My 5-year-old calls this her &amp;#34;Magic Brush.&amp;#34; She has medium-length, thin and tangly hair. We&#x27;ve had many painful hairbrushing sessions. I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it magic, but it does seem to hurt her less, and she even is using it herself, voluntarily, and doing a decent job. My only gripe is that you can&#x27;t choose the color. We ended up with blue. I know she would have preferred pink. :)</li>
    <li> This works better than expected. Makes getting ready in the morning a breeze.</li>
    <li> I bout one 2 yrs ago and love it. This is my 2nd one as a gift. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have waist long hair and every morning I would wake up with quite a few tangles i.e. messes. And it was painful and annoying detangling my &amp;#34;mess.&amp;#34; I have to say I was a bit skeptical ordering this brush but it really, really works. I am impressed. It works especially well after a bath or shower. Now it&#x27;s my go to brush for everything!</li>
    <li> the best brush for tangles.  I haven&#x27;t used detangler on my daughter&#x27;s hair since purchasing this brush.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Have a very weird chemical smell that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
    <li> I bought this for niece and she was so happy to brush her hair with out it hurting. She is 8 and was bragging to her mom she could brush her hair with out it hurting.</li>
    <li> Brush is great for thick knotted hair when used in wet hair or with detangling spray.  Use for my hair and the kids hair.</li>
    <li> I got this brush because of the wonderful reviews it got. I even saw a couple of ppl with the same hair type. I am black with very thick hair. I am 1 year natural and Im trying not to perm my hair. My hair tangles every time I wash it or take out my sew-in and it is very painful to comb my natural hair with a regular comb. With high hopes I got this, but I am completly let down. The brush is just too soft to acually sort through the madness that is my hair. Ill have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairbrush for detangling any type of hair. Originally, I bought it for myself after rave reviews at a salon. After using it for a week I purchased brushes for both of my girls, one with curly hair and one with thick, straight hair. This brushes is gentle on their hair and heads and has saved a ton of tears. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush 3 times so far, but it does manage to not tear at or break my hair after I wash it. I have no idea how it works, but it does. No more painful tangles! I was thinking about using this brush all the time, even if my hair isn&#x27;t wet, but I&#x27;m not sure if the magic pain-free juju will wear off after a certain amount of use...</li>
    <li> My daughter has long hair, and always had a problem brushing all the tangles out. And has a sensitive head. We heard about this brush from a friend&#x27;s mom. I ordered it here, it came in about 2 days, better than expected, and it REALLY WORKS!!!!! And it works both wet and dry. Highly recommend! Only criticism is that you can&#x27;t say which color you want.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for very thick, curly long hair. My 8 year old can get out tangles very easily all by herself. No more crying!</li>
    <li> My daughter has the most unruly hair you will ever see.  Very curly, very thick and extremely course.  Brushing with other brushes, broke her hair off causing it to look more frizzy and no product can tame this wild beast.  I bought 2 brushes because there was a GREAT deal on the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; one for $4!!!!!  Well, a pink one and a purple one came.....and to my surprise.....no wining when I brushed, no more breaking of the hair.  I can brush her hair when it&#x27;s dry (a major accomplishment) or in the shower. Her hair is starting to look soooo much better!  If you have a child with a tender head that complains about their hair being brushed, then this is the brush for YOU!  I use it myself and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like the brush is going through all your hair because the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t jab your head.  Until you look in the mirror and watch it go through you wouldn&#x27;t think it was working.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this brush!  Love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exellent! Amazing! I actually can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this brush. It was impossible to brush my hair without pain, but this brush is a dreamy solution. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works fine (I mean it is a brush)... but, I haven&#x27;t noticed that it  reduces tangles or anything??  I would not recommend this for that purpose... but, if you need a new brush, this will work!  :o)</li>
    <li> unlike any other brush. got this b/c it hurt to brush my hair that is getting long even after blow-drying. this brush really does what it claims. now can brush hair with no discomfort even if not completely dry. would&#x27;ve cut my hair short again without it!</li>
    <li> I have a super-sensitive head AND fine, curly hair that is prone to nasty snarls - not a good combo. I have always combed only in the shower with conditioner and running water, but it was still a painful experience every time. I can honestly say that this brush has changed my hair-care world. It glides through my hair painlessly, and gets every tangle out. My hair is pretty thick so sometimes it takes a few passes over an area to get all the knots out, but I could care less about a few extra brushstrokes because it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! I don&#x27;t end up with any extra frizz when i get out, either - if anything, I would say my hair is smoother when dry than before the wet brush came into my life.</li>
    <li> Works great. I could get all my tangles out quickly.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone with hair longer than a couple of inches!  Works great - - especially on wet hair, but even does a great job on dry hair.  Doesn&#x27;t pull like other brushes.</li>
    <li> My girls love this brush</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought this brush years ago! My daughter&#x27;s hair is fine and tangles easily, and brushing it, wet or dry, has always been awful. But this brush is amazing. It just glides through her wet hair. It works so much better than other brushes, even the fancy, specialty de-tangling brushes. I love it so much I bought a second one to keep downstairs.</li>
    <li> This really works great!!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever! it used to take me like 1h to detangle my hair, now it only takes me like 2min</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing just as most of the other reviewers suggested! I alternate between straightening and leaving my hair au natural, and it is the latter that really gets my hair tangled and knotted up. I usually spend about 15 minutes trying to untangle my hair with a regular brush, which usually ends up pulling out lots of clumps of hair and giving me a good arm workout. I was skeptical when I first saw this brush, as it seemed so flimsy, but it was able to really work through my hair and cut the untangling session in half. I am able to use this when my hair is dry and wet. When my hair is wet this gets through my hair with ease and when my hair is dry, I have to split in half and work through it in sections but again, it still goes through pretty easily. I really recommend this for the price is at (the Amazon price is also about a $1 cheaper than at Target)!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter with long hair, and she loves it.  It is the best brush we have ever purchased to take out tangles.  I would purchase this again and recommend to anyone, as her previous brushes she used would hurt and not work.  She thinks this is the best brush as her hair is extremely long. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My daughter has tight curly hair. I use this after a condition her hair and she never screams anymore. Yeah! The only con I have is that water gets inside it</li>
    <li> works great. gonna try to get another for my dog.</li>
    <li> the product its okay for daily use. The 3 starts review is because the picture is misleading because show 4 brushes but you will end receiving only one, and the fact you cant choose the color.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this product because I have a hard time brush through my hair when Its wet. Your hair is at its weakest when its wet and more prone to breakage if your ripping through it. This product works like a dream! I only wish that you were able to pick your color hair brush, they just send you a random color.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush!  No more crying from my daughter when she brushes her wet hair. A must have for sensitive heads.</li>
    <li> My only concern is that it might be more effective on hair that is not as thick as mine.  I have to section it a little for it to reach all the hair.  Otherwise, it is gentle on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has extremely coarse, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair combing time has been a tearfilled experience for years.  I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of combs and brushes to comb her hair and all kinds of other hair products to prevent knotting and soften her hair.  I&#x27;ve found a variety of things that work, but nothing has helped as much as this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still takes awhile to come her hair, but this is the first brush I&#x27;ve ever found that I can just run through her hair from top to bottom without her screaming in pain.  I used to have to start at the bottom of her hair and comb 2-3 inches at a time slowly going up.  It could take 20+ minutes to get her hair reasonably combed out and it was an awful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has probably cut that time down in half and cut the pain down tremendously.  I&#x27;ve bought a bunch of them to keep with me everywhere.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my teenage daughter who has really really curly hair. she&#x27;s been using it in the shower and she says she cant believe how great it works and the best brush she has ever used for her hair. great brush for the price!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I used to only use combs and I ended up pulling so much of my hair out that way. I now brush my hair with this before getting in the shower and after. Great buy! I only knocked it down a star because the finish on the handle is coming off. Minor, nothing big.</li>
    <li> I should start out by telling you what kind of hair I have.  I am Scottish, Irish,  and Dutch. My hair is is mid back length and THICK.  I don&#x27;t mean normal thick.. My hairdresser will actually clear 4 hours for me.  Sometimes she just has to started it and cut it because she doesn&#x27;t have time to wash comb and dry. Other hair stylists will gather around the washing station to watch as the tub over flows because she can&#x27;t lift all of my hair off of the drain for it empty the water. My hair also mats,  not knots.. Mats like a carpet or dog hair I usually spend over an hour and a half painstakingly unraveling mats with my fingers until I could run a brush through it.  Now that that&#x27;s out of the way I also have a extremely sensitive scalp brushes can make me cry and I have never gotten my hair cut without my eyes watering. I got this brush as a gift from my friend who is also a hairstylist and has seen my mess on my head.  This brush works my having softer more flexible bristles so when you run it through your hair,  rather than pulling through the knot it is more likely to give.  You just keep running it over your knot and it gently works through it just like your fingers.  I am in LOVE  with this brush. I will never go back to a normal brush again. No matter how matted my hair is it is impossible for me to brush my head with this thing and make it hurt.  So it gently detangles my hair, no pain whatsoever and here is a big bonus! Because the bristles don&#x27;t yank through the knots I have way fewer split ends and I know longer have that weird after brush shedding. I loved this brush so much a month later I went back to the store and bought my mother (who has the same hair as me) the same brush and she swears by it too. I have had it for a year now and none of the little plastic beads on the bristles have come off and no bristles have fallen or pulled off. Just be aware the bristles are very soft so if you throw it in your purse they can bend every which way. I really recommend it,  it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> Still tugs at hair. Not as good as Ouchless Goody brushes.</li>
    <li> It is not the original Wet Brush</li>
    <li> This is really an awesome brush, i&#x27;ve purchased it a few times and it&#x27;s great on wet and dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;One thing i want to point out is that is collects lint pretty easily and after a few months a dirty &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; forms around the rubber around the bristles.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Still have to use a comb to get the underneath part of my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair, but it glides right through, making it easy to do her hair, finally!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Perfect for de tangling with out breaking your hair</li>
    <li> Bought this brush for detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair after baths and it works wonderfully. It gets the tangles out without causing tears.</li>
    <li> This brush is AWESOME!!! It detangles very easily. Especially when the hair is wet. My daughter actually looks forward to having her hair done after her shower since we&#x27;ve started using this brush. There&#x27;s no more pulling or ripping of the hair when we brush with the wet brush. The wet brush gets out all the tangles on wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Finally a brush that gently and quickly removes tangles from my granddaughter&#x27;s long fine hair.  Well worth the price. No more fusses when we use grammy&#x27;s magic brush.</li>
    <li> I had heard so many tears I just had to find a better alternative to the standard everyday brush. This works so incredibly well, no more tears, no more fuss, no more arguments or fights after the nightly bath.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had known about this years ago. It would have saved me six years of bedtime tears.</li>
    <li> This works beautifully for my daughter&#x27;s hair without the tears. She will not use any other brushes besides this one.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT DETANGLE SUPER CURLY HAIR</li>
    <li> my daughter cries about getting her hair done, but this brush has changed our lives. I tried one I found on an infomercial and it SUCKED! Someone suggested this one and it has been amazing</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t believe at first. Couldn&#x27;t believe when I first used it. It just is simply superb. Does what it says and does it great.</li>
    <li> This brush works great on my daughters straight hair.. And works great on my waist length curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy at all. I even find myself hunting for this brush after a shower so I don&#x27;t have to struggle with the tangles in my hair!</li>
    <li> I love the wet brush. I had problems with tangles and brushing my hair for years, and once I started using the wet brush, I noticed it took me a quarter of the time to brush my hair (I have long and thick hair - so it used to take me 20 minutes to brush it). It&#x27;s similar to a comb because it&#x27;s really thin bristles that are spaced apart, but it&#x27;s just nice to get out of the shower and brush my hair with a maximum of 10 strokes. It also works the same on dry hair. I had one before this for over a year, and I wanted to get another to keep in my bag for the gym.</li>
    <li> I have tangly hair, especially after I shower. My mom bought two of these brushes for me and I was skeptical because they look like something you&#x27;d never find at Sephora or a professional salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes work so well, I just bought a mini travel size brush. I keep one large brush in the shower to brush after I apply conditioner (this helps it get through to all of my hair) and another by my vanity for brushing after the shower or before I style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am picky about my hair brushes and used to only use a fine tooth comb, but I now only use these brushes!</li>
    <li> I ❤️ this brush. I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. It works very good on wet hair.</li>
    <li> This has been the best brush.  My daughter and I have naturally curly hair and if you do too, you know how hard it is to get your daughter to brush their hair.  This brush has become so popular to my daughter and her friends, that we literally starting buying them as presents for her friends and her friends are ESTATIC!!</li>
    <li> I discovered this brush and have been very happy with it.  Brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair no longer turns into a big battle.  My daughter has thick hair and the longer it gets, it tangles very easily.  This brush works wonders.  Amazon has great prices on this brush--I paid more than double this price to get my first one at a salon.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because after using for a while, the tips of the bristles fall off and then it hurts a little on the scalp.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old has very fine hair that tangles very easily. Before I bought this brush at my salon, it would take about 5 minutes to comb her hair even with conditioner and detangler. That job takes less than a minute now. She doesn&#x27;t cry or squirm while brushing her hair. I loved this brush so much that I bought 2 for our house and one for each set of grandparents. I won&#x27;t use any other brush. I would recommend this brush to anyone. Wouldn&#x27;t have believed that this brush was so good if I hadn&#x27;t seen it for myself. This is one product that&#x27;s definitely not too good to be true. Love it.  The price on Amazon is amazing. I paid $10 each at my salon and paid less than $7 with shipping to my door on Amazon. Shipping was fast too. Received it within 3 days of ordering. Wish I would&#x27;ve thought about Amazon before I bought 3 at $10 a pop at my salon. At least I got this one for a good deal.</li>
    <li> In comparing this brush with other brushes I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s more special than the next. It&#x27;s ligher than I expected and the bristles are softer and more flexible than I usually like.  Having really thick hair, I like something that I can feel on my scalp and hair when I brush through it. Using this brush when my hair is dry I feel like I may pull out the bristles if I&#x27;m too hard on it.</li>
    <li> brush works as described, luckily we received the purple brush and it looks and feels great in the hand, great price.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got this for me as a stocking gift, which i thought it was weird!!! But after i used it, i thought it was the most thoughtful gift ever. my hair is really tangled after a shower and with the brush, it doesnt hurt or have to pull hard when brushing my hair. I LOVE IT! and i couldnt live with out this brush.</li>
    <li> This is one of he best hair brushes I have ever owned~! its so mazing and it leaves my naturally straight hair neat and without split ends, without using a hair dryer! I love this product!</li>
    <li> Completely worth it! My salon sells this exact brush for $15 and it works like a hot knife through butter on my super long, super fine, tangly hair. I&#x27;m thinking about buying another to keep at the boyfriends place actually...</li>
    <li> This brush is great for long hair. It is soothing to your scalp after shampooing and does not hurt while getting tangles out. I will probably get more for my kids so they stop using mine.</li>
    <li> great brush really does work I was very skeptical at first but two of my three daughters have curly hair which tends to be very tangled and this really does work now they only let me brush with this one</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! I have thick super curly hair and it glides easily through my hair detangling while adding beautiful shine! Also makes it easy for me to brush my 2 yr old daughters hair because it combs out those tangles so easily. Will be purchasing more for stocking stuffers for family and friends!</li>
    <li> does have an unpleasing smell in the rubber that won&#x27;t seem to go away but other than that seems to work well</li>
    <li> I received the brush in the mail a few days ago and I tried it out without my hair being wet and it works great.  Better then the hair brush that I am using now.  It combs my hair really nice.  I have medium length hair.  I am going to recommend the brush to my sister who has two little ones.</li>
    <li> This the best brush ever, especially for kids! BUT you can usually find it a little cheaper in stores....</li>
    <li> best hair brush! gets hard to remove tangles out without too much trouble for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream can&#x27;t believe the difference it has made to brushing my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> This little brush is just AMAZING!!! Its my go to brush for both wet and dry use.  It detangles like nothing else. I just purchased two more (one for my car, one to keep at work).  It&#x27;s a must have in my opinion. BTW, I rarely review an item, but this one definitely warranted it.</li>
    <li> Wow. I have no words. I finally found a brush to deal with my horrific tangles. This is so exciting!!</li>
    <li> I just received the brush and used it.  It was just slightly better than a normal brush.  Still had problems getting knots out.</li>
    <li> Actually works. Was happy to find something that works for my daughters thick hair.</li>
    <li> great brush - I have two!</li>
    <li> Got it for my granddaughters long hair.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Goes through my daughter&#x27;s hair with ease. No more screaming when she has to get her hair brushed!</li>
    <li> I have 4 daughters ages, 4, 3, 2, and 1. They all have long, fine hair. They are bathed every night and I have struggled to brush their hair since becoming a mom. I have tried detangler and all other options. This brush has saved my life!! I bought 3 and I will never use another brush for my girls ever!! If I could give it a million stars I would!! Don&#x27;t delay, order this brush ASAP!!</li>
    <li> Just bought another one of these brushes because my daughter and I cannot live without this brush and we always misplace the ones we have. I even keep one in the car. And it&#x27;s the one brush we always have to take on vacations. At first I was unsure if I was actually brushing my hair because it was so gentle on knots (my daughter and I have very long wavy hair that tends to get knotty). But the brush gets the knots out without any pain, and seems to be much less damaging than any other brush I have owned. If I was Oprah, it would be on my favorite things list. We also love the Wet Brush Paddle brush.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old added this to my cart when I wasn&#x27;t looking and I was very close to deleting it because we&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different types of brushes and combs for her hair and nothing has worked to both our satisfaction so far. Every morning she would cry and complain and I would threaten to cut her hair short. It was a lose-lose frustrating way to start the day until she begged for this brush. I gave in because I thought, \\&quot;What have I got to lose?\\&quot;. At least, when this brush did not work, then I&#x27;d have a legitimate reason to take her to the hairdresser for a SHORT haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... was I in for a shock!!! We have been using the Wet Brush since the day it arrived and mornings are happy times in our little household. She loves it! She still has her tangles, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but even if I start brushing from the middle of her hair instead of the end like they advise, it doesn&#x27;t hurt her as much as it would using one of our other brushes. Wicked Mommy that I was, I switched brushes on a couple of occasions and she knew it from the very first pass through her hair. It doesn&#x27;t matter if her hair is dry, sweaty or wet, the brush works exceptionally well regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you will know, she has thick fairly straight hair, which falls to her mid back. She is active in outdoor activities, so despite ponytailing, it&#x27;s tangly by end of day. She also has tremendous bed head, since she moves around a lot in her sleep. This brush WORKS!!! Detangling is so much easier, and in the mornings when I&#x27;m in a hurry and her hair is dry, a spritz of water or [[ASIN:B0013UAPVK Johnson&#x27;s No More Tangles Spray Detangler, 10 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] does the trick and helps the brush to slide right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this unexpected purchase. My son and husband love using the brush, not for it&#x27;s detangling properties, but because as my son says \\&quot;It feels good on my head, Mommy,\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My daughter has crazy curly hair and absolutely HATES having her hair brushed.  No matter how much detangler we sprayed in it, it hurt her to have her hair brushed.  A friend who also has a daughter with crazy curly hair told me about this brush.  Oh my!  We used it the first time and my daughter said, &amp;#34;Momma!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair!&amp;#34;  Morning is so much easier now with this brush and she even brushes her own hair now.  This is a miracle maker!!</li>
    <li> I love my wet brush!  I have bought one for each one of us in the family. They all kept stealing mine!  This is a softer bristle, so it does not pull hard on your hair when wet.  It detangles extremely well. I have such a sensitive scalp, it hurts.  This keeps me from wincing when I am brushing my hair after washing it.</li>
    <li> This brush by far is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  I bought it based on what I read from other posts and it was a worth the risk.  This brush is soft but yet firm and it it pulls through my girls hair without all the ouchies that normally come with brushing tangled and wet hair.  I&#x27;m going to buy more!</li>
    <li> The wet brushes are the best brush is the market. I have never had to take one of them back for defect. This company is great to work with and every order has been correct. Thanks</li>
    <li> This brush, I don&#x27;t know where to begin. I have long hair, not thick but not to thin either. I wear a bun and ponytails a lot and have 2 babies 1 &amp; 2 years old, so I get food in my hair (oatmeal and bananas are a favorite) and little fingers love to tangle my hair all the time. THIS BRUSH is a must. I do not know how it works, but it does. It does not pull, my boys brush my hair, and aside from the thump i get once in a while, they do a great job brushing my hair. I do not know how the bristles work, they are soft and flatten very easy, yet my hair gets in it and i do not feel the rip and pull of my hair coming out. No snarling teeth, just brushed hair. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This brush must contain some sort of black magic because it brushes through my thick tangled hair with ease.  I used to go a week without brushing my hair because I hated doing it so much, but now I would brush my hair all day with this brush!</li>
    <li> so i was kind of a skeptic, i thought it looks like any other brush out there.  I have extremely long hair.  took a shower ran the brush through it right after stepping out of shower.  brushed through like it was butter.</li>
    <li> my daughter uses it on her tangled curly hair and it does a good job of gently detangling her hair</li>
    <li> Best hair brush to get out tough tangles without hurting my daughter. She has long fine hair that gets lots of tangles. It works great when her hair is wet or dry.</li>
    <li> This brush changed my life.  As crazy as that sounds, it&#x27;s really TRUE!  My daughter and I both have very long, fine hair....and a TON of it.  This combination creates the ideal environment for massive tangles making every shower a dreaded event.  A friend introduced me to this brush and it took our 15 minutes (each) brushing routine down to 2 minutes flat. It seriously goes straight through our hair. Not to mention, I don&#x27;t have to clear it of a handful of hair when I&#x27;m done, as I did with every other brush I own.  We loved this brush so much we had to buy another!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever. I will never use a different kind again. This does a great job of detangling both wet and dry hair without pain.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> How does this work?! It&#x27;s amazing! I was so skeptical because it is just a hairbrush after all, and it doesn&#x27;t look particularly special. But this goes SO smoothly through my hair with no snags. More importantly, my hair looks so much healthier with barely any frizz.</li>
    <li> This is the worst peice of junk i ever bought. It must have been designed by a bald person. Tjis product is really lacking.There is no way this will go thru my hair wet or dry. Its way too soft. Bristles just bend and slide over your hair instead of brushing it. Its like brushing your hair with a spoon.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt tho.</li>
    <li> This brush is really a lot softer and using it is a lot less painful than other brushes. However, after using it several times on my wavy hair and my toddler daughter&#x27;s curly hair, I noticed that it causes a lot of frizz and my hair is typically not that frizzy.  Now, I have yet to try it on wet hair, and it very well may work better under those circumstances. However, the product also advertises that it works on dry hair too - just be aware that it may cause hair to be frizzier than hard-brissled brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush is good.  My little ones are happy with it.  However, it bothers me that sellers are allowed to present their product showing more than one  of the item.  Maybe I am foolish, but in this case, it led me to believe that I was ordering a set of brushes.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love this hairbrush.  It is wonderful on long wet hair.  No more painful sessions of getting tangles and knots out! I would highly recommend this.  We even bought a second one.</li>
    <li> This is not a quality soft flexible brush with rubber, like Conair. It is a no-brand cheap product, that sells for $1 AT MY LOCAL ONE DOLLAR STORE! I JUST SAW IT THERE FOR ONE DOLLAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product is low, and the description does not say that it is not rubberized very well, it scratches and it does not detangle when wet....</li>
    <li> This brush is a little mysterious. It seems just like an ordinary cheap brush, but it works really well! The bristles aren&#x27;t anything special but it works really well. I like the rubberized feel as well. I gave 4 stars because you can&#x27;t choose your own color (I lucked out with black!).</li>
    <li> I HAVE A VERY SENSITIVE SCALP AND THESE ARE THE ONLY HAIR BRUSHES THAT FEEL GOOD AGAINST IT. GOOD PRODUCT AND FAST SHIPPING FROM AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Brushing time for my 3 year old daughter down from about 30 minutes to about 5-7 minutes. Tears for the brushing down to almost zero. I still have to be carefull but this brush is really good.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for a comfortable brush--I did not see that it was a detangling brush also. IT DOES NOT HURT TO BRUSH TANGLY HAIR!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best thing I have ever owned. Sometimes I didn&#x27;t brush my hair because it HURT! Now in a few COMFORTABLE strokes, my hair is de-tangled and brushed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t let you pick the color, but that as the only downside!</li>
    <li> Straightens my daughter&#x27;s hair perfectly!1</li>
    <li> Go back 32 years with me.  I&#x27;m a cute chubby little 4 year old getting my morning hair style for another tough day of kindergarten. (Yes we start early up in the mountains.)  My Mom, bless her heart was on her last baby and boy were they saving the best for last!  She&#x27;d take the time to braid my hair, put ribbons and bows in the long deep dark brown hair.  She&#x27;d sing The Little  Indian  song to me because I wanted to look  just like my Dad&#x27;s sisters.  She&#x27;d send me off to school and I&#x27;d come home every single day with no hair doo to speak of unless you are Mr. Yahoo Serious.  Knots, clumps, dirt, a worm from time to time, once a dog treat...all have been found in my hair over the years.  Finally, giving into the fact I would never be prim for more than an hour a day she gave me a Dorthy Hamill and I was Sarah The Fat Boy for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward those horrible years called life before 25 and we&#x27;re to about 11 years ago.  I had hair down to the middle of my back that was so thick hair stylists couldn&#x27;t believe their brushes.  Never processed, and hardly every dry as it was that thick and long.  Still hard as heck to comb, but long hair was just something I needed.  No pain, no gain!  Then life kicked in, we&#x27;ll fast forward past some surgery, some weight loss, a dash of stress and one giant incurable disease that called for medication that took all that hair away. I started over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are now in the near past (last week), I&#x27;m a okay.  My hair on the other hand has gone through several  lengths and came full circle to hair nearly to my waist.  This hair is thin, and without serious amounts of  hydrotherapie or maybe lard would not comb / brush / iron / pull / etc thorough tangles.  Often I would just braid a tangle into the the fold as cutting or leaving was the only option that day.  I was losing more hair than a very large old stuffed cat, should I try to brush my hair.  Then I stumbled upon The Wet Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve tried every comb, clicker brush, no nibby metal prong, wooden, plastic, silicone, pick, finger comb, brush combo out there.  Thousands of dollars over the years looking for something to brush out my uber thick non  curly hair and then my uber thin still tangledy hair. I have a closet of conditioners that makes most supply warehouses look weak.  I figured, what&#x27;s one more brush for less than $10 with all these stars?!  I ordered it.  Prime always makes it easier for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*triangle &amp; harp music* *fade to color ala Wizard of OZ*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a long time as I was going  to put a rinse in it. I asked my Mom to brush my hair out over a towel because it makes such a mess.  Besides who better than  the woman who started the long hair love affair of mine only to rip it away with a sassy skater cut?!&lt;br /&gt;I digress, to the night in question.  She starts to brush and I hand her the ultra de-tangler just in case!  She&#x27;s not exactly a sweet fawn with my hair or my mouth.  Weird part?  It doesn&#x27;t hurt and I&#x27;m thinking, my gosh my hair must be really really, grody greasy... ewewewewwwwww.  Then she flips the first portion over my shoulder and I said what on earth are you doing?! If you&#x27;re not going to bother to brush it, I&#x27;ll make someone else do it.  She replies...Sarah...there is no hair coming out and I did brush it!  It&#x27;s totally smooth, look!  Sit still and shut up!  She keeps brushing and it&#x27;s like nothing is going on back there.  Certainly not a replay from 32 years ago with her brushing my feral child hair and me yelling b*stard out my cute 4 year old mouth.  When she was done there was a small bunch of hair...a normal amount of shedding.  My scalp was not bleeding.  I was not crying, nor was she.  The towel was not playing a game of Harry and The Almost Henderson&#x27;s.  My hair was smooth, brushed out, ready for a  rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this morning I washed my hair very quickly for an appointment and used the brush and same result.  No issues.  I don&#x27;t know that this is the Shroud of Turin or even the secret to Martha Stewart looking not a day over 60...but this brush is something!  Order one.  See the difference.  Feel it.  I&#x27;m a realist, aka pessimist.  This brush is cooler than the other side of my pillow and I will never go without one again.  Then come back and tell me how to get away with yelling cuss words to get my Mom&#x27;s goose with no tangles?at this is the Shroud of Turin or even the secret to Martha Stewart looking not a day over 60...but this brush is something!  Order one.  See the difference.  Feel it.  I&#x27;m a realist, aka pessimist.  This brush is cooler than the other side of my pillow and I will never go without one again.

    <li> I am a guy with really long 3a/3b hair. I used to last roughly half an hour detangling my hair with TONS of conditioner, and at times I had to ask my aunt for help. Enter this brush and i swear it works with a spell enchanted by Merlin himself. I wanted to see how well it worked, so when i received it I used it without any conditioner at all. This thing went through my hair like freaking butter. I tried as hard as i can to see if it ever got stuck, but this champion never faulted, and this was using it from top to bottom, which to many its the wrong way to detangle hair, this brush doesn&#x27;t care. I buy many things here and I am always too lazy to write a review, but this really deserves it. Would pay 5 times its price if need be now that i know it works.</li>
    <li> So at first you use this and you pass it over wet hair and youre like, Whaaaat? This just went OVER the knots. It doesnt work. Then you do it again and youre like whaaaat? Same thing... then you do it again and youre like, Umm... is this seriously working? Then you do it one more time and ALL the knots are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush rocks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for 2 weeks or so and at first it was sorta great, it was detangling my hair and it didn&#x27;t hurt my hair/scalp. However, after about 2 days of use I started to notice that it ripped out a lot of my hair. At first I just passed it off as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; but then one day while I was just rubbing the ends of my hair, a bunch of my hair fell out. I am honestly very concerned that I&#x27;m going to go bald because of this s***** product. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Quality of a 99cent brush with an overrated price tag and all this hype. Not what I expected. Plus it smells awful.</li>
    <li> Lots of hype in the reviews.  None of it true.  Stick with a boar&#x27;s hair bristle brush and put up with your Rapunzel wannabe daughter&#x27;s complaints when you try to make her look less like Hermione Granger on a Weasley wand hair grooming day.</li>
    <li> This is far better than the average brush for our daughter&#x27;s tangled hair.  It used to be that every shower would result in yelling and screaming as my wife helped our daughter de-tangle her hair, but this brush has changed that.  The complaints are far less frequent and the experience is more enjoyable for all.</li>
    <li> My daughter who normally hates brushing her hair due to tangles loves this. It works!!!</li>
    <li> It works great in the shower!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my hair longer than a few inches beyond my shoulders.  Only recently did my hairdresser tell me that my hair doesn&#x27;t have a chance to grow very long: it starts to dry at the ends and break off.  I know it&#x27;s getting dry (aka too long) when it starts to tangle; then I have to go get my hair trimmed -- and voila! -- it ceases to tangle . . . until it starts getting dry and breaks off again.  Thus, my hair always seems to be at the same length with the constant trimming.  But then I discovered the Wet Brush here ([...] and immediately ordered it.  As soon I stepped out of the shower, I excitedly ran it through my hair.  IT&#x27;S FAAAAAAABULOUS!  VERY little hair came out, and they were just strands -- not clumps of snarled hair (which is what normally happened with my regular old comb.)  I only wish I had discovered the Wet Brush sooner.  Now I may have a chance to have really long hair after all!</li>
    <li> There really is no difference in using this brush versus&lt;br /&gt;any other brush with the same type of bristles, wet or dry</li>
    <li> Bought one for my aunt after she tried out my daughers.  They seem to work well to not &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; when brushing, but they don&#x27;t really get out all the tangles.</li>
    <li> This is my first of two brushes. I keep one in the car, and the other at home. It works really well in detangling my hair without destroying it. I love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is the best. I have thick long hair that is always hard to get through after the shower. Now I can get through it in seconds!</li>
    <li> i never could brush my toddler&#x27;s hair before, now she brushes her own hair. I am so jealous, I need to buy one for myself. and the price is so cheap, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I have only had the brush for a couple months so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity but it looks well made.</li>
    <li> I have used the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product and LOVED it. I ordered three of these and was excited to have one for myself, mom and friend, but these don&#x27;t work as well as what I have used before. They still work good though. The seller was fantastic and quickly delivered. Very pleased with the customer service!</li>
    <li> My hair gets insanely knotty and tangled. I read reviews on this brush and didn&#x27;t believe how miraculous it could change my life, but I won&#x27;t sugarcoat it: it&#x27;s life changing. I am completely confused as to why it works as it does, but I&#x27;d rather not know and just keep smiling every time I brush my wet hair. Trust me, you&#x27;ll understand once you try it.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my granddaughters and though I would try one too.  It is unbelievable how it glides through wet hair and no tangles to mess with.  You want go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the physics here but it doesn&#x27;t matter. This brush goes smoothly through hair in every situation, dry, wet, tangled, or fresh out of bed. Minimal tearing or discomfort, buy it.</li>
    <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t really detangle my hair at all.  The bristles are really soft and bend very easily so that it will not break your hair while trying to detangle it, but since they bend so easily, they also are ineffective at detangling.  It works ok as a regular brush though.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Still in tack after much use.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long hair (can almost sit on it) and the wet brush definitely seems to tangle less, which I think is due to thinner bristles not having enough resistance to get caught in knots easily. It&#x27;s fine to use on wet hair or in the shower, but if I use it when my hair is dry, I might as well brush my hair with a balloon! My hair will shoot straight and crackle for a while, which is quite distressing. My friends who&#x27;ve used the brush say the same thing, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m crazy. For wet hair though, this is fine! Definitely worth the 9$.</li>
    <li> I received the first one as a gift. My 4 year old daughter loves this brush! No more crying and fighting about hair every morning!</li>
    <li> it works amazingly, wet or dry. no more crying when brushing my daughter&#x27;s tangles. love it! thinking of purchasing a spare.</li>
    <li> Ordered three of these and received them in prompt time with packaging in tact. My daughter hates brushing her hair and always has matty hair despite the fact that she would otherwise have quite luscious locks. Brushing her hair is no longer so painful. I would recommend this brush to those who struggle with brushing wet or dry hair.</li>
    <li> Did not believe anything can help me with my daughter&#x27;s curls! Every morning started with tears from brushing. Now it is incredible! Even my husband with my son said nothing can happened to that brush! It brought peace and happiness to my family;-)</li>
    <li> These brushes do just what they say - detangle hair even when wet. Gentle on hair. Gentle on scalp. Recommended.</li>
    <li> It really does what it says. Grand-daughter has stopped running from the owie brush. Seems to be made of high quality material.</li>
    <li> Best brush for kids! I have two girls with very long hair &amp; always a challenge to brush their hair. I usually have to spray a ton of detangler in their hair to brush it. I am so happy to have found this brush. Works best when hair is wet but also does the job when their hair is dry. Finally, no more tears when it comes to brushing their hair!!</li>
    <li> I love this hair brush! My brother got it for me at Christmas and I had three Goody brand brushes that I switched between using so I wouldn&#x27;t wear the bristles out too quickly. My hair is long and really thick (so thick that if I don&#x27;t get it trimmed at least every two months, I get severe neck-aches and stress-induced headaches from having my hair up in a ponytail too long, which puts stress on my neck. My hair is HEAVY!) I was going through bottles of leave-in conditioner and detangling spray so quickly and it made my hair sooo greasy. It was such a pain and all I wanted was to brush my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking into that Michel Mercier Detangling Hair Brush for Thick Hair and everyone said it was a waste of money, that it hurt and didn&#x27;t do anything for their hair. And then one of the related products was this brush, yet the reviews were spectacular, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;ve been so disappointed in my hair brushing experience that I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as the reviewers were saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say I was shocked with how well it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not need my detangling spray. I did not need my leave-in conditioner. I had this wonderful, lightweight brush that looks so flimsy and cheap, but it a wonderful tool! I use it daily and love it to death. I&#x27;m going  to buy more in the future because my hair is so thick, bristles bend and break under it and it&#x27;s starting to pull my hair the way other brushes do from the get-go. I&#x27;ve had months of use from this one brush alone. It gets my hair brushed so quickly and pain free, I&#x27;m still sometimes shocked it works so well. There are nights that I toss and turn so much in my sleep that I do have to hunt down my detangler, but the problem is quickly solved and without spraying it throughout my hair and getting it greasy. Also, I brush my hair a couple times a day and it works whether my hair is wet or dry. This brush does it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only brush I&#x27;ll ever buy from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: That &#x27;tire rubber&#x27; smell people talk about is real, but I only smell it when I sniff my brush. It doesn&#x27;t spread to my hair when I brush it.from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: That &#x27;tire rubber&#x27; smell people talk about is real, but I only smell it when I sniff my brush. It doesn&#x27;t spread to my hair when I brush it.</li>
    <li> I got this when it was on sale for a few dollars cheaper than it usually is, and I&#x27;m SO glad I got it! I&#x27;ve always struggled with getting tangles in my hair, and it is amazing how this brush gets them out with no pain, even when my hair is dry. I don&#x27;t think I will ever get another kind of brush. If you have a daughter who cries when you brush her hair, get this !</li>
    <li> I had heard that this was the best brush ever.  I have to admit it is pretty good.  My daughter and I both have thick long hair and this doesn&#x27;t even feel like it is going through the hair.  But it pretty much does.  It gets through 80% of the knots - then we switch to the old brush.</li>
    <li> It does detangle. I&#x27;m not sure that it does a better job than my wide-tooth shower comb but definitely better than a regular brush or a hair dryer/styling brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After having this several months, I realize it doesn&#x27;t detangle as well as my wide-tooth \\&quot;wet comb\\&quot;. I use this now as a regular brush.. on my dry hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made.  My eight-year-old daughter has very thick wavy hair with some curls.  As is the case with many girls, brushing her hair was a nightmare, causing tears for her and frustration for me.  So then we&#x27;d avoid brushing it for as long as possible, and the knots would be even worse when we finally tried to brush it.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried various brushes, shampoos, conditioners, and other hair products.  Although some of these items have helped a little, the Wet Brush has easily been the greatest of them all.  I am able to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair with ease and no screaming or crying (from either of us!).  My daughter is able to brush her hair independently as well.  Although we used it at first only when her hair was wet, we now use it dry too.  Getting her ready in the morning is a much more pleasant experience now.  Thank you Wet Brush!</li>
    <li> OMG! FINALLY! A brush that gently and effectively untangles my hair! I have baby fine, thin hair with a natural wave to it. I used to have to hack at it, no matter how much conditioner I used. This brush fixed that! It glides through my hair, even when it&#x27;s crazy knotted! Haven&#x27;t tried it on dry hair yet, but I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughters.  Both Moms says it works very well, fewer tears when brushing wet hair, happier kids.</li>
    <li> Easiest and most gentle  brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Worked nicely, meet my needs. Good for the hair</li>
    <li> I have purchased one of these for each of my kids!  Absolutely love it!  My girls have long hair and curly hair.  Helps detangle without the tears that other brushes would result in.  recommend it to those who have a tangled mess in the morning to deal with!</li>
    <li> I know this brush sounds so cheesy, but it really detangles hair so much better than other brushes. I don&#x27;t want to use other brushes after using this one. It&#x27;s the type of thing that works so well that its going to be xmas gifts for others now too!</li>
    <li> This brush is FANTASTIC! No more tears while brushing my daughter’s hair. I am going to get another one for me and my sisters as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush knowing how great it was but the gray color represented was why I ordered so many for Cmas gifts and then they arrive in bright taxi-cab yellow! I had to return them all because that color yellow is usually not liked by a man. But, the brush is terrific... if I could get the right color!</li>
    <li> I got this because my 5 year old daughter has curly hair and always whines when I brush her hair.  I also have long curly hair that tangles easily, I understand her complaints.  I decided to give this brush a try.  It really works!  She doesn&#x27;t complain and actually enjoys brushing her hair now.  I do find if she brushes her hair when it is dry it makes her hair extra frizzy, but when brushed wet and then left to dry it is fine.  I also use it for my hair.  I find it does have a harder time getting some of the tough knots out.  If that is the case I just get a regular brush and go through quickly to get the last of the little knots out.  This brush is a life saver!</li>
    <li> My husband has very curly long hair and this works out the tangles very well with minimal hair loss....His scalp and hair thanks this brush!</li>
    <li> This is the best detangling brush I have found yet.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a young girl with thick hair.  I wish we could have picked the color.  I have ordered 2 and gotten black both times.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend, we bought this brush when we already had a Diva Glide. The children (5 and 2.5) prefer the Diva Glide, even though a test run through my own hair made me think they are pretty much the same thing. Anyway, it&#x27;s a fine brush. I expected it to be the best brush ever, and that&#x27;s why it was only &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; to me. We still have a lot of crying and screaming and &amp;#34;IT HURTS MOMMY IT HURTS&amp;#34; when I use it, so I can&#x27;t say it was a five-star purchase for me. Glad I tried it, though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to prevent hair being pulled out by the brush but this does still pull out hair as much as my other brushes.. I thought it would work well for my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair but it was not strong enough to get through it. She did not find it helpful. It did stink of plastic smell at first but that is getting better. Perhaps i bought the wrong kind of wet brush! i had high hopes but this did not deliver. Sorry!</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a Wheaten Terrier owners group that I belong to and boy where they right in their recommendation!  This brush is really perfect for brushing out our 9mo. old pup&#x27;s hair - wet or dry.  It&#x27;s bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t scrape her skin but rigid enough to pull out little tangles, remove leaves and dirt, etc.  We now brush her with this daily - including her face, ears and beard - and she doesn&#x27;t mind it at all, unlike other brushes we tried.  It also helps if we brush her pre-bath.</li>
    <li> This brush works good to use before you use a real brush to get all te remaining tangles.  My daughter has extremely thick hair and I use this brush and then I use her regular brush.  It helps get the bigger knots out with less pulling.  It doesn&#x27;t get the fine knots but it definitely helps with the big ones.</li>
    <li> This worked great the two times I used it. Way easier than my other two brushes to use after a shower. I was really surprised how well it worked considering the time and pain my other ones took, but it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I lost it somewhere, so I&#x27;m buying another &amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> My only regret with this brush is that I did not take my hairdresser&#x27;s advice and purchase this sooner!  My daughter has incredibly thick, very long, corkscrew curly hair.  She is 9 and has become accustomed to long brushing sessions and deep conditioning, however, it is still sometimes nearly impossible to work a brush through.  Problem solved using this brush!  It glides right through and gently detangles.  This also is working fabulously in my 4 year old&#x27;s fine, straight, thin hair as well.  Her head is more sensitive so this brush really helped.</li>
    <li> The first day I used this brush I would have given it 5 stars.  It slid through my tangled wet hair effortlessly.  it continued to do that for about two weeks.  Then it stopped gliding through so easy.  It is still better than my old brush, but some element must have worn off after a few weeks because it takes a little more detangling effort now.  Still a great brush though and I would recommend it for anyone with long, thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I got a black one from target. But seriously, anyone with kids needs this brush! I have a 2 year old and he has curly hair and he&#x27;s a head rubber when he sleeps. He screams and runs away when I try to brush his hair. I went to brush his hair with this and he wanted to run but after he seen it didn&#x27;t hurt he actually wanted me to brush it!!!! This does pull a little but nothing like a normal brush. I definitely recommend this!!! Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush from the salon I go to. It is not at all what it claims to be. It caused my to break and could not get through knots like it says it can. My hair is down to the middle of my back and I bought this to use on myself and my daughter. Not even a chance. I ended up buying the Glide Thru Detangling Brush by Crave Naturals after hearing how it worked. I was pleasantly surprised at how it just went through my knots and tangled hair. I love this brush, I have bought more and will be giving them to my nieces who have little ones. The Glide Thru increased shine in my hair and I actually got a compliment from some of the ladies I work with :) Maybe I was just having a good hair day or maybe it was the brush, who knows,,, but I definitely took the compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the brush that worked for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CGN9LQ8 Crave Naturals Glide Thru Detangling Brush - Best Detangler Paddle Hairbrush for Knot &amp; Tangle - Detangles Thick, Curly, Long or Short, Natural &amp; Fine Hair - Works Like A Genie on Wet or Dry Hair - No More Tears for Kids &amp; Toddlers Or Grown Men And Wome...]]</li>
    <li> This brush did not detangle as easily as I thought it would. I tried it in both of my daughters&#x27; hair: one has thick silky hair with and the other has long wavy hair. The brush pulled both of them -- we tried it in wet and dry hair. I was really excited by the other reviews. But, this bruch did not work for us.</li>
    <li> This brush works great I have very long hair and it always goes straight thru my hair. Also My daughter has very curly hair and so far its the only brush that she can use to get the tangles out works great on wet or dry hair!!</li>
    <li> I have hair that gets easily tangled, only made worse by my frequent boating/scuba diving etc.  I&#x27;ve tried other speciality tangle brushes and still needed to use leave in conditioner etc.  This brush has eliminated that though! Although I still like leave in products to strengthen my hair it&#x27;s not necessary as this brush will get through any tangle! It really blew my mind.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think a brush could be that much different than my normal paddle brush until I received a sample brush in a subscription box.  After one week of using a wet brush, I can&#x27;t go back to using any of my old brushes.  Detangles easily and gently for even the most tender-headed.  I had to buy another one to make sure I always had one with me.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but it really works!  My daughter usually whines the whole time we brush her hair, but she hardly even noticed we were brushing it with this brush!</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves this brush. Her hair does not pull at all when wet. Even when the hair are dry it pulls very little on her quite curly hair. She does not cry at all while we combing her hair earlier she used to run away from letting us comb her hair. The bristles are very soft and soft to touch. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Brushes worked fine, however, the balls of the bristles has scraped off after only a month of use. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and her hair that has not been cut in her five years of life. I noticed an immediate change while brushing her hair. No more squirming, crying, pulling away. I do not know how, but it works.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review the Wet Brush versus the Tangle Tamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict. The Wet Brush is preferred by my daugher for her silky, very fine, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT a win on my thick, coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves it and uses it daily. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try and if you end up with a ball of fuzz on your head (as I did) then it isn&#x27;t for you. Not a bad brush, just not the brush for MY hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the Wet Brush for my daughter who has very thick hair and has a hard time getting tangles out. She loves it. I always have a hard time getting my hair brushed out after riding on the motorcycle with my husband. This last time, I was spraying my hair with detangler as I usually do, and still the hair was being ripped out by my regular brush. I remembered the Wet Brush and decided, why not? It worked GREAT. I got the tangles out easily and there was less hair loss and watery eyes.</li>
    <li> Stop what you&#x27;re doing and buy this brush. I had no idea Id avoided brushing my hair because it hurt so much! This brush is incredibly gentle -- especially after a shower when my hair is normally as tangled spaghetti. Love this brush!!!!!!</li>
    <li> As a 21-year-old woman I cannot believe I&#x27;ve lived my whole life without one of these. Brushing out my hair used to be a painful and traumatic experience especially when wet. I can honestly say this brush has changed my life. I actually enjoy brushing my hair when I get out of the shower and I&#x27;m not worried about causing damage or breakage.</li>
    <li> Very soft brush. Almost too soft for my thick hair, but it does comfortably get the tangles out after I shower. Has a nice feel to it.</li>
    <li> Terrible experience for my 4b hair. My hair constantly got caught on the balls at the ends of the bristles and ripped out.</li>
    <li> It was a little Disappointing BC they told me I would get 5 brushes but I only got 1. 😭😭</li>
    <li> Really does a number on the tangles while managing to be gentle. So far a wonderful purchase and the bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out nearly immediately as with other brands.</li>
    <li> This saved my 4 year old&#x27;s after-bathtime and morning hairbrushing in our house. Something that was always a struggle has turned into something so easy. Pretty impressive how easily this brush glides through wet hair or tangled hair (dry or wet!). I&#x27;ll sometimes still use detangler if my daughter&#x27;s hair gets a bit ratty, but it&#x27;s almost not needed given this hairbrush does miracles.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody with longer or curly hair needs one of these. Seriously. I wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
    <li> This brush definitely helped with tangles! Works better on wet hair than dry, but works well either way.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Brushing hair used to be a hassle but now girls just do it themselves with this brush!</li>
    <li> Not perfect, but the best I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve been through a lot of brushes to find one that painlessly detangles my kids hair. That includes professional ones from the salon. This one is the best of them.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on hair both wet and dry. Will get brush for everyone in the family. Tangles in hair come out easily. Smelled like a tire and had to soak in bleach to get smell out. After that it works great.</li>
    <li> We love these brushes! The best we&#x27;ve found for my daughters long curly hair.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this brush after seeing all the good reviews but unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work for my thick type 3c curly hair. I had to go back to my wide tooth comb mid shower after trying to detangle with the Wet Brush. I brushed starting from the ends as usual but it seemed like the brush was just causing my shed hairs to tangle up into matted knots. I&#x27;m sure this brush would work like a dream for straight and/or fine hair but if your have thick curly hair this may not be the brush for you.</li>
    <li> At first I thought that this was a great brush.  I have short hair so this brush gets minimal use one time a day.  Mine has little beads at the end of the bristles.  Over time the beads either fall off or get pushed down the bristle.  First it was only one bead, which caused a little discomfort.  But then it started happening to more and more of the beads.  Now it&#x27;s actually painful to use this brush.  It feels like I&#x27;m rubbing a porcupine on top of my head.  I regret buying this.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush outside of the fact that she wanted a different color. The brush does a fantastic job of getting tangles out of her hair and would ahve received 5 stars if only you could select the color you want instead of getting one randomly from the five colors available. We played the brush lottery and ended up with yellow which was not the color my daughter wanted. :)</li>
    <li> Got these for my grandaughters to try and minimize the after shower tears.  Happy to report they work!  Kids love them!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair that tangles quite frequently. This brush does what is says and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Works great on my daughters hair as well. No more complaints about painful tangles.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting - my hair is a disaster after the shower and it was unrealistic of me to expect that a brush could glide through the tangled mess with absolute ease. Is it better than the brush I was using before? Yes it is. And that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
    <li> My 3 yr old has very thick, tightly curled kinky hair.  This brush was nice in that it didn&#x27;t hurt as much when using it on her wet hair BUT it wasn&#x27;t something I could use alone. I had to also use another brush that got deeper in her hair (and hurt more).  This brush did help loosen some of the tangles first, so overall there were less tears than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this brush, but for children whose hair is like my daughter&#x27;s, it can&#x27;t be used alone.</li>
    <li> I know I can&#x27;t be the only one out there who thinks this brush is a piece of junk.  It has completely ruined my daughter&#x27;s hair! Detangling was hard enough before, but we&#x27;ve spent the last month using this brush, and it has damaged her hair so badly that any time it gets wet, it becomes matted and impossible to comb through.  I literally spent 1 hour and 15 minutes tonight trying to get this brush through her hair.  Ridiculous. Setting a match to it tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Wish you could choose your own color, but aside from that, this brush works fairly well.  I would not say that it is completely pain free, my daughter and I both have super curly long hair and this helps with the tangles better than a regular brush, but I still think a comb in the shower with conditioner on hair is an easier alternative.</li>
    <li> So great for thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush I use for my long thick hair when it&#x27;s wet or dry.  The bristles reach all the way to my head, and they glide smoothly without pulling or ripping out my hair.  I recently got the paddle brush version of the Wet Brush, and it&#x27;s perfect for blow drying.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old daughter has very long, thick hair. I was skeptical about this brush, but gave it a try anyway. Yes the bristles basically collapse as you use it, but it does work and she doesn&#x27;t complain at all. It works best for me if I section her hair and comb from under (after I put in her conditioner). Once each section is done, I run a comb through it and there are 90% less tangles to deal with! Love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy for me to comb my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;The hair still catches sometimes but since the bristles are very flexible, they do not pull so hard.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I got it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush. Brushing my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair has always been such a hassle. She hates it &amp; I practically have to drag her into the bathroom to brush her hair because she&#x27;s very tender-headed. Since purchasing this brush, she no longer argues about me brushing her hair. This brush works well and doesn&#x27;t pull her hair like other brushes do. I highly recommend it, especially for little girls!</li>
    <li> This brush and my experience with it were pretty much as advertised.  It definitely goes through wet hair better than most brushes with less hair ending up in the brush.  The things I didn&#x27;t like were minor like that they didn&#x27;t let me pick the color and just randomly sent me yellow.  Not a big deal but if I had to say something negative that would be it.  My husband is also using it now.  He says he doesn&#x27;t notice a difference but my hair is much longer and more fine than his thick curly main so go figure.  It drys fast also and doesn&#x27;t fill with water when I use it in the shower.  Good price and good brush.</li>
    <li> I love this Brush it works wonders on my long thick hair and it also is great for my daughters very curly hair!</li>
    <li> I previously had crazy tangles after the shower, it&#x27;d be a struggle to get through them. Now i use this brush with Suave Kids detangling spray after the shower and it&#x27;s a breeze, brush slides right through. Brushes great for dry hair too. So happy and highly recommend</li>
    <li> This was a stocking stuffer gift for my wife.  She is very happy with it.  This is the second one like it that I have purchased - the first was a different brand and did not work well.  This specific brush was on the list.</li>
    <li> The bristles are so flexible that it doesn&#x27;t grab my wet hair so I can brush the tangles out.  I regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Both of my daughters have this brush.  We initially bought them from my hairstylist then bought this one for a gift.</li>
    <li> The wet brush is a must if you have long and tangled hair..it works like a dream! I will always use this one!&lt;br /&gt;Dawn</li>
    <li> Great product. It goes smoothly through the most tangled hair with no problem. I am so glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Although my daughter said the brush works well, it is nothing like pictured. It doesn&#x27;t have a handle but is just the round brush part with a small rope and suction cup attached. My husband thought it was a dog brush. It is very difficult to hold on to. There was also a very large barcode sticker stuck on the brush that didn&#x27;t come off completely. Kept it only because the price was low enough that it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning.</li>
    <li> My son decided to let his hair grow. Detangling it after his shower had become a nightmare. I tried several brushes and combs and detanglers and still he complained as if I was torturing him. I bought this brush and he loves it. Now he detangles his hair by himself, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter but use it on myself now too!  It combs my wet hair much easier than my wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what is special about this brush that makes it work so well.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a cheap brush you could pick up at any .99 Cent Store.&lt;br /&gt;BUT.. this thing really works!&lt;br /&gt;It gets through my long waist length hair like butter. No pain, so tugging. I love this brush.</li>
    <li> Finally a brush I can use on my daughter&#x27;s hair and she does not scream. Love this brush!!!</li>
    <li> My 4 year old has fine curly hair and this is the only brush that doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Even on the nights we forget to put the detangler in her hair before we brush it out she doesn&#x27;t fuss at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush hoping for less hair breakage/loss when combing. It combs your hair basically without pain, although I still think I am losing just as much hair as with my classic bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be 5 stars but it feels so light and cheap. I&#x27;m just 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and have small hands, and the brush is almost too dinky for me to use.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I bought this brush because I have thin hair but A LOT of it and it&#x27;s somewhat between curly and wavy. Whenever I use a normal brush, it pulls my hair out and tires my arm out because it&#x27;s basically war between the brush and my hair. I was needing a new brush and stumbled upon this one at my local Bed, Bath and Beyond. So I decided to try this one out and wow was I surprised, it does exactly as it&#x27;s described! I barely feel it go through my hair and it gets all my knots out! And it barely leaves hair on the brush! Which is surprising because all my other brushes would leave so much hair on them I&#x27;d have to clean them out every time. Just make sure you use it when your hair is wet. Amazing brush.</li>
    <li> I saw the good ratings on this brush, and being disappointed with the quality of brushes purchased locally, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. It does what the name says and seems to be holding up well, also. I liked it so much I bought a second one to keep in my car. Gets those tangles right out!</li>
    <li> Amazing!  My little boy has fine curly hair and would cry when it was time to comb it, no matter how gentle I was and how much leave in de-tangler I added.  I was skeptical about whether this brush would be as good as everyone said it was but lo and behold, it&#x27;s awesome!  Just a few strokes through wet hair and he&#x27;s tangle free without a tear!  He doesn&#x27;t complain about brushing time anymore, yay!</li>
    <li> Wow this works great for tangles on long hair!</li>
    <li> One of those life changing experience...the good kind. Friend at work recommended brush to me since I have two granddaughters living me under the age of 6. I thought, yeah, right, a brush that is less than $10 couldn&#x27;t be that good. Well, the girls and I call the brush &amp;#34;the good brush&amp;#34; in the morning when we are getting ready for school. Works fine with wet or dry fair.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t able to reach my scalp while brushing on some parts of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think that happens because the bristles will bend or press into the brush if your hair is thick.</li>
    <li> Not as not ce as the flat brush, but does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and have always hated brushing it because it is painful. This brush has helped so much with that I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> This brush is great at de-tangling long hair.  I bought a few of them for my daughters.  There is nothing else that does the job as well as this.</li>
    <li> This is really a magical product, works like a charm. My hair loss and breaking is reduced. Get this brush and protect your hair</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  Amazing for brushing without pain! cant go back to a regular brush now.</li>
    <li> This thing works perfectly. My young daughter always has tangled hair and complained about hair brushing. This brush has stopped the complaints!</li>
    <li> Good brush, I like it better than a regular brush</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well on wet hair. I was skeptical but it really is better than a regular brush</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush. I bought it for my 4 year old daughter that has super curly hair. It makes bath time so, so much easier. The knots come out easier than any other brush I&#x27;ve used with her. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This brush goes through my hair like a butter knife.  My hair is long and thick.  I simply wash my hair and place a small amount of crack in it and then brush it through.  It is amazing! If you have found yourself near tears trying to get tangles out of your hair, get this brush! It will not let you down!</li>
    <li> This works great outside the shower. I bought this explicitly for the shower - it did not work. My hair may be too thick, but the brush only glided over the top and never dug in to untangle and brush. It does, however, work fantastic outside the shower. Untangles my morning mess with ease.</li>
    <li> Did a great job the first few wet-hair brush-throughs, but the little rounded balls on the tips of each bristle have all come off (after less than a month of using it) and scratch my scalp.  It really did go through my thick hair smoothly and easily, so I was disappointed to find that I won&#x27;t be able to use it anymore because of the damaged bristle tips.</li>
    <li> best and only hair brush we use.  Great for little kids who get the knots and such.&lt;br /&gt;We use it wet and dry..</li>
    <li> Usually when you&#x27;re detangling you start at the bottom of the hair and work your way up. Not with this brush! You start at the crown of your head and let the brush do the work for you. And you&#x27;re usually not suppose to brush your hair when it&#x27;s wet, as it is at its most weakest state. But this brush works wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides through my hair, taking out a few tangles along the way. Completely painless. I&#x27;ve had a lot less fall out since using this brush.</li>
    <li> This product is great for women with very long, curly hair.  Normally it takes me about a half hour to brush through all of my hair with a flat brush, bristle brush or a comb.  With this brush, it takes about 10 minutes.  My hair is ~16 inches, is very thick and curly similar to Jennifer Freeman&#x27;s (from My Wife and Kids) hair.  It works even better when paired with \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Product\\&quot; located at[[ASIN:B002CMLHEC B002CMLHEC]]</li>
    <li> This brush works fairly well but I have concerns about durability. It does get though my baby fine hair without a problem, but the bristles appear thin and I will have to see how well this works in the long run.</li>
    <li> this brush does exactly what it says and does it perfectly and fast. my hair doesn&#x27;t break either! my hair feels so sleek afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, coarse hair and this brush is my only saving grace when I don&#x27;t condition. I have started giving them as gifts...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews but I just had to write one for this product.  I must say when it came in the mail I almost immediately sent it back because I thought I was dubbed into buying a $1 brush for $8.  When I tired it, I couldn&#x27;t believe it worked.  I usually can&#x27;t touch my daughter&#x27;s hair without her screaming and bawling tears of pain.  Now, she finally has untangled hair and looks like the sweet little girl that she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good, steady comb, not liking the fact that I feel that I&#x27;m not brushing, very soft to detangle my hair.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this brush because it untangles her hair quickly and easily... she uses it all the time now.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in new condition.  I have 2 kids with Very difficult hair.  This product is their favorite of several brushes that I purchased at the same time.  it brushes out wet tangles and is still flexible enough not to tug the kids&#x27; hair out of their head like some of the more rigid bristled brushes. Satisfied.</li>
    <li> I agree with all of the other reviews...this brush works effortlessly. Bought it for my mother for Christmas and now I&#x27;m ordering another for myself.</li>
    <li> Same price as the one at walmart yet it brushes better. Not only does it detangle the hair, but it actually brushes it&lt;br /&gt;BUT WHY COULDN&amp;#34;T I PICK THE COLOR I WANTED...&lt;br /&gt;yellow is such a terrible choice.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best brush I&#x27;ve used by far!  There&#x27;s something about the design of this brush that makes it feel great and doesn&#x27;t snag in tangles.</li>
    <li> Works very well. My hair tends to get more knots on days that I shampoo it (even though I always follow with conditioner), and this makes those days much less of a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: As with any brush, start at the ends and work your way up. Don&#x27;t just try to pull through any knots, or you&#x27;ll induce breakage (especially when your hair is wet).</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick, long hair that is easily tangled. This brush has made a huge difference when brushing her hair.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to use on my Labrdoodle but was too soft.  Didn&#x27;t detangle very well.  Good brush for my hair but not for my dog!</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about this brush and sure enough it&#x27;s great!! Easy to comb through wet hair. The only issue I have is that I thought I was purchasing a black brush and got a purple one instead. Other then that the brush is great :)</li>
    <li> It brushes my 4 yr old&#x27;s hair really well. Her hair tangles no matter what and she hates it being brushed. This isn&#x27;t perfect but I think it does very well and I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very tightly wound curly hair that becomes tangled on a daily basis. We both hate it when I have to brush her hair.  This brush has made it much easier on her and more tolerable for me as well.  When giving her a bath, I lather her hair with conditioner and brush it and the tangles come out with a bit of effort. I definitely recommend this brush for any parent of a child with difficult to brush hair.  It makes it much easier.</li>
    <li> Ok, I was skeptical too BUT I was at my wits end.  After years and years of struggling to detangle my hair, I came here and saw this brush with all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try.  I always hated my hair, hate it.  It&#x27;s  baby baby fine and very wavy which is impossible to detangle and would break just looking at it. I tried every single detangling solution available. They would work, but I would still lose gobs of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I just got this brush yesterday.  This morning before washing my hair there it was, sitting on my sink counter.  I stared at this brush thinking this is either going to work or it&#x27;s going to be a total nightmare and rip every hair out of my head.  I crossed my fingers and tried it.  It whipped through my hair like MAGIC, IT IS MAGIC PEOPLE!  I used no detangling spray, nothing!  If you have baby fine wavy hair you need this!  You must buy this to experience the miracle!  I also purchased the &amp;#34;tangle teaser&amp;#34; so I&#x27;ll compare the two, but I&#x27;m totally impressed with this brush after one use!!!!  I also had very minimal hair in the brush after running it through, not like when I use a wide tooth comb, my hair would come out in clumps :(( !!!  If you buy this you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> seriously the BEST! I will never use another brush again. My hair looks sooo much better</li>
    <li> Best brush in the world for tender headed kids. The flexible bristles tease the tangles out rather than yank. My 6 yr. Old has hair to her butt, I no longer threaten to chop it all off, I love this brush!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle brush.  My daughter cried every time we would comb her hair out after a bath because she has very thin fine hair that tangles easily.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this brush worked.  We love it!  No more tears!</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do. Great little brush</li>
    <li> No, I swear I am not impaired in the brain. ;) Let me paint the picture for you. A young girl with curly and thick hair dedicates her life to brushing her hair daily. Usually when brushing my hair, I experience various degrees of pain (even with a high pain threshold). So the first time I brush my hair with this lovely device and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working very well because I don&#x27;t feel any pain at all. It works like Moses parting the Red Sea of tangles in my hair. Buy it. It&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I ride a motorcycle with my hair down. It gets *super* tangled.</li>
    <li> The best brush I have owned!!! My hair knots like no ones business. This brush is easy on the hair and effective. All the brush colors are great. Works the same on dry hair as it does wet hair!</li>
    <li> i run this thru the curls in my weave and its glides thru easily without causing any shedding in the weave. it definitely is a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it</li>
    <li> Even when all the tangles have been combed out before my hair gets wet, I get tangles in the shower that used to take forever to get rid of. This brush works, and it&#x27;s gentle on the hair and the scalp.</li>
    <li> Buy one. Period. Perfect brush ever for wet or dry hair. Mine is medium length. Bought one for home, and one for work. Better, way better, than the Ouchless!!</li>
    <li> When it came, I was surprised at how &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; looking it was. Why does this look like any other brush? But something is different about it that really does detangle hair easier when it&#x27;s wet. It seems to be average on dry hair. But there has been a lot less screaming and crying from my girls when I use this brush on their wet hair. It seems to just be more flexible so it doesn&#x27;t pull as hard when combing through. It&#x27;s not perfect....I almost gave it only 4 stars because it can&#x27;t get out the toughest tangles, you know, basically the ones that are so tiny and knotted that you have to rip them out altogether? It&#x27;s too soft of a brush to pull that hard (which is why it is more gentle of course.). I had to pull out a fine tooth comb for those-  and that&#x27;s okay. A Good purchase!</li>
    <li> Honestly, it really has. I have very unmanageable frizzy curly hair, I would spend hours trying to de-tangle my hair when I get out of the shower or when I wake up in the morning with rats nest. After fighting with it and 5hairballs later I got sick of ripping out my hair and decided to search for something better.&lt;br /&gt;This has honestly saved my life, no pain and works like a charm. Only issue I see that it has some problem getting into the deeper parts of your hair if you have tangles there but if you keep working at it, you&#x27;ll get it eventually.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick hair but this brush doesn&#x27;t do a very good job at getting all tangles out. I feel like I always have microtangles in my hair unless I switch to a different brush. The bristles are too soft and spaced out. It just smoothes over the top surface of hair, leaving the inner hairs alone.</li>
    <li> There are times when I like using these brushes over my own. Anyway, the girls like using it.</li>
    <li> This product is genius !! This brush goes through my tangled hair with such ease... also pain-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for all hair types!!</li>
    <li> It says assorted colors. But I got all black!!!</li>
    <li> I loved this hairbrush as soon as I got it but after a few months the bristles started to fall out. I have fine long hair and it tangles easily. I am 27 &amp; still have to use hair detangler meant for little kids. This brush is amazing at detangling my hair but the quality it cheap and poor and I don&#x27;t think worth the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased several of these brushes because stupid me, I sat on one and squished the bristles. It&#x27;s amazing for the perfect blowout - gets the hair nice and straight and the bristles provide the right amount of air flow through the brush and each hair strand. I have noticed that my hair detangles easier and dries much faster when using this brush as opposed to a regular paddle or barrel brush.</li>
    <li> I aimlessly bought this brush and holy mackerel this thing is great! The brush literally combed through my hair like silk. I have no idea why or how it works so well but I am beyond happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is the best thing we have bought for our daughers hair. She has thin hair but a lot of it. All the way down past her waist. I brush it out when she gets out of the tub and it does awesome. No screaming and crying anymore. It also works great on dry hair. She is 5 and actually likes to brush her own hair now. I used it a couple of time on my own hair and it feel very nice.</li>
    <li> Nice quality brush -but i was sent the black one. I had purchased this for my 9 year old daughter - I wish you could choose your color - she will not like the black brush! I wanted any color but black :(</li>
    <li> I bought two of these brushes. My hair stylist recommended them and I&#x27;m glad she did. I have thick hair and de-tangling wet hair has always been a problem for me. I use this with a de-tangler/moisturizer that I&#x27;ve always used and it definitely works great. I use it on dry hair too and it works just as good. I highly recommend this product. I only wish I could&#x27;ve picked my own colors, but I am happy with the black and purple ones that I received.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not magic but it works good.  It was able to get through some tough tangles that another brush couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have really long, straight hair that WAS constantly tangled... this brush is awesome. I DO use it on wet hair and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> This brush untangles my 2 year old&#x27;s long hair without tears or tantrums.  I am extremely happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife who&#x27;s growing her hair out and has been having knot issues related to that. She loves this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her description: Great for thick hair. Cut the time for brushing my hair in half, and does it painlessly.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and bought one for each of my girls.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work given the hair and tears ive seen shed.  But so far they both love it and are no longer scared.  Wet hair! Dry hair! Bird&#x27;s nest!  don&#x27;t matter!  This brush is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I have ordered two of these brushes in the past and both were fantastic, but the third that I just ordered smelled like someone smoked a pack of cigarettes over it. I can&#x27;t believe how horrible it smells and it is currently sitting in its original wrapping in the box unusable.  If yours comes wrapped in a plastic bag check the smell inside of it before gifting it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Simple, yet highly effective for brushing wet hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife primarily uses this at our cottage when she gets out of the lake - and it makes brushing her long hair a breeze. Can&#x27;t quite figure out what makes this so different from other brushes, but for the price it is an excellent buy!</li>
    <li> My hair is long, very thick and tangles as soon as it gets wet. I always dread blow drying my hair and having to brush it out. However, this brush has changed that! No more pain, and I am able to brush it out more quickly. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have REALLY long thick hair. This brush does the trick. It is my out of the shower brush as it doesn&#x27;t get caught up in my wet hair and cause more tangles. I was shocked at how well it brushes through all my hair even when it is dry and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy or full of static. My 6 year old niece loves this brush as it doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush her hair. If you have a kid who doesn&#x27;t like to brush their hair because &amp;#34;it hurts&amp;#34; this is the brush for you.</li>
    <li> I have absurdly thick, long, exceedingly tangle-prone hair. I seriously spent late November of 2011 through February of 2012 with a ginormous impenetrable tangle that would slowly engulf my hair until my sister started calling me hermione granger :/ ever since then it&#x27;s been a battle requiring excessive amounts of detangler and conditioner with little success. I got this brush for Christmas and it BLEW MY MIND. It has been YEARS since I&#x27;ve been able to run a brush through my hair without bracing for the  scalp pain that will inevitably follow. If you have long hair that&#x27;s prone to tangles, get this brush!!!! You will not be disappointed!!! I have no idea how it works but it really really does.its a Christmas miracle!!!</li>
    <li> This brush us amazing! I have long, thick hair that is pretty much matted when I wake up, and it is downright painful to brush. I was ready to cut it all off, then I bought this brush. It gets right through the tangles with minimal effort. My SCALP even feels better after a week! I will continue to buy these brushes forever, and can&#x27;t recommend them enough! Best purchase ever!</li>
    <li> Bought this for an 11 year old girl with very thick hair.  Always a fight with Mom trying to comb all the way through that wet hair and not just the top layer.  Now, she has no complaints and says it works great!</li>
    <li> My african american daughter hated hair brushing time until now.  Even though she is only one she now tries to brush her own hair after a bath.  It is true to it&#x27;s promise, it brushes wet hair without pulling or snagging in hair.  I tried it also on my mildly curly Caucasian hair and it is fabulous, bought myself one too.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairbrush I ever have. It&#x27;s a life saver for easily tangled hair. Bought it for my mom and another travel size.</li>
    <li> Great brush, cheaper on Amazon than in my local stores</li>
    <li> I adore this brush. It has made the morning ritual with my two young, long-haired girls so much better. I don&#x27;t know why it works so much better than other brushes, but it is worth every cent. I recently ordered a second one for myself.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this brush! Easy to brush my hair right out if the shower- definetely a 5 star product!</li>
    <li> I have really long hair and it is always a tangled mess after washing it. This brush actually goes through my hair and detangles it without sprays and hair additives. I love this brush and would recommend it to anyone with long hair.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter won&#x27;t not even let me NEAR her with a brush after a lice scare two years ago at her daycare and I had to comb her hair to check. We were cutting it short and still it was a battle. I got this after someone on Facebook was raving about it. I figured it was worth even a chance that it would work. It&#x27;s AMAZING! She let&#x27;s me brush her hair wet, dry no problem anymore with this brush. I love it. Worth every penny and more.</li>
    <li> Love it. My 6 year old little girl has very long hair, she loves this brush because it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair at all, it can be wet or dry, it brushes right through..</li>
    <li> My 3 year old has crazy curls. They are beautiful, but hard to manage. We&#x27;ve tried all sorts of brushes, including the knot genie, but nothing works as good as this brush. I do still use detangler, but it does a great job on wet and dry hair. I will never use another brush on her curly hair again - it has saved countless tears</li>
    <li> BEST EVER. I use this every day, hair wet or dry. It&#x27;s a fantastic product and I usually never brush my hair.</li>
    <li> my girls have seriously super curly hair and everyday was a crying nightmare, but I thought I&#x27;d give this brush a try since it had great reviews, and it is the best brush ever! It does work much better if their hair is wet or sprayed with tangle spray or leave in conditioner, but then it almost just completely brushes right through and instead of it taking like 10 minutes of crying, its now like 30 seconds of crying and all brushed within a min or so. So wish I had found this brush long ago!</li>
    <li> It came with a HORRIBLE chemical smell to it. Don&#x27;t really want to use it on my child so I will be sending it back.</li>
    <li> I have curly ethnic hair that I have to wash everyday in order to style.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I get the best results ( style wise ) using a flat paddle brush.&lt;br /&gt;( My hair is styled through washing it. Once I&#x27;m out the shower that is it. Unless I want to do an up-do. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had zero expectations for this brush. I even told my mom &#x27;If it works on my hair it&#x27;ll work on anyones! Forget the reviews the real test is my hair!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I am used to normally having a handful of hair in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see maybe 5 strands of hair! Wow I can&#x27;t believe this actually works, I thought it was another silly gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt so soft on my hair, I couldn&#x27;t really tell if I was brushing it. I was so surprised that I ran out in a wet towel to show my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a beauty staple that I will forever love!</li>
    <li> This brush was originally given to me by a friend who&#x27;s niece has long beautiful hair and was told to give it a try. It is fantastic. It does not pull or tear your hair wether you brush it dry or wet. It also does not undo any styling you have done with curlers or hot iron. It is a simple, but very effective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my horses. It keeps their tails and manes in beautiful condition. The entire barn is using the brush at this point.</li>
    <li> Love these! Keep one in shower to brush after I&#x27;ve applied conditioner and when I rinse after with lukewarm water my hair is so much smoother. Keep one in bedroom to brush after shower. Really gets tangles out easier and less painfully than the expensive ones as seen on tv. Love these brushes! Great for kids hair too!!!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this brush!  I ordered it out of curiosity and some doubt as to it&#x27;s claims, but once I used it, I was amazed! I was considering cutting my long hair because of the struggle of de-tangling every morning ~ Now I don&#x27;t have to!  I&#x27;ve already recommended this to one friend, and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> These brushes are simply WONDERFUL! I was skeptical at first but after using them on my self and multiple children, the results are magical. I don&#x27;t have to hear screaming or crying anymore because the knots are no match for this brush! A must buy and I only wish I would&#x27;ve discovered them sooner!!!</li>
    <li> A lot of hair in this brush.</li>
    <li> Thank the Lord in the heavens above. This brush has already saved me a gallon of tears in just one short week. The daily struggle with my two girls was real and now it&#x27;s over. I will purchase one in each color and store them in every bathroom and travel bag. I will not let this brush out of my sight. This is a must buy if you have little girls. Must BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome for long hair.  Keeps hair for knotting when brushing wet.  Best price found on amazon!</li>
    <li> it works. I&#x27;ve ordered Wet brush and tried to different product but it is the same product with different box. anyway my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> This hair brush arrived with a foul odor. I thought the smell would go away but it has not. I wonder if there was a fire where it was stored since the smell has a burnt quality to it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great!</li>
    <li> Great brush. I use it whenever I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> It works, but could be better. I have tried lots of detangling brushes for my daughter. This one isn&#x27;t bad, but I found one at Kmart made by Goody that&#x27;s cheaper and works much better.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I slather on the conditioner &amp; brush it through her hair with this brush. No more whining &amp; crying about it. I wish it worked better on dry hair. I also wish my daughter could do it herself (she is 8). Its hard for her to brush through the tangles at the back of her head. Would buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> This is astonishing. I have hip-length hair that grows in very thick on my head, but the individual strands are fine and light -- a perfect recipe for all manner of snarls, tangles, knots, and general unpleasantness. It usually takes me 10-15 minutes to detangle after a shower, and that&#x27;s with using copious amounts of conditioner and leave-in detangler. I was skeptical about this, but with no detangler, I was able to get through all of that wet hair in about three minutes. So much easier than combing! And it pulled out about half as many hairs as I usually leave on my comb. Highly recommended! I only wish you could pick the color -- the random draw gave me an orchid-y shade of purple that I&#x27;m not crazy about. Plain black would&#x27;ve suited me just fine!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;de-tangle&amp;#34; anything.</li>
    <li> I actually found the bristles to be too flexible, requiring twice the brushing time as our normal routine. My daughter also thought the bristles were too sharp, so we switched back to a typical/cheap hairbrush. (TIP: we brush while the conditioner is still in the hair)</li>
    <li> I am 8 years old. My hair is long and it is fine. I always love to swim but there is a downside to it. Before I ever had the brush my hair got so, so, matted. It was like a rat&#x27;s nest after I swim. So then I got the brush for Christmas! And the person who gave it to me exclaimed that it said &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; and I was so excited! So, now I&#x27;ve started using it after my showers. It works very good. I love it. It does have a little tug, but it&#x27;s better than most brushes. I&#x27;m happy I have it.</li>
    <li> This brush is not great. The bristles are so forgiving that it glides right over the knots in my hair. Which i didn&#x27;t notice until a few days later when the small knots because huge and I actually had to cut a few out. I have fine thin hair and it knots up very easily.  Although taking a comb to my hair takes forever, it gets the job done. I also have noticed more breakage since using these brushes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have hair like mine hat easily knots. As this brush will ensure you have dreads in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have fine but thick extremely long hair (and a sensitive scalp, good combo I know). This brush is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like regular brushes so less pain and breaking. I will never use a regular brush again!</li>
    <li> I have LONG hair....almost to my bottom. I cannot tell you HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS BRUSH. It has simply changed my life. I was having to brush my hair before and after I washed my hair. Now, I just brush after I wash my hair. I LOVE IT. IT doesn&#x27;t pull hardly any hair out when I brush and it gently pulls the tangles out of my hair as I brush. I even brought another one for my Bichon Frise dog and it fluffs her hair out beautifully and easily. This is one of those purchases that I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without!</li>
    <li> This brush works.  But it is very similar to other soft core brushes that have been around for decades.  It replaces one bought about 10 years ago for a dollar that I have used for brushing conditioner through just shampooed hair.  It does smell bad, but the odor (from recycled tires, maybe?) does not transfer to your hair, as far as I can tell.  The retail price at this time is listed as $28.00, clearly fraudulent, which Amazon should not be permitting.</li>
    <li> Terrific for brushing tangled hair!</li>
    <li> Pulls, I bought this brush after reading the reviews that said it would not pull your hair, it does. I used it after washing my hair and it pulls. I used it on my dry hair and had much static electricity. I put it in the cat grooming container.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream! Seriously, every time I would brush my hair after a shower or bath it was so painful that I never really got all the tangles out. Not sure how this thing works so good but I will make sure to never be without one, ever!!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing!  My hair is always hard to brush after a shower and this goes right through! I love it, wish I would have known about it 15 years ago!</li>
    <li> I have fine, thick hair and this detangles in 1-2 minutes right out of the shower. It&#x27;s amazing and I&#x27;ve also gifted one of these each to my mom &amp; brother&#x27;s fiancé to show them how amazing it is. :)</li>
    <li> I get that this looks like your everyday brush (and an inexpensive everyday brush at that), but this thing is pretty spectacular!  I have lots of fine, curly hair I&#x27;ve been attempting to grow out.  It&#x27;s always frustrating to know I&#x27;m ripping some of it out trying to get through the knots (even carefully with a wide-toothed comb).  This brush glides right through like magic.  It&#x27;s actually quite nuts.  I keep it in the shower and use it to work conditioner or leave-in product through my damp hair before going through again with the wide-tooth.  No snarls, no struggle, no frustration, under $10.  Un-freaking-believable.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve tried to date for extremely knotty hair!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, we still have knots and tears and screams sometimes when brushing my pre-schooler&#x27;s hair after bath, but this brush has cut all that in half!  It is amazing what it works through.  Small knots are no longer an issue at all; big knots still are, but that&#x27;s just the nature of long hair that knots easily.  I use it now too.  I love this brush!</li>
    <li> My daughters have straight but thick hair that is prone to tangling.  I&#x27;d heard good things about this brush from friends and was really hoping for a brush that would do a better job of detangling than normal brushes.  My daughters do love the brush, as they say it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Great!  Unfortunately, it seems to me that the brush doesn&#x27;t hurt because it doesn&#x27;t actually BRUSH very well.  The bristles mush around, and glide through the top layer of hair, leaving large tangles under the top layer that aren&#x27;t easily seen.  The girls&#x27; hair LOOKS brushed but if I go to glide my fingers through- mats and tangles underneath.  If I use this brush to brush them out, I find myself fighting harder than usual because the bristles just keep moving around and don&#x27;t work through the tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that if I use the brush right out of the shower on them, if I leave extra conditioner on their hair I&#x27;m more able to detangle... but it&#x27;s still a fight.  I know I was foolish to expect some sort of miracle but the product reviews really made me think this was possible!  Two stars because the girls DO like the brush, and that does make it a little easier to make them sit still while I fight the good fight.  Again.</li>
    <li> My four year old daughter has long, naturally curly hair. Brushing her hair after baths had become a chore that neither my husband nor I looked forward to doing on account of the tears. One of my friends told me about this brush so I immediately purchased it. We are very pleased with the Wet Brush, and so is our daughter! It works best if we brush her hair in the bath while it is still soaking wet. It gets all the tangles out with minimal pain. The bristles are finer and more flexible than a typical hairbrush, which is why I think it works so well. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love the brush, so does my granddaughter, She likes it better than the other brush I bought that is advertised all the time on TV.&lt;br /&gt;I just wished I had received 2 different colors so that we could tell hers from mine.</li>
    <li> Love this and it does make brushing wet hair easier (and painless) but it breaks down after a bit</li>
    <li> I thought this was just a gimmicky product, but I&#x27;ve used it daily for years and I would never go back to using a wide-tooth comb in the shower for my course hair. In fact, I haven&#x27;t used any other brush on my hair, wet or dry, since I bought this two years ago. It&#x27;s extremely gentle, and glides through the hair on the nape of my neck (where I get the most tangles) with ease. My hair is quite fragile, and I definitely see a difference in the amount of breakage from what I used to get.</li>
    <li> My child is very tenderheaded and this brush has been a life saver.  It is great on tangled hair whether it is wet or dry.  We don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I have 2 daughters and both now do not complain when need to brush their hair with the Wet Brush! No tangles!</li>
    <li> I bought this for 4 granddaughters who have complained of painful comb outs when they wash their hair. They all love this easy on the head brush.</li>
    <li> I am a conservative person and do not like to spend a lot of money on junk, but this brush is awesome! I have long thick hair, and it gets very tangled after the shower. When i use this brush the tangles are considerably less and i dont feel nearly as much pulling on my head</li>
    <li> Ok so when I received this I literally said to myself and to the friend who was with me that I ordered a mediocre brush and i wasn&#x27;t going to open it and just return it. I ended up opening it and using it after my shower and I was shocked. It usually takes my 15-20 to brush my hair and not even all the way just the top and bottom. With this brush I had a full head of wet brushed hair in 5 minutes! It&#x27;s amazing! I purchased detangler brushes before and they were way more expensive than this and they sit in my drawer. This brush is a must have for anyone with problematic hair. My hair is long and very soft so it tangles while I&#x27;m brushing it but with this item I can enjoy my hair again! It&#x27;s a great product would rate it 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about trying this, but i&#x27;m so glad I did.  The bristles are VERY fine and flexible, so I doesn&#x27;t pull on hair at all.  I&#x27;ll never go back to a comb again.</li>
    <li> I love my wet brush. My friend at work suggested this brush and I&#x27;m not bald thanks to this brush! The brush helps with detangling your hair while you&#x27;re brushing it wet. Obviously. IT WORKS. I&#x27;m not BSing you either. I have really thin hair but I have a LOT of it so it looks like a MANE when I get out of the shower and towel dry it. Like honestly, birds compete to reach it first and nest. I once found a colony of homeless people curled up in there. This brush helped me get them out! I&#x27;m kidding obviously, but seriously it does work. I love this brush.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush.  I wish i had this my whole life.  I have long thick hair that i normally have to spray forever with detangler for a brush to get through my hair.  This brush just glides right through all the tangles.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Quality and packaging is not very good, would have preferred a different brush but we are using it… the bristles are so flexible that they don&#x27;t do a very good job combing though thick hair (which is why we need a good detangling brush).</li>
    <li> It detangles wet hair without breaking it, just like it says.  Keeps my granddaughter&#x27;s hair neat and smooth. Great product.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> First off, this brush DOES work very well in terms of detangling the hair!  In that regard, it does what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush 5 times now (once when dry and 4 times while wet) and every time it pulls out LOTS of my hair!  Much much more than when I use a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I used the brush in the shower and my scalp was sore for about an hour after! That is not a good sign and definitely validates that this brush pulls hair out in a MAJOR WAY!  I am also very gentle when I use any brush or comb on my hair so as not to pull or rip the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other concern is whether this brush causes any ripping or splitting of the ends.  It makes me worry that if the brush is pulling hair out so easily that it might also be damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use caution if you share similar concerns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to using a wide tooth comb with a leave in conditioning product.</li>
    <li> No, seriously. Getting the knots out of my daughters hair was a daily and very whine ridden chore. The brush works perfectly without the whining and her hair looks great. It saves time and makes for a peaceful morning... Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This brush does detangle my long hair but is not as good as advertised.  I still loose a lot of hair when using. Not much better than many of the other brushes I have tried.</li>
    <li> Note that this detangler brush is for wet hair only. I would prefer a detangler brush that works on both wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my girlfriend.  Her hair is thick and full of tangles, due to dying.  She has many brushes and this is the one she uses the most.  I wish I could of picked the color of the brush for her, but she had to settle for what they sent (which was a sky blue).</li>
    <li> Finally! A brush that can handle my daughter&#x27;s long, incredibly thick hair. It no longer takes her 20 minutes to brush. Wish someone would have told me about the Wet Brush years ago!!</li>
    <li> Attention: do you have a small child with long hair? Does that hair get tangled? This is a MUST PURCHASE.&lt;br /&gt;The brush can get tangles out of dry hair with a little effort but it is magically easy on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;My child has no more tears, no more fuss or tantrums when it is time to brush out her hair.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very thin and flexible. I use it on my own hair, it is even great for matted doll hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I brush a lot of hair each day from three dramatic girls and get screamed at a lot in the process;  I personally think it is comfortable and most importantly it works great with my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. It has cut down significantly on the belly aching and blood curdling screams.  My hair dresser recommended this brush because her daughter liked it.  I my ordering two more because it is the only brush my kids want me to use and I need one in each bathroom.</li>
    <li> I first purchased these brushes a few years ago from a nearby salon. LOVED the product. One of best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used in almost 50 years. My two daughters also love the brushes...all they ever use. Was thrilled to find another source to buy these where the price was so reasonable!!Would recommend brushes and source to anyone!!</li>
    <li> My wife said it&#x27;s the best brush she has ever used. She was obsessed with it when she first got it. No negatives to it.</li>
    <li> Amazing on just washed hair or tangled pool hair. This brush is awesome and I highly recommend. Best Brush EVER!!!</li>
    <li> I have long,extremely thick hair that&#x27;s always difficult to comb out after a shower and nearly impossible after swimming. I was skeptical about this brush but figured it was worth a shot. I was pleasantly surprised to discover it works exactly has advertised. It untangles my thick hair after a shower or swim without any effort at all. It is gentle and doesn&#x27;t break the hair. What used to take me 20 minutes now takes about 30 seconds. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a hard time untangling hair. It works great on dry hair too. Can&#x27;t wait to use it next time I go to the beach- I think it will even be a match for wind and waves.</li>
    <li> I have straight fine mid lenght hair but super dry so when I get out of the shower and dry it with a towel it looks like a giant EXTREMELY tangled hairball. It takes my husband 10 minutes or more to brush it and it is super painful. And I can make another huge hairball out of the hair that got ripped out. I felt helpless but desperate for help so I decided to try it because it came to the point I literally dreaded washing my hair which is ridiculous. I didn&#x27;t expect anything amazing really so I dreaded using it too but I did and I was able to VERY EASILY get all the tangles out within 2 minutes and NO pain at all. Also it barely ripped any of my hair off. I am absolutely shocked and amazed!</li>
    <li> This brush looks just like any other brush you&#x27;d find at a grocery store or beauty supply store. The bristles are soft and have some give to them, but it really does untangle hair with ease. No more standing outside the shower, getting soaked, trying to brush my daughter&#x27;s wavy hair. She can now do it herself. And it does work with dry hair as well, though it may be a bit static-y afterwards. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with curly or wavy hair that tangles easily.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this working, because my daughter and I have VERY tangly log hair. Then, when I received it, and saw and felt it, I thought, &amp;#34;there&#x27;s no way this will work&amp;#34;, because it&#x27;s really not that different than any other brush, or so it seems. But then I used it! It&#x27;s amazing! I don&#x27;t know how or why it works, but it does! Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  I have terribly tangles in my hair after I shower and this is the only brush that has worked on getting them out without too much pain.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that after a year the little tiny balls on the end of the bristles start to fall off, but that isn&#x27;t a huge deal.  I will just buy a new one once mine is destroyed.</li>
    <li> use it daily, love it! very helpful!</li>
    <li> I have a wet brush I bought from my hairdresser and loved it, so I ordered a couple extra on here.  As soon as I opened it, I should have returned it.  The packaging smell (plastic smell)  was overwhelming on the brush itself.  It was so bad that I tried washing it and then letting it &amp;#34;air&amp;#34; out for a couple weeks.  It still reeks,  there is no way I can use it and have my hair smelling like plastic.  I recommend buying from your salon, not on here.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, It actually does what it claims. It will not pull your hair at all. So if you have small children I think it will be a very good idea to buy it. the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it smells but just wash it and it will be ok.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for my 2 y/o daughters hair and is very gentle. We lost our first one and just had to order another one.</li>
    <li> Works great ~ but struggles a little on thick hair</li>
    <li> Great product! Got to my house very fast and I love this brush.</li>
    <li> My dad has super pin straight hair and my mom has very curly hair. I know this may sound strange but, because of this my hair is a mixture of all three hair types: straight, wavy, and curly. It&#x27;s straight in the front, but my fly aways are curly. Super curly in the back, with the exception of a small section of hair that is very fine and pin straight. And it&#x27;s wavy everywhere else. This makes way for lots of tangles, especially in the back where my super curly and fine straight hair mix. This brush makes detangling as painless as possible and it just glides through my hair when wet. I never have to be afraid of detangling my hair again! I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old now brushes her own hair with this. It has really made a difference in a tear free process.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! I have really thick and curly hair and this brush went right through it. It didn&#x27;t snag or pull my hair out like other brushes do. I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush to use on wet hair. I have very thick and long hair, normal brushes cause tangles and pull my hair when I use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use this brush on my dry hair, the bristles are not thick enough to work when it is dry, for wet hair this brush is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this brush, it doesn&#x27;t tug like regular brushes, so less pain and less hair loss. My daughter who is 3 no longer yells and cries when I have to brush her curly hair when it gets all nappy.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d read some reviews here on Amazon for detangling creams and ran across this brush.  Must admit, I was skeptical but decided to try it.  Thank goodness I did.  I have to buy another one for my daughter.  We both love it that much.  She and I both struggle with tangles.  She has such a sensitive head that brushing her hair is never fun.  This makes it so easy.  Thank you!  Awesome brush.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Works as described to get tangles out of wet hair even on thicker longer hair it works. Highly recommend this for anyone with fine hair that worries about breakage.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I use it on my goldendoodle and she enjoys being brushed now!</li>
    <li> My wet brush saves me at least 10 minutes a day and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. I use the brush in the shower to distribute conditioner the again after I&#x27;ve towel dried. My hair is past my shoulders and thin but I have a ton of it. I&#x27;d have a buzz cut by now if it weren&#x27;t for this brush.</li>
    <li> It really works! The bristles are sturdy but flexible and detangles my hair fast and fairly painless.</li>
    <li> This brush does not work, save your money. Does not get out the tangles out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after reading the positive reviews. After receiving the brush and using it, I am not a fan. It feels very cheap and is not good for thick hair.</li>
    <li> Very good product but i wish you could chose the color.</li>
    <li> I found this brush at a major cosmetology trade show. I always chastised my clients on brushing wet hair. I know that it will cause sever damage because hair is extremely vulnerable when it is wet. I have very long, color treated hair and absolutely dreaded shampooing my hair. Mainly due to the time it took to detangle it and all the breakage and hair loss. Ok , I thought. I will give this a try. I bought one and used it that night. Might I say, I am a very happy woman. Now keep this in mind that this brush is designed to be used on wet hair. I do not use it on dry hair. I bought 30 more brushes the next day and began selling them. In the 20 something years as a hairdresser, I truly believe I have found a remarkable brush.</li>
    <li> The best brush I have ever owned! I have long, thick hair, and the tangles after the shower (no matter what kind of conditioner I use) were unbearable. A friend had this brush, and I tried it one time. I immediately ordered one for myself!</li>
    <li> Works so well I am on here purchasing another one because my husband keeps stealing mine when he goes on business trips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the father of a 10-year-girl old with thick, full hair. It&#x27;s very prone to tangling, even when using a lot of Pantene conditioner. Just got this brush, and it&#x27;s amazing- it really does work out the tangles very gently and easily, even at the crown of her head where her hair is so thickly layered that very painful tangles often occur.</li>
    <li> My 2.5 year old daughter has hair mid-way down her back. It&#x27;s long and she doesn&#x27;t like to have it put up. She also twirls her hair when she is sleepy (which seems like all the time). This gets through her snarls relatively quickly - and there are some pretty major knots that form. This is the third brush I&#x27;ve bought - I kept two for our house and another I bought for my 12 year old niece who has thick hair as well. It&#x27;s worked great!</li>
    <li> Long thin hair that I usually keep in a pony, at home mostly and only wash it when needed to keep color fresh and to smell good.  I could not BELIEVE how amazing this thing worked.  I did use some &amp;#34;No More Tangles Leave-In Conditioner&amp;#34; but I am not sure this brush would have cared.  Just make sure your  hair is wet.  You could probably de-tangle dreadlocks using this brush and No More Tangles Spray or Wen shampoo/conditioner or something like that.  Delivered practically overnight.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Good brush, after a few years it has become less effective.  but overall a good brush for easily tangled hair.</li>
    <li> It really helps detangling my hair after shower. I have curly/very wavy hair. Now, I use this brush first to detangle everything and finish of with a comb. Very good brush! I did notice the smell someone mention in a previous review, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much that would make me not use the brush. I have also used with dry hair and it also performs very well.</li>
    <li> this brush works great on wet long hair</li>
    <li> My daughter is 6 with fine tangly hair. We have bought no less than 10 combs/picks/brushes and various detanglers, tried the gamut of shampoos &amp; conditioners and many other recommended regiments (combing hair before bed, in the shower, not combing hair when wet, etc) to alleviate the pain and no matter what, combing her short hair has produced continuous ouches and yelps which hurts her and hurts me when I see how sad it makes her. I saw this product in a parent magazine and decide to look into it. From day one, with wet or dry hair, with or without conditioner, my daughter exclaims that she loves her hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. She is all smiles and so am I. I cannot recommend this product enough!</li>
    <li> This brush is insane! I too spent 20 minutes or more every morning brushing out my very thick, curly red hair, but now I don&#x27;t have to! Seriously though, I have a sensitive scalp and brushing my snarls out was so painful. This barely seems to snag at all. How??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lightweight, perfect size (not too small, not too large), comfortable to hold, seems durable and well-made (I ordered from Amazon), and (most importantly) it does what&#x27;s advertised - no more pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I actually can&#x27;t think of a single one. Let&#x27;s hope it&#x27;s durable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An awesome side-note: my old brush caught a LOT of my hair. This brush pulls out a lot less hair; it actually detangles!&lt;br /&gt;If you have pain brushing your hair (even a little bit), buy this brush - it is worth it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK general brush, but I gave up on the supposed detangling aspect after a few strokes on my wet hair.  I could feel it breaking the hair somewhat, but I couldn&#x27;t control it as I can with stiffer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the kind of detangling brush I&#x27;ve used all my life. [[ASIN:B003B6MH8I PHILLIPS Wristsaver 14 Hair Brush (Model: BP0014)]] I just start at the ends and move in.  The stiffer bristles give me more feedback as to when I&#x27;m tearing hair.</li>
    <li> Finallyyyyy!!!!, I found  peace in the mornings before school, this brush do the job perfectly , My daughter loves it. She has a very long thick hair, and she doesn&#x27;t like brush often , I have to make her do it at least for school, this brush is my best friend.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I really doubt I&#x27;ll ever use another brush again. I always loved a paddle brush I&#x27;d had for years but now i literally never use it. Worth every penny &amp; more.</li>
    <li> Love it! My two year old actually lets me brush her hair now. Wish I would have bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING. I don&#x27;t know how it works but it&#x27;s like magic. When I get out of the shower my hair is usually a tangled mess but this brush just glides through from root to tip without any hassle or snagging. I don&#x27;t even need a detangling spray anymore. Love this brush!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has been begging me to get the &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; detangling brush. So my first instinct is to go to my Amazon app and see how much they have it for and read some reviews. This came across my search and from reading other reviews it made me think this might work instead. Hmmmmmmm...... When my daughter opened the box she looked at me and asked why I got her a brush. LOL! It was my fault I didn&#x27;t look closer while I was researching this product, I didn&#x27;t realize this is just a regular brush like other brushes in our house. We did however put it thru some testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 daughters 10 &amp; 8 yrs. old. My 10 yrs. old have Type 3C - Curly Coily hair, my 8 yrs. old have 3A-3B - Curly Spiraly hair and myself have straight hair; all pass shoulder length (Yes, my hubby is one lucky guy! He gets to unclog the tub once a week. LOL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product testing:&lt;br /&gt;The Wet Brush Vs. $1 Dollar Tree Paddle Brush&lt;br /&gt;The Wet Brush Vs. $4 Detangling Brush from Walmart (Goody Brand)&lt;br /&gt;To my hair no difference from my $1 Dollar Tree and Goody brush. To my 8 yrs. old Curly spiral daughter no difference. Still the same &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34; scream and whine. To my 10 yrs. old Curly coiled hair at first I didn&#x27;t hear complaints, which is good. But it took me a minute to realize the brush bristles are bendable thin like so the effect was nearly a trick. The brush only brushes the top part of her hair and the bottom close to her scalp wasn&#x27;t being touched at all that is why no scream. In this case I had to take a comb to part the hair to half and by doing that it was time consuming and yes - can you imagine trying to part the &#x27;rat nest&#x27; like in half? My daughter started whining and there goes the &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34;. Needles to say compare to my $1 Dollar Tree brush and good ol&#x27; Goody brush it&#x27;s still the same result. With Dollar Tree and Goody I only had to part my kids hair 4 ways, with this brush about 6 ways. 3 Stars since it&#x27;s not a bad brush but not a GREAT brush!</li>
    <li> I use this brush every time I wash my hair and let me tell you, with my fine tangled hair it&#x27;s a time saver for me. I was always having to put more product in my hair to remove the tangles, but now I just brush the tangles out in the shower and dry it and I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> cuz i always untie my hair, my hair usually tangles all the time. But when i comb my hair with this brush before i take shower, this brush combs my hair perfectly.</li>
    <li> Annoyed. Ordered this with the intention of receiving a black brush as pictured (I have no desire for bright colored brushes and there wasn&#x27;t even any colors pictured) to my dismay a bright purple one arrives in the mail and now it won&#x27;t let me exchange or return it. Everyone raves over this brush so I was quite excited to try it but this just put a damper on it. I could&#x27;ve picked up any of the colored ones at my local target it that was what I wanted but I was specifically looking for the black. PLEASE figure out why your system is not allowing returns or exchanges so I can get what I intended.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I never thought I could be in love with a brush. Where have u been my whole life?  I have long curly hair. It&#x27;s not thick, but I have a lot of it. I usually use a wide tooth comb in the shower to disperse my conditioner through my hair. It hurts like heck. I struggle through tangle after tangle. By the time I&#x27;m done the size of the hair ball I accumulate is ridiculous.  Then the &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; came into my life. I swear I feel like I&#x27;m not even brushing my hair. It magically and gently untangles my hair, wet or dry. Us curly haired girlies know getting a brush through dry hair is scalp suicide. It hurts and there&#x27;s hair everywhere. Not with the Wet Brush.  I predominately use it wet to brush the conditioner through my hair.  My hair is healthier. More manageable, and believe it if not for some reason I don&#x27;t need as much hairspray since brushing with this. I LOVE LOVE LOVE This brush.</li>
    <li> My daughters have difficult hair and this helps immensely.  Less pain and crying.  Seven more words about a brush, hmmm.</li>
    <li> There are many brushes out there like this one. I ordered this one because of a very positive and hilarious review a father wrote. So GLAD I did. This brush is great! Glides right through my six year old granddaughters (very long) wet hair. She will even brush her own hair now! I can not praise this brush enough. The only thing I would change about this is I wish you could pick the color. We were sent black and my granddaughter had hoped for a pretty colored one, but hey it really works!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that is perpetually tangled. I didn&#x27;t brush it for years on the advice of a stylist, but I like brushing it sometimes and this is the least painful brush I&#x27;ve ever found to detangle it. Makes my hair brushable. I usually brush it dry right before I get in the shower--then it&#x27;s easier to clean and detangle. I&#x27;ll buy another one of these if this one ever breaks and I recommend it to everyone with difficult hair.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on hair, but cannot brush completely through underlayers (our kid has fine, not too thick Caucasian hair that we regularly condition with a premium product), end up with a rat&#x27;s nest unless a second, firmer brush is also used to brush the back of her head.</li>
    <li> Sorry for the great review when I bought it! Now it&#x27;s just a mess of a brush, moldy, falling apart and pulling out hair!</li>
    <li> Just used the brush after showering today and it worked really well! I have long, thick hair, and it only took 2 minutes to detangle the mess as apposed to 7-10 with a normal brush in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great brush-has helped get knots out easily.</li>
    <li> Super awesome brush.  My hair tangles badly (a lot of very fine hair that is long) and this brush is amazing.  I&#x27;ve never had a detangling brush before that actually worked.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great detangling brush</li>
    <li> It was AMAZING!! I had like 2 birds nests in my hair and this got rid of them after half an hour. This brush is a MIRACLE!!! Total 5 stars. Hope this review helps you!</li>
    <li> Does the job. My 2-year-old doesn&#x27;t complain anymore :)</li>
    <li> I can only say that I like it because I bought it for my little granddaughter.  Her mother told me it works well.</li>
    <li> I really had my doubts about being able to brush my hair while it was wet and not lose clumps of hair.  If you have those kind of doubts, just throw them out of the window.  I have never been able to wet brush my hair until I bought this Wet Brush!  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Got here quickly and looks very good will try it out X-mas morning to see how it performs.</li>
    <li> My 5 year-year-old daughter has long hair and it is a chore to comb or even pick through it.  This brush, when used after her bath, works wonders.  Her review of the brush is simply, \\&quot;It&#x27;s good because it doesn&#x27;t hurt.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Just like someone else said: i don&#x27;t know how they make those bristles differently than other hairbrush makers, but this one works like magic! Got one for each member of my family!</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job of getting knots out of hair when wet.  Very soft.  The only down side is that because it is very soft, it doesn&#x27;t get down to scalp.  Have to use a regualr brush or comb for that.  But since I bought it for detangling, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this brush works but it does. It detangles my crazy curly hair with ease either wet or dry. It also feels very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I received a bad brush in the beginning, but was given a new one by the Wet Brush Company it&#x27;s self shipped at their cost.  Not only did this company made their customer happy and now a lifetime user of their product, I feel every Man Woman and Child across the color spectrum if they are tired of having their hair pulled out by other grooming combs and brushes or over priced  items who claim No More Ouch! with wet or dry hair, to pick this one up, you will not be disappointed,</li>
    <li> I kept brushing and brushing my hair with this, thinking that I was brushing but really my hand brushes better then this brush. If you have thin hair, I can see it might work but I have thick lushes hair and this brush is no good for me.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair. It&#x27;s kind of long (past my shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-No pain at all when brushing. I don&#x27;t have to hold sections of my hair to avoid painful tugging.&lt;br /&gt;-I can use the brush in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Brush itself has bad smell, probably from whatever process they use to manufacture it.&lt;br /&gt;-It takes longer to completely brush through and detangle my hair than it does with other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;-Handle is kind of awkward since it&#x27;s so flat, and it doesn&#x27;t have a hole in the end to hang it in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the pain-free brushing makes up for everything I don&#x27;t like about the brush. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This brush is a miracle worker! It works remarkably well. It gets tangles out quickly and easily, without pain. Works best with wet hair, but also works on dry hair. This is the best product you can get if you need help with tangle-prone hair!</li>
    <li> does not work on thick wavy hair. i feel like it might even be ripping my hair more than average brushes.</li>
    <li> My stylist introduced this brush to me and I love it. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and when I used to brush it when wet, I had a lot of breakage. I love this brush and if it ever fails on me I&#x27;ll definitely by another one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing ever for little girl wet hair! No more tears after bath time!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before deciding to purchase this brush, and was highly skeptical. However, I was not disappointed- this brush is awesome! It effortlessly glides through tangles. My hair is normally pretty straight and relatively easy to comb, although it is deceptively  easy to  tangle it, and strands break very easily (very thin strands of hair).  This brush shortened the time needed to brush my hair significantly, as I no longer need to section it out and brush each chunk. I use it mainly on dry hair, but it works pretty well on wet hair too. Already two friends that have tried it went bought their own!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot less hair in my brush and a lot less tugging.  This is the best brush I ever used.</li>
    <li> I am a 24 year old guy and I have kind of long hair. but my hair is very thick and all of the hairbrushes that I have before either pull really hard on the knots or break after a month or two.  I have had this brush for almost 2 weeks now and I love it.  it just glides through my hair and leaves it a lot smoother and less tangled then before.  my only complain is that this brush is a little pinker then I thought.  but hey that&#x27;s what a guy gets when he buys a product designed for women. lol</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush. I have long, straight, fine hair that has a tendency to get lots of tiny tangles. This glides through any tangles post-shower effortlessly. It&#x27;s also great for dry hair. My sister, unlike me, has full curly hair and borrowed this brush once and loved it so much I got one for her as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for all hair types, especially those prone to shower tangles.</li>
    <li> I emailed the company because I bought two brushes at the local red concentric circles store and they were fine, then came to Amazon and ordered two more which smelled like tires. Really strong rubber smell.  I ended up leaving those two in the garage for a couple of weeks (in fact my neighbor commented that I must have gotten new tires because she could smell them) and eventually the smell decreased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I emailed the company and they responded as below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The smell comes from the rubber coating. The reason that the smell is so distinct is because the brush is in such high demand that it comes in from our factory and gets shipped directly out.  This does not allow the proper ventilation time for the smell to dissipate.Some brushes that I have in the warehouse do have a little odor.....It is not bad for your health. The smell usually dissipates within one to two weeks. I have found that by using baking soda on the brush, it also helps take the odor away.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do work really well, so I have put up with having to &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; them in order to be able to use them.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my VERY tender-headed almost-6-year-old daughter, who has long, fine, straight hair...and lots of it. We&#x27;ve tried numerous brushes and combs. She had gotten to the point that she would say, &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t I just get it all cut off??&amp;#34; because she hated having it brushed so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 months ago, while out shopping one day, we came across this brush, and she asked if we could buy it. She thought that it was the detangling brush she&#x27;d seen on a TV infomercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has dramatically changed our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that&#x27;s a strong statement, but when you have a 5-year-old who wakes up happy, but then is reduced to tears EVERY SINGLE MORNING because her hair is a tangled mess and brushing HURTS, a product that takes that away is a GODSEND! I can even brush her hair now in the same room with her sleeping baby brother now - something I NEVER would have tried before The Wet Brush. NO crying, no screaming, no &amp;#34;can I just cut it all off??&amp;#34; anymore - just a happy, sleepy-eyed little girl getting her hair brushed peacefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my own thick, long hair now, and it&#x27;s truly amazing. It glides through, gently removing the tangles as it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend The Wet Brush to anyone who is looking to end the tearful drama at hair-brushing time!!</li>
    <li> It works, but this has to be a marketing ploy. I have a Revlon rectangular paddle brush with the exact same shaped spikes on it that I&#x27;ve had for years, and it does the same thing. I bought this because I thought there was some magical technology for it to work better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever tried, but its just a brush with little plastic nibs on it like a lot of other brushes. I mean it works, but you don&#x27;t need this specific brush. Of course it works when wet, it&#x27;s made of waterproof materials and the plastic bits just slide through the hair, like many other brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush is great. It doesn&#x27;t pull or break the hair. My daughter used it and asked me to buy her one too.</li>
    <li> Best brushes ever.  We got three at one time, all quality!  These are great for wet hair.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to comb out my tangles in the shower.  It is amazingly gentle yet effective at getting through my long, thick, curls.  I&#x27;m losing way less hair in the shower than when I was finger combing or using a wide toothed pick.  It also saves time compared to other methods. I&#x27;ll be buying another one when this one needs replacing.</li>
    <li> I just got this brush a couple of days ago and three bad things that I noticed about it: 1) the brush smells awful, 2) the back of the brush had some scratches/scuff like marks on it, and 3) the product looks like it&#x27;s a fake/imitation because of the poor quality. The chemically smell from the brush actually stuck to my hair as well. All that being said the brush does actually work. It&#x27;s unfortunate that I won&#x27;t be keeping the product unless I get a genuine product that doesn&#x27;t smell or makes my hair smell. I will be contacting the company about my issues.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. I love it! I also have a toddler who is prone to getting knots in the back of his hair. I literally run after him with this brush and it takes them right out! He doesn&#x27;t like to sit still. :)</li>
    <li> I bought one for my daughter and had to buy a second one for myself! Even with dry hair, it pulls less and feels good on the head.</li>
    <li> I did not like it.  It was hard on the scalp and hair.</li>
    <li> this brush is amazing I always use to just dry my hair without combing it bc I would always tangle my hair more but once I used this and let my hair dry my hair was so straight I don&#x27;t even need a hair straightner anymore. It&#x27;s the perfect brush for hair that is half straight half wavy.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best detangling brush in exsistence.  And I have tried a TON.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for a couple of months.  I initially thought it was going to be a problem solver for my daughter&#x27;s hair or mine.  Yes, it does glide through wet hair, but only the top layer.  The knots that were underneath are still there and must be combed through with a comb.  It works about the same on dry hair.  My daughter has a ton of baby-fine hair.  Mine is thick and curly.  Doesn&#x27;t work that well for either of us.  It&#x27;s a cute brush though and I wouldn&#x27;t return it (if that was even an option).</li>
    <li> Received all black. Would have liked some colored ones.</li>
    <li> Where was this brush all my life?! I&#x27;m a Latin girl with thin curly hair. My hair has always tangled a lot and really easily. As a child the process of getting my hair brushed didn&#x27;t come without tears. After having my son my hair started to fall, as most women postpartum. Since my hair is always tangled after I shower I was losing even more hair when brushing it. So I came in amazon and found this brush that has cut my hair detailing time to half of what it used to be. Not only that it feels so good on my scalp when I use it. Very massage like. I will use this brush on my son and future daughter (wishful thinking) since both my hubby and I have curly hair so the kids have no other type of hair option.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I constantly had problems with my hair; it sometimes got to the point where I literally had to pull my hair apart in order to detangle it. This brush solves all my hair problems. I use it right when I get out of the shower, and it glides through my hair. It does not hurt or yank my hair whatsoever. It also keeps my hair smooth and untangled all day! I recommend this brush to everyone.</li>
    <li> I used to dread brushing my hair after the shower (as gross as that sounds). Mostly because my hair is so thick and full of knots after the shower. This brush looks like a normal brush but it really isn&#x27;t!!! I went from 20-30 minutes of painful brushing to around 5 minutes or less!! I&#x27;m so thankful someone took the time to make this product!! I hope you sell it forever. I might have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I got this because of it&#x27;s popularity and reviews of other buyers - and am not disappointed - the qualify and affordability of this is better than anything we can get locally, and we do live in a metro area of 1 million plus.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for de-tangling long wet hair, with or without leave in conditioner.  And it doesn&#x27;t cost the fortune I&#x27;ve paid or high end brushes a the beauty supply.</li>
    <li> Works great with fine, long hair.  This is one of few brushes that does not pull or rip my wet or dry hair out.  Works wonders with easily tangled hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that my 3 girls will let touch their hair.  I call it, &amp;#34;the magic brush&amp;#34; and it takes every tangle out perfectly-with few if any tears.  Inexpensive, sturdy and I have ordered one for each of the girls.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and I have thick but fine hair. I always have issues with get &amp;#34;rats nests&amp;#34; under all of my hair. This brush is amazing to get through my hair. My 2 year-old also enjoys this brush. Spray a little bit of water in her hair and we can brush right through her hair without her saying &amp;#34;owie&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I saw these things in my hair dresser&#x27;s salon. I was doubtful that these could be good for your hair but I came home, broke down and bought one for my own stocking at Christmas. It works wonderfully and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any damage to my hair (not sure I would anyway) but I still wonder how these aren&#x27;t bad for your hair. Shouldn&#x27;t this have been done by now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put: It quickly brushes and tangles our long wet hair. That&#x27;s all I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush. If you have never tried this brush, you are really missing out. I have very thick hair and have never had much luck brushing my hair when it is wet. This brush takes all the effort and pain out of brushing your hair while it is wet. No effort at all to get all of the tangles and knots out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I ran out of conditioner and didn&#x27;t have time to run to the store and get a new bottle. I was shocked that even without conditioner The Wet Brush worked just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would especially recommend The Wet Brush to parents of children with thick, hard to comb hair.</li>
    <li> the best brush, it goes right through my knots and it does not pull my hair at all</li>
    <li> I have three of these now (one for my apartment, one for my parents&#x27; house and one for traveling) and I have no idea how I survived without them. I&#x27;ve had these for over a year and I feel compelled to write a review because of how often I use them. I have incredibly thick, wavy hair and it used to be SO painful to comb it after every shower. This works super well, is painless, and detangles in seconds. I&#x27;m currently at the beach and for the first time in my life I don&#x27;t have to shower and comb my hair for hours after dipping in the ocean. LOVE this brush!</li>
    <li> By far the best brush I have ever owned in my life...hands down.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Saves me lots of crying and whining.</li>
    <li> Works fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;Upon receipt of this brush, I actually discovered that I&#x27;d already purchased one about a year ago and had not meant to buy the same brand. While it works well for a month or two, eventually the bristles start to come apart and yank uncomfortably on the hair. Next time, I&#x27;ll be sure to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, enjoy it while you can because while it stays together, it does work very well.</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft. You still have to be gentle in brushing hair to untangle, but it does a good job doing so.  If I loose this brush, u would buy it again.</li>
    <li> My daughter has fine, easily tangled hair and is very sensitive.  This brush works great and is better than other brushes we&#x27;ve tried at detangling her hair without so much pain-wet or dry.  Not sure it would work well on thick hair though.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my super tangled hair and got the tangles out so fast and painless it blew my mind. I had to get it for myself, so happy I did.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, slightly curly hair.  Had lots of tears and frustration until we got this brush.  It is gentle, durable, and great for her hair.  So happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair since I was five years old. My hair is thick, fine, and nearly to my butt. As lustrous as it is, my hair has definitely sent me on a quest for the holy grail of brushes... and after 20 years of searching. I can safely say that this is as close as it gets. Most of the time, this brush practically glides through my hair, and even when I take on more difficult detangling jobs, it still manages to get through my hair with minimal damage and fighting. Wet or dry, this brush is legit. Just, wow.</li>
    <li> Works good my niece love it</li>
    <li> The brush detangles hair wet or dry. It&#x27;s awesome on my son&#x27;s easily tangled hair and my shoulder length hair.  It lacks a star because it&#x27;s not the best quality.  Few of the bristles are stuck together, held by one rounded tip.  It is such a great brush that could use better craftsmanship.  Personally, I would pay more to buy a higher quality version of this brush.</li>
    <li> I have semi-curly hair with a coarse texture.  I dread washing it because of the tangled mess is becomes when wet.  I had serious doubts any brush would make a difference, but this brush WORKS!  It easily combs through wet or dry tangled hair without pulling, breaking or otherwise damaging the hair or my tender head.  It is a miracle and I would highly recommend it.  I ordered 2 more for my nieces.  A MUST PURCHASE ITEM!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very curly hair and would be knotted very easily. She hated to brush her hair until she got this brush. Now when her hair is wet it is very easy for her, and she finds that even when it is dry, it is much easier to brush than with other brushes. We even bought a second one so she could have one upstairs and downstairs.</li>
    <li> Initially looking at this brush, it seems like any other brush you would buy elsewhere.  However, I can&#x27;t explain why it works so wonderfully!  My daughter has fine, long hair in which she wears headbands and always seems to get something sticky in her hair.  It has been a battle to chase her down to brush the tangles out.  I have used wide tooth combs in the shower for her hair and specialty brushes to remove tangles and this is by far the best one (for the shower)  ...... I am not as crazy about it when her hair is dry ( I guess that&#x27;s why they call it the &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34;).  We wet her hair, shampoo, and add conditioner.  With the conditioner in her hair we use the brush .  The tangles come right out!  No crying, no pulling away ...... she just continues playing with her bath/shower toys.  Every time we use this brush I just shake my head in amazement ...... This is one happy mommy!</li>
    <li> I think this brush is magic. I have a 5 yr old with SPD and her head is very sensitive. She would scream and cry every single day when I brushed. It was so challenging. The wet brush does not hurt her. It appears to be pulling on her hair still to get snarles out but the bristles are flexible and so the give with the hair so it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I will never buy another brush again. Has made brushing a breeze. Works really well with wet hair too.</li>
    <li> I love the brush, but ordered black and received pink. Not happy!&lt;br /&gt;I needed it for part of a gift and didn&#x27;t have time to bother returning it.</li>
    <li> Works excellent on wet hair and no pulling or tearing out of hair. Great brush. If you are looking for a brush for a child who doesn&#x27;t like getting their hair brushed this is the one to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for after showers to brush mousse through my hair.  I&#x27;ve used it 2 mornings and I have a couple of bent pins already.  During my shower, I comb conditioner through my hair, so I do not have tangles when using this brush.  I like the grip to the brush and it is a good brush, but functionally my Goody brush did just as well a job and lasted for years.</li>
    <li> The reviews are right, we no longer have any arguments over whether or not hair has been brushed, and I no longer have a kid walking around with a crazy rat nest of hair. My 6-year old (with long hair) happily and willingly brushes her own hair every day now that we got this brush. When it arrived I was skeptical because it looks like the bristles aren&#x27;t going to comb through anything. They&#x27;re light and lean with the slightest pressure, but it works, wet hair, dry hair, whatever. We are all glad to have this.</li>
    <li> Amazon didn&#x27;t really let me choose a color for the brush, but I didn&#x27;t really mind. It works really well on wet hair to detangle! I will say I think it works worse and may cause breakage on dry hair, though...</li>
    <li> It is the only brush my little one wants me to use in her hair bc it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you brush all the tangle hair away.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this brush on me during my last haircut and I loved it. The salon was charging $20 for the brush so I looked on Amazon for a better price. I decided to buy the brush and I am not dissappointed. It took me less than half the time to brush out my curly hair than with a regular brush. When I brushed my hair out it didn&#x27;t hurt like it normally does because I have curly hair. If you are thinking about buying a brush that won&#x27;t hurt to detangle then buy this brush. I would recommend if you have children or anyone with long or curly hair. Seller was great too! I got my package before the estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about the magical powers of this brush. I have told everyone I know to invest in this fantastic product. My hair gets extremely tangled, and my old brushes used to rip out so much of my hair. My hair sylist used this on me and I was hooked. It doesn&#x27;t tear at or rip out my hair at all. I dont know what it is about this brush, but somehow it glides through my gnarled locks with no painful tearing. If you have little girls with long hair, this is a MUST BUY. My sister is still thanking me for relieving her from her kids&#x27; temper tantrums during hair-brushing time.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been nearly impossible to brush whilst wet. I usually have to wait for it to dry a bit to get out any tangles. This brush makes it SO simple to brush through my wet hair. Effective and pain-free. This will be the ONLY brush I use from now on!!!! LOVE IT!!!! Could not give a higher recommendation.</li>
    <li> My girls LOVE this brush! One has CRAZY thick hair, with tight curls underneath, and she doesn&#x27;t flinch when you brush her hair with this. The other is Asian and this brush makes her hair super shiny. Even Momma loves it!!</li>
    <li> this brush works great on my hair without pulling it and hurting my head. it is a great brush to have</li>
    <li> I am so thankful for this brush!  I have had days where I literally could not get a brush through my hair.  In other words, I would go to brush it and the brush would literally get stuck in a tangled mass in my hair.  It one time took me 20 minutes to get the brush untangled and I actually thought I was going to have to cut it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all started maybe 6 or 7 years ago when I had gotten very ill for a prolonged time.  Something in the make up of my hair changed and even the follicles themselves became very sensitive.  Every little pull of the brush was painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has been wonderful.  Of all the brushes I own, I will search the house over for this one, because I know it won&#x27;t hurt when I brush with it...  And it really does do the job.  It actually brushes your hair and somehow magically does not hurt in the process.  I will be buying several more of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would DEFINITELY recommend this brush to anyone with any type of sensitivity, whether you&#x27;re just born sensitive, or whether it&#x27;s due to something like Fibromyalgia, Lupus, medical treatments or medications, etc.  I would also highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s hair is simply just difficult to get a brush through.  I had both of these conditions and I love this brush.  :)</li>
    <li> Anyone with hair that tangles (with or without conditioner) needs to buy these.  It&#x27;s like they are miracle brushes.  My grand daughters have long hair that tangles unless their Mom uses a lot of conditioner.  These brushes will detangle their hair even without the conditioner.  Not much tugging and very smooth hair results.  The girls give these as presents to their friends.  They work!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush as a complete skeptic, convinced that it wasn&#x27;t going to work, I was wrong and I&#x27;m so glad that I was!!!!! This thing is a life saver. My six year old daughter has long, thick curly ringlet hair. I dreaded shower night because it would end up with her in tears and me completely frustrated. I kid you not this thing detangled her hair in five minutes without one tear! My daughter literally kissed the brush after I was done. I used it on her hair wet with conditioner in, then again right after I rinsed. I am going to order three more of these things so I can have a spare and one for each grandmas house. I&#x27;m in love with this brush!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after my stylist told me about it.  This thing works through my wet hair in about 4 strokes.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much agony it has saved my daughter and me.  We both have long hair that is prone to tangle, even when we use a lot of conditioner.  This brush has allowed me to cut down on how much of that I use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Amazing brush! No more tears and fits from my 2 young daughters after the shower!</li>
    <li> I was starting to think we&#x27;d have to cut out the rats in the back of my 1.5 year old&#x27;s head. This brush had them out in a few strokes-- and she didn&#x27;t even cry! I could not believe it.</li>
    <li> I saw tried this hairbrush at my hair studio but they did have it for sale.  So i came to Amazon and found it.  I have very fine hair and tangles a lot.  This brush untangles in seconds.  I think it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING!!! My hair is a big knot regardless of how much conditioner and what type of conditioner I use... This brush went through my hair like butter. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The brush will de tangle hair, but the coating on the brush wears off in time</li>
    <li> A must for long hair! It would take me 3 times as long to brush through my very long hair after a shower with a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all you stylists out there as well. Your clients will thank you.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use this brush in the shower to comb conditioner through my hair. It takes out snarls and tangles without breaking the hair. It also works well to detangle dry hair.</li>
    <li> We love this brush.  Very simple brush.  It is one solid piece from handle to top.  It is rubberized all throughout but very rigid.  It feels good in your hand without slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The needles are ball tipped and each tip is smooth which is very gentle to the scalp.  At the root of the needles is a rubbery cushion which absorbs the impact if you accidentally push it to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is called a wet brush because it is designed for both wet and dry hair.  My daughter always complain when my wife brushes her hair after shower.  My 5-yr-old has a long and very fine hair, this brush made it much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative thing is that you really can not choose the color.  We received a yellow one but my daughter really wants a pink one.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It would take me 20 minutes to comb out my daughter&#x27;s hair after shower or swimming - with her grabbing her head all the time and yelping.  My arms would actually get tired.  Then, my sister&#x27;s hair dresser used the brush on her and she knew I needed it for my girls.  She gave us three and I am so glad I have one too!  I don&#x27;t know what makes it work better than other brushes, but it does!  I&#x27;m so happy to have it!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this brush.  She said it was a llifesaver for getting tangles out of her ganddaughter&#x27;s hair.  It works!!</li>
    <li> I have thick, fine, curly hair.  Up until I bought this, I didn&#x27;t even own a brush.    I was really happy with how well this works.  I took back the expensive shampoo and conditioner I was using to de-tangle and went back to something I could buy at the local star.  YEAH!!!</li>
    <li> It works great! It doesn&#x27;t pull my daughter&#x27;s hair at all. No use for detangler anymore. Is recommend it to everyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> Writing reviews is a chore and I rarely do it for anything. But this is one of those few products in life that is THAT good. I have been told by stylists (and certainly know from my own daily wrestling and detangling attempts) that my hair is 1) overly porous, 2) damaged and hopeless, and 3) a mess. I&#x27;ve seen stylists and their assistants get visibly frustrated trying to comb through my hair after washing it at a salon. It normally takes me 5 solid minutes of raking through, starting responsibly from the bottom and working up. Seriously, this brush whips through that same hair, top to bottom, with one fell swoop. I love it, I no longer dread the after-shower routine, and am planning to give a bunch of these brushes as stocking stuffers for my daughters and pals. It&#x27;s that good. Don&#x27;t waste your time with Goody wide-tooth combs. This is truly better.</li>
    <li> I do like this brush, the bristles are pretty thin and flimsy, so on the top of my head when it is hard to brush i have to press down unlike my old brush, but this one leaves my hair feeling smoother and makes it easier to brush, it&#x27;s als bigger than i expected, which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I own a collection of hair brushes ranging from the drug store/super market variety to the fancier Mason Pearson Detangler and baby brushes. I have 2 daughters currently aged 9 and 7. Both of them and I have long hair. My older daughter has hair that is so thick that her braid looks like a rope. My younger daughter&#x27;s hair is so fine that it tangles in the wind into a rat nest.   After showers we used to use Suave detangler or something similar and spend a good 15 or 20 min brushing and separating all the knots per kid - even after conditioner and detangler.   Now that we use the \\&quot;Wet Brush\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t reached for the detangler once. The brush doesn&#x27;t hurt and does detangle. It makes hair look shiny if you brush it while dry, and it easily goes through wet hair. At most, it takes 2 minutes to brush their hair (even with bed head). Sometimes i hold their hair in a pony tail and brush below my hand so it doesn&#x27;t pull which works fine - it&#x27;s pretty amazing.  I bought 2 back up brushes because we loved it so much.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  The bristles are close together, it works great with fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t poke your scalp.  I will be ordering more for my daughters.</li>
    <li> At first when I got this I thought \\&quot;no WAY is this going to detangle anything.\\&quot; The bristles are very soft and bendable and I have curly hair. But after using it once I have to say this brush works way better than the paddle brushes I had been using. There&#x27;s a lot less breakage than with a firmer one and I have to be trying to make it pull on my scalp. I&#x27;d imagine this would be great for parents for that reason. This is great for curly hair since it breaks less, pulls less, and works on wet hair (the only time you can brush curly hair). I highly recommend this brush. It detangles really well and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Even though the bristles are soft and bendable, none have become bent or broken. The only thing is that I wish you could pick the colors, but that&#x27;s pretty minor.</li>
    <li> I love it! Its so gentle and brushes easily through my very long and very thick hair. Its excellent for wet and dry hair! It would be wonderful for children as its so gentle and soft. My favorite brush ever!</li>
    <li> I got this brush from someone as a gift. My daughter used it on her daughters hair &amp; loved it. It is very good for hair that is fine. You can use on wet hair to get out the tangles. I now have two, so I am never without one.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the wet detangler brush from amazon. It was a good deal and shipped quickly, but it didn&#x27;t work for my thick wavy hair. I tried using it in the shower, and it did nothing. I tried using it out of the shower, and it did nothing. My husband then used it on our dog who has wiry fur, and it worked. It managed to take out all the little dreads she gets on her legs. So in all I don&#x27;t love the brush but my dog sure does.</li>
    <li> I got my brush today in the mail. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it when I got out of the shower. My hair tangles easily and brushing it with my regular brush when it is wet is usually painful. Today I used my wet brush and it is great. It just slides right through the wet tangled hair with out pulling your hair out. I have medium length hair (a few inches past my shoulders). I will be ordering two more for my step daughters who have really long hair and always have trouble brushing it after their showers.</li>
    <li> I have thin,straight, normal,dry,long hair. This brush has saved my ends from snagging and especially on tangling. It&#x27;s a life saver for my long locks.Bought twice: first wet brush from amazon and second one bought at my favorite store:Bed,Bath, and Beyond. My hair is happy and I am happy.Amazingly way better than a paddle brush and gentler on fragile hair. And more affordable than the paddle pro brushes. Other reasons I also love this wet brush:    1. Less brushing means less damage and detangling.An ahhhhh moment and my ends of my locks are super happy.    2.Easy to clean and super gentle on the hair.    3. It&#x27;s for any hair type.Especially benefit for the curly curls and wavy hair out there.    4. Last amazingly long time.    5.It&#x27;s Epic Awesome!    Thank you wet brush company for saving one head of hair at a time. You made a huge difference and saved my beautiful locks of hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is AWESOME!  My 4 year old always has tangles in her hair after a bath no matter how much conditioner I use, and this brush just slides right through those tangles!  I love it and highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love! Recommend to anyone! It&#x27;s like I have a brand new daughter! No more tears, no fighting, it&#x27;s amazing! I don&#x27;t even use set angle spray anymore!</li>
    <li> I got this for my autistic son.  Hair brushing can be a frustrating nightmare.  It takes a while but it does detangle efficiently and mostly pain free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I guess. It doesn&#x27;t detangle as well as it advertises.</li>
    <li> Looks can be deceiving!! When I first received the brush it looked cheap and flimsy! I was like welp I just wasted my money on this garbage.... I have long thick hair! Down to my butt! I usually brush my hair before I take a shower while its dry because I can&#x27;t brush it while it&#x27;s wet and I give up. Well I took a shower and decided lets just see if this brush does anything. Omg! I&#x27;m in love with this brush! It barely pulled if at all and brushed all my tangles out within 5 minutes!!! That NEVER happens to me. I brush my hair for atleast 10-15 mins and split it in sections. I didn&#x27;t even split my hair in sections!!! And it brushed with ease. Very little hair in the brush afterwards! Which also never happens with me And I&#x27;m just in love. It almost fills like it&#x27;s only combing the top part of your hair like it&#x27;s not getting all of the tangles throughout my thick hair (not penetrating from top to bottom) so I brushed my fingers through it afterwards and not one tangle! No matter how many times I brush my hair I can always find a tangle somewhere!! This is definitely my new brush for life and probably future Christmas gifts as well! Love love love it!</li>
    <li> Although this doesn&#x27;t completely detangle my hair, it doesn&#x27;t snag my hair at all. Love it,</li>
    <li> I have very long THICK wavy/curly hair that always tangles.  I&#x27;ve tried several detangling sprays, but then I heard about the wet brush.  I bought mine at target, and I decided to give it a try while my hair was dry...not really expecting it to work but I brushed my hair with it and it went right through my thick tangled hair without a problem.  The only word I could use to describe it was MAGIC.  I honestly was so amazed at finally finding something that worked that I had to come on here and right a review.  I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> This brush is life changing! I have long curly hair and trying to brush it after a shower was always the worst--it took forever to get through the knots and I would always painfully pull out hairs. This brush is literally miraculous--it took me about 30 seconds to detangle my hair and it was absolutely pain free! I don&#x27;t know how I lived so long with curly hair without this brush!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so hard to know what&#x27;s worth it and what isn&#x27;t. i rely on amazon reviews to help me make my decisions.&lt;br /&gt;for the first time ever, i feel moved to write a review. this brush seriously works. i normally dread brushing my knotty hair after a shower. not anymore.  there are only a handful of life changing, amazing, way worth more than you paid for them products i&#x27;ve encountered in my life: the vitamix blender. the panasonic bluetooth headset. the republic wireless cellphone. the irobot vacuum. the smart car. this brush is going on that short list.</li>
    <li> The bristles are very thin and flimsy, brush does not penetrate the hair, just glides on top with no effect whatsoever.</li>
    <li> A lot less crying when trying to brush my little ones hair!</li>
    <li> Works GREAT every time. No complaints. Use it all the time on my 1 1/2 year olds hair, it is so gentle.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for myself, but gave it to my mother. She likes it. She said it gives her scalp a massage and detangles her hair. My mother&#x27;s hair is thinner than mine, so if you have thin hair, this might work for you.</li>
    <li> I use this as my main brush (on my hair when dry) and it is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used to get rid of knots without pulling/ripping hair. My sister liked it so much she bought herself one too.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I had two little girls who cried every time I brushed their hair. Now they sit and chit chat while I&#x27;m brushing! I still have to use a detangler on their long hair but the brush doesn&#x27;t hurt them anymore. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy - just a brush with soft bristles attached to a very flexible base, so that they bend rather than snag, allowing you to comb out the tangles a little at a time without jamming and pulling.  Got it for my 11 year old daughter who hated having her hair combed out.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work, but she loves it!  She has thanked me many times for buying it.</li>
    <li> Brush is nice. Light weight and seems durable. Havent tried it out yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered this about 4 years ago and I still use it daily!  It&#x27;s a great brush!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really live without my wet brush. I&#x27;m sad I went so long without it.</li>
    <li> I have two of these. I bought one and brought it with me everywhere because a girl needs a brush, especially with long hair. So I bought a second one to keep at home because I forgot the one a take with me everywhere at a friends house. My friends has super long hair too and bought her own wet brush after I got mine back. So yes, I have two, totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I have the most tangled hair in existence, previously brushing my hair was a 45 minute long experience filled with paint and tons of ripped hair, but now that I have this brush, it takes significantly less time, a ton less pain, and a very enjoyable experience overall. Everyone with long hair should own one of these!</li>
    <li> I bit the bullet and got this  brush based on a crazy bunch of positive reviews.  Well it rocks.  It seems like brushes you seem everywhere but it works much better.  I have very thin, straight hair but a ton of it and I can barely get a brush through it.  This brush saves me 3-5 minutes a day brushing out my hair (wet or dry).  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love my brush, I have hair extensions and this brush gets right in between my extensions to make my hair smooth and detangled! This is a brush for both dry and wet hair and especially someone with a full head of extensions! Wow!</li>
    <li> The first time I ran it through my hair, I was like, &amp;#34;It really works&amp;#34;!  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair prone to tangling.  My 7 year old granddaughter brought her brush with her to spend the night.  She also has very fine hair and it can be a struggle to comb out after washing.  This brush worked so great on her hair and with no fussing, I decided I had to have one.  On Amazon it was less than going out and buying one.  Works great on dry hair as well</li>
    <li> Love this brush, I use it with wet and dry hair. Easy detangling pain free.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush I use now. I don&#x27;t understand why it works so much better than precious brushes I&#x27;ve owned, but it does. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and Im always extra careful with it to not break it to avoid split end. It slides so soft that sometimes I think it didn&#x27;t do anything. It can be use wet or dry. Highly recomended</li>
    <li> Every long hair beauty needs this. One for in the shower and one for when your hair is dry. Must BUY!!! soo good</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that is always in knots and this brush not only works well but it feels good too. I have yet to use it with wet hair.</li>
    <li> GREAT for people with fine hair that dangles easily. I got one for my son and husband (to take on trips), and have been reccomneding it to all my sisters for their daughters.</li>
    <li> This truly is the best brush EVER.  This was the first time I was ever able to brush through my daughters curly hair without any tears!  Amazing!</li>
    <li> Works great on my daughters waist length hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull while removing tangles.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about these brushes! I bought one for myself and one for my 7 year old granddaughter. She hates having her brush combed out after her shower. She has long hair and even she loves this brush. We use it on our wet hair after every shower!  Buy it and see for yourself. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these brushes, one for me and one for my daughter. We both love it, it does not hurt while brushing and gets all the tangles out.</li>
    <li> This brush was listed as a \\&quot;wet brush Detangling Shower Brush\\&quot;.  It appears more like an ordinary hairbrush....it did not appear that this brush was  made for  shower use \\&quot;wet\\&quot; !  It may detangled wet hair, but the product does not seem like it would be suitable for use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think the price was a bit overpriced for similar product that I could purchased at the local store</li>
    <li> At the time of purchase, was able to select a black brush but received a bright pink one. It was meant for my husband but I kept instead. Otherwise, it seems to work ok with detangling my hair when wet. Actually works better on wet hair than dry.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t attempt to take tangles out if your hair is dry.  Works ok in the shower to get the conditioner through. It&#x27;s worth keeping and works ok, not a miracle brush by any means, but, works good enough.  If you have long hair, you still need to be careful when trying to brush through but with some work at it, you can get through the tangles.</li>
    <li> Slips thru my hair with barely a hair pulled out</li>
    <li> I lived with a never ending struggle of pulling out my tangled curly hair. No more. I don&#x27;t really understand how it works but I can brush my just washed wet hair and not pull out a strand. You have to try it.</li>
    <li> bought so many of these for everyone I know!!! well my girls in my fam. LOVE them :)</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. I have really long hair that gets super tangled so this is great for that. It combs out the untangled parts of my hair, then passes over the knots without breaking the hair so that I can untangle it myself with my hands. I really like this brush.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the claims for this brush but it is very effective. It does a very good job of detangling wet or dry hair. I ended up with very few hairs in the brush. It would probably take a week or more to equal my usual one day hair loss with my old brush. I do like more stimulation than this brush provides. Also this brush is not good for carrying in your bag. The bristles smoosh flat and they don&#x27;t quickly go back to their original position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all you want is a brush to detangle your hair, this is your brush.</li>
    <li> Just buy this brush!  I have a 3 year old with thick Rapunzel hair down past her waist.  It&#x27;s just too pretty to cut, even though it&#x27;s an ordeal to maintain.  She HATES anyone touching her hair!  Out of desperation or frustration, we were in the routine of combing it out thoroughly twice a week.  It took 45 minutes to an hour each time and it was not a good experience for anyone involved.  But it was the best we could do.  We talked about cutting her hair just to avoid the struggle, but the thought broke my heart..  This brush is quite amazing and has saved us!  She LETS me comb her hair out everyday now without too much discomfort.  It usually takes about 5 minutes to have it all perfectly brushed out.  It looks beautiful during the day.  And we don&#x27;t have to resort to hats and big bows to hid the rats nests.  I can&#x27;t say exactly why this brush works so well.  It looks like all our other brushes.  The bristles do seem to be much more flexible, so maybe that&#x27;s the magic.  I also have long hair and have used it.  I can tell a difference.  There&#x27;s no sharp tugs when it hits a knot.  I&#x27;ll be buying another so we are never without this brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush after I watched a YouTube video of a Beauty Blogger and she raved about it. I have really long hair, pretty thick and lately, it’s been getting so tangled. It gets especially tangled after I wash it. I bought the Wet Brush and I like it. It doesn’t hurt when you’re trying to get the tangles out, however, it’s takes a long time to actually get the tangles out. (around 15 minutes for me) I guess this might not be a real problem for some people, but for me, I only have so much time in the morning to get ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush and have recommended it to my cousin for her daughter who has really curly hair because it’s gentle. I do wish this was around when I was growing up, it would have saved me a lot of tears when my mother was brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is great.  I have twin 8 year old girls who love to swim.  Things have been much easier after swimming with the brush.  The only thing is you can pick what color you want.</li>
    <li> I bought a wet brush because everyone was saying it was the greatest thing ever for long hair.  I have very long, thick hair, so I was excited to try this &amp;#34;amazing brush&amp;#34;.  It works well for brushing wet hair; however, I used it while I was blow drying my hair and all of the bristles bent to the point where I cannot use it anymore.  So, I guess if you are just going to brush your hair and not blow dry it would be okay, but don&#x27;t buy this brush if you think you will be able to use it while blow drying!</li>
    <li> I really was not expecting much as I couldn&#x27;t believe that a $7 brush could be that great, but I was willing to try anything for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  We would spend 15 minutes easily with detangler to brush her hair after a shower.  She was unable to do this on her own.  I gave her the brush and was shocked when she came to me with perfectly smooth wet hair and told me this brush was easily worth $50.  She was able to brush her hair with no detangler in 30 seconds.  We are buying a couple for backup just in case.  It is that good.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many items from Amazon but this is the first review I&#x27;ve written.  This brush is AMAZING!  I&#x27;m not sure what makes it so different than other brushes but it is.  My youngest daugther has very long hair and it stays a tangled mess.  Mornings were so stressful because she would fight me to brush her hair.  No more!  This brush goes right through those messy tangles...wet or dry!  My oldest daughter has shoulder length hair that is very coarse and it works great for her too.  I also use it.  I&#x27;m placing an order for two more brushes, one for each bathroom.  I highly recommend this brush to anyone.  It has saved many tears.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does!  I have medium length, fine, thin hair that&#x27;s sorta damaged so it tangles easily.  This brush glides right through my hair, whether it&#x27;s wet or dry.  No more pulling and tugging at tangles.  I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine brush but not the miracle it claims to be.</li>
    <li> Its great - works like it should.</li>
    <li> There are no words to describe the excellence of this brush. I bought it for my granddaughter&#x27;s super curly, long and thin hair that is always knotty and the process of brushing her hair was a nightmare for both of us. Now no more tears when is time to brush. One recommendation is that the hair needs to be dripping water to start brushing. I do it under the shower. Great, excellent, super good and an A+. I will buy another one soon to have it at home for when she visits me.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and I get huge knots in the back . I like that I can brush my hair and not have huge balls of hair when im done. I would recommend starting at the ends if your hair is super tangled. works great on kids hair and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this brush.....</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSH.  two stokes through wet hair, and all the tangles are out.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but since this is the best brush ever and has saved my sanity, I am writing a review! My 2 year old would cry and bawl over getting her hair washed. .brushed. fixed.. and I had it! I called the hair dresser to get her gold ringlets cut off because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the tangled mess everyday then I found this brush, ordered it for me cause I honestly didn&#x27;t believe it would do what it said it would do. I brushed her hair wet in 4 strokes, completely brushed through, no crying; she even said it felt good on her head. Looks like I will have to cancel the hairdresser!!</li>
    <li> Best hairbrush ever!  My kids love it.</li>
    <li> My little girl doesn&#x27;t not cry anymore when I brush her hair.  I should have bought this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> In short, this product actually does what it says it will do!  Truth in advertising?  Yes, it is possible.</li>
    <li> Love love love!  Brushing my hair has gone from 30 minutes and annoying to 10 minutes and pain free!  I have soft/fine but thick hair down to mid back.  This is the best brush I have ever used, I wish it was around when I was little!  My mom would just have to cut the knots out sometimes....it was that bad!</li>
    <li> Brush works well. But it has a super strong, weird smell.</li>
    <li> Great de-tangling brush. Does work better on wet hair but I do feel like it does not pull or stress my hair as much as most brushes do. Good buy!</li>
    <li> It really is gentle but effectively detangles hair, right in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great Brush which takes out knots without tearing out all the hair</li>
    <li> My long hair tangles easily, especially when wet while swimming or snorkeling... After a long day at the beach, I would literally have to spend about 30 minutes getting the tangles out of my hair. This brush cuts through my hair like butter... Very few snags, tangle-free in about a minute. I love it and I bought 2 more, one for me an another for a gift.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice. Just kinda sucked that i didn&#x27;t get to pick out the color it just comes at random. Luckily i got the black one and I&#x27;m very happy with it :)</li>
    <li> Not sure about the detangle part, but this brush hurts when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very uncomfortable. At the end I bought Conair Anti Static Paddle Brush from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still keeping this one though. It&#x27;s so cheap, not worth it to return it.</li>
    <li> I was wary of this brush actually working but decided to give it a try. My hair has become tangled and unmanageable lately and I have THICK wavy hair, so I have been trying to get used to the clumps that get ripped out on my normal brush. It was just getting too painful to go on so I found this brush with all these great reviews and decided to see if I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush came in yellow (ew) and smelled weird but all of that takes a back seat to how well it works. I&#x27;ve used this for the past few days on my hair wet and dry and I really cant figure out why it seems to work so well. It gets the knots out and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my other brush while leaving so much more hair intact on my head! Love this brush! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING! It truly works. I usually do not write reviews, but I felt compelled to write one this time. I have a horrible time with my hair getting tangled up in a big mess and this brush works wonders. It looks like an ordinary brush, but one stroke through the hair and it seemingly just glides right through it. I have not tried the brush through my hair when it&#x27;s dry so can&#x27;t say much about that, but it works wonders through wet hair. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because if you get the brush cushion extremely wet, it will start to mildew. This is my 2nd brush and I&#x27;ve treated it with better care. I was using my 1st brush while in the shower and now I just wait until I&#x27;m completely done before using my brush and it has just been fine. This is truly a MUST have if you&#x27;re tired of messing with tangled wet hair!</li>
    <li> So simple, yet life changing.  I wish I bought this brush years ago.  Detangles without pulling out lots of hair!</li>
    <li> I was browsing for a new paddle brush on Amazon a couple of months ago, and this came up as a recommended item. Being that I have shoulder length, very thick, color treated hair, having a good detangling brush for my wet hair is a must have for me. I have tried so many brushes and detangling sprays and nothing works as good as this little gem!&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was a bit skeptical when I saw the size of the brush, thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t help get the knots out of my hair after washing it. However, this is a miracle brush! This makes detangling my hair easy and pain free. Yes, even at 25, tangled hair can hurt just as much as when you were 5!&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser has always told me to use a comb on my wet hair, but I find that&#x27;s more of hassle than using a regular brush. With the Wet Brush, I just spray some leave in conditioner on my hair before brushing, let it soak into my hair and a few minutes later, I start combing my hair section by section. I usually start with the underside first and work my way around my head. I do find that I have to go over it with my larger paddle brush, but at least all of the knots are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely repurchase this brush. I just hope that they make this brush in a larger size one day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 13 year old granddaughter who has very long hair. She used it and said it is only slightly better than a regular brush. She is not impressed with the results. This item is really not worth buying. Sorry just being honest!!</li>
    <li> This brush has helped my 6 year old daughter be able to brush her own hair and to have her hair brushed without all the crying and carrying on she has done in the past with other brushes.</li>
    <li> My hair is highlighted and when I shower, no matter how much conditioner I use, my hair is always super tangled and it&#x27;s quite painful to detangle. I have to use leave in conditioners so that I can brush through my wet hair - that is, until I found this brush! I am not sure why this brush is so much more effective and efficient and pain free than my other brushes and I am not sure why it works so well, but it really does. I detangle my wet hair without using leave in conditioners, no problem. It is pain free and so much less hair gets stuck in the brush. I love this brush and would really recommend it to anyone that has a hard time detangling their hair. It&#x27;s really painless and I feel like there is relatively no breakage of my hair at all compared to other brushes. I would even go as far as saying that I find this brush better than a comb to detangle hair. LOVE IT &amp; so happy I got this brush!</li>
    <li> Great brush at a great price. It detangles without tugging on hair. My daughter loves getting her hair brushed now that we have this brush. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. My daughter has extremely long thick hair and likes this brush best. It still gets tangled, but she now refuses to use our other brushes, so that is a plus.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter, who has long, very thick hair.  After trying many different kinds of brushes and having only moderate success, I decided to take a chance on this one based on reviews.  WHAT A BUY!!!  She no longer complains when I brush her hair either wet or dry, and after a year it&#x27;s still going strong!  Don&#x27;t look any further, this is the brush for anyone whose hair tends to knot and tangle!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, long hair which gets tangled easily. I&#x27;ve had such a hard time with keeping it long that I&#x27;ve broken down and gotten the majority of it cut off just to prevent knots. I&#x27;m also very sensitive to pain, so brushing my hair out is a nightmare. This brush definitely works well. I can get through the majority of my hair with no issues, but it will still catch on knots now and then. I still recommend using some detangler or leave-in conditioner to help the process along...</li>
    <li> In all honestly I haven&#x27;t owned a regular brush in 10 years- I simply used a pick to comb out my hair when wet then used a round brush to blow dry my hair. I saw all the reviews about this brush AFTER I was going to purchase a much more expensive version, thought I would try this first. I have super thick, long hair (middle of my back) and this brush is AMAZING. The price is unbelieveable- everyone needs one of these!!</li>
    <li> I first bought this brush from a local salon for twice the price. Absolutely love it. No more tangles or hair falling out from awful brushes or combs. Bought another one for my brother from amazon for half the price!!!</li>
    <li> My 5 year old daughter has long hair and her hair is a tangled mess after we give her a bath.  Trying to comb her hair was very painful.  My wife started to use grape seed extract which helped but was very expensive.  Then I happen to see this on Amazon so I thought I would give it a try.  When I received the brush, it didn&#x27;t look any different from any of our other brushes and my wife and I were really skeptical.  Wow.  This brush actually worked.  She no longer buys the grape seed extract because it just combs out all of the tangles.  I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does.</li>
    <li> My daughter HATES for me to brush her hair.  This brush has done the trick!  It works great for detangling, especially when hair is wet.  It&#x27;s our new favorite brush for after the shower!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, wavy/curly(ish) hair and was a bit skeptical about the detangling power of this brush on wet hair.  Seriously, it takes good conditioner and detangling serum plus a slow hand with a good comb to deal with my hair after it&#x27;s washed.  Not anymore.  I didn&#x27;t put any detangler on my hair just to give it a difficult test and it passed with flying colors.  Also, I ordered this back around Christmas and it never arrived.  Amazon handled it VERY quickly by refunding my money.  This time around, no delivery problems.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that I could actually brush through my 2 and 6 year old daughters&#x27; hair with out it being a huge deal.  I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work and the fight to brush hair would continue, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My 2 year old has thin curly knot prone hair and my 6 year old has really think long straight hair, it works for both.  Here are my thoughts 1) The bristles are soft and bend, for that reason I find combing on top and then from underneath works great. So, yes, it may be a little more work to get knots out, but it was actually less time because no one was screaming and crying.  2) I&#x27;ve used it with their hair wet and dry with the same results. 3)  I used it on my hair (very thick) and while I personally wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best brush for myself, I don&#x27;t have a sensitive scalp, it has been the best brush I&#x27;ve found for my girls.  Both my daughters love it and even want to brush their hair by themselves.</li>
    <li> I have ethnic THICK, CURLY hair as the result of my genetic make up (half-black / half-mexican). My hair is sooooooo very curl, so curly...WOW!!!! My daughter&#x27;s hair is also curly, she is multi-ethnic (half-mexican/ one quarter black and one quarter caucasian). I purchased this brush to ease with the process of detangling her hair. This brush definitely serves it purpose. Her hair is easier to detangle than mine, but the main thing is that on her hair, it detangles her hair with the ouch factor, which is a major plus. But the proof in the pudding for this brush, was when I used it to detangle my hair. Now like I said, my hair is THICK and CURLY. I used this brush and detangling factor was amazing! I have only  had it for about 2 weeks or so, so I haven&#x27;t experience the pulling or lost of the end protectors on the brush, but at this point, I am sure that if this does occur, I will proceed to just order more. This brush is a winner!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best brush for combing my daughter&#x27;s hair.  This has eliminated all crying when I brush her hair, this is a must buy!</li>
    <li> All I truly want to know is, \\&quot;What are these other reviewers smoking?!!?!?\\&quot; This product is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!! We received it in the mail on Tuesday (Oct 22, 2012) and I was STOKED based on all the positive reviews. I took it out of the package and started combing my daughter&#x27;s hair (she just turned 3, she has medium hair with a TON of curls!!) and the brush was just pulling and tugging at her hair, WORSE than if I would have just used a wide tooth comb. So, I sprayed her hair with water so it was wet (after all, this apparently is a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; brush), and that didn&#x27;t matter at all. She wanted me to stop combing her hair immediately. I have NEVER had a problem combing her hair, she even sits there while I have to pull and tug the tangles out of her curls! But she wanted me to stop and wouldn&#x27;t let this brush go back to her head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought I would give it a try. I have super THICK wavy/curly hair and O M G...what a JOKE! I, by NO means have a sensitive scalp, but I was almost crying using this brush. The bristles basically SCRAPE your scalp....nothing \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; or comforting about that. Let alone, it didn&#x27;t do crap for my hair. Pulled and tugged at my hair. After I got all the tangles out of the top of my hair, I had to take the brush and brush underneath to get the tangles out. THEN I had to go back to the top because I had tangles AGAIN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, we knew within 5 minutes this product was a joke and we were sending it back!! I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star.</li>
    <li> this hairbrush is seriously magic. I don&#x27;t know what it is that makes it work so well but it&#x27;s amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely thick waist-length hair and my hair is typically a nightmare after I shower. But my friend told me to get this brush and I ordered it thinking it would just be another hairbrush&lt;br /&gt;I seriously takes the knots out without pulling or anything. it&#x27;s incredible.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s cheap price-wise but knowing how well it works now I would happily spend a lot more money on this.</li>
    <li> Brush works pretty well, but looked like it was in shoddy shape. There was rubber splattered along the side which looked to be the same material as on the tips of the bristles.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It removes tangles with so much ease.  It is easy to clean and to use! Buy it!</li>
    <li> This is the best we have ever had! My daughter was always struggling with tangled hair, but this brush truly is a tear free brush.  We don&#x27;t have any more struggles when it comes time to brush her hair.  The bristles are soft enough that they don&#x27;t tear at her hair, but firm enough to get through her thick hair.  I highly recommend this brush!  It also comes in a variety of cool colors.&lt;br /&gt;We are ordering this for a friends birthday to give along with cool bath and body products.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who has long hair that tangles and she loves it! It helps a lot with the tangles and she also uses it on dry hair and it works very well!  I am very pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> If I hadn&#x27;t purchased this brush my daughter would have a bob instead of waist length hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush.  I have long curly hair and have always had it ripped out as I brush. This brush goes through my hair without much problems and makes my hair more curly.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products that I have found for not causing too much pain to my daughter while brushing her hair after a bath. The bristles are flexible so it really helps get through the hair and get the tangles out. I will buy more of these</li>
    <li> Great Product....really works well</li>
    <li> Works much better than the other brushes we bought that were ouchless. Plus, they were 15.00 each. This one was much more economical and works better, especially in damp hair.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this brush!  I have long hair, and I love the detangling.  When I use one of my old brushes, it feels so hard and rough.  And it does work with wet hair - although I think a lot of wet-hair-brushing would damage your ends.</li>
    <li> Works great on wet hair!!! I feel like it works like any normal brush on dry hair. But my daughter loves it, and it really does de tangle on wet hair!!</li>
    <li> I have medium long, wavy hair that has been color treated with highlights.  My hair gets tangled so easily  when it&#x27;s wet.  I usually have to use a lot (I mean a lot) of conditioner in the shower with a wide toothed comb, then some leave in conditioner/oil when I get out of the shower with a boar bristle brush that also has nylon pieces....even with all this, and the special brush - it hurts to brush out my hair and it somehow gets knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - now that I have overly explained the state of my hair - I got it in the mail a few days ago and wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.  I mean, let&#x27;s be honest - it looks like something out of an 80s jazzercise video;  if anything it would be a cost effective replacement my other brush that&#x27;s ready to be tossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...regardless of my skepticism - - it actually works.  I mean really works.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it yanked on my hair when I was brushing it out, I felt like I could use less &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; on my hair.  I&#x27;m so impressed, I think I have to buy another one for my gym bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair like mine, or a little girl that gets squeamish after a bath or shower as she sees you coming toward her tangled mop with a brush and detangling spray - - this product is for you.  No more tears and fears. :)</li>
    <li> My 3yr old has fine thin hair that gets tangled easily and it murderous to detangle even with these sprays they sell now. This brush has made it pain free and now my daughter doesn&#x27;t mind me brushing her hair. Win win!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this brush works, but it does! I call it the magic brush! my hair gets very knotty after i wash it and this come detangles with absolutely no effort!  I don&#x27;t even need to use my detangling spray anymore!  I highly recommend it to anyone with hair that tangles!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is a fantastic detangler on all types of wet hair right  out of the shower!! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser recommended it. Does not hurt to brush.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter only uses this brush too and complains when I try to trick her for fun.&lt;br /&gt;Comes is fresh assorted colors that is fun for kids.</li>
    <li> I have the long curly hair and I can&#x27;t say this brush is super special. It works the same on dry ans wet hair.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto a muy buen precio..&lt;br /&gt;muy buen producto a muy buen precio.&lt;br /&gt;muy buen producto a muy buen precio</li>
    <li> Glad it came in different colors for my daughters and wife.  It goes thru hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;Spray detangler in long hair and then just brush.</li>
    <li> My sister bought one of these from her hair saloon and I fell in love with it! I have thin hair that gets very tangled when wet/dry and this brush goes through the tangles with out pulling out my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, but fine, waist length hair.  I was skeptical when I bought this brush because it&#x27;s just about impossible to detangled the unfortunate neck dread.  This brush works great on mildly tangled hair.  The bristles are very flexible causing basically no pain at all to brush thru my hair.  But, the brush failed at untangling the extreme birds nest my hair forms.  I can brush at it all day with this brush, it won&#x27;t hurt or anything, but the bristles are so flexible that it just bends out of the mess and doesn&#x27;t undo it.  So in short, works great for short thin hair tangles.  If you have very long thick hair, you&#x27;re out of luck, nothing works.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this brush. I have thin, tangly hair which is complicated by illness and the fact that I stopped using conditioner on it (chemicals). So this brush had a big job to do. It did the job! It was really easy and painless to run this brush through my hair and it detangled it with ease. I am really impressed. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Works great with long hair. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s ripping through hair. Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult in my 50&#x27;s with long hair and have issues with detangling.  I found that this brush is super amazing.  I read other reviews and I was hopeful.  I am not disappointed and would recommend.  I&#x27;ve only used it on wet hair, which is great at getting through knots.  Never tried on dry hair.  But to be fair, I also use Mane N Tail Detangler because I don&#x27;t want to break off my hair.</li>
    <li> this is the ONLY brush I have and its because a reason.. IT IS SO DAMN GOOD.. my hair loves it</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I bought this originally for my 18-month-old daughter who has fine but very curly blonde hair that snarls easily. Until I bought this brush, it was always a struggle to brush her hair, especially the really curly portion in the back that would get snarled. This brush goes through her curls with ease, rarely snagging at all. Now she calmly sits while I brush her hair instead of trying to get away from me. It is easier to use on her hair wet, but works very well on dry hair too. On a whim, I thought I&#x27;d try it on my own hair, not expecting much from the skinny lightweight bristles because my hair is thick, wavy, and long, almost to the small of my back. Surprisingly, this brush also brushes through my hair wet easily, and does an excellent job of detangling (although I do prefer to brush with a paddle brush after to fully brush my hair because it is so thick). Still, I prefer this brush to any other when brushing wet hair to detangle and manage,, and think it is far superior to my old method of just a paddle brush, so now I share it with my daughter! :)</li>
    <li> Does a good job of detangling wet hair.  My hair is coarse and curly.  I use it mainly in the shower to brush conditioner through my hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing brush. After spending tons of money on detanglers for my curly haired toddler this brush saved the day. It saves me ton of time and my daughter is spared the pain. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the most fantastic brush. I have waist length hair and discovering this is the only reason I haven&#x27;t cut it all off yet. I used to get the most horrible tangles, but using the Wet Brush in the shower with conditioner has made it so much more manageable. No more dreads!&lt;br /&gt;It even beats out my beloved Mason Pearson, which is more suitable for hair that&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
    <li> It used to take me 10 minutes to brush through my hair every night - this brush cut it down to 3 minutes tops! It feels great on my head and works through the nastiest of snarls. It&#x27;s not always one-pass through, like some of the other reviews made me believe, but give it a couple more strokes and it&#x27;ll fix the tangle no problem without pulling, force or discomfort. I like to use it in the shower to comb my conditioner through my hair, and it is my go to hairbrush for my regular day-to-day styling. Materials are sturdy and the bristles are going to fall off anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;Saves me a ton of time; definitely a worthwhile product and recommend it to anyone and everyone looking to improve their hair care.</li>
    <li> As described and great product.</li>
    <li> WOW!!! I bought this with MUCH hesitation since A) brushing your hair when wet is a sin and B) I saw it on an infomercial at 3am. BUT HOLY CRAP this thing is MAGIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t use it to brush my hair while wet because I&#x27;m certain if I do something horrible will happen. What? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s just what &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; say. BUT, I use it regularly on my hair after teasing it. I have very long hair and tease it often. Because I want to minimize damage, I use a teasing brush and am careful to &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; the hair rather than just rat it up. This also means I use TONS of &amp;#34;freezing&amp;#34; hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite hairstyles is a faux-hawk that requires tons of teasing all over my head. In the past, this mean at least 1 full hour with first a wide tooth comb and then a brush to get through my hair at the end of the night. Add in the ten minute breaks to wipe the tears out of my eyes and give my scalp a rest, and I wasn&#x27;t getting to bed til 3am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet Brush time to undo the same style: 10 minutes. Period. Done. And very minimal hair loss/damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job brush-fairies!!</li>
    <li> I added this hairbrush to my cart ONLY so I would remember I need to get the girls a new brush. For one reason or another I read the product description before deleting it and I wound up ordering it. Now you are an $8 hair brush in a house of bargain brands so you better show me what&#x27;s what! It did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what is so special about this thing but my kids say it feels weird. All I know is, the knots are coming out and I can hear them gently separating. It takes some time to get through two heads of thick long hair but when all is said and done their hair is not broken and frizzy. This is truly an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This brush has cut my hair brushing time in half. I used to have to use a wide tooth comb after I showereed to get out all the knots in my fine, long, knotty hair but this is way better. Gets through the knots and doesnt feel like it&#x27;s pulling on my scalp. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> This brush doesnt look like much but it is great at untangling my hair, especialy wet hair.  This is the best brush ever invented! It works...we have 2 in our apartement! It is gentle on the scalp but takes out the tangles without any painful pulling.  My sister got me one for my birthday, this is the best brush I have used for untangling.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the glowing reviews here, but didn&#x27;t have quite the same experience. My 4-year-old has long, curly, tangly hair, and freaks out when it&#x27;s time for me to comb through it. I promised her that this brush wouldn&#x27;t hurt at all, but... it still did. It was and is much better than everything else we&#x27;ve used (picks, combs, and brushes), so it still deserves a great rating, but I just don&#x27;t want to go overboard here and pretend she likes getting her hair brushed now. She still hates it, still winces, still grabs her hair and says \\&quot;ow\\&quot; whenever I hit a bad tangle, still tries to run away. It&#x27;s just an improvement over the level of pain... now it&#x27;s more like \\&quot;ow\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;OWWWW!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and have more \\&quot;give\\&quot; than normal brushes, which seems to be the reason it works like it does.</li>
    <li> A friend had given me one of these brushes and I found it amazing. I always had to use a detangling solution before. The new brush is so good at detangling that I didn&#x27;t need anything else. I ordered 4 more to give to family and friends and kept an extra as a backup. Great Product!</li>
    <li> This is a gift, so we haven&#x27;t used it yet.  Am hopeful that it will do what it advertises...detangle wet hair without breaking it.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on reviews. I laughed when I opened it because it is cheap, flimsy, and clearly useless for my medium thick hair even when dry, let alone wet! Am returning for a refund.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old cries each time we brush her hair, no matter how gentle we are.  She has thick, curly hair and it&#x27;s just past her shoulders.  We see less tears when she brushes it herself, but that&#x27;s asking alot for someone her age.  We braid it after bath, use both conditioner and detangler, but still, it&#x27;s difficult for her to brush through because she&#x27;s so tender headed.  Until we bought this brush, we used a horsehair brush for her, which wasn&#x27;t a horrible choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is amazing.  She can brush her hair, wet or dry, with very little help, and because the bristles have alot of &#x27;give&#x27; she&#x27;s able to handle the pain.  It&#x27;s still painful, sure, but the difference is really uncanny.  We&#x27;re big believers in this brush in our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note:  When she goes to spend the night with her grandparents, sometimes she forgets her toothbrush, but she&#x27;s never forgotten this hairbrush.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered a wet brush, I had doubts that it would actually work especially because of the price.  This is my all-time favorite brush for my daughter and myself!  I first bought it for her (she&#x27;s 3) because she has curly hair that tangles easily.  It worked so well for her, so I tried it on my own hair and was shocked!  I don&#x27;t even understand how it works so well, but it just does.  LOVE THIS BRUSH and I tell just about everyone.  I even sent one to my hair stylist for Christmas because he&#x27;d never heard of it!</li>
    <li> I am not sure how this works....but it does!  My daughter has the curly hair, which is a bare to comb through!  She was in tears this morning as I was brushing it!  This came in the mail today and I used it on her and it worked wonderfully!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTERS HAVE SUPER THICK HAIR (BLACK/INDIAN) AND THIS IS FOR THE FIRST BRUSH MY DAUGHTER IS OKAY WITH USING. IF YOU HAVE A KIDS WITH THICK, CURLY HAIR THIS IS THE BEST BRUSH.  I SAW THIS AT THE HAIR CUTTERY AND BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE I LOVE IT SO MUCH.</li>
    <li> Ordered two of these as Christmas gifts. Gave one to my daughter and the other to my granddaughter. They both have very thick hair and complain the entire time they are brushing out their hair after a shower.  First time each of them used this brush, they were amazed at how easy it brushed out their hair. My daughter said she didn&#x27;t even use conditioner and the brush was just gliding through her hair. We were all amazed.  This is a great product. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it for the person with difficult hair in your life.</li>
    <li> OK, I have no idea why this brush is so special.  It looks like any other brush but I have to tell you- my 3 year old has sensory issues and HATES hair brushing, clips, headbands... anything in her hair.  So you can imagine that brushing her hair has been a power struggle.  I bought this brush and the magic part is true.  She has fine hair that is messy post bath and post sleeping but this brush literally glides through and makes it soft- no pulling, snags, or fussing.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have long, fine, wavy hair, and this dry winter weather has been causing some serious knots and tangles.  I bought this a few months back, but it hasn&#x27;t worked too well for me.  It has a hard time getting through my knots, even when I use it with wet hair that is slathered with conditioner or de-tangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since picked up a [[ASIN:B003DU3HY0 Tangle Teezer Brush Original Professional Detangling Hairbrush Pearl Blue]], and that works much better for me.  You might find the Tangle Teezer to be better, too, if you also have fine hair.</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush is great! I used to have a lot of difficulty combing through my hair after washing it, and I lost some hair and had broken ends in the process. Using the Wet Brush, I am now able to brush out the tangles in my wet hair without it hurting and without any hair loss.</li>
    <li> Works well with my daughter&#x27;s thick hair- wet or dry :)  We have a lot less complaints in the morning!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the claims this brush makes, but I was happily suprised.  I usually have to use detangler before I brush, but with this brush I don&#x27;t have too.  I also have a 10 year old daughter who hates brushing her hair because of the tangles and she loves this brush too.  No more fighting with her in the morning to brush her hair before school.  I highly recommend this brush!!!!!</li>
    <li> OK. I have no idea how this works but it WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;I lose 40-50 hair each time I brush after washing it, but with this I lost 10 at most!!!&lt;br /&gt;and I dont use a conditioner, so it was always difficult to brush after washing.. Well, until now!!&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy one for my sister, too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative: the back of the brush, the plastic part smells really bad!!! like it is some kind of chemical smell..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on products, but I MUST on this one! I see I&#x27;m not the only one. After seeing a hairbrush making similar claims for twice the price plus s&amp;h on T.V., our 4 year-old daughter said \\&quot;I want THAT brush so I don&#x27;t cry anymore when you guys brush my hair!\\&quot; Naturally I hopped on to Amazon to check out the reviews prior to ordering said brush and stumbled upon The Wet Brush. We received it today and I kid you not I didn&#x27;t even have to use any detaingler on our daughters nauturally curly, extremely long, thick hair. There were no \\&quot;owwww\\&quot;&#x27;s, no \\&quot;stop\\&quot;&#x27;s, no tears. This brush was amazing despite my skepticism after feeling the extreme flexibility of the bristles on the brush. The only downfall (in our daughter&#x27;s eyes), we got a yellow one and she of course would have preferred pink or purple. ;) I knew going in we couldn&#x27;t choose the color, and apparently unlike the one on T.V. for twice the price, it doesn&#x27;t make a difference what hair type you have the awesome brush is the same. I even tried it on my extremely thick and coarse hair and it went through with ease and left no tangles behind. Buy the brush, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have waist length, straight, thick hair that will sometimes get tangled. This is the first brush that doesn&#x27;t hurt to use! No harsh pulling or tugging, it just does what a brush is supposed to do: BRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t work for me in the shower or on dripping wet hair.. but I think this is perfectly ok. I&#x27;d rather brush my hair when it&#x27;s dry or semi-dry to avoid damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it on damp hair, and it works amazingly.</li>
    <li> I have thin curly and extremely tangled hair. It is horrible brushing my hair because one, it hurts! and two, I always end up pulling out chucks of my hair due to the excessive knotting. BUT WITH THIS BRUSH I FINALLY can brush with ease, and Little to NO hair gets pulled out, This is such an amazing product, I only purchased one, but I have to get the mini for on the go and possibly a few more just because I want to share this with all my friends! Even my husband loves it (he has extremely long hair) this is such a great product, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> My daughter has a very sensitive scalp with baby fine long hair (think angel hair).  She has hated every single brush I have every used on her, natural boar bristles, plastic with ball tips, metal, cushion... Many a brushing has ended in tears. This brush is not perfect but it is as close as we are going to get. The bristles and very thin nylon with small balls on the ends. The bristles bend very easily with pressure. She still says the brushing hurts her scalp but not as much as anything else we have used. Everyone else in the house thinks the bristles feel like a massage on the head. This works best when her hair is wet and conditioned (true of many a brush we&#x27;ve used). When her hair is dry and tangled it is very slow going but better than a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  i have straight, long hair, but there is a lot so i always get the worst tangles!  i have had this problem all my life and i use heavier conditioner, etc. but have always had a lot of trouble brushing out my hair **even with detangler** once out of the shower!  i would delay washing my hair until i had a lot of time and patience.&lt;br /&gt;this brush made my morning routine SO much better as i am able to brush out my hair in a fraction of the time (not to mention it&#x27;s PAINLESS).  i have a sensitive scalp - heairdressers are always frustrated - not my fault!  this brush is a savior!  i will definitely be bringing it to my next hair appointment and will continue to use it every day!&lt;br /&gt;great great find!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has very long fine curly hair and hates to have it brushed. With the wet brush the chore is so much easier. The tangles just seem to slide right out. It is good for wet or dry hair and I recommend it to anyone for your little girls hair. By the way I have used it on mine and love it also. I ordered 2 and will be ordering more again soon since I am afraid these will get discontinued as so many other things I like seem to do.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after watching a video review by jcokes7 and was impressed. I&#x27;ve used the Wet Brush with great ease on my kinky, coily hair. It glides through my hair with ease once I&#x27;ve misted it with water and applied conditioner. This is a must-have for any woman with natural hair, as detangling is super easy.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and it was perfect for detangling it, It was also the best brush I bought for a long time. I just thought that 5 come so I was a little excited it asked for quantity but I thought it was a package. But it was very good</li>
    <li> First let me say my child has had a ton of hair ever since she was born. Now that she is two it is so much longer and thicker. I always feel bad for my child because she has so much hair and it is hard to comb through. I tried a lot of products to detangle her hair and everything I have tried did not work until now. This brush should be called the miracle brush because it performs miracles by detangling my child&#x27;s hair. I still use the comb afterwards but the comb goes right through. Thanks to whoever made this product. It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> My daughter, 8, has a TON of hair and it tangles horribly.  I have bought every brush on the market, even the Knot Genie.  But non of them compare to this brush.  Finally she can brush her hair by herself! I use it on dry and wet hair and it works great.  A local stylist recommended it to me and I am so glad she did.  Now we finally have a tear-free morning before school!</li>
    <li> Better than other brushes I have used. Still pulls a bit when I get out of the shower but I have pretty thick hair. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull it it as much as regular brushes.</li>
    <li> This brush is a miracle!!  I used it wet and dry on my 6 yr old daughters THIN long hair and my THICK long hair.  Brushes right thru with ease!!  The bristles don&#x27;t jab you and your hair isn&#x27;t pulled - LOVE it and highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush is FANTASTIC. You need to own one if your hair tends to tangle, especially if your hair is long</li>
    <li> I thought to myself, how much do I really *NEED* another hairbrush, but after rave reviews from my sister in law who also has long, thick hair, and the fact that I also have toddler girls, I thought I&#x27;d get one anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fun, although it really wasn&#x27;t, I brushed half of my head, post shower, with my normal brush.  I then brushed the opposite side with this one.  It was literally like I&#x27;d prebrused that side too.  You really have no idea how pleasant brushing your hair can be without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate test though was brushing my 3 1/2 year olds hair after her bath.  She has long and thicker hair too.  To be absolutely sure, I didn&#x27;t hold her hair as I brushed it to see if she&#x27;d whine.  Not a peep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this in the shower, but rather afterwards when my hair is still wet.  The bristles look similar to a traditional brush, but they are softer and flexible.  Therefore, when you&#x27;re brushing, they give and let go of your hair instead of ripping your hair out of your head.</li>
    <li> My wife has very long and thick hair. Always complained about not being able to brush her hair when it&#x27;s wet. So I found this brush. She likes it and it works great.</li>
    <li> Well when this brush arrived and i saw how it felt and looked i thought i wasted 8 dollars...my hair is thick and coarse...how the heck was this gonna work on my hair. So i gave it a try today and i must say, do not judge this brush....it de tangled my hair with minimal hair breakage....a must have for anyone with kinky/curly course hair...pair it with your favorite conditioner and get even better results...</li>
    <li> I used this brush over the past year, and while I loved it, the little rubber ends came off the bristles so I had to throw it out. For $7 I don&#x27;t mind replacing it annually but at $20 or more in a salon there is no way I would buy it again. I have thick, long hair and it is much nicer to use than a traditional brush but a wide tooth comb works great too.</li>
    <li> This has led to a slight reduction in morning tears.  I can&#x27;t really see why it is better than other brushes, but when combined with sprout miracle detangler it seems to help get through my 5 year old&#x27;s long hair.  I&#x27;d say worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> Not typically one to write a review. I purchased this brush thinking it would be great for my daughters hair. I take amusement in getting up every morning and truly waking up to the shrill screeches of pain echoing my house.  The greasy feeling of innumerable  hair products on hand just to manage a braid that requires repeating again at night.  So far it&#x27;s been my favorite part if of parenting. This brush had removed that 30 minute they&#x27;ll from my morning and nightly routine.  Upon receiving it I feel the need to question how it works. I didn&#x27;t do a lot of research but I&#x27;m fairly certain it will run out of magical power eventually. How do I replenish it&#x27;s mana? Is it a matter of rest, or does this brush demand a blood sacrifice be made to it? If so, will it crave more and more as its used? I&#x27;m prepared for either.</li>
    <li> Really works ! Used in my long haired granddaughters . No more whining and crying after washing their hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested I get one of these for my daughter&#x27;s who were fighting having their hair brushed. I cannot say enough about how amazing this hair brush is!  You&#x27;d think every hairbrush is the same, but I have learned different. This brush detaches without hurting and it feels like a gentle scalp massage when you use it. I got one for myself, too!  Now my kids WANT to brush their hair! It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
    <li> Best brsh ever! I have long, thick, course, naturally curly hair!</li>
    <li> Gets through the tangles with less pain, takes longer and still pulls out some hair. Overall better than my regular brush</li>
    <li> This is a day-saver!  My kids have very sensitive heads and this takes out knots with absolutely no pain!!</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t believe all the hype about this brush until I saw my sister use one. Since we were young, my grandma would get us a soft bristle hair brush every year for Christmas. We both have extremely thick hair. My sister&#x27;s is super long and silky, and I&#x27;m very tender headed (with coarse, curly hair) so these were always the best option to avoid tears :). I&#x27;ve used detangling spray all my life and it never seems to work like it should, especially after a day out on the lake or in the ocean. I saw her use her Wet Brush after spending all day on the boat skiing and swimming and riding around in the wind and it brushed through it with ease. She didn&#x27;t even flinch. So, of course, I had to get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT. I was kind of skeptical since, when I opened the box, it had &amp;#34;hard bristles&amp;#34;, but it goes through my hair with absolutely no pull at all. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and haven&#x27;t had to clean it out yet, whereas I would have to clean my old one out every other day...at least. (Thick haired girls feel my pain). Overall I love this brush. It&#x27;s been a lifesaver for my hair.</li>
    <li> I did not buy mine on this site but regardless I have bought 2 because I love the brush so much. I have very long fine hair and this makes brushing my hair so easy. I dont know how it works so well but I love it!</li>
    <li> Works well for hair of average thickness, but if you have REALLY thick, curly hair like I do, it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. The bristles are more flexible than those of a regular brush, and I suppose that&#x27;s how it detangles without all the pulling, but for me, they don&#x27;t go far enough into my hair. The outer layers get brushed adequately, but the inner layers remain tangly and unbrushed. My hair is waist-length and curly as a telephone handset cord, so you can imagine the ordeal of brushing it, even a section at a time. I usually end up using my regular brush in addition to this one, but it does help get some of the tangles out. Every little bit helps. :-)</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter has long, fine hair that gets easily tangled.  Her hairdresser recommended The Wet Brush to me.  I ordered it on Amazon--a full size that came with a smaller travel size as well.  The handles on these two feel rubbery, and the brush really does work wonders.  It glides through the hair with ease with or without the use of conditioner, detangler, etc, resulting in tangle free hair.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well as mine, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the bad.  I liked the brush I got so much that I saw The Wet Brush also at Bed, Bath, and Beyond one day and decided to buy another one to keep just for me in my bathroom so I could stop using the one I bought for my daughter.  This one has a plastic, hard handle.  It does not work nearly as well as the others I purchased from Amazon with the rubbery handles.  The bristles don&#x27;t look different, so I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is other than the handles (which I wouldn&#x27;t think would account for the performance), but this second brush does not move smoothly through the hair at all.  It doesn&#x27;t glide.  It gets caught and pulls at the hair, resulting in ouchies and seems to even contribute to more tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase again because there seems to be some sort of quality control issue.  I love the first brush (and its mini size companion), but the second one is terrible, hence the 3 star rating.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with slow shipping. It took almost a week even though I&#x27;m a Prime member. I&#x27;ve received the black one and don&#x27;t mind the color but the odor is nauseating. It&#x27;s been a couple weeks and the odor wouldn&#x27;t go away. I&#x27;ve never own a wet brush and didn&#x27;t expect this kind of low quality. I&#x27;m not loving this. The bristles look weak a few came bent already. Plus, any other places including drugstores, etc are selling this brush for $8.98. Why wrong advertisement? It made it look like we are getting a great deal from $20 to $9. If you buy this brush on Drugstore, you even get a free gift (another small size Wet Brush). Not worth buying @ Amazon in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and long, so I&#x27;m always worried about breakage and knots. The bristles on this brush are very soft and flexible, enabling it to glide through the hair easily.  It&#x27;s perfect for brushing conditioner through hair when you&#x27;re washing it, and it does a great job detangling wet hair after washing it.  Getting knots out of dry hair is a breeze.  I&#x27;ve used wide toothed combs previously and now I primarily use this brush. FYI...get an extra one to keep in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have A LOT of thick hair, but I got this comb after I got it cut and thinned out a lot, so my hair is easier to brush with anything. However, this brush works a lot better than a comb (which was the only thing I could use on my wet hair before I cut it). It&#x27;s got a nice grip and feels nice.</li>
    <li> This brush is AWESOME! It combed through my and my daughter&#x27;s (wet) hair like a knife through butter. I just wish I had ordered it sooner! Get it - your head will thank you! :)</li>
    <li> My niece has very long curly hair and absolutely loves this brush. I&#x27;ve been using the same brush for twenty five years so I know the importants of a good brush. Keep in mind that even though the picture shows four brushes, you only get one and in the color they choose for you.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and struggle to brush it after the shower.  This is the best brush I have ever used and had decreased the amount of hair damage tremendously. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Does just as advertised. My daughter has long hair that tangles easily, and this brush has been wonderful. She no longer cries or complains when her hair is brushed.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I ordered a lot of them. I have one in every room, if you have tangles or thick hair this is a must have.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush for getting tangles out of wet hair! It is a great brush for dry hair too! I have long hair and getting tangles out of it while wet was very difficult, time consuming and would break some of my hair off! I really love this brush, I listed only 4 stars because after using it for a few months the rubber part with the bristles keeps falling out while brushing.  I am going to try to super glue it soon and see if that works. I am in love with this brush and have bought it as gifts for other people, everyone needs this brush!</li>
    <li> I have extremely tangly hair.&lt;br /&gt;This brush mine as well be made if gold. What a massive relief every single morning for my tender head!</li>
    <li> Best brush ever.  I have long hair that gets really tangled at night.  Usually it takes me forever to brush it out and lost of hair is lost each day.  This brush is so gentle.  I am losing less hair and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush each day. I&#x27;ve used on my niece&#x27;s hair (also long) and she didn&#x27;t cry which means a lot when brushing the hair of a 5 year old!</li>
    <li> The bristles are too pliable, not able to actually brush through wet hair.</li>
    <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, and I have a sensitive head!  Hate my hair pulled.</li>
    <li> But it does.  I have bra length, long, thick Asian hair and I have every brush in the universe.  I thought my Sephora detangler was good but this one is amazing.  I think the thicker your hair is, the more you will appreciate it.  It takes several passes if my hair is very tangly but it works every time.  Color me skeptical but shocked.  I think this would be great for dogs and kids with sensitive scalps or even just kids in general to make grooming much faster.</li>
    <li> My 5 yr old wakes up with terribly knotted hair &amp; this brush glides right through it. It truly is some kind of magic! I&#x27;d love to give these brushes out as party favors for her birthday :-)</li>
    <li> both girls have long hair and what could be different in a brush; big difference; both have made the point to comment to me how much they love it and how well it works , no more ouch! when brushing hair</li>
    <li> Very good brush. My daughter loves it. It was a big issue with her hair. As she has very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I always have issues combing through my hair because I do not wash my hair as often as most. So usually it&#x27;s a painful process that takes a long time. With this brush my hair is knot-free with ease and it done quickly. My hairstylist sells these at her salon for much more than what I paid for on here so it&#x27;s a great deal, especially if you have Amazon Prime!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, soft, the only negative thing is smell. I put it outside for a few days and it helped to diminish the smell.</li>
    <li> Amazing to get through my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair!! This will be my 3rd one, I need one for every bathroom!</li>
    <li> This brush is a life saver! If u have a toddler with tangles, buy it, if u have tangles after washing your hair buy it. We used to use a fine tooth comb and detangler on my little girls hair and would take 30 min and lots of tears. Just used this on one heck of a tangle and no tears, no detangler, was done in 10 min or so. Love this brush!!</li>
    <li> My 6 year old has long hair and often cried while we were brushing her hair. This is what she asked for as a birthday present. It has had made doing her hair so much easier. It does work better when damp or wet. But we usually use detangling spray anyway. She is so much happier to do her hair now.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I find it even better to use while in the shower. I put conditioner in my hair and then brush through. Its great for my daughters too. No more whining while brushing there hair. :)</li>
    <li> I use this brush on my daughters hair as well as mine. We love it! We both have fine, thin hair and somehow this brush doesn&#x27;t pull near as much when working out tangles. It just glides through...well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. This brush has really helped lessen fights with hair brushing after baths/showers. My daughter loves it and does not &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; as much when she brushes her hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine, but stubborn hair. It naughts up like no other and gets very dry and brittle after combing. I&#x27;ve combed it wet, dry, whatever - it was unmanageable! For months I&#x27;ve heard that the Wet Brush is the way to go and that it&#x27;ll comb through naughts softly, leaving your hair perfectly smooth. Finally I broke down and got one. It is by far the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I hope that I can grow my hair out longer than my shoulders, now that I have a brush that gives me naught-free hair. I don&#x27;t even have to brush my hair in the morning if I brushed it the night before; this brush leaves my hair so soft and light. So happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Goes through my hair and my daughters&#x27; so easily wet or dry.  There are no more tears while we brush their hair after shower every night.  Best detangling tool I have found!</li>
    <li> This works perfectly on my thick/long hair! Combing was too painful and brushing was damaging my hair. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these brushes for me and my daughter. I like how easily it brushes through my wet hair right after a shower. It glides through easily and makes quick work of any tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter (8) likes the brush too. We&#x27;ve often struggled with getting her to brush her hair so this was a great compromise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 8 years old and have hair that likes to get tangled!!! when I got the wet brush my hair was as smooth as silk!!! Now my Mom doesn&#x27;t dread brushing out my hair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush works well. It&#x27;s not a miracle brush mind you, but it does a lot better than a standard brush. The girls definitely don&#x27;t complain nearly as much. So this brush was a success and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best brush I have ever used.  It was gentle yet powerful enough to glide right through my long tangled wet hair.  I plan on buying more for the salon.</li>
    <li> Got this brush super quick and love how it detangles my locks! Excellent product will be trying the comb next (:</li>
    <li> This product changed my life.  No kidding.  My kids would scream everytime I comb their knotty hair.  As long as it&#x27;s wet -works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Works really well for getting tangles out, but noticing difficulties with detangling the ends of hair</li>
    <li> i ordered 3 or 4 brushes..i was expecting different colors as the picture and all were sent to me in Black.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for hair that is easily tangled! Still have to be gentle but it does wonders on my hair.  Yay for not going bald!</li>
    <li> It is amazing how well this works.  I have waist length wavy hair and this makes brushing effortless.  It would be nice if the handle was thicker but that really doesn&#x27;t matter because it takes no time at all to brush.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush in the world... I love it so much I gave all the girls in my family one for christmas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best tool for detangling that I used on my kid.  It works somewhat while wet, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea.  It&#x27;s always easier to brush when dry or drying.  The \\&quot;spikes\\&quot; are very fine so I don&#x27;t think it will last as long as the usual ones.  But that&#x27;s the price I&#x27;m willing to pay.  Also, the brush handle is coated with some nice to touch plastic.  From experience this softer layer doesn&#x27;t last as much as simple hard plastic.  So it get 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hard cases of tangling you should be looking for conditioner.  Some very cheap ones will do well if you don&#x27;t care too much about the look of kids - the perfect silky voluminous look.  For that look it gets expensive for adults.  For natural alternatives the best so far is whole milk, and egg is better.  A little bit of oil help but it doesn&#x27;t look good.  Since egg yolk smells, the best is egg white.  Forget about what people tell you about the benefits.  The slippery sticky stuff just can detangle hair if you use it as a conditioner.  Egg white powder is much easier to handler and cheaper since you don&#x27;t need to use a whole egg every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course these natural and potential cheaper alternatives are not as good as some chemicals, the chief ingredients of which is soluble in water and oil at the SAME time.  Therefore I need help from brush like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought two \\&quot;assorted color\\&quot; brush, fully aware that there is no choice.  But I ended up with two black brush. The way Amazon deal with multiple sellers is that when I order, I only see 4 non-black colors.  Now when I writing the review I see a different picture with the 5th black color.  To add insult to injury, the individually package have the words written on it \\&quot;assorted color for the family\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is Discount Infomercial Products.  I can&#x27;t even seem to be able to leave a feedback.  It should go back to eBay, or Aliexpress.</li>
    <li> Brushing through my tangles were once painful and dreadful, but with this brush, combing through my hair is a lot more pleasant and comfortable.  I use this brush everyday now and I can&#x27;t imagine using any other brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING! I had a baby 9 months ago and my hair has sections that have become very curly and tangles easily. Not only does it brush my wet hair easily, but it helps straighten my hair when I blow it dry. Wonderful purchase!</li>
    <li> What a great brush! Glides right through hair, no snagging or pulling. I didn&#x27;t think it would be strong enough to handle an adult head of hair, but it most certainly proved me wrong. I&#x27;m back to buy a couple more.</li>
    <li> Just can&#x27;t believe that this brush works so great.  No more tears and fights when brushing the tangles out of little girls hair.</li>
    <li> My 9 year daughter has wavy long thin hair and gets so tangled. This brush is great after swimming and for getting the tangles out of wet hair. I like it for my hair after the shower.  Helps with less breakage. The only negative is at 1st my daughter said it hurt her scalp?  After a few weeks of using it she no longer complains that her scalp hurt.  I did notice it was red after the 1st time we brushed her hair but now no issues.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my 3.5 year old daughter who hates (hates hates) having her hair brushed after her bath. I had high hopes and it did not disappoint! It really makes such a difference. Yay for no more yelling and screaming! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great for thick curly (My hair) or fine straight hair (my 3 year old&#x27;s). It used to be the battle of the hair in my house.  I have long frizzy, curly, crazy red hair, and my 3 year old has fine, blond, long hair.  Both of us used to struggle with tangles.  The wet brush enables me to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair without tears while she brushes her teeth.  Brushing hair is almost a non- issue now! ( for both of us).  Do not press down on your scalp as the tips of the brush are pretty sharp/small to allow it to glide through the hair.  I dab on a little conditioner on dry hair and start at the ends.  Hold the brush loosely so that you can make gentle corrections to the brush when you encounter a tangle.</li>
    <li> This is a much gentler way to detangle fine hair, even better than a wide-toothed comb, in my opinion. I still tend to find some hair on the brush but it&#x27;s less than with previous brushes.</li>
    <li> I still find my broken or shed hairs in the brush, though I am careful to brush starting g at the ends, working my way up, and never when soaking wet. I have extremely fine hair, so for those with stronger, thicker hair, this may be perfect, but my baby fine hair is still seeking a brush.</li>
    <li> Finally knots are easily removed in the shower with a little conditioner!</li>
    <li> I just got my first Wet Brush and I love it!  I was kind of skeptical, but with all the great reviews I went ahead and purchased one.  When I use this brush it feels so good on my scalp. and I really don&#x27;t want to stop brushing!  It feels amazingly soft, and is no way scratchy like a regular brush. It detangles wonderfully, too.  I have one tiny complaint, though.  The handle is flat and does not feel really nice to my hand.  I am used to more ergonomic brush handles.  This one has semi sharp sides because it is so flat and thin.  That won&#x27;t keep me from using it and loving it, though.  Maybe the next generation Wet Brush will have nicer handles.  I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> Good brush.  Not the miracle I hoped it would be be still, an improvement on our regular brush for our young daughters.</li>
    <li> Have been using a version of this brush for years. After two years had to replace it as it was getting too soft. Just replaced it with another one because it works so good.</li>
    <li> I understood that there might be more than one color when I ordered this from Amazon but the finish was not as noted on the site nor on the box it arrived in. It is shiny, slippery, hard metallic-colored plastic, not rubberized like the box notes and like the first one I ordered through Amazon. Hopefully it will perform the same, but the finish was disappointing and isn&#x27;t comfortable. Check your local Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond to get the brush you want and use a coupon. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do if I want another.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite brush for her crazy, tangled hair. We just moved and lost the brush I bought two years ago so I am back on amazon ordering a replacement. No other brush will do!</li>
    <li> works great wet or dry! inexpensive for product that works so good and I received it within one day! my daughter loves it too!</li>
    <li> My daughter is 4 years old , and has very thick, long, curly hair. Before I got this brush combing her hair was a complete nightmare!!! I don&#x27;t know what makes this brush so great, but now she enjoys brushing her hair, and I can actually do cute stuff with her hair. We call it the magic brush!!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush is unreal. I have super thick and wavy hair that tangles extremely easily. Most brushes just pull and break my hair, but not this one. It used to take forever to brush out my hair, but this brush makes it super easy AND pain free because the bristles are thin and flexible. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what it is intended: Wet hair!  My 4 year gets tangles very easily.  Normally brushing her hair after her bath takes lots of detangler and bribing or else she ends up crying.  With this brush, she didn&#x27;t complain once and I didn&#x27;t use detangler.  I just started brushing towards the bottom of her hair and worked my way up.  I&#x27;ve tried using it on dry hair and to me it seemed the same as any regular brush.  Fast shipping, as always.</li>
    <li> Prior to this brush - I rarely brushed my hair, unless I was planning on wearing it straight. My hair was always tangled in brushes and wide tooth combs weren&#x27;t very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush makes brushing EASY. I just wanted to comment on those who said that the brush doesn&#x27;t go all the way through- from my experience, it doesn&#x27;t FEEL as though it&#x27;s going through my hair but it does. If you brush your hair from the underside (with bristles facing out) you&#x27;ll see that it goes through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brushing with the wetbrush- I have no tangles and it&#x27;s painless. However - I have TONS of hair in the brush. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the brush&#x27;s fault - I lose a lot of hair everyday so maybe that&#x27;s normal for me? I don&#x27;t know- either way, I highly recommend using this brush.</li>
    <li> Got this for my niece and she loves it. She used to cry a lot with regular brushes when my sister or mom used to brush it. But not with this brush. It goes through her hair very smoothly.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters both loved this brush.  They&#x27;ve even called me to thank me again for getting it for them.  No tears, making for very happy mama&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my daughter, as her hair is very fine and thick and tangles easily. I was skeptical, but I was also desperate since my husband does not want to cut her hair (it is VERY long!). I bough this brush, hoping to find something to help me. I found that this brush does best with wet hair, though it does work with dry hair. I won&#x27;t say that it takes out every tangle, but it definitely does better than my regular brush. I recommend this product, but be aware that there will still be tangles regardless.</li>
    <li> If you have little girls buy this brush immediately!! My 5 year old brushes her hair first to get tangles out but would never get them all so then i would do it again when I put it up and it always lead to whines and tears and stress!! We&#x27;ve had this brush for few days now And there&#x27;s no need for a second brushing by me bc she gets them all out the first time and there&#x27;s no discomfort or whining!!! Best....brush ....ever!! Even love it on my hair!! Buy one for every bathroom now!!!</li>
    <li> I have fought with my 10 year olds tangles her entire life, the Wet Brush has eliminated many tears! Truly love this brush, it has changed out lives.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best brush ever. My girls have thick curly hair that gets tangled easily, and this glides right through it.</li>
    <li> When I received this package in the mail, I scoffed at the little bristles. These? In MY thick mane? Please. I was extremely skeptical, but sure enough, as soon as I lifted this brush to my freshly showered head it was like a miracle! Way better than any comb or brush I&#x27;ve used to detangle my hair before.</li>
    <li> Oh my wow.  This seemingly cheap looking (and cheaply priced) brush really does live up to all these reviews.  No control over what color you get (we got Lavender) but who cares when this thing untangles like a dream! Feels like it works slightly better with damp hair but damp or dry, really does work miracles!</li>
    <li> Where has this brush been all my life, my mother would have loved this when I was a kid</li>
    <li> I love this brush! Using on wet or dry hair this brush glides through without having to work from the bottom to the top like I used to do with a regular brush. I have very thick and long hair that was always a pain to brush but now I&#x27;m done in seconds without any tugging or pain.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush. I never understood the hype until I bought one for my toddler. She has long hair and this brush is awesome at detangling. She rarely fights back when I use it on her.</li>
    <li> I ordered two and I received 2 blue ones. I wish they would have sent me 2 different colors, but this brush is amazing for the price. My hair dresser recommended it for me since my hair tangles very easily and my sister uses it since she has hair extensions. We both love it.</li>
    <li> This is such a great brush.  I bought it to help me with de-tangling my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair in the hope that I could avoid some of the yelling and screaming associated with brushing out her hair.  This brush has totally exceeded my expectations for \\&quot;yell-free detangling.\\&quot;  In fact, I loved it so much I bought one for myself hoping that it would prevent some of my hair from falling out. I have not tried it in the shower or for any other wet application other than wet hair so I can&#x27;t say how it holds up to use in water.  The first brush I was sent was blue and the second one was yellow.  Although it&#x27;s made out of plastic, it&#x27;s actually pretty high quality, feels good in your hand and has a good weight to it. This is an overall great brush, totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick, very curly, coarse hair. All my life I have never, NEVER been able to get a brush or a comb throught it. They would actually become stuck. So I finger combed my hair for over 10 years. Then I bought the wet brush. I was like there is no way this going to work. One comb through my hair and my jaw fell open. It WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can finally brush all the knots and tangles out my hair. My hair is shiner and healthier and has much less breakage!!!! Buy this!!!!! It really truly works!!!!!!!!! Buy as many as you can!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Such a simple looking brush that&#x27;s not too big and not too small and looks very ordinary. You would never know that it is also the best brush you will ever own! I ordered it after finally getting tired of my 5 year old daughter crying every time I brushed her hair. We got it in the mail yesterday and brushed each other&#x27;s hair. My daughter&#x27;s hair was a dry tangled mess and mine was wet with tangled ends. The brush detangled our hair with ease. I am considering buying another to have for a spare.</li>
    <li> I bought several of these brushes for my daughters that have long hair.  It works so much better than a wide tooth comb and is more comfortable against the scalp.  My purchase on Amazon was half the price my salon charged when I was first introduced to this brush</li>
    <li> I have unmanageably thin, KNOTTED hair. I would spend 15 minutes EASILY fighting through tangles after a shower after dousing my hair in both conditioner and \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; leave in conditioning treatment. This brush miraculously gets through tangles with NO PROBLEM at all. I even stopped using \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; as much as I used to because it left my hair greasy and weighed down. This is the best product I could have asked for, especially for $7!</li>
    <li> The bristles are a bit longer than most brushes, and they are softer than paddle brushes I am used to. I think that&#x27;s why they comb through the hair so nicely without tugging or any ripping. I like this brush so much I am thinking about buying for everyone on my list that has long hair this coming Christmas!</li>
    <li> This really works!!! This is a must have for detangling even the tightest curls.  It has saved me quite a bit of time and hair.</li>
    <li> I like the brush, but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in brushing between this one and the regular brush I got from the store. My daughter and I both have long thick hair. It is still pretty difficult to get the tangles out. I have to take the hair in sections. Again, good brush but nothing special.</li>
    <li> When I received this brush, I wasn&#x27;t all that optimistic that it would be the \\&quot;most amazing after shower brush you will ever use,\\&quot; but it really is! It slides right through my hair and detangles it effortlessly. I absolutely recommend this!</li>
    <li> It really does get the tangles out without any pain! It&#x27;s a great product. I would buy it for all my friends</li>
    <li> My daughter likes the brushes, but she is only 6 yrs old. You can use it and it may work right and my not, the knots never go away unless you brush for 20 min. They are cheap and everything which is good, but I would not ever buy another one again.</li>
    <li> I know I say best purchase EVER but really! I have always had issues with snarly tangled hair. I have used the wide tooth combs and they work alright. I got this and fell in love. It is so nice and not so stiff. I have not had a single issue with it. Makes hair time easier! It only takes me 30 seconds now to comb through unlike a comb where I have to sit and work on every snag. This does it for you and it is so flexible. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love my wet brush. It painlessly detangles even the messiest wet hair.  I use it every time after I shower now.</li>
    <li> I received mine yesterday for Christmas and I already love it! I do indeed see a difference. My hair looks different today...NO KIDDING! I used it on my wet hair last night and let my hair air dry. This morning my hair looks and feels softer and smoother. It detangled my hair very easily.I also noticed less breakage, less hair left behind on the brush when I was done brushing. I&#x27;m sold! Thinking of buying more in different colors.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  I could sing this brushes praise for days!  I grew up crying every time I had to have my long, thick hair brushed so much that my dad invented a brush to roll out of my tangles and not hurt.  This brush does the job somehow perfectly.  For those that talk about not working, it&#x27;s because you do have to use more strokes to get through your long and thick hair but it&#x27;s designed to not pull which means more strokes. This brush is so amazing that my very high end salon even carries it solely.</li>
    <li> .....But it does!!  My wife and girls swear by this brush and that is saying alot....nuff said....just buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll come back to thank me :)</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by a brush that would actually not tear my hair out when wet. This one does the job. I usually use a wide-toothed comb on my hair, but this brush was even better. I am at an age where I prefer to lose fewer rather than more hairs when I shampoo, so this did the trick. Good product.</li>
    <li> All the brushes were the same color when ordering several I expected different colors. That is my only complaint they are for different people and can&#x27;t tell them apart.</li>
    <li> Does wonders for detangling my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, even when dry. She used to avoid brushing her hair but this brush does the trick - she even snuck it into her room and brushed on her own. Very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star ding for the annoying smell. It&#x27;s only been a few days so hopefully the smell goes away, but out of the package it was like new car tires... Today was better.</li>
    <li> Three women in one house. I have long, baby fine hair. My oldest has straight, long, insanely thick hair. My youngest has kinky, curly, long, ethnic hair. We&#x27;re all obsessed with hair products, and we&#x27;re usually disappointed by our hyped purchases. I bought this at the salon b/c the hairstylest swore by it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I was wrong. Seriously, we couldn&#x27;t live without it. We all brush the knots out in the shower with conditioner. It has saved time, conditioner and tears. I blow my hair out with it. My fine hair looks smooth and frizz free (a problem) when I&#x27;m finished. We&#x27;ve discussed stockpiling this brush in case it gets discontinued. This is probably my second review ever on Amazon. The last one was to complain. I&#x27;m a real person. For $8.++, how can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> I bought the wet brush for my 8yr old daughter &amp; she loves it! She used to lose all her brushes on purpose &amp; hated having to brush. Now she actually keeps up with this brush &amp; refuses to use another. The bristles are not hard so it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair as she brushes.This is the only brand I will buy for her!</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and still took a chance ordering  the brush...as soon as I opened the package I could smell it. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it other than a toxic smell.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s really do no like having their wavy hair brushed when wet. I bought this brush thinking that it would help make the process easier and a little less painless. I WAS WRONG. This brush does not make brushing wet hair easier, in fact, it appears to cause a lot of discomfort and breakage. Great concept but not practical. I do not recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush for my long hair and my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. It get a through tangles better than any brush we have and she doesn&#x27;t complain when I brush her hair anymore. It is a great value for the price and works as promised.</li>
    <li> I got one of these for myself and one of these for my niece who has VERY thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it does not hurt to brush my hair, but I haven&#x27;t been using this product that much because of how many split ends it caused for me and my niece both. It&#x27;s a little unfortunate. I still have the brush and I toss it in my beach/pool bag because when it comes to getting tangles out at the beach or pool this product is a lifesaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this product for everyday use because of the split ends!</li>
    <li> These work fantastic for my daughters who used to complain when I brushed their hair about it hurting. These work great without the painful tug.</li>
    <li> Great on  thick wet hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this brush for the first time on wet hair this morning, and it really worked well, I was surprised at how well, actually.  (I used on dry hair yesterday and it also worked well.)  I got this after seeing one at my colorist&#x27;s station and asking her about it.  I have long, very thick, moderately fine hair, and it tangles very easily.  I&#x27;m giving the brush 4 stars rather than 5, because I can tell that it&#x27;s not going to hold up very long.  The bristles are thin and the tips are unevenly coated, and I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s one of those products that I&#x27;ll have to replace regularly, especially with thick hair.  However, at this price and for the effectiveness of it, I don&#x27;t think that makes it a deal breaker!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my two year old niece would cry whenever we tried to brush her pretty curls.  It took a few baths for her to get use to not be afraid of the brush anymore and now she doesn&#x27;t mind one bit.  When she wakes up I wet down the brush and her bouncing curls are back with no tears!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the brush on my hair too.  I have long hair and it tangles a lot so I keep one in the shower and one in my beach bag. I love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 7 year old daughter! No more tears as we comb through tangles. She actually does it herself with no complaints now!</li>
    <li> I am Spanish and I have extremely thick curly hair almost to my butt. I&#x27;m 24 and I have been using detangler on my hair since I was young . I would still struggle with brushing my hair I hated it. My eyes would tear sometimes cause it hurt so bad . If I seem this brush in the store I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it because I never borne these things work, but my mom bought it for me . It&#x27;s AMAZING. I never wrote a review before but I had to write it for this . It got my hair knot free in under a minute ... Unbelievable.. Wish she found it sooner.  And it&#x27;s pink my favorite color ... Perfect</li>
    <li> This works as advertised. My hair is fine, but there is a lot of it, and normally, I just grit my teeth as I work through post-shower or windy-day knots. This thing just breezes through everything, and you can&#x27;t beat that price. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Best investment for long thick wet hair is a wet hair brush!! It is pain free and detangles fast.</li>
    <li> I will not use any other brush for my mess of hair on top of my hair! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush for my daughters super curly hair!</li>
    <li> The best brush for my daughter thus far!!  She has very thick mixed hair that is part curly and caring for her hair is a major process but this brush makes it so much easier and it&#x27;s also easy to clean and disinfect!!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how wonderfully this brush works!!! I find myself studying it, but I have nary a clue. No matter. IT WORKS as claimed. And is reasonably priced!. I have only had it for 2 weeks, but I am buying 4 of them, as stocking stuffers for my girls (2 daughter in laws and 2 granddaughters).&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I am 65, but weary hair very long (past my bra strap), in a somewhat restrained, ponytail. It is much easier than trying to tame a short style.</li>
    <li> Goes through my long hair with no problem and no pulling. Love it. Will buy it again if I ever lose this one.</li>
    <li> My daughter has 3b thick hair and the brush did little to assist with the detangling.  I had tons of conditioner in her hair while trying to use the wet comb and brush…. This product didn&#x27;t help and my 5 year old daughter cried the entire time.</li>
    <li> Works well for my daughter&#x27;s thick, wavy hair and sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> Works fabulous! I have lots of fine, curly hair and this just goes through it like butter! It&#x27;s amazing how well it works on detangling.</li>
    <li> Having VERY long, THICK hair, I do NOT know how I&#x27;ve lived w/out this brush for so long!!! Does wonders on both wet and dry hair, no more pain trying to get through the knots, very nice rubbery grip to it.</li>
    <li> Why am I one of so few for whom this thing did nothing? I have long, wavy hair--but it is quite fine.  This brush just kind of skimmed the surface of it and couldn&#x27;t work through the tangles.  The bristles are not substantial enough to work through a knot---that&#x27;s why, I think, they just skim over it.  I don&#x27;t understand how this has received so many high reviews: I must have the wrong kind of hair or must have been using it wrong!</li>
    <li> After spending years trying to find a hairbrush that would slip easily through my hair I was finally rewarded with the results from the Wet Brush Detangler Shower Brush! It&#x27;s a dream.</li>
    <li> I have a teen daughter who is extremely extremely sensitive to hair brushing. This exact product was recommended by another parent. I read many of the reviews and decided to try it. Amazing. It has soft bristles, but still brushes through hair. She has medium thick hair and I have thin hair. Comfortable grip/handle.  Great color (purple-her favorite) and more than reasonably priced. I like hers so much-I&#x27;m buying myself one. :)</li>
    <li> My daughter cries every time I brush her hair. She refuses to let me cut it so it is long and gets lots of tangles. We decided to try this brush and it has been so much more bearable. It definitely works better with wet hair. It still works better than other brushes in dry hair but it does pull more than it does wet. I even like to use it because I feel like it is more gentle on my hair and doesn&#x27;t break it off as bad.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law and granddaughter have long, thick, curly hair.  We have tried so many products.  I saw this product rated in a newspaper and tried it.  They both loved it.  It did not pull on the hair and also there was hardly any hair left in the brush after using.  My granddaughter is young and it took hours to detangle her hair so this is a time saver!!  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works better than a regular brush, my daughter doesn&#x27;t mind too much now when i brush her hair. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is magic but is better than before. I also noticed that it works better when her is wet.</li>
    <li> Tried this for kids with waist length, thick and curly hair.  Works best with wet hair with conditioner in it.  But seems to penetrate only the top layer of the hair.  Would be good for a child who gets really upset about having hair brushed as it gets the job done without pain but it WILL take longer.</li>
    <li> I have several Wet Brushes and love them! This is the original Wet Brush and it works great on wet hair.</li>
    <li> I never thought I could get that excited for a brush.  I&#x27;ve bought other detangling brushes, and they really did not work really well on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has long, straight, fine hair which tangles very easily probably due to the fact that she likes to use her hair as a napkin, so there is always food in it (ewww!).  I had seen some written recommendation somewhere to buy the &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34;, and since it was a good deal at Christmas-time, I decided to buy it because I couldn&#x27;t find DD&#x27;s other brush and I was really sick of brushing and pulling her hair out.  This thing is worth its weight in gold!  Works great on wet hair and dry hair.  I&#x27;m so impressed!  I&#x27;m tempted to buy a couple of them for when I inevitably lose this one.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush is a dream come true for children and adults with long hair or that which tangles easily.  It just swipes right through wet hair like magic.  When I first heard about this brush, I was wary but decided to give it a try.  My daughter is so happy that I did! She loves it!</li>
    <li> If your kids cry when you brush their hair -- stop torturing them and by this brush. I have curly hair and grew up crying every time I brushed my hair until the nerve endings in my head seemed to lose sensitivity. Wish this brush had been around then. Bought it for my curly haired nieces a couple of years ago. They actually started to like brushing their hair and my sister-in-law was so happy that she thanked me for a month every time I called her. She felt like she was hurting her children every day when she helped them brush their hair. Second time the kids used the brush they told Mom they were big girls now and could brush it themselves since it didn&#x27;t hurt anymore. My goddaughters who are Chinese have thick hair and actually had the same problem until I got them the brush as well. Best thing I ever bought from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after hearing one of my favorite beauty gurus rave about it. I saw the high amazon rating too and knew I had to have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed! I have very thick hair that tangles constantly so I thought this would solve all my problems. My hair has broken so many brushes that I figured it was time to invest in an awesome brush like this was supposed to be. Nope. The bristles are so thin and bendy that they barely brush through my hair, let alone detangle it. The Wet Brush just brushes over the knots, what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This brush may work well for people with thin hair, but I would advise thick-haired people like myself to stay away.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Granddaughter who has major problems with detangeling her long hair and she loves it. She not only uses it for the detangling after a shower but all the time.</li>
    <li> This brush didn&#x27;t help my hair AT ALL!  My other brushes were way better than this one.  I&#x27;d give it 0 stars if I could.  Bad product.  Do not buy</li>
    <li> my daughter have big wavy hair that knotted up easily, but the wet brush works fabulous dry or wet. No more tears .</li>
    <li> I have a four year old grand daughter who hates having her hair combed.  After shampooing I run the &amp;#34;magic brush&amp;#34; through her hair without any trouble.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter because she has that rare and terrible combo, fine but somehow thick hair.  She adores it?  Goes through her hair wet or dry, virtually painless.  Highly recommend for women with long hair of any texture.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and it constantly tangles. This brush does a great untangling my hair without breakage. Ginally a product that works as advertised. The handle is designed to work with you and it cleans easily. Would recommend to anyone to wants to keep their well groomed.</li>
    <li> This brush is really nice.  It works well with dry or wet hair.  We have had it for a while and the quality is holding up well.</li>
    <li> Cannot rave enough!  My daughter has not cut her hair in three years.  You can imagine the crazy length and condition of the ends.  This brush saves SOOOOO much time.  It works dry but is AMAZING on her wet hair.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I got my brush quick. I love it! I have fine hair &amp; I&#x27;m tender headed. This brush doesn&#x27;t pull my hair whether it&#x27;s wet or dry. I had tried my nieces b4 I bought my own 2 see wht all the fuzz was about. It&#x27;s truly  worth the money.</li>
    <li> This brush will change your life and your hair. Don&#x27;t be fooled by it&#x27;s ordinary appearance, it glides through tangled wet hair like nothing else. I&#x27;ve tried loads of brushes and combs in the search for tangle-free locks but this one is the best I&#x27;ve encountered! I have very long thin hair that tangles literally every day and usually requires 10 minutes of brushing and combing, but with this brush I&#x27;m done in 60 seconds!</li>
    <li> Just awesome - works beautifully</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush. I&#x27;ve bought 3 so far. I&#x27;m not going to say that it put an end to toddler hair brushing tantrums, but significantly reduced the pain involved and now brushing is much calmer. I enjoy using it too. I will buy more in future.</li>
    <li> The best brush ever. I have waist length hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick coarse hair and this brush really didn&#x27;t work for me! It hurt my head when I brushed my hair and i&#x27;ve never been tender headed! It seems to get some tangles out closer to the root but the tangles below you really have to work at like any other brush. Now, a week later, my brush isn&#x27;t even working on my hair at all, that&#x27;s confusing?! The brush may work if you don&#x27;t have thick hair but if you do have thick hair I would pass on this brush. My brush also had black marks and was chipped when it arrived.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because her hair was so tangled after getting out of the shower.  Her cousin told her about this product because she had the same problem.  Since getting this brush, I have not heard her complain one bit.  She has told me over and over how much better she feels when brushing her hair.  I&#x27;m glad there is a product out there like this.</li>
    <li> Works great, no slip from your hands in shower like other brushes do.  Recommended by my hair stylist and me.</li>
    <li> Not bad, works best when hairs wet. Hehe bought it for my daughter she likes it, hurts less than all the other brushes</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad brush but the chemical smell was so strong that I refuse to use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair. Even after a week of purchasing this product it stinks.... who knows what kind of chemicals are in the plastic. Not for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED ON 05/20/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company has great customer service. They contacted me and sent a new brush. This one was purple instead of pink. The new brush didn&#x27;t smell bad at all and actually works great on my 3 year old old curly hair. The original brush I bought was pink and the horrible smell started to fade now. Thanks for such a good customer service!</li>
    <li> I am disabled and can not take care of my medium length hair. It was badly tangled and I could not get tangles out. I took my wet brush to the beauty shop on Good Friday I told them I didn&#x27;t of want to cut my hair. Tina washed my have and within in five minutes my hair was tangle free. So I can go to church Easter Sunday with my hair. Not tangled. Thank you for this wet brush. It really works and it did not hurt getting the tangles out. I recommend this brush. 4/3/2015</li>
    <li> Brush broke within a 2-3 months.. bristles receded into brush.  I have owned other WetBrushes but the one purchased here was defective.</li>
    <li> I have thick, semi-textured, curly hair and this did absolutely nothing for me. I don&#x27;t understand the hype!</li>
    <li> No different than any other brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft but does the work. My girl has very thin hair that breaks easily and tangles all the time. This made my life (and especially mornings) much easier! Recommend.</li>
    <li> Combing hair is still causes a full blown melt down, but we are able to knock it out in a couple of seconds thanks to the wet brush. I foresee buying many of these over the years.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this brush and the bristles are very soft against my head. I have short thin hair.  However it does have a little bit of a smell. For a detangling brush it works well, but I personally wish the bristles had a little bit more force.</li>
    <li> I use this after long runs or any other time my hair is ridiculously tangled, and it saves my hair from breaking as much while saving me time and frustration.</li>
    <li> This brush is the creme of the crop!  I have thick, corse hair and it brushes through my hair like it&#x27;s silk.</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed so she has very curly hair that gets tangled and knotted all the time and this brush works wonderfully to get them all out without pulling on her hair. I have used it on wet and dry hair and it works great on both.</li>
    <li> Perfection! Two happy daughters &#x3D; happy mommy!</li>
    <li> My daughter has beautiful curls, but trying to comb or brush them is a nightmare. Even when wet, it&#x27;s always a hassle trying to get her to sit still. This brush helps out, she doesn&#x27;t even feel me brushing her hair. When I get to a knotted part, it gets a little tough, but overall good product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product does not pull hair</li>
    <li> Holy crap. How have I lived without this brush for this long??? Totally works for myself and my one year old daughter with tons of hair.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that a simple brush could solve our toddler screaming problems.  Now I&#x27;m a believer! I used this brush on my two girls, aged 1 and 5 years. My 1 year old has extremely curly hair that has always been difficult and painful to comb; now it takes only seconds and no pain! My 5 year old has always been a screamer when it came time to comb her hair; now she sings through it and says there is no pain. I am never going back to any of the brushes we have tried in the past. This has ended our search for the perfect toddler brush. I&#x27;m doing a happy dance!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, long hair, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to tangle. Untangling, however, is a different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I got tired of ripping out clumps of hair, or even worse, hacking away at mats with a pair of scissors. Desperate for a solution, I took to Amazon, and my search led me here. I read the reviews, and though I was skeptical at first, I figured $7.51 wouldn&#x27;t break the bank if it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I unpacked it, I stared at it with disappointment. It looks like any other brush I&#x27;ve bought in the past. Still, I decided it was worth a shot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my eyes were opened! The brush simply glided through my hair with no snagging, pulling, or breaking! No clumps of dead tangled hair! No pain! I&#x27;m not entirely sure what makes this brush different -- as I said, it looks like any other -- but if I had to guess, I would say it&#x27;s the bristles. They are thin and flexible and seem to work WITH your hair, not against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been brushing my hair all day. I love this brush so much that I am buying the mini-sized one to keep in my purse. I highly recommend this brush!!!!</li>
    <li> EVEN THOUGH THE PICTURE SHOWS BRIGHT COLORS OF THESE BRUSHES, I RECEIVED A BLACK ONE! THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR MY DAUGHTER--WHO GETS A LOT OF TANGLES AFTER WASHING HER HAIR. SHE DOESNT LIKE THE COLOR SO I ENDED UP WITH IT. I WISH THEY COULD GIVE YOU THE OPTION OF COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM!</li>
    <li> Wet or dry it is the best brush for my shoulder length hair.  I wash it on the top rack in the dishwasher.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  It makes brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair so easy.  Wet or dry.  I&#x27;m not sure why it is called a &#x27;shower brush&#x27;.  I suppose it could certainly be used in the shower, but works just as well outside of the shower!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews on this page, and I can say that they are completely accurate. I love brushing my hair with this brush. I have long thick hair that I hate detangling and every time I brush; I just rip and yank. But brushing my hair with this brush is a wonderful, soft, luxurious experience. I needed this brush 20 years ago! I can&#x27;t wait to buy this for my sister. No more knots, tangles, pain or hair coming out. It is a miracle!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend as a stocking stuffer. She loves these brushes, so I bought her another one (really just needed to fill the stocking LOL). She was happy!</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES this brush. I was going to buy the as seen on tv one (she&#x27;s been begging for it) but didn&#x27;t realize that you have to replace the head, so I found this one and it&#x27;s AMAZING!!! It works on wet and dry just as it advertises.</li>
    <li> My 8 year old was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with the same type of hair that I have - super thick, wavy, very tangle-prone.  No matter how much conditioner we slap on, she has mats/tangles all through her hair after washing.  We&#x27;ve tried just about every &amp;#34;miracle detangling&amp;#34; brush and spray out there, and they never seem to live up to the hype.  One of my daughter&#x27;s classmates mentioned the Wet Brush to her, and she talked about it daily until I finally bought it for her.  We were both excited to use it, but disappointed to find that it&#x27;s truly no better for her hair than the Knot Genie or any of the other detanglers we&#x27;ve tried.  The bristles are very soft and flexible, but they don&#x27;t truly detangle - they just glide over top of the mats in her hair.  They don&#x27;t reach all the way through to the underneath of her hair - it&#x27;s like the bristles only glide over the very top layer. I still have to comb through not only the very tangly under layer of her hair, but also tackle each individual tangle in the top layer with this brush, which still pulls and makes her spazz out, no matter how gentle I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not any better than all the other brushes just like it out there.  It would probably work better for someone with thinner hair who isn&#x27;t so prone to matting.</li>
    <li> I just want to say I have wavy kind of curly hair, and the brush does a very good job</li>
    <li> Works well in the shower for my waist length hair. It really is great.  The bristles are fine and provide some &#x27;give&#x27; as it moves along the hair which helps to eliminate knots I use to get with stiff-bristle brushes.  I have only had it a few months and can say that I love it.  Can&#x27;t say much on durability yet, however it appears to be well made and will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for combing through wet hair (we use it in place of a comb now), but also works well for untangling dry hair. My kids prefer I brush their hair with this over any other brush. I&#x27;ll be purchasing a few more soon so we&#x27;re not always looking for this one!</li>
    <li> Gentle enough for my little one&#x27;s locks, yet strong enough to detangle my curls, without flattening them. I&#x27;ve used it dry and wet with great results. It looks sturdy, but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how it will hold up to us day in day out.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for after shower tangles!  It was recommended by my stylist, and I love it!  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I had a plain, everyday bristled brush I bought from a grocery store in the beauty section...and this brush did not feel much different nor worked that well.  I actually like my old brush better. This brush still pulled my hair and the bristles are so thin, they are kinda flimsy and don&#x27;t go through my hair as good as hoped. And I add, my hair is not thick and it is straight and normal.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for kids with curly hair ... it minimizes the crying and the ouchies :) It hurts a little because the bristles feel a little sharp at first but that&#x27;s the trick that makes it flexible enough to help the tangled hair</li>
    <li> I think the title says it all, the first time I used this product it was amazing, it brushes my hair leaving as much to no tangles in my hair. My hair is very thick and wavy and I have a lotnof it. This brush works geeat when I am brushing and atyling my hair. Plus, tyey come in differwnt colors! I refuse to use any brush besides this!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave long reviews, but this brush deserves one. This thing is awesome. My hair tends to run on the side of &amp;#34;electrocuted muppet&amp;#34;  when I get out of the shower. It is naturally wavy and is down to my waist. I usually have to wait until it is dry to even try to brush it. This brush ran through my hair like silk!  On the days I wear my hair straightened, I will just pick it up to run it through my hair since it also feels awesome on my scalp. (Similar to the sensation of digging in my ear with a q-tip. I&#x27;m just saying.) I highly recommend this brush for everyone one. Even bald guys. (See comment above.)</li>
    <li> Works like a regular brush to me, loved the color pink they sent me and I use it more than I thought.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES this brush.  We bought it several years ago when she was in elementary school.  She has semi-curly hair which is super fine and tangles easily.  We tried detangling spray but that only semi-worked.  Before we bought this brush, she would cry every time we brushed her hair.  Now she loves brushing her hair.  It gets the tangles out of wet or dry hair.  I have recommended this brush to numerous people.  It has been a lifesaver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling my 4 year old&#x27;s knotted up long hair for a while now. It&#x27;s almost impossible to get through when it&#x27;s wet. I&#x27;ve been tempted to cut it many times due to our battles to get the knots out. This brush is PERFECT! With a little conditioner and this brush, we&#x27;re getting through knots with little problem. It works just as well on dry hair! As long as I have daughters, these brushes will be in my house.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse hair and this works GREAT!  It slides right through knotted, wet hair without tearing the strands!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush for all hair types.  Purchase of daughters and granddaughters and they love it.  The only brush granddaughters will use.</li>
    <li> My grand kids won&#x27;t let me touch their hair after a bath unless I have this brush! It glides right through long wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;And we are all happy.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is a tangled mess every day. We brush her hair everyday, 2,3 sometimes 4 times a day. As soon as the product arrive she tried it out and I could not believe what I was seeing. It went right through her hair, NO PROBLEM! This product is so worth the tiny investment, I plan to tell everyone I know about it. No more crying and ripping hair out, if your looking for a detangling brush this is it!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and liked it so much I ordered another.  I&#x27;ve got long fine hair and this brush really does a nice job of getting the tangles out without pulling my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has curly hair &amp; she would avoid getting her hair brushed at all cost before we found this brush. The first time we used this brush, it only took a few minutes to brush out her hair - wet &amp; tangled after a bath. I was used to spending about 20 minutes carefully working section by section before. This brush is excellent! I do recommend following the instructions for the first time or two - for long hair try brushing through the lower half first, then brush from the top down the full length. I used to have to coax my daughter to allow me to brush the tangles from her hair, and now with this brush she asks me to wet her hair &amp; brush it out every day!</li>
    <li> Great brush for my hair, which is long but fine and tends to get tangled easily.</li>
    <li> The brush works fine but it has a horrible smell.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for my hair made cheaply I think</li>
    <li> My 16 year old thanked me profusely for buying her this brush. She has that typical teenage hair down to her you-know-what and she said this significantly saves her time brushing out when wet. I went solely on the Amazon reviews and they were accurate. I would not have thought a brush could detangle as well, but this one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing</li>
    <li> This brush works as it says it does. I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Especially now that she is growing her hair out.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected per description. My 9 yr-old used it by herself in shower and according to her &amp;#34;it worked&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very fine hair and I bought this on recommendations from several friends. Apparently, it works on my different hair types. I love using it myself on thick hair. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My hair always tangles up despite using the best conditioners out there.  I accidentally came across this brush and decided to give it a try.  It makes a huge difference on my hair and I am not sure what the difference is between using an Ouch-less brush and this brush, but it definitely works!! I can towel dry my hair and brush out the tangles with no pain! I highly recommend this brush! In addition, delivery was prompt!!  Gotta love Amazon Prime!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister and she loved it! I ended up buying one for me and for my sister-in-law too! Our hair always gets so tangled from the saltwater and the boat wind.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Love it!It works great to comb my daughter&#x27;s hair and get out tangles! Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughters both have long, thick, wavy hair that cannot be brushed easily at the best of times, so I purchased these brushes based on the reviews.  Both girls LOVE them!  Whether brushing their hair while conditioning, or when using with a detangling spray, there is virtually no pulling or breakage, and, best of all, no complaining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Tried it even if I was skeptical.  It does work.  I&#x27;d say 85% pain free when detangling.  This is great.  Take it easy and take your time.  Great product .  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have sort of thick, straight hair. I&#x27;ve had my share of tangles and they&#x27;ve been nasty to try and comb through, but this brush really does do some kind of supernatural magic trick that combs through your tangles like butter.    I used to avoid anything but wide-tooth combs on my hair when it was wet, but this is so much more effective. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Bought for someone else; however, I purchased them elsewhere and they are awesome for curly and wavy hair! They are a couple of dollars more online.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST brush I&#x27;ve ever owned!  I have very thick, naturally curly, prone to tangling locks (read: unruly hair) and this brush has changed my life!!  If your hair is prone to tangles and you struggle with brushing it, please buy this brush!  You won&#x27;t regret it.  :)</li>
    <li> Great brush. Works very well for my hairpiece.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is one of those great, small purchases. I&#x27;m almost tempted to buy another one as now I want to leave one in the shower for getting conditioner through my hair and then have one that&#x27;s relatively dry for when it&#x27;s time to blow-dry and style my hair. Lightweight, comfortable handle, and truly seems easy on the hair as it doesn&#x27;t snag and doesn&#x27;t appear to be causing any breakage at all. I already have an assortment of other shampoo brushes and wet-hair combs and other related tools and devices, but his has a nice niche of its own. This and the fabulous Croc tension comb that actually gives me the ability to lift up sections of my hair to use the flat iron in a way that almost acts like a third hand are both great helps especially with such unruly, frizzy hair as mine. With all of the big issues in the world, sometimes it&#x27;s nice to celebrate these small finds...</li>
    <li> Buy this brush. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t fully understand why or how this brush works but it&#x27;s unbelievable. My routine before Wet Brush: shampoo, apply conditioner, split hair into two sections, finger brush hair to detangle(ish), rinse out conditioner while finger brushing. After getting out of the shower I would still have to section off my hair and slowly brush it working from tip to root. So time consuming! I just got out of the shower, without the whole finger brushing routine and detangled my hair in under a minute. I am in awe.</li>
    <li> this works i didnt have to pull at my hair it was very gentle made the task of brushing less time consuming and violent..my hair is a ltl on the curly side just dont use it with a blow dryer the bristles will bend.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the wet brush for years now. It&#x27;s the only brush we use on our hair now. I&#x27;ve never come across a brush that could go right through my hair straight out of the shower. It&#x27;s especially great on long hair.</li>
    <li> Awful brush! This brush did not work any better than the old brush I already had. The bristles are hard and sharp. It felt like needles poking me in the head every time I tried to brush my hair. Couldn&#x27;t stand using it! Also, the handle is flat instead of round so it&#x27;s harder to hold. This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased. Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> Just buy one.  They&#x27;re amazing!</li>
    <li> My hair gets ultra tangly, I used to condition my hair twice. Once to get some of the tangles out, and then the 2nd time I&#x27;d brush it with a detangling comb. I&#x27;d carefully work my way from the ends to the roots all the while my hair was making terrible ripping noises. But with this brush everything is so much easier! I love it! I have thin hair strands but A LOT of them, so my hair is thick too. I gave my first one to my sister and she loves it. I bought a 2nd one for myself. I</li>
    <li> Awesome for combing out my naturally curly hair! Been looking for something like this for a long time! Buy it now!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! Can&#x27;t put enough stars! It brushes through both my wet &amp; dry hair perfectly with no pain.  All the struggles that I used to have brushing through my long curly hair are gone. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have a full head of curly hair and this brush is the softest I even comb my 1 year olds hair with it. I haven&#x27;t seen no bristles come out either.</li>
    <li> This is a NICE Brush!!  My wife and I both have long hair and we agree that wet or dry this brush is a lot better than the ones we&#x27;ve used previously.  Gets through knots easier and is even gentle enough for my son&#x27;s ridiculously curly hair.  I think everyone has a favorite hair brush and it is kind of a personal thing.  But if you&#x27;re looking for something new, give this a try.  It&#x27;s inexpensive enough to find out if it works for you too.</li>
    <li> It is a good brush but it also keeps dust. How to get the dust off the brush?</li>
    <li> Awesome! It really works!</li>
    <li> Liked it enough to buy a second one.</li>
    <li> i purchased this as a gift &amp; it went over well</li>
    <li> We use this on our 4 year old&#x27;s curly hair to get out the tangles.  It works great!  I also use it, but it&#x27;s hard to brush it through my thick hair.  It takes much longer than a regular brush.</li>
    <li> This is my third of this brush. Mine don&#x27;t last too long because I heat style with them but this is fantastic, I also bought the mini size brush for my daughter who is 22 months and gets very tangly hair.</li>
    <li> The brush quality not good. My two girls doesn&#x27;t like to brush her hair used this brush. I found more color and same price in Sally shop.</li>
    <li> I heard these are for children.  But I bought one for myself as my hair has lots of snarled.  It&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life. No joking. My kids would scream everytime I comb their knotty hair. As long as it&#x27;s wet -works like a charm. Anything to make my life easier;-))</li>
    <li> For anyone like me who is wondering &amp;#34;how on Earth does this brush that looks like something from the Dollar Store intend to flow through my wet hair without ripping off my scalp? And for a price that doesn&#x27;t make me sad?&amp;#34; here&#x27;s what I can tell you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it actually does what it says it will do.  Sadly though, no, it isn&#x27;t magic.  It&#x27;s actually kind of clever.  The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; of the brush are VERY thin and VERY flexible.  And the &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; where the bristles meet the brush is a bit squishy as well, presumably so the bristles don&#x27;t snap right off when they bend.  So anyway, rather than getting caught in your hair and tugging/tearing at it, the bristles simply bend out of the way.  So it isn&#x27;t as if you&#x27;ll get it through your wet hair on the first try exactly.  It&#x27;s more like you&#x27;ll work out the kinks until you actually can run the brush completely through your wet hair in one sweep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own hair is LONG.  It is thick, it likes to tangle, and generally be a hassle.  This thing isn&#x27;t my everyday brush, but when I need to smooth out my wet hair in a hurry, it&#x27;s a life saver.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much. I always brush my hair right after I shower and usually not any other time since my hair is super curly and it will become an afro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this brush for a very long time and I don&#x27;t think you choose the color because I got yellow but I didn&#x27;t really care. It does the job and is quite amazing!</li>
    <li> After years of begging my 8 yr old to brush her own hair, and years of screaming,kicking and crying when I brushed, this brush is a dream come true. It really does work well! Yes there is still some tugging as others have stated, but it&#x27;s so much less than before. Any reduction in pain is worth it for my daughter and I. And yes, it does smell a little due to the material, but that is such a minor inconvenience for us. And with the small size, my child finally brushes her own hair in the morning without complaint. My only reason for 1 less star is the brush came with a few bent bristles, and I can&#x27;t straighten them out. Better packaging and it probably would not have happened. I&#x27;ll buy another!</li>
    <li> I have dealt with unmanageable curly/wavey long hair my whole life and this brush has been a huge lifesaver of time..&lt;br /&gt;Energy brushing..pain from tangles I am very impressed. I&#x27;ve tried every conditioner out there and this combined with any conditioner is amazing!!! :) highly recommended for anyone that has to deal with unruly hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best brush I have ever had. It works perfectly on wet and dry hair and even in between wet/dry hair which is awesome. The ONLY complaint I have is that the colors vary, and I got stuck with yellow, ugh. It could be worse I suppose! I would rather be able to choose the color.</li>
    <li> I will never use any other brush again! Although, it takes a few strokes to get stubborn knots out, this brush keeps from pulling your hair out of the hair shaft. I have very long hair and it gets tangled very easily in the shower. This brush makes brushing 10 times better than a regular hair brush. Sometimes, my hair gets very very tangled at the nape of my neck, this is when it takes me a few strokes to get rid of the tangles. I often have to go in with another brush to get stubborn tangles out. However, when my hair is wet, I ALWAYS use this wet brush! I got the blue one and its really cute.</li>
    <li> Love this brush and purchased another as a gift.  Easily goes through hair without pulling.  Easy to clean and a joy to use.</li>
    <li> I Love the Wet Brush. My daughter gets upset every time I brush her hair. My Mom bought this for her and it&#x27;s pure heaven. No more fighting and crying. She said to me, \\&quot;Mom can we use this Brush every day\\&quot;. LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> Need I say more?  This brush for the price helped her immensenly when combing her long hair.  I am no longer John, but hero of the Seven Kingdoms.</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews and gave this brush a shot. I never thought this simple brush did a huge impact on my hair. It detangle especially even after a shower(even though u should not brush after a shower) but this I never really had ANY problems with it brushing my hair afterwards. It help my hair be more straighter, calm, less breakage really on my ends, brings my natural oil from brush from bottom to top of the scalp. What really helps last this brush and healthy for my hair is every time I shower( twice a week) I clean my hair brush and use it like I first bought it. It HELP BIG TIME! My new oils on my scalp gets a chance to be brush down to the rest of my hair. It never fails for when ask about my hair of how its soooooo shiny, long, healthy, and ask who did my hair and how my family, coworkers, and my friends saw a huge difference that the simple brush did for my hair. My split ends I suffer and don&#x27;t ever like sacrificing my length of hair has minimize to no show of split ends!!! This brush works wonders for my hair. I had a hard time trying to get rid of my split ends. So what I did is take care of my scalp, eat healthy Green for Life (victoria boutenko method), get enough sleep, eat more greens, keep myself hydrated, switch my shampoo and conditioner back and forth( once my hair starts to get build of it), and change the shower head with a filter shower built in that I bought here on amazon. My goal is to hair long strong hair like a stallion. So far the brush is important to as well cleaning the brush helps every time you shower so your hair has a chance to strengthen and grow. But its also important to other factors to not ignored. I like drinking my greens in smoothies than I do chewing it. I let the blender chop and break the cell walls instead and just drink it down. Kale is my favorite to through it in with mango and bananas. I&#x27;ll prefer to eat starchy veggies like my brocoli raw instead cook over 118 degrees. Best way to eat close to nature. But anyways doyour research first. I love this brush of how it helped reaching my goal for my hair. So Simple yet Brilliantly Made. Don&#x27;t be dogmatic that this will resolve all hair problems. Take care of your body by eating healthy in high nutrient none refined and unprocessed food and keep listen to what your body wants and with in combination with the brush in return you will get healthy hair 8)! Do good for your body, and remember its NOT a over night thing. Time and patience and stay as much you can be in resilience with yourself and well being. Step by step, don&#x27;t ever give in to giving up. Record your results and take pics of your hair. Be realistic in your decisions by making small in investing little but not too much to gamble of riskiness until you know well of the field of your investment. Be  sensitive to your health if you want to achieve in richness in health. Failure is not a option. What could you do if you could not fail? \\&quot;Advice is one thing that is freely given away, but watch what you take only what is worth having.\\&quot;-Book Quote from the Richest Man In Babylon-</li>
    <li> This brush is magical.  I didn&#x27;t believe it would work as well as the reviews said it would, but believe every word.</li>
    <li> Okay..my daughter has curly blonde hair that she claims hurts more to comb than the rest of ours (she is 8 and has added some drama) but this brush is without question unbelievable.  No more fights to comb her hair, no more cutting chunks out that she didn&#x27;t comb.  Glides through her hair without any problem and really gets the tangles out.  This brush is it...miracle brush in my home.  I ordered a spare just in case.</li>
    <li> This brush resolve all of our issues with my daughter. she has a afro hair which is very difficult to manage when it time to do a shampo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks God</li>
    <li> My granddaughters loved the brush.  Normally there is much drama with brushing hair but this brush made it so easy. I actually ordered more.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, but doesn&#x27;t work on my thick curly hair.  I can imagine that if you have straight hair that this would be a better brush.  The dogs just love the feel as I brush them after their bath.  It is a fantastic dog brush and that is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This brush works great for my toddler&#x27;s curly hair.  Easily works through tangles - wet or dry - and doesn&#x27;t hurt her head.  I recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after seeing it suggested by a youtube natural hair vlogger. Firstly, I wish I could have chosen the color of the brush when I purchased this product. I was lucky and received a pretty purple color and think that it&#x27;s generally a pretty attractive product. I would have liked any color other than the black because when using a brush, I like to be able to see the amount of hair left in the brush after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this brush in two contexts and really did not like it much in either context. While I was transitioning from relaxed to natural hair, I used this brush to see if it would make detangling faster/easier. While it took less time than going through with a shower comb, I found that I experienced lots of breakage on my relaxed ends. My curls mostly stayed in tact but I wanted to hold onto my relaxed ends as long as possible so that I could extend the length of my transition. After 7 months of transitioning, it was time for me to finally \\&quot;big chop.\\&quot; I loved my new cut and decided that this was a good opportunity to try the wet brush again.  For context, I have mostly 4c hair. After trying it on one section of my hair, I knew it was time to give up on this brush for good. Though it detangled, I kept hearing that dreaded snapping sound of breakage. Using this brush caused less breakage than when I was transitioning but I can ensure even less breakage by sticking to my good old wide tooth comb and fingers. While this brush might work for other hair types, I would not suggest it for people with my hair type. For those who it does work for, I am totally jealous! :-) I&#x27;ll have to keep searching for a product that will make detangling more efficient.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered a hairbrush from you. My hair is long and curls. I did not think it was really possible to get the knots out but it works. On not sure how it works but I love it no more cutting. Thank you Victoria</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading the positive reviews, but when I received it, I thought it would have to be returned.  First, it was lightweight, soft, flexible, with very fine &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34;.  My hair is long, thick, prone to tangling every single day, and I felt like I was ripping my hair out trying to brush through it - wet or dry.  I&#x27;ve never had the luxury of NOT dealing with painful tangles.  Until now!  I could not believe it, I truly could not.  This brush made it through my hair, tangles and all, wet and dry, and wasn&#x27;t like any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love it.  I had no idea that a brush like this existed and will never hesitate to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret, is that I did not find this product sooner, and that I didn&#x27;t buy several at once!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair.  It really likes to tangle.  I ordered this brush on a whim and when I got it, I was like oh no, this could not possibly work.  It appears flimsy compared to what I&#x27;m, used to, but it does actually get the job done easily.  I&#x27;m not altogether sure what about the design works, but it&#x27;s the best detangling brush I have ever used.  I&#x27;m planning to order a couple more just for back-up.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is beautifully thick and heavy, which is nice to look at but often times impossible to brush through in the morning. She took the brush from the package and brushed her hair out; it went through her hair smoothly and beautifully, with very few snags and even more importantly, NO TEARS!!! We haven&#x27;t tried it on wet hair yet, but from what I witnessed, this light, little inexpensive brush does what no amount of professional and over the counter detanglers or conditioners could do. This brush was great! 4 stars because 2 of the lower bristles were bent back (facing the handle); even so, we&#x27;ll be ordering more of these brushes.</li>
    <li> I read a million reviews on this brush that all touted its awesome nature at detangling. I found it to be, well, ok. It&#x27;s nothing magical, but it does a good job. The brush is very light weight, and it almost feels cheap, until you use it a ton and it stands up well.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;tender headed&amp;#34; granddaughter always hated brushing her hair without pain.  That is no longer a problem with her new Wet Brush.  She uses it both Dry or Wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also bought one for myself and it is now the only brush I use.  My hair is thinning from age and I want to preserve my hair as long as possible.  I lose very little hair when using my brush. Thank you for offering such a great product.</li>
    <li> The product is great totally works great. One thing I was disappointed about was that I ordered 3 of them and got 3  of the exact same colors for all of them, would have been nice to get different colors. I bought them for me and my girls.</li>
    <li> I love this brush, and was very surprised to find that it really does work as good as it says it does!! I was a little skeptical at first, but because of all the positive reviews I gave it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, thick, wavy/curly hair, and any other brush, comb, etc. was always a fight to brush my hair wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;It normally takes me about 10-15 min of hard brushing to get my hair entangled and smooth. So I was willing to try anything really! I kind of always thought it would always be that way but thank goodness not!&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got this brush in bright blue which I love, I showered and gave it a try right after and it went through my hair with no problem at all! I literally said wow, it really does work! So thank you and high five this brush is awesome, and I can assure you I&#x27;ll be back for more!&lt;br /&gt;Super good price for such a good product!! I definitely recommend to anyone, especially those of yoh with longer more difficult hair to deal with! There is no needed detangler spray or anything! :)</li>
    <li> I bought two because my daughters wanted their own. Soft, gentle, and really works!</li>
    <li> This brush has made bath/shower time a dream!  No more crying from my daughter when I brush her hair out!</li>
    <li> The colors are so cuuute! works well on wet and dry hair! very easy to grip!</li>
    <li> bought it for my wife as a Christmas gift- she likes it very much- she says it leaves her hair untangled and very smooth- so I think she would recommend it for anyone with longer hair who needs an affordable brush</li>
    <li> I have mid length normal hair and even if my hair is wet or dry or messy it glides through like NOTHING I&#x27;ve ever used before. I find myself brushing just for the massage to the scalp now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but I needed a brush because I keep losing mine but I&#x27;ll be damned if I lose this one.</li>
    <li> My four year old daughter has very long hair. Not only does her hair get tangled very easily, she also twirls her hair constantly which makes it even more tangled. I tried expensive conditioners and every type of detangler spay I could find, but nothing worked. She screamed and cried every time I brushed her hair. I was ready to cut all her hair off, I couldn&#x27;t put her through the pain of brushing her hair out any longer. My sister-in-law told me about \\&quot;The Wet Brush\\&quot; and I was very sceptical, but desperate. I decided to order one. I could not believe it the first time I tried it. There was no more crying, and the tangles magicaly came out with little effort. It was the answer to our problem. And it&#x27;s very reasonably priced considering it saved me from buying product that didn&#x27;t even help. It truly saved my daughter&#x27;s hair!!</li>
    <li> For years, I have dreaded washing my hair because its so hard to get a comb through it that it can take forever to comb my hair.  This brush is the best thing I have ever used!  It combs through my wet hair like butter.  It&#x27;s unbelievable!  I have bought one for all my friends who have thick hard to manage hair.  And the price is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like to brush my hair out while it&#x27;s still wet and I have tangles. When my hair is really wet this doesn&#x27;t work any better than a regular brush. Not only does it rip at my hair, it doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out at all. At least my regular brush smooths out my hair. I think this may be because I have a lot of hair, so maybe it would work better for people with thinner hair. This brush does tend to do a little better when my hair has dried somewhat and is only slightly damp.</li>
    <li> My hair reaches my bra line and while each individual strand of hair is fine, I have a lot of strands per square inch, so I don&#x27;t know if this counts as &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair or not. But the strands spend all night rubbing themselves carefully around one another so that each morning I awaken to a macrame plant hanger at the base of my skull, under the top layer of hair. It takes me 3 minutes to shower and 15-30 minutes to comb out the tangles with my wide-toothed &amp;#34;for curly hair&amp;#34; comb, depending on whether I&#x27;ve procrastinated a day or two or have diligently addressed the knots morning and night. I have used kids&#x27; detangling spray which helps about 10% but smells like Happy Sparkly Pear or Wild Strawberry or some other flavor I&#x27;d rather not smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush reduced the detangling time down to seconds. I let my conditioner (Pureology Hydrate) sit on my hair for about a minute and then I started brushing at the ends, working through handfuls of hair at a time. The tangles just ... came out. It&#x27;s like they weren&#x27;t even there. I would feel a little bit of resistance and then it would melt away. No ripping, no yanking, no breakage, and no swearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented and tried the brush on dry hair. It detangled well but left the hair in that kind of frizzy, &amp;#34;brushed&amp;#34; state from the &#x27;80s instead of as a mane of separate curls. Using the brush on wet hair with conditioner, then toweling once and letting the hair air-dry, resulted in defined curls without frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am too lazy to use hair product so I am extra happy with this brush because I can continue my wash-every-other-day-and-let-it-dry-on-its-own lifestyle -- now, without getting dreadlocks or rat nests underneath.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the rec of a hairstylist friend but it&#x27;s much smaller than my paddle brush. I have a detangling comb I&#x27;ve used for years and this works just as well. For the price it&#x27;s worth it if you need detangling but in my opinion, it&#x27;s just an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; brush, nothing really spectacular or different about it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It just works so good! It doesn&#x27;t pull or tug my hair when I&#x27;m brushing...and I have long tangled hair. My niece loves it too because her hair is always so tangled, nappy and she hates brushing her hair...well not anymore! She loves this brush as much as I do. I don&#x27;t even bother using my old brush anymore..this Brush is the BOMB!</li>
    <li> Love love love love this brush. My girls don&#x27;t fuss at me anymore when I brush through their wet hair.</li>
    <li> These brushes are especially great for kids, getting thru the tangles.  It is not really for dry, but will work.</li>
    <li> LOVE this!!!  Use it every day!!!</li>
    <li> not good for thick hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing little girls knots for over 16 years now. Where has this brush been??? There&#x27;s nothing fancy about it, it just works and I don&#x27;t know why. Lots of fast strokes seems to do the trick for even the worst of knots.</li>
    <li> Just as other reviewers described. If u have thick and/or curly hair it will take a while to brush through the knots since it&#x27;s so soft to the touch. If you have time to brush your hair out it&#x27;s a great product but I recommend you keep your regular sturdy hair brush for those days where you are running out of time or really need to control your hair.</li>
    <li> I basically have horse hair. It&#x27;s really thick and a LOT of it. While this doesn&#x27;t get through all layers of my hair in one swipe, it does glide through like butter. This makes it worth its weight in GOLD to me because I&#x27;m super-sensitive headed.  Bought one for my daughter, too! We like this much better than the Tangle Teezer (which pretty much did just that... teased our tangles. The bristles are so short, there was no effective brushing whatsoever. Just skimming of my hair.) Get one of these Wet Brushes! I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever...thick hair, Curly hair, thin hair all hair...I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Upon recommendation by a stylist, I bought this for my daughter who has super curly and easily snarled hair. It works much better than her old brush and doesn&#x27;t cause her as much pain. I still have to use detangeler but overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I watched a YouTube video on this brush and it was exactly as it said!  I love being able to brush my hair when it&#x27;s wet, I actually keep it in the shower and brush the conditioner in my hair.  I haven&#x27;t been this happy about a hair tool probably ever!  Recommend!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after it was recommended to me by my hairstylist. I have fine hair that knots easily. Other combs/brushes were breaking my hair from too much pulling trying to get the knots out. My split ends have reduced and getting knots out is now pain-free.</li>
    <li> My oldest son just washes his longish hair, brushes it out and lets it dry. I got him this brush hoping it would be gentle enough for tangled, fine (but thick and longish) hair. It works well for detangling without repeated strokes and doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing breakage.</li>
    <li> As a busy woman with long hair, I have always found the morning task of brushing my wet hair out before drying it very annoying.  They say that brushing it with a regular brush can damage it, but I don&#x27;t have time to go over it with one of those special detangling combs, which takes FOREVER and still hurts almost as much as the brush.  I used to brush it with a regular brush, which was painful and only seemed to tangle certain areas of my hair more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this brush on Amazon and decided to ask for it for Christmas.  The price was reasonable and I figured it was worth a try.  When I received it as a gift I tried it in the shower and it worked like a charm!  I could not BELIEVE how quick and easy it was to brush out my usually unruly long, thick hair.  The best part of this brush is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!!  I don&#x27;t understand how this brush works, but it is amazing.  I am going to buy several more, just in case they come to their senses and start charging twice as much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that this brush would be great for anyone with long and/or thick hair and anyone with a tender headed child.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long hair and after shower, this brush works great!  No more screaming trying to get through her wet hair!  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still amazed at how well this product work. I thought I was going to be disappointed, because it looked like any other brush. But I&#x27;m definitely very happy.</li>
    <li> he&#x27;s got tight ringlets (not afro, but a caucasian equivalent!) and hair washing is always bad. this makes it easier. i shampoo, then get a glob of conditioner worked through and comb it out. this is the best i&#x27;ve found for gently untangling.</li>
    <li> This brush has worked wonders since I have started using it. My hair has grown an additional 2 inches in 2 months since using this gentle brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter used to cry from frustration while she was brushing her wavy hair, but now she is able to do it easily, and it looks shiny and smooth.  Nopooing also works (avoiding shampoo and washing with conditioner - don&#x27;t knock it until you try it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have since given these brushes to her friends and all have rave reviews.  It is life changing!</li>
    <li> I do.  I love my luscious locks.  You wanna know how I take care of such a beautiful yet manly head of hair?  With this brush.  That&#x27;s right.  I said manly.  Because even though I use a bright neon colored brush, I am still a man.  With a manly beard nonetheless.  But enough about me; let&#x27;s talk about the brush.  I&#x27;m Mexican so I can say this.  I have Mexican hair.  Sometimes my hair stands in front of the home depot looking for work...but not for very long because it&#x27;s beautiful, and beautiful things always get picked up and aren&#x27;t out of work very long.  Thanks to this brush.  No tangles, no ouchies, just long gorgeous hair.  Get some.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;No more hurt, Mommy.&amp;#34;  This is a great product for those with curly-kiddos and even those with fine, soft hair.  This brush is amazing and I haven&#x27;t heard an eek out of my child since using it.</li>
    <li> After using a crappy, cheap, very stiff bristled hairbrush for years (&amp;#34;I&#x27;m a MAN, I don&#x27;t need no frilly frou-frou wimmenfolk hair brush, gol&#x27; durnit!&amp;#34;), and it was always an hour-long affair to get my hair brushed out. It would always tangle immediately afterward. Girls would run their fingers through my long wavy locks and get stuck. It was rather embarassing. It gets to the point that if I spend a day in bed sick I get huge incredibly embarassing mats in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled this out of the package and ran it through, and it worked its magic. It looks like a normal brush that&#x27;s in every girl&#x27;s armory, but there&#x27;s some magical secret sauce to this one. It might be the super soft bristles, it&#x27;s hard to tell for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that its an ergonomic nightmare since the handle is just a flat plank, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter since my mid-back length hair is now brushed perfectly in just a couple minutes.</li>
    <li> I recommend it. I have long fine hair and I use this right out of the shower, after a quick towel dry of my hair. Good price. This brush  takes the place of my comb for detangling my hair in three to four strokes, vs small strokes with a large comb.</li>
    <li> We ordered this brush after reading the reviews, and it totally works!  My six year old daughter has long hair which gets tangled quickly, and she HATES having her hair brushed.  We received the brush today, tried it out right away and she reports that it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  She did a side-by-side test brushing her hair with her regular brush on one side and this brush on the other, and she could see and feel the difference.  We don&#x27;t know how this works, but we love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> The brush has been wonderful to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It used to be difficult to brush her hair but this makes the whole process easier.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble untangling my long hair after shampooing without tearing out or splitting my hair.  This is gentle and does the job - just takes a few minutes.</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes.  Bought them for my grand daughters who don&#x27;t ever want to comb their hair.  They really work.  The kids love them.  Now my grown daughters want them and my grand daughters&#x27; cousin and her mother.  I was pleasantly surprised by the results!</li>
    <li> Got this brush because both my 2 year old&#x27;s hair and my hair were getting long enough to need a brush that could de-tangle. The brush works great for both of us. And my daughter likes the bright color (yellow in her case, and blue in mine). You don&#x27;t get to pick the color, but that didn&#x27;t matter to us, and nice that we got two so I could let my daughter pick. Now I can brush my hair in 1/3rd the time and with barely any pain. And my daughter likes having her hair brushed as well.</li>
    <li> everyone should have one of these...it really works.  i got purple...nice durable brush.</li>
    <li> I was desparate for SOMETHING to help detangle my hair.  My cheap detangler wasn&#x27;t doing it... I thought the answer was a good conditioner, but I found this instead.  I have long, fine hair that is very tangled after a shower.  This works every. single. time.  Just buy it.</li>
    <li> Like most people who would shop for a product like this, I was looking for something to make the hair brushing task a little easier on my kids.  The first couple of times it was used, they said it was better.  After a few uses though, the complaints started back up again.  Don&#x27;t think it is the brushes fault as it looks the same, nothing has broken off or anything, it could just be that my kids were expecting it to be easier the first couple of times so maybe they tricked themselves into thinking it was better.  At any rate, its a decent quality brush for the price, I would recommend giving it a shot, it just hasn&#x27;t worked the miracles I was hoping for in my case.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. Gets tangles out nicely. I have a mini I keep in my purse. They both are great</li>
    <li> My daughter has a tender scalp and tangly hair.  She loves this brush.  We have tried so many &#x27;ouchless&#x27; brushes over the years, and this is the first one that is truly ouchless.  She loves brushing her hair now.  It is also very light weight so she can carry it in her backpack without being concerned about extra weight.</li>
    <li> The wet brush is fantastic! My daughter used to yell and scream when having her hair combed out after a shower until I found this brush. It glides through wet hair very easily and makes brushing tangled morning hair a breeze as well.  It&#x27;s the only brush my daughter will use.  Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife to use on our three year old granddaughter.  Works great, no more crying after her evening bath.  It&#x27;s amazing how it combs right thru the tangled hair.  Would highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> My 3 yr old daughter has beautiful naturally curly hair, but is so tenderheaded.  I used to have to hold her down to try and get tangles out and it was just awful.  I had thought I was going to have to cut off all her beautiful curls until we tried this brush.  I had bought so many different types of brushes and every detangling solution out there.  Finally something works.  It does work better wet but you can use it dry too.  Not sure how this works but it does. Just start at the bottom of the hair first and gently brush and it will just slowly work the tangles out painlessly!!!!</li>
    <li> got the recommendation from my sister. We both have thin thin hair, so it tangles easy. Mine is longer than hers but I still love it. Take a little effort still but the bristles are flexible and it works all the knots out eventually.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been thick, long and straight. As I have gotten toward my late twenties I have begun to loose a lot of hair every time I brush or wash it!!! The wet brush is gentle and since I have started using it I have less hair loss AND less split ends and fly-aways. My boyfriend brushed his hair out in the shower with it also and loves it. After about 8 months of using this brush I have found my favorite brush and hope it is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought it I loves it but the last two I bought pull my hair somewhat</li>
    <li> I bought this brush being very skeptical about it being as good as it seemed to be. I have thick, very long hair that tangles so easily. I used to have screaming and crying matches with my mom when trying to brush my hair as a kid - now that I&#x27;m 25, I just have screaming and crying matches with myself while trying to brush my hair. While this brush looks nearly identical to my Conair hair brush - it is SO. MUCH. BETTER. It went through my hair like a hot knife through butter, and it was pretty painless too! I have yet to try it wet, but I can only imagine it will impress me then, too. I highly recommend to anybody looking for a great detangling brush. And mothers - buy this for your daughters - you will both enjoy it!</li>
    <li> I do like this brush. It is especially nice for brushing wet hair but works equally well on dry hair. My only issue is it takes a long time to brush your hair. For me, probably 3-4 times longer than with a regular brush.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the brush. she has thick curly long hair uses the brush everyday. no complaints from her yet. overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Worked like a charm on both wet AND dry hair with ease!  And I have thick, Hawaiian hair!  I will purchase more for gifts to family and friends!  Happy Camper!  :)</li>
    <li> All the bristles slowly fell out of my 20 year old brush that gently detangles my hair. I have bought 5 brushes, over that time period, in hopes they could replace this old deteriorating brush. None could do it. I was down to less than half the bristles and a ripping pad when I found this brush. Gave it a try and it works BETTER than the one I held onto for so long. Now my long hair is safe and will quit breaking off. I love it.</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. My husband and my cats love it too. It feels awesome!</li>
    <li> It works really well for my grand daughter&#x27;s long hair. Not nearly as many tears~!</li>
    <li> I cannot stress the magnificence of this wonder brush more. I have fine but thick long hair that gets tangled easily and this brush does not pull. I don&#x27;t feel like I break my hair every time I brush it anymore. I will never buy another hair brush again.</li>
    <li> I got this brush as a Christmas present from my mother and I cannot explain how incredible it is! I have insanely thick, curly hair and I&#x27;ve always had a terrible time brushing it out. Wet, dry (never, ever, ever), didn&#x27;t matter there was pulling and ripping and tearing. I had low expectations for this brush, but tried it anyway and was honestly amazed. Every time I use it I find myself expecting the old tangling, but it never happens. My shower time has been cut it half, my scalp has been saved and the knots are removed. I even used it while my hair was dry just to see how it worked; it was still pain free. I can&#x27;t get over this brush and can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough! If you have hair that tangles easily you have to at least give this thing a try.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this worked any better than any other brush. The small balls on the ends of the bristles started coming off almost immediately and we ended up throwing the brush away after 2 months when they were all gone. I can&#x27;t think of any brush I have had to throw away that quickly!</li>
    <li> I always had a difficult time getting my daughter to brush her hair.  After years of reminding her to please brush, things are looking better now.  This is now the go to brush and rarely I need to remind/beg her to brush.  This looks like any other brush but works so much better.</li>
    <li> kids love them.  no more pulling their hair.</li>
    <li> Best brush I ever owned. Love this brush! I use it everyday. It&#x27;s been wonderful on my hair.</li>
    <li> My new favourite brush! I have a very sensitive scalp and this brush never hurts me!</li>
    <li> Good brush. Good even for wet hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING. I first used it when I was traveling with a friend and had forgotten my own. I DREAD brushing my wet hair because of tangles and she told me that this brush would be a different experience. I was doubtful, but she was right. It really does make brushing my wet hair far less painful. After borrowing hers, I ordered one for myself right away. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I first heard about the wet brush at my upscale hair salon. My stylist recommended it to me, so I instantly bought one on Amazon. It is way cheaper than buying in a salon. The brush works so good! I can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t heard of it before. It makes brushing my hair so much easier and a lot less pulling is required. I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends this is a must have for any girl with long hair!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  I never write reviews but we&#x27;ve struggled with her hair brushing every morning and night since she was 3 because her hair is thick and knots easily.  This brush is the only one I can use now and she is actually smiling while I brush her hair.  AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this brush works!!! I wish my Dad had this brush when I was little :o/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d always grow my hair long and then get tired of endless brushing and pulling my hair out..So I &#x27;d always end up cutting my hair and regreting for the next 2 years ! Now I have long hair that I can enjoy without the pain of brushing. I am ordering more !</li>
    <li> This brush really gets through tangly 7 year old girl hair with NO crying.  I am blown away.  She is now sitting happily brushing her hair and I was so close to dragging her to get her head shaved. (not really!)  I bought 3 to have around. LOVE them.</li>
    <li> Brushes right through wet hair with no pulling</li>
    <li> Good brush that doesn&#x27;t pull hair. Brush is not good for blow dryer use. Bristles will melt with minimal heat application.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this brush to anyone with long hair, or kids! gets out the tangles without the pulling, and the bristles are gentle on the scalp.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended, and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered one.  I have long, thin, fine hair that tangles into mats.  If I use this brush in the shower with conditioner in my hair, the brush glides right through and saves me so much time in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I think they might as well call it the perfect brush. It will change the daily struggle with you&#x27;re or your kids curly or tangly hair for good! I simply Love it. I&#x27;ll give it 10 stars if i could.</li>
    <li> This is our new favorite brush.  It seems like a regular brush but it really is easy to use on my four year-old&#x27;s hair.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Great way to distribute conditioner through thick, curly hair. The bristles don&#x27;t go all the way through all parts of the hair, but somehow it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it on my and my daughter&#x27;s wet hair, not dry. We really like it.</li>
    <li> Was a gift for my daughter and she is very pleased with the brush set</li>
    <li> It really works don&#x27;t know how but thanks for saving me twenty minutes detangling!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a girl with very curly hair who was a nightmare to brush through everyday. The difference between this brush and others we have owned is immeasurable. No pulling or snagging and helps cut the time of the job in half. Love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this brush!  She has had it for about a year and says it still works great !  We advise you to get this!!  Recently bought several more.</li>
    <li> Ok, it&#x27;s a hair brush, but I am still excited about it.  It gets down deep and gets to scalp, and the fact that I can use it on my hair wet or dry is a plus! It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out either.</li>
    <li> This brush works really well, but I&#x27;m afraid I got a cheap knockoff. The packaging looked &#x27;off&#x27; (it was cheap plastic stapled to a piece of faded cardboard). And the SMELL! It was terrible! When I brought the package into my house, I immediately thought something was on fire because it smelled like campfire smoke. When I finally opened the box, I was hit in the face with a very strong chemical burning smell. No amount of soap and soaking will get rid of this terrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great so I just breathe through my mouth when I use it...but really, I was hoping for a great brush that didn&#x27;t smell like it got roasted in a vat of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Changed the score from 3 to 5 stars--the smell has started to dissipate, although it took quite awhile. I&#x27;m also not sure that I received an authentic version since the packaging was so faded and it looks different from the one at the store. Still, it works great so I can&#x27;t complain about the quality of the brush! I also appreciate the quick response from the WetBrush rep regarding my review.</li>
    <li> My hair gets severely tangled and this brush did not perform miracles.  However, I think I lose/rip less hair with this brush than with a regular brush.  It takes longer to get through it all though.  So there&#x27;s a trade-off:  longer to get rid of all the tangles, but less hair damage.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I&#x27;m glad I did research before I purchased it. It doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair and it takes out the knots really well. I love it! Only regret is not getting a fun colored one...</li>
    <li> I would prefer to call it a \\&quot;magic brush\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a great product. It does not pull hair like a ordinary brush would do, I don&#x27;t even need to use any serum or detangling lotion. I highly recommend it. Go for it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to detangle and blow dry my daughter&#x27;s coarse hair.  I checked the reviews before I purchased and they were not accurate.  This brush is too flimsy for coarse hair and does not work as a good detangler.  I&#x27;m sure it works for someone, but I don&#x27;t recommend.  It was a total waste of my money!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, wavy hair that also happens to be fine and breaks often. Because of this, I always find myself rushing in the morning to complete a decent hairstyle.  I wear my hair wet almost everyday.  This brush has been a lifesaver!  It brushes my hair quickly and removes the knots I would struggle with a normal brush.  The bristles bend and make brushing wet hair much easier.  The only downside is the material this brush is made of feels a bit cheap.  I know I will have to replace it with a few months of regular use, but it is well worth the low price.  If you have thick, wavy, curly, or even fine hair that you struggle brushing when its wet this hairbrush is definitely for you!</li>
    <li> Amazing for brushing and getting tangles out of wet hair. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well on dry - but it is called the Wet Brush and is amazing with wet or damp hair</li>
    <li> We keep one in the bathroom, one in the swim bag, one at Grandma&#x27;s .... you get the point. The girls will not let us use anything else on their hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a 4 year old that has long hair and hates to brush it because &amp;#34;it hurts&amp;#34;. She uses this brush when her hair is wet and it is much more gentle than a regular brush. Also works great if hair is dry and a de-tangler is sprayed on first.</li>
    <li> Love..love..love!!! I can&#x27;t believe I did not know about this sooner. This is the best brush!!! Highly recommend. Will never buy another brand again!</li>
    <li> I bought one for my niece, my sister and for myself. What a great brush! My favorite so far. Good packaging and it arrived quickly and safely. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I will never be using another brush again. This doesn&#x27;t pull out half as much hair, but hair still does get caught. Its good in wet hair, but I don&#x27;t like to brush my wet hair, it is great in dry hair.  Update: I just got a 2nd brush, and the design is a little lighter and a little classier. But still fantastic on my hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush! A friend introduced it to me and I haven&#x27;t had it long but it is so soft on the head and I don&#x27;t shed as much anymore!</li>
    <li> This brush works miracles.  My daughter gets dreadlock style knots every day. With detangling cream and this brush- no tears.</li>
    <li> Really detangles and is very durable.  Saw that other brushes didn&#x27;t last so I bought this one and it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
    <li> Good brush, it really does detangle my cccurly hair easily, I have fine curly hair</li>
    <li> I have no problems now brushing through my wet, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I own one of these brushes and bought one for my daughter too.  We both have very thick hair that is always being broken by other hairbrushes.  This brush glides through our hair without tangling or breaking our hair.  Great Product!</li>
    <li> It is ok, gentle and detangles hair like..... any other brush that I have been using.&lt;br /&gt;Again, it is ok, but I do not get why it is ranked so high.</li>
    <li> Basically, this brush changed my life. I no longer have to take a long time to brush my hair after a shower and fight tangles. This brush glides through with ease.</li>
    <li> I saw a few reviews on youtube and decided to try it. I have tried so many brushes over the years and this one is just amazing! I have long and curly hair. This brush along with coconut oil have improved my hair dramatically.</li>
    <li> It worked great on detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair with minimal pain for a few months, and then it started catching and hurting. I am not willing to pay for a new brush every few months, and will be looking for alternatives.  It is possible with all the sellers here that counterfeits are sneaking through- buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading other&#x27;s reviews and I am so pleased with this product. My daughter has very knotty hair and this really does do a great job of detangling.  It does take longer to brush her hair with it however it does not yank on her scalp like other brushes- she loves it!! A great product!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with the wet brush - I tell people about it all the time.  If you have hair that tangles easily, if the thought of washing your hair &amp; not using conditioner gives you nightmares or if you have to brush your hair BEFORE you wash it just so it is as easy to comb through as possible....you NEED the wet brush.  I honestly think if my house were burning down &amp; I could only grab a handful of items, this brush would probably be one of them.  No lie.</li>
    <li> The brush had such a strong odor that we cannot use it.  I cannot tell if its a bad plastic smell or a smoke smell. I have tried soaking it, etc.  This is the 3rd wet brush I have ordered and the only one that has smelled so badly that I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all and I have a very very sensitive head, however hair has to be wet to work. Also, I think it does cause some breakage to hair bc you don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s ripping your hair.</li>
    <li> This brush works well. I have 2 daughters with curly hair: 1 being very thick and the other thin but very easily tangled and this works well on both of them. I use it on wet and dry hair.I have read a lot of reviews where people are saying that this brush brushes over the hair and not through it. I can see that being true IF you&#x27;re just running the brush over your entire mass of tangled hair. I know when I&#x27;m brushing their hair, I section it off into smaller sections (no matter what brush I&#x27;m using). I&#x27;m going to buy one for myself as well, not because my hair is hard to brush through, but just because it seems to be less damaging. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> The best brush I have owned!!! So nice, very efficient , and never hurts or pull the hair especially after shower!</li>
    <li> With this brush I can brush my hair right out of the shower without using detangler or leave-in conditioner. I have very thick, long hair and although it is always difficult to get out some tangles, this brush really helps. I use it everyday and it has lasted a long time. Only a few bristles bent from being shoved in a drawer (on accident) but other than that it still works great and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Buy this brush.  It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, fine hair, and I normally have to brush very carefully.  Starting at the ends, slowly (and painfully) working my way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But with this brush, I can literally brush from top to bottom in a few minutes, without going inch by inch starting at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if it is actually &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; for your hair, but it feels great!</li>
    <li> I expected this to be a magical solution to tangles and it isn&#x27;t - you still have to fight through tangles. However, it is much better than a regular brush. I have very long and easily tangled hair and always brush it wet and this has cut my time in half to brush my hair as well as pulling out less hair. I like feeling I&#x27;m not hurting my hair with the wet-brushing.</li>
    <li> I have bought this brush for my daughter and my 2 nieces.  All of them hated brushing their hair because they said the brushes hurt.  I have bought more expensive brushes but this has worked much better at a great price.  My daughter has straight hair and my nieces curly and it has worked well with both types of hair.</li>
    <li> My grandaughter was so excited to receive this brush as was her Mom.  We ordered two for her, so that she could always have one at each of her homes.  She has very long hair and has to take care of it herself if she wants to keep it that long.  She is eight years old and uses this brush every day!</li>
    <li> My heading pretty much says it.  I like bristles which are firm enough to feel good on the scalp.  These are flimsy.  It may be a decent hair detangler, but I wouldn&#x27;t know as I have short hair.  Also, and most importantly, even if the brush does what you personally want it to, it literally reeks of the chemical material of which it is made....so much so, in fact, your hand will reek just from handling it for a few seconds.  So if you don&#x27;t mind being poisoned, or having to scrub your hands after brushing your hair, this brush might be for you  :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this brush is legit! I have very long hair, I could not brush it when it was wet... No more! No pulling, no pain, and actually brushes/detangles my hair! Works amazing! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughter hates to comb out her hair, so, though she&#x27;s plenty old enough at 10 to comb it out on her own, I often ended up doing it after she got out of the shower.  This brush has been wonderful!  She can brush out her hair (on her own!) while it&#x27;s wet and it takes the knots out, yet it is gentle on her hair.  She loves how soft it leaves her hair.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This works really well detangling my girls hair.It is good&lt;br /&gt;in or out of the shower. It is also reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It works great for my teenage son.</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local salon and I loooove it. I have long, dry, thinning hair that gets easily knotted after showering and my heart breaks every time I have to comb through it. With this brush and a lil bit of leave-in conditioner, I can comb thru my hair effortlessly. I&#x27;ve even tried the brush on my wet hair without the use of a leave-in and I still experienced a smooth comb-through. That just doesn&#x27;t happen with my hair! I will never use any other tool from here on out.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush, I have hair as long as rupunzal lol and it get SO tangled so easily, this brush is fantastic for getting out the dreadlocks I get at the nape of my neck!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  I use it on my hair when it&#x27;s dry and it seems to remove a lot of static and frizzies.</li>
    <li> Not detangling as advertised, but it&#x27;s a decent hair brush. I especially like the grip and the color (mine is purple).</li>
    <li> Just a typical brush.  Although this brush may work just fine on perfectly straight hair it DOES NOT work on slightly curly hair weather the hair is dry or wet.  It does work somewhat better on wet hair, the brush is nothing special. Would never recommend this to anyone with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I got this brush hoping it would help with my long tangled mess I have for hair. I was worried because it looks a lot like other regular brushes that never helped me. Well it was nothing like the other brushes I&#x27;ve used! It works and makes brushing my hair out much more enjoyable than before and I lose less hair. Thank goodness for this brush!</li>
    <li> Love this brush, I use it on my wet hair and there are no ripping hair out. It works even better on my daughter&#x27;s hair because she doesn&#x27;t even notice when I brush her wet hair now.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I&#x27;ve bought one for my young nieces with tangled baby hair. It works fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have a daughter who has long, thick, wavy, unruly hair.....down past her elbows.  For the past 7 years (she&#x27;s 8 btw) we&#x27;ve had nightly battles over combing &amp; tangles and crying (on both teams.)  Last weekend, I went to my cousin&#x27;s salon and she cut my daughter&#x27;s hair (just a trim.)  I was complaining about how bad her hair tangles and how much conditioner and detangler we go through...my cousin pulls out this brush, and tells me this wil solve all my problems.  I told her if it works, I&#x27;ll pay $100 for it.&lt;br /&gt;Well she hands it to my daughter (who has NEVER combed her own hair) and my child proceeds to brush her entire head or wet hair.....literally took 5 minutes.  It takes 20-30 at my house.  My jaw dropped!  It was amazing.  The brush went right through her hair with no detangler, no gobs&amp;gobs of conditioner, no leave in NOTHING!&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used it at home now for about a week and I&#x27;m still impressed, as is my husband.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to pay $100 for it (thank goodness) but I probably would have!! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this brush for my 18 month old daughter.  She has very long and also very fine hair.  I had been using the small comb from the hospital with detangling spray to manage her hair until I saw this brush in a parenting magazine. It glides easily through her hair both wet and dry and she never complains like she did with the comb.  It works great and I highly recommend it to other mommies.</li>
    <li> It is a decent hairbrush, I am not quite sure if I buy the whole safe wet hair brushing concept.</li>
    <li> I bought my 4 year old niece this brush because she has long, super fine hair and hates getting her hair brushed -wet or dry.  This is the best brush to get out the tangles.</li>
    <li> Love these brushed!  They work great!  Wet or dry goes smoothly through hair with no tangles!</li>
    <li> I gave this 4 stars because the smell was horrible and noticeable when your brush your hair. The smell doesn&#x27;t actually stay in your hair though but it somewhat bothered me. However, that being said this is still a great brush!!!I would still recommend this brush to other people.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually take time to write reviews, but this product is amazing. I have three little girls and long thick hair myself. It just combs right through the knots. We use it on wet hair or just wet the brush for great results.</li>
    <li> It usually took me like 5 min. to brush my hair out after getting out of the shower. With the Wet Brush, my hair is combed through in 30 seconds or less.  I bought it at a salon for $15 so this is quite a steal. I reccommend this for every woman with any style of hair. It works wonders!</li>
    <li> This brush really works! I was advised by serveral moms to get this brush and I was kinda of the mind that it wouldn&#x27;t make that big of a difference...I was wrong! This makes brushing my 2 year old&#x27;s hair soooo easy! Dry or wet!</li>
    <li> This brush is great for kids with long fine hair. This will eliminate the big fuss about brushing hair. It also works great for anyone. Highly recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> works okay, I have very thick curly coarse hair and it just doesn&#x27;t make its way through all of my hair, doesn&#x27;t hurt which is good&lt;br /&gt;went back to the shower comb</li>
    <li> Great Product, speedy delivery</li>
    <li> purchased the wet brush rubberized wet detangle shower brush for both of my daughters; they are happy with them and work well</li>
    <li> Awesome shower brush :) leaves my hair soft without damaging.</li>
    <li> This brush is wonderful. Does a great job of brushing through tangles with out breaking the hair or causing my daughter to scream! I&#x27;m ordering another one!</li>
    <li> Hands down best brush I have ever bought. I wash my hair at nights and comb while I dry. I have long hair that tangles easily and this brush makes it easy to comb through even the toughest of knots without pain at all. A must try brush. I have even recommended it to my friends!</li>
    <li> Kids love it no more crying ...</li>
    <li> wow, this is awesome. Why didn&#x27;t I know about this before. My hair dresser told me about it and I purchased as I was sitting in her chair and she was working on my hair.</li>
    <li> Got it for my granddaughters. Got tired of their screams when brushing their hair. Worked. Screams stopped. Great, thanks.</li>
    <li> This really works great!  Super for children with tangles that don&#x27;t want their hair combed!</li>
    <li> This hairbrush changed my life.  Literally.  I find myself telling curly-haired randoms on the bus about how life-changing this hairbrush is.  Imagine no more tears... trying to untangle the knots that won&#x27;t untangle with a regular brush...  no more hurting your head, or damaging your hair...  no more cutting off random bits of your hair with scissors because you&#x27;ve just discovered a dreadlock... No more of any of that.  Just lovely, curly hair that you run this hairbrush through in the shower, like a knife through hot butter.  Join the cult.  Change your life too.</li>
    <li> I have been warned time and time again not to brush curly hair, but when I&#x27;m in the shower there is no way around it. It&#x27;s been tough finding a comb/brush to get all of the knots out that inevitably happen once the water hits my curls, but this brush glides right through like silk! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone so long without knowing this existed.</li>
    <li> Just okay. Don&#x27;t expect a whole world of difference. Your hair will still stick a little when brushing but it will be a slightly minimum compared to regular brushes with think prongs.</li>
    <li> It works on wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about a month now. I get what people like about it, and I do like it, but it isn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; the hair all that much. It&#x27;s more like it organizes the hair into smaller rows, but the tangles are still in the rows. I use it on my wet hair (which is naturally straight but is tangly right out of the shower), but then I have to use a real brush to get all the tangles out for blow drying. It&#x27;s because the bristles are so soft and bendy, they just go around the tangle. Which is nice in that it doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull your hair, but it doesn&#x27;t actually get the knot out. Hope this is making sense! I recommend it though, for a first round on wet hair.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever! I LOVE this brush, instead of having to freak out over using too much detangler (or trying to find one, do they even sell it anymore?) I just brush my hair and the knot come right out. This is perfect for a girl who has long hair like me.  The price is always great because it&#x27;s under 10 so if it breaks in a year big deal, I just buy a new one!</li>
    <li> My daughter has sensory issues and very thick hair  that she despises to brush so when we took her for her haircut with a head full of knots they used this brush on her with only minimal complaints her hair was knot free in 2 minutes now she loves it which makes her hair care soooooooo much easier</li>
    <li> I got this at the local Bed Bath &amp; Beyond after reading reviews here. I have fine fragile thick  4a/b African American hair &amp; these brushes...I have the paddle version ,too... are fantastic for my hair ! The bristles have just enough give to get thru my hair without ripping it out.  At first I tried the highly recommended Denman brush ,but those things act like shredders &amp; weed whackers on my hair...they rip it out something awful. May as well use a lawnmower with dull blades ! With these brushes I&#x27;m able to detangle &amp; brush my wet hair &amp; distribute oils for hot oil treatments, regular &amp; deep conditioners &amp; other hair products without causing a epic broken hair catastrophe.  Between these brushes, my Tangle Teezer, &amp; my huge Hercules Sagemann rake combs, my hair is in great condition with far fewer split ends &amp; breakage. You&#x27;re crazy if you don&#x27;t get one of these !!</li>
    <li> I have long, long, long hair that gets tangled five seconds after brushing. I&#x27;m so happy to find a brush that&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t rip all my hair out. But I have no misgivings that it&#x27;s actually brushing through ALL the tangles. It&#x27;s more like a superficial detangler for the outer layers of hair. Works in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real complaint is that you can&#x27;t choose the color. I hate the color purple, so naturally that&#x27;s what I got when I ordered. Would&#x27;ve liked the option to choose!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that gets impossibly tangled after I wash it.  I don&#x27;t even need to use a detangler spray or leave in condition with this brush. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> NEVER using another brush again. Brush may not look like much but I dreaded brushing my hair after taking a shower before. I have long straight hair but it&#x27;s pretty thick. No more pulling my hair out. This brush is awesome.</li>
    <li> I had a wet brush from my hair salon for about a year. It was kinda falling apart and I wanted a new one. I received a purple one (kinda odd you can&#x27;t pick the color) and noticed that the bristles are much firmer than my old one. Basically I got a regular hair brush...works well but definitely rougher than my real wet brush. Just a brush.</li>
    <li> I use this brush with slightly damp or dry hair. It&#x27;s extremely gentle and causes far less breakage than than the tangle teaser.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical for sure when I bought this, but I brushed my long hair &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and the result was the same! It untangled my hair like no other brush has, I have no idea why it works the way it does, but it works. I have even tried brushing my nappy morning hair real fast and there is seriously no pain! I put this brush through quite a bit of work and it still does the job.</li>
    <li> Appears to be a generic cheap brush, aside from the labeling. Appearance aside, my young daughter thinks it&#x27;s great. She&#x27;s been battling tangles for years, and now she brushes her hair without us pressing her to do so. Good brush, slightly over-priced.</li>
    <li> Massages scalp! Comes in great colors. But still be careful with wet hair or should use a wide tooth comb .</li>
    <li> I like this brush. It really helps to brush the long hair of my child. No tears anymore. Good product.</li>
    <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and it is a bear to try to comb or brush with a regular item.  I&#x27;m not sure what makes this one so special but my knots and tangle come out super easy with the Wet Brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the bristles tend to get out of whack and I&#x27;ve had to purchase a new one.  No idea why they do.. but it happens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this for my other curly haired friends and they love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out!!</li>
    <li> My kid ALWAYS complained that she would get knots in her hair, all the time.  She hated coming them out, and she hated MY combing them out of HER hair.  Then i bought the Wet Brush.  Knots are NO LONGER  A PROBLEM.  Her hair is &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; now with the new brush.  Now she LOVES brushing her hair out.  She now understands why Princesses in fairy tales had to brush their hair 100 strokes a night.  With her, though it was closer to 1000 strokes a night.  She loved the new brush so much it was never out of her hand, even during dinner.  We had a pet bird a few years ago, who &amp;#34;preened.&amp;#34; Birds do this to maintain their feathers.  I started thinking that the kid was &amp;#34;preening&amp;#34; with her glorious, new brush every single chance she got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we set &amp;#34;preening limits.&amp;#34;  She may preen after she showers, when she gets up in the morning, and when she comes home from school.  Preening is NOT ALLOWED between forkfulls of dinner!</li>
    <li> It does detangle wet hair, but if your hair is long, thick and curly like mine, it takes quite a while to brush through all the tangles. Some tangles are too stubborn for this brush, and oftentimes I lose patience and end up just brushing my hair with a regular brush (when wet). This is a great brush for thinner hair that does not tangle easily. Great concept though; just didn&#x27;t work wonders for me...</li>
    <li> Changed our lives - No more tears!! :-)</li>
    <li> Until very recently I had long, thin, knotty, straight hair.  This was my favorite brush, it was very massaging in the scalp and didn&#x27;t pull at the tiny tangles like many others.  It cleaned easily.  The size is good and overall I was very happy with it.  I went back and bought another to keep a spare in the car.</li>
    <li> I am white with problematic thick, curly, coarse hair.  Brushing my hair during or after my shower is normally a nightmare, but not with this brush.  It feels like it&#x27;s not even doing anything it&#x27;s so painless, but after I was done, the tangles were gone.  HIGHLY recommended if you, like me, dread the after-shower brushing.</li>
    <li> stops the tears after bath time with the long hair</li>
    <li> this brush broke after first used. not happy</li>
    <li> 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 FIVE STAR PRODUCT 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 FIVE STAR BUYING EXPERIENCE</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews for this, I had to try it as it&#x27;s been getting challenging to brush my 6 yr old daughter&#x27;s long hair.  I agree with the other reviews that it looks just like any other brush so not sure what makes it so special.  After a few uses on both of us, I find that the bristles are much softer and therefore don&#x27;t hurt my daughters head like the other brushes we have.  Even if there are some knots (it doesn&#x27;t miraculously get knots out), my daughter doesn&#x27;t yell that it hurts anymore.  Overall I would recommend this brush if your child has issues with a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; or hard bristle brush.  Seems to work well for us.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best brush I&#x27;ve found for combing through fine tangled hair (without pulling your hair out)</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush!  Would be 5 Stars, but the bristles are very thin and you cannot use it with a blow dryer or they bend.  I will order another one.  This brush is great on my 2 yr olds curly hair, my long fine hair and my 8 yr old sons hair!  Great for everyone!  I just wish the bristles were a little stronger, but that might take away from the no tears.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve managed to live 3/4&#x27;s of my life without this brush. I don&#x27;t use anything else any more I even bring it to the salon.</li>
    <li> Good brush, but you can&#x27;t put it in your bag without the bristles getting crushed down and it becoming unusable. Mine was useless after 3 months of being in my purse. It&#x27;s a great detangling brush though and I have another one I bought in a salon that I keep in my bathroom that&#x27;s lasted about 2 years now so....keep it at home I guess?</li>
    <li> I have super thick tangly hair and was hesitant to buy this brush. This is THE BEST brush I have ever owned. Makes brushing painless and effortless.</li>
    <li> Beware when ordering this brush from an outside vendor (Limited Quantity in my case).  The brush was an older version and did not work as well compared to the multi colored ones (which I would rate 5 stars).  If you get a black brush with a black logo, you&#x27;re not getting the brush pictured.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, fine, and tangles easy. I needed a detangling brush mostly for after my runs when my ponytail has turned into a cluster of knots. For my needs, this brush is not a miracle. It contains no voodoo magic to effortlessly detangle the knots in my hair. For the price, I didn&#x27;t really expect it to. But, without a doubt, it works much better than any other brush I have tried. I don&#x27;t have to fight my hair as much when I use this brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush to use in shower to detangle your hair while conditioner is in.&lt;br /&gt;I think it works just as well as a wide tooth comb</li>
    <li> i have thin, fine hair &amp; i need a brush that doesnt YANK everything out when its wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my sister had one &amp; i tried it &amp; LOVED it! almost took hers! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i HAD to have one, ordered one as soon as i got home!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are incredibly gentle, and soft!!</li>
    <li> These are the BEST brushes for tangles!  My kids have thick, wavy hair and it&#x27;s a struggle to keep it brushed.  We used to have tears and tantrums about brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair.  This brush has saved my life, and the morning routine!  I have multiples since I can&#x27;t afford to misplace it, even for one day!  BEST BRUSH EVER!</li>
    <li> Must have for young girls (and women too).  Was previously a struggle to detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair but this brush is a miracle.  A friend who has super curly hair recommended it and we&#x27;ve used it ever since</li>
    <li> Totally works. A friend of mine suggested I give the brush a try and with 2 little girls who have curly hair, it totally works!</li>
    <li> At first, I was happy with the brush but after a couple of weeks of using it I noticed that I was loosing a lot of hair and the bristles started coming off. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have 2 little girls with long hair. Read about this product in a magazine and was hesitant to believe the hype, but it is true - no more tangles! I love it. My girls love it. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> The last brush I was using for brushing my wet hair literally snapped in half but this was after several years of usage so I wasn&#x27;t upset just surprised.  I was looking on Amazon for a new one when I came across these, after reading the reviews I decided to try and and have not been disappointed.  This is the best brush I&#x27;ve probably ever used.  I have medium length slightly curly hair that after getting highlighted can be very tangly.  This brush easily works through the tangles and snags without hurting.  My only concern is that some of the bristles are starting to bend already which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever love a hairbrush so much. My young daughter gets the worst snarls in her hair. This brush just glides through them. With this brush there are hardly ever any tears. It is fantastic.</li>
    <li> What is the VooDoo Magic of this amazing brush!? My hair is wavy, long, extremely fine, and gets tangled ridiculously easily. My hairdresser says I have the most sensitive head of anyone she&#x27;s ever met! Lol. Bought this brush on a whim, and I am SO glad I did. I&#x27;ve never had such an easy time brushing the knots out of my hair wet or dry!!! I&#x27;m a believer. I don&#x27;t know how they do this, but it&#x27;s my new favorite thing in the world.</li>
    <li> My daughter has long curly hair that tangles easily. She loves this brush, she only wants me to use it on her hair. We love that you can use it on wet hair and it does a pretty good job of getting out tangles. She took it with her to the pool everyday last summer, all the girls kept trying to beg her to let them borrow it. They ended up buying their own and they loved them. It is easy to use on curly hair, and does not make it frizzy. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> The best hair brush you can buy for detangling hair! This is the ONLY hair brush that I use!! This product arrived very quickly and the packaging was nice and neat! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> This brush is phenomenal!  Our struggles with tangles have significantly decreased with our little one.  Wet or dry hair, doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many brushes for my curly headed children. My kids have fine but super curly hair. This brush seems to inflict the least pain by pairing the very small bristles with soft beaded ends so it doesn&#x27;t scratch their tender scalps.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 4 1/2 and she has long, wavy/semi curly hair that gets tangled easily.  I have fought with her for years with the hair brushing.  This works SO well.  Do it right after the bath when the hair is wet.  (The wetter, the better, for us). Be VERY gentle around the ears and be easy on the scalp, as the bristles can feel sharp against their skin.  I use this on my waist length hair and I am done in less than 30 seconds.  Seriously, it is amazing!!!  We finally found our answer!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Work well to get the tables out of wet hair without damaging the hair. Great to put in the pool/beach bag!</li>
    <li> This is my first review. But have to say it is the BEST. Immediately detangled the hair without cry. Would buy several so I can put everywhere whenever and wherever I need it.</li>
    <li> Love this .... it&#x27;s real soft for the scalp... hence does little to no damage to your hair... works eqqually well on wet &amp; dry hair</li>
    <li> Oh the TEARS that this brush has saved us just in the short time we&#x27;ve had it! I have three young girls... and hair brushing time has NOT been their favorite activity of the day! But this new brush has made that a breeze! I&#x27;m not sure how... but it does not pull their hair!! At all! The first time I used it I was not being gentle just because I wanted to see if it really worked, and my daughter didn&#x27;t even notice! Usually she is super sensitive and the tiniest tug gets her upset. This brush  is amazing! I feel like ordering several more, just because we love it so much!! Am telling all our friends with girls, no doubt!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, it is long, and its tangles eat hair brushes.  Detangling every morning is an exercise in rage and pain -- or was, until I bought this brush. I don&#x27;t know what magical voodoo was used in its manufacturing, but all I can tell you is that it works.  Actually I just opened the box it arrived in and brushed my hair with it for the first time, and I was immediately overcome with the need to rush to Amazon and write a raving review, it has already impressed me so much.  If your hair is anything like mine, you don&#x27;t want this -- you NEED this.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I ordered this brush.  It has been wonderful for my hair and has saved me the time and pain of untangling my hair.  However, I was disappointed that I got a black brush.  When they say assorted colors, I expect to receive ANY color but black.  I could have just ordered the original black brush.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old daughter has thick and long hair.  Combing it can be difficult because she has a lot of tangles.  This brush works miracles while wet in the shower.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter.  I used to have to use detangler on her hair, but not anymore.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time we relied on J&amp;J to avoid post-shower, tangled hair. Welcome the brush that doesn&#x27;t care what shampoo you use. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> love the brush but i wish i could have picked out the color.  wish i didn&#x27;t have to give more words than i want to give a review.</li>
    <li> This brush was a gift for teacher&#x27;s appreciation week.....to go along with all the other items for her beach bag.  I was EXTREMELY disappointed when I opened this package and  discovered that of all the vibrant colors shown, I received a black brush!!!!! I just knew it!!! You can&#x27;t choose your color so be careful!</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m ordering another one is that my daughter lost the one she had. One of her friends probably neglected to mention that she left it at their house because they love it so much too.</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter love it</li>
    <li> The wet brush is magic. I have long thick curley hair and it combs right through like silk. No pulling or tangling. I got one for Christmas and then bought 3 more.My granddaughter used it and loved it so I sent her one to.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have long hair, and allot of it, but it&#x27;s still fine hair and I get terrible rat&#x27;s nests in the back-mainly from leaning my head back on the couch. Every couple of weeks I&#x27;d get one so bad I would have to just work it into my hair-do for a day or 2 until I had a day off or a couple extra hours time to sit down &amp; slowly work away at it with my brush. I&#x27;d never heard of a brush like this but I stumbled across it while (doubtfully)hoping to find some miracle detangling spray, and based on the reviews &amp; cost I decided to try this first.  Admittedly, when I opened it I was immediately disappointed that it looked almost exactly like my current hairbrush, leading me to think it would be useless. Well much to my surprise, this brush is magical! I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but now no matter how bad my hair gets or how much product is in it, I know it&#x27;ll take me less than 2 mins to smooth soft hair. I&#x27;ve only used it for detangling with dry hair, but it&#x27;s gotten through the worst of messes-and it never pulls or pinches my tender head! This should be called the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; brush!</li>
    <li> It is not as good as a wide tooth comb for detangling my long, curly hair.  I&#x27;ve tried it several times now and I feel like it is pulling more hair out than the comb does.</li>
    <li> The wet brush is the most amazing product out there. I have bought 3 in my life and as I need new ones, I will continue to buy more.</li>
    <li> I love this brush it&#x27;s amazing it detangles your hair so great and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It just glides right thorough your hair no matter how tangled it is. All I have to say is if your have really thick hair I would recommend getting the paddle one that&#x27;s what I had to do after having the regular for about 7 months it broke but other then that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: I did not buy at Amazon but at a local salon. Just wanted to share my experience. I agree with a few other reviewers here: horrible odor. I think it&#x27;s more a cheap rubber odor, which I&#x27;m sensitive to, instead of a plastic odor. It&#x27;s so strong that  I can&#x27;t imagine others not noticing  it. I think it&#x27;s just an issue of poor quality control where it was made..China. I cannot speak to it&#x27;s function as I re-packaged it immediately to return.</li>
    <li> This brush was a god send!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My five year old has really long, really fine hair. It gets tangled a badly very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Brushing her her was a constant fight until we got this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it doesn&#x27;t really save me time because I have to spend longer actually brushing (the bristles are bendy And don&#x27;t yank, but this also means working on tangles longer) it does however save my daughter a bunch of tears.&lt;br /&gt;And the extra time brushing isn&#x27;t a deal breaker because I would have spent that time fighting her to sit still anyway.</li>
    <li> This works better than expected on detangling.</li>
    <li> Worked great on half-breed hair!</li>
    <li> Great product and actually works as promised, I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s hair breaks easily or has a tender head.</li>
    <li> it doesnt tear out the hair from my skull so ya know thats always a good thing</li>
    <li> Did not observe any special detangling qualities,  it&#x27;s an ordinary brush with short, fine bristles.  After brushing my granddaughter&#x27;s hair several times there was quite a lot of hair in the brush, so it&#x27;s either breaking it or pulling it out.  For wet hair, it seems the best solution is to use a wide tooth comb and a good detangling spray, and gently work from the bottom ends up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they did it, but they really, truly managed to develop a brush that minimizes tears.  This brush is a God-send!</li>
    <li> This brush is nothing special. I read all these great reviews. But the plastic part looks used and abused. There are scuffs and dents on the plastic. The brush will brush out my hair, but so would any other. I should of just got another con air that worked for years! And it was way better. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! We call it the &amp;#34;magic brush&amp;#34; because it really minimizes the snagging, tangles, and screams. It is a must have for curly heads!</li>
    <li> This has to be the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned hands down! I have fine hair that tangles easily and I&#x27;m from the generation that had thick plastic bristly paddle brushes that my mother would smack me in the back of the head with whenever I fidgeted in pain. This brush is very light weight and the bristles feel like a scalp massage. As an adult I love the ease of using this brush and not feeling like I&#x27;m ripping out my hair. For the sake of your hair, head, children, and sanity, BUY this brush!!!!</li>
    <li> I found out about the wet brush after my sister bought one. It seems like any other cheap brush but it works miracles with hair - untangles &amp; softens. I get horrible rats nest every night &amp; the wet brush brushes them right out, painlessly, wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush - and so does my 4 year old daughter! Until recently when I trimmed it, my daughter&#x27;s hair was more than 20&amp;#34; long, which tangled very easily. Brushing her hair in the morning and after her bath in the evenings was a nightmare for both of us. I tried the Kids Detangling comb from Avon, but that didn&#x27;t help much. So after many battles, I decided to try the Wet Brush and what a difference it made! The brush just glides through my daughter&#x27;s hair, whether it&#x27;s wet or dry. She happily sits still while I brush her hair out. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the color I was ordering - ended up getting a black brush, but would have preferred any one of the other colors. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these brushes for over a year now - one stays in the bathroom so I can detangle my hair as soon as I get out of the shower, and the other stays in my purse. I have hip-length, thick, Asian hair with a slight wave to it, which means that detangling has been a part of my life for as long as I&#x27;ve had hair. My hair is full of super coarse strands and thin gossamer strands - these strands typically find magical ways to snarl and knot up with one another, and I&#x27;ve had to cut knot out with scissors PLENTY of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried DOZENS of brushes, from the Tangle Teezer (too soft, doesn&#x27;t work), to super-expensive Mason-Pearson brushes (not worth the $$$$), to pretty much every brush available at local beauty supply stores. My hair actually BROKE a wooden handled boar bristle brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wet Brush WORKS - it has yet to snag anywhere in my hair, and has taken a lot of abuse. The \\&quot;soft but not too soft\\&quot; bristles glide right through my hair, wet or dry, without ever snagging, pulling or breaking hairs. I no longer have to use leave-in cream detanglers or spray-on detanglers. After my shower, it takes me only 1-2 minutes or brushing with the Wet Brush, and my hair is detangled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint - you don&#x27;t get to choose colors when you order. I ordered two and ended up with a black brush (awesome!) and a NEON YELLOW BRUSH (yikes). I actually ordered 2 more just to have extras on hand, and I could care less what colors I get, as long as I don&#x27;t have to be without my brush.</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth $9. The brush is too soft for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have no words to explain how amazing this brush is. I have very long hair that gets tangled very easily. I have always hated brushing my hair because it hurts so bad no matter what kind of brush I use. Even hair stylists get frustrated with it. This brush makes me not hate brushing my hair. It kind of feels nice actually hah. Seriously, it does not hurt AT ALL. Also, it takes five minutes to brush my long hair with this brush after a shower. It&#x27;s perfection and I will never use another brush. BUY IT NOW.</li>
    <li> I am so confused by the 5 star reviews for this brush.  I got this brush based on a great review from a blogger.  I should not have trusted a review of a free product with an affiliate link, but I did, my mistake. The brush is awful, it looks and feels cheap and it doesn&#x27;t detangle hair at all. I&#x27;ve used it wet, dry, super wet in the shower, trying to figure out why people are saying this brush is so amazing. It&#x27;s awful, I would expect to find this type of brush at the dollar store.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Eh, it&#x27;s ok. It works for the most part. It hurts a lot less than a regular brush but it takes longer if you have thicker hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is ALWAYS so tangly and this brush works the most efficient!! I love it and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and I&#x27;m pleased to say it works as advertised. Wet or dry, this brush gets the tangles out without pulling. Works great on my daughter&#x27;s almost waist-length hair, even right out of the tub.</li>
    <li> I used after shower, very easy and smooth to comb hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried use when hair was dry, but it made static cling to my hair. So, to me, use this brush after shower is perfect. It will be great for summer time after beach or swimming pool. Brush is light weight, and drying quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing, I really didn&#x27;t like... brush has chemical smell something like rubber smell. If there was no strong smell, I would give 5star for this brush. But overall, I like this brush.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that it does what it says it does. But I use in the shower and comb my long hair with conditioner in it. It detangles easy and see a lot less hair coming out in the shower. I got one for my niece- and the other one steals it all the time too!  Good price too.</li>
    <li> Brush works as everyone says but the amount of hair in the brush is about 4 or 5 times normal!  I have a slight wave color treated thick abundant hair.  I am planning to throw the brush out since any damage more than normal is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t yank on my scalp</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this brush! I have 2 daughters with hair to their waist and it brushes&lt;br /&gt;Out all the tangles ... with no &amp;#34;ouchies&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Every time I use this brush on myself or my girls, wet or dry hair, all I can think is that EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THIS BRUSH.  Seriously, it&#x27;s amazing. Cuts hair brushing time in half.  The value of this brush cannot be overstated.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this brush for my fine hair so when brushing through when wet it doesn&#x27;t tangle. She also said it&#x27;s the best brush for kids to prevent tears from pulling hair while brushing. I got one for each of them also and they love getting their hair brushed now!</li>
    <li> I never thought a hairbrush would blow me away, but this one does just that. I first heard about it during a segment on the Today Show. I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I have very thick hair that tangles when wet, and this brush just glides through my hair. Amazing. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the only brush that will go through my daughters very long hair without her crying about tangles. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> My kids love this brush. Gentle enough not to hurt their curly hair. It looks and feels sort of cheap so I don&#x27;t expect it to last long. But it&#x27;s perfect for those with sensitive scalps and thick hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using her wet brush even if her hair isn&#x27;t wet.  Gets tangles out without the tears.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Couldn&#x27;t ask for better</li>
    <li> This brush was recommended to me and I absolutely love it. I have thin, fine hair that tangles so badly - if it weren&#x27;t for this brush, I&#x27;d have to shave all the tangles off. Thank you for finally making a brush that actually works - I have seen such an improvement in my hair and actually look forward to brushing :)</li>
    <li> Great for detangling my wet long hair.</li>
    <li> Least amount of discomfort for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  We both appreciate this product!</li>
    <li> My Daughters favorite brush.  We can not go anywhere without it.</li>
    <li> The only brush that does not pull my hair</li>
    <li> Not a miracle brush BUT it did make it easier and less painful.</li>
    <li> detangles hair pretty good. Sometimes I have to brush my short hair for 10 minutes before its detangled enough too comb though.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for performance ...  plus it seems to be pretty well made.  I would take 1 star away because you do not get to pick you color, but we received pink for our daughter. All is right with the world.  It would be nice to pick your color, though.</li>
    <li> Works great, glides right through my wet hair. It also works great for hair extensions, which can be very difficult to untangle. I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> We have two of them, a black one and a blue one, love them both but the blue one has an awful plastic odor that won&#x27;t go away and too late to exchange it.</li>
    <li> My hair has gotten increasingly more unruly as I&#x27;ve begun growing it out to donate it. I usually have hair barely past my shoulders, but the longer it&#x27;s gotten, the harder it is to brush it. I read a description of it and saw the $8 price and figured it was worth trying. AND OH MY GOODNESS I WAS RIGHT!!!! I have no idea why this brush works, but just yesterday my hair took about 15 minutes to carefully comb out all the knots and with this new brush it took approximately 2 minutes. I was concerned that the brush would pull my hair a lot and hurt, but it was painless as well as effortless. I&#x27;ve honestly never written a product review on any website before (and I&#x27;m a frequent online shopper!) but I was seriously so amazed with this product that I had to share my experience! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR PEOPLE WITH HARD-TO-BRUH HAIR!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long hair and this made my job immeasurably easier! I even bought one for my own hair! I got rid of all my other brushes! Will only use these now.</li>
    <li> I have hair to my waist and was looking for a detangler brush. This one was probably the worst I&#x27;ve ever used, the little nubbies on the end of the bristles ripped out my hair in large quantity. I&#x27;m going to use it on my dog and see if it helps him, but it&#x27;s not touching my hair again.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about six months, and then the bristles started bending/coming out.  Thanks for the six month ease-of-brushing;  but I&#x27;m not planning to buy one of these twice a year... so you&#x27;ve lost my business.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my sons curly hair, I was impressed with the smoothest brush ever, no tangles felt with it at all, plus it massages the scalp so gently that you want to brush all day long!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this brush does what it does but I have replaced the brush that I used to use with this one and I am thinking about purchasing more for my family.  I have a sister who has always been very tender headed so I know she would love this.  I also have 4 step daughters, all with long wavy hair.  This would be perfect for them too.  I think that the trick to this is the flexible bristles.  They are much more flexible than a standard brush.  I still get hair in this brush but it does not pull the hair at all so you get pain free detangling.</li>
    <li> My daughter is very tender headed &amp; this brush is a wonderful relief for both of us! This is a great brush for all ages.</li>
    <li> the brush itself is great.  however, I would like to warn potential buyers that this ad is misleading.  it shows 5 brushes.  no where does it say you get only ONE brush.  the ad makes it seem as if you get all five brushes.  I ordered and I got only one brush.  moreover, I didn&#x27;t even get to select the color.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer stated, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does&amp;#34;. It is one of the few brushes that detangles my long, fine, thin hair without catching it. Works better for me with wet hair. I use the scalpmaster for my dry hair.</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush does exactly what it is advertised to do.  My hair is long &amp; thick and it was an ordeal to brush it after washing until I bought the Wet Brush.  Now the brush slides through my hair sooooooooo easily it is almost unbelievable.  I bought the Wet Brush &amp; the Sharkk brush (thinking they were the same) since they were part of Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Add On\\&quot;  (the Wet Brush was $8.96 and the Sharkk was $3.96.)  Well, they are not the same.  The Wet Brush is excellent in everyway but the Sharkk Brush is flimsy and works okay with dry hair but not with wet hair (brushing conditioner through wet hair.)  If you want the best brush simply pay $5.oo more for the Wet Brush and you will be happy.</li>
    <li> We have 2 daughters with long, thick hair and it&#x27;s been a nightmare trying to brush their hair.  It&#x27;s been especially rough with our 2 year old who has mid-back length hair and would cry and fight just at the sight of the brush or comb.  It&#x27;s a totally different story with the Wet Brush.  I first used it right after our toddler&#x27;s bath and she was apprehensive at first, (as was I) thinking it was the regular brush, but when I got started and she realized it wasn&#x27;t pulling her hair, she calmed down and we haven&#x27;t had a problem since.  The bristles are really skinny and flexible, so they drag through the hair rather than just pulling it.  It does take a little longer to work out big tangles, but it&#x27;s worth it for how smoothly it works.  We&#x27;ve used it on wet and dry hair and have great results both ways.  The brush leaves their hair much smoother and softer than with a regular brush, and doesn&#x27;t pull out even an eighth of the hair the girls were having yanked out before.  We&#x27;re definitely stocking up on a few more of these!</li>
    <li> I love this brush for after shower hair</li>
    <li> My daughter says it works great.</li>
    <li> This brush is a game changer! This is the only brush I use to completely detangle my hair. I tried the tangle tamer and it was terrible compared to this. I use this brush in the shower; it works quickly, well, and painlessly. I love it! I want to buy a second to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s house.</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product!!! I don&#x27;t know how anyone can use this on wet hair without ripping it out. Please don&#x27;t get your hopes up and waste your time and money. The thought that any salon would use or sell this product is a complete farse!!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. Other brushes take forever, but this works great on wet hair after giving my daughter a bath.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick hair so this brush didn&#x27;t work too great for her. The bristles collapsed and looked flat after 2 weeks. So if you don&#x27;t have thick hair maybe it would be ok but if you do have thick hair I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brush!!</li>
    <li> Love this brush ! Works great on my thick knotty hair ! I use this in combo with &amp;#34;its a 10&amp;#34; and I highly recommend if it&#x27;s difficult to get a comb through your hair after a shower !</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of a detangling brush because my hair is so thick and tangles so quickly that I HATED brushing it when it was wet. This brush is awesome it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like other brushes and it is now painless to brush through my hair. My hair still had some shedding but I&#x27;m sure it was already loose strands.</li>
    <li> This brush is the best thing to happen to my head in months. After an over-bleaching accident last year, every morning has been a painful battle to brush my just-out-of-the-shower-bleach-damaged wet hair enough to get it into a french braid. I&#x27;ve tried wide tooth combs, detangler, conditioner, and my regular brush and everything HURT! This brush has put a stop to the daily torture.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is not a miracle brush. The reason it gets through knots so well is because of its very thin and well spaced bristles. However, because they are so thin, they bend with contact to something solid like the back of your neck. So, with wet hair, the brush will completely detangle the sides and get a lot of the back, but not everything. I&#x27;ve found that a first run through with the brush gets out the worst tangles, and a wide tooth comb gets out the rest. With dry hair, there&#x27;s no need for a second run through. And all without pain!</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for children with sensitive scalps.</li>
    <li> As expected.  Good service.</li>
    <li> I love this hairbrush. I have a really bad habit of brushing my hair right after getting out of the shower because I hate the feeling my hair all over the place, and this has been fantastic. This brush has definitely been gentler on my hair; I don&#x27;t know if it pulls less hair out, but I definitely like that the actual brush pin things are gentle on my scalp and any knots.</li>
    <li> It really does brush the tangles out with no pain, and it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out.</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush had good reviews, and I have two daughters with long hair who whine and cry 90% of the time when their hair is being brushed, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My oldest has the thickest hair I&#x27;ve ever seen.  This brush slid through her wet hair like a knife through warm butter.  I was so shocked I made my husband come do it again.  He refuses to brush their hair because of the drama - and he was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this brush five stars is because of my younger daugher.  Her hair is the polar opposite of her sister&#x27;s -- very fine, thin and tangly.  This brush did a good job but there was still a lot of grumbling.  It didn&#x27;t slide through her hair nearly as easily as her sister&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a great detangling brush for THICK hair, this is definitely for you.  If you are looking for one for FINE hair, I haven&#x27;t got your answer yet.  :/</li>
    <li> i looove these brushes!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say how much I love this hair brush!! My hair is freaking damaged and frizzy and my more expensive boar bristles + nylon hair brush couldn&#x27;t even tame it.</li>
    <li> This brush blew me away when I first got it. After a month or so, I noticed that the bristles were coming out. They get bent over and just break off easily. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good with missing bristles. I&#x27;m kinda disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wow! It&#x27;s magic. I was hoping the reviews I read were accurate. They are. My very fine hair is no longer painful to brush before drying. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference between this brush and one I would get from the drug store</li>
    <li> This brush was not any different that any other brush. It did not detangle my hair or make it any easier to brush my hair while wet. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves her wet brush, so does her daughter</li>
    <li> Does what it says! My long hair can tends to get tangled to the point I start breaking it with other brushes- well not anymore! It isn&#x27;t made of the greatest material, but so far so good. It untangles my hair without yanking or breaking it in the process. I don&#x27;t use the brush to put my hair up in pony tails since the bristles don&#x27;t seem to go as deep into my hair so it&#x27;s just my untangling brush</li>
    <li> This brush definitely helped with tangles!  Works better on wet hair than dry, but works well either way.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush on the recommendation of my daughter in law. She bought it for my granddaughter who has very thin, long hair and complains when mommy brushes her hair that \\&quot;it hurts\\&quot;. They are very happy there are no more tears when getting ready for school.  I bought one for my other granddaughter to use and she seems to love it, too. As for myself, I still love my wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. I purchased a 2 pack for my kids. My 4yo has curly hair and my 5yo has thick hair. Hair in the morning before school was always a disaster which usually ended in the curly-headed one leaving the house with her hair standing on end. I found these by accident on Amazon and took a chance at ordering them because the price was so good. I have no idea what makes these brushes magical but who am I to question a good thing? The kids now brush their own hair--sometimes without being asked!--without missing a beat. They worked so great for the kids that I ordered the black brush for myself. Just buy them--one for every member of the family!</li>
    <li> My daughters are 3 and 5 with very thick, curly, ethnic hair.  They used to hate getting it combed and I hated them screaming through it! Not any more. This brush works on wet and dry hair and is extremely gentle yet does what a regular brush does. I want to give the creator of this brush some kind of parenting award! This is a must have for every parent!</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter has very long thin hair that beccomes easily tangled.  Because it&#x27;s thin we have to be careful brushing it to avoid breaking it.  This brush works very well in her and she gets very good results without the pain that other brushes cause.</li>
    <li> Love the hair brush! My hair used to get tangled all the time and at least I am able to brush thru whether it is wet or dry</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. It was recommended my my hair stylist and it is much better at detangling my hair than a wide toothed comb. It saves me time and hair. Great price too. There is an odd plastic smell to the brush but it has lightened up over time. I noticed that the coating on the plastic handle is crackling. It doesn&#x27;t affect performance but still, it&#x27;s only about a month old.</li>
    <li> I got this because I&#x27;m a swimmer with really long hair. I thought it would help with all the tangles. I wish I would have discovered this a long time ago! I use it every day after I shower. It&#x27;s so helpful for girls with long hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush in hopes of easing the morning hair brushing battles between me and my 6 year old daughter.  It worked!  This brush is amazing.  My daughter can brush her own hair and get all the tangles out in less than a minute.  (Her hair is nearly to her behind).  It also works in wet hair.  I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this brush.  I think I&#x27;m going to be giving it as a gift it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> First off, I NEVER write reviews.. and I buy a lot of things on Amazon. My hair is pretty normal, nor is it very damaged from styling it. It&#x27;s very long, but it gets tangly SO EASILY. I have to shower ever single day just to be presentable to the world, otherwise it&#x27;s so unbelievably tangly and dready. When I shower I spend so long just trying to brush my hair out with a comb with tons and tons of conditioner, but somehow it always ends up tangled again. After my shower, I use detangler and morroccan oil. Nothing worked for me. Today I received my new brush and was super excited to try it out. I had hairsprayed, tangled curls from the night before and suprisingly this brush brushed it out in the shower with just shampoo! Before I had even used any conditioner, my hair was softer than it had ever been after soaking it in conditioner in previous times. So so so happy with this purchase; cannot believe it&#x27;s not sold in every single salon and department store.</li>
    <li> Good Product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> I never thought I would find anything that would get through the knots in my wet hair...but this Wet Brush did!  With a little leave in conditioner, this brush did just that.  I would definitely recommend it to someone with long, straight hair.  I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s full wavy hair.  Cant live without this brush!  l</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product I have found that gets out the knots and matted messes in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has thick, short, curly and sort of nappy hair. She was 3 years old before I found this product and we struggled mercilessly before that.  No detanglers, shampoos, conditioners, or any other types of brushes, picks, or combs worked.  It also works on my hair which tends to knot up very easily in the back (my hair is wavy). Other brushes have ripped out or broken off my hair instead of detangled it.  I have several of these brushes now.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brush!  I have really long hair.  After a shower my hair gets so tangled and is really hard to brush out.  The wet brush is awesome and helps get those tangles out.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> I have a tough time combing the hair (wet or dry) of my daughters aged 3 and 6. Anyone with daughters should get this product! No more teams and screaming with the knots!</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that works it&#x27;s way into a rat&#x27;s nest when washed and this brush gets through the tangle in a flash without ripping my hair out.  It&#x27;s easily shaved 5 mins off my prep time.</li>
    <li> My daughter has really curly hair and this is the only brush she hasn&#x27;t complained about hurting her head.</li>
    <li> While this cannot perform miracles, compared to my previous brush it gets more tangles less painfully and more quickly.  Not only that, but it is completely waterproof and it is extremely cheap.  For this price range there is no better.  Only problem is that some of the tines are not as well made as the others, but this does not noticeably impact the effectiveness of the brush nor are imperfections rough or likely to damage or catch hair.  Got a nice bright pink color.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush for post-showering brushes. My hair always gets tangled and knotty, but this detangler makes it much more manageable to brush out my fine hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
    <li> This was a christmas gift and I loved it.  Was well worthe the price and product.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush.  Nice made, works well with tangles, and feels great on your scalp.  Would have given it five stars if the handle was not as flat as it is.</li>
    <li> I like my brushes...they do what they say they will do, which is prevent pulling of hair while it gently detangles.  However, the bristles don&#x27;t seem stiff enough and, although there is no pulling, it takes me several passes to detangle each area of hair.</li>
    <li> I am not one to usually write reviews but I just had to.  This brush is amazing.  I have very brittle hair as I am bleach blonde and all the other brushes I have tried always break my hair.  My hair tangles very easily and with just one stroke it was detangled. Didn&#x27;t feel it tugging or pulling on my hair at all. It really lives up to all its great reviews!</li>
    <li> This brush is GREAT! How have I gone so long without it in my life?!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair, almost to my waist; it&#x27;s also very fine, and tangles extremely easily, especially if I&#x27;m lazy with my hair care for a couple days. Previously, I had to use a leave in conditioner nightly (my favorite is its a ten plus keratin) not necessarily to condition, but just to detangle! Even with a detangler combing through my hair still took a good 10-15 minutes every night, which is annoying when I&#x27;m tired and want to go to sleep! My hair really doesn&#x27;t need the conditioner on a daily basis, and would sometimes get greasy, especially if I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this brush on both wet and dry hair, and it&#x27;s AMAZING! I do have a little breakage, but way less than before! Probably even less than the wide tooth comb. I use my leave in conditioner every other night now, and even on nights where I don&#x27;t use it, my hair is still very easy to brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of African descent and have tight, very coily and dry hair.  I was soooooo surprised that I could feel these bristles on my scalp and pulling it through was pain free, dry or wet.  I also tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair because its longer.  I usually have to fight with her over doing her hair.  She didn&#x27;t wince or cry once when I brushed her hair with it.  After having stopped perming and processing my hair over 18 years ago I never came across a brush like this that didn&#x27;t cause pain or rip my hair out.  I&#x27;m so happy with it that I&#x27;m writing this review and I just bought 3 more to have when I&#x27;m out and about, one for my daughter, and some backups.  I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve been able to get by without this brush for so long.  Just freaking awesome.</li>
    <li> This is my VERY FIRST TIME OF RETURNING ANYTHING. It is so coarsely made, to be honest. Not only there was dust on both the wrap and the brush. A small damage was on its handle, and it hurt my scalp when I tried it. Anyway, it looked like USED, and NOT FUNCTIONAL at all. I bought another one at a hair beauty store for 4.99, and it works much better than it.</li>
    <li> We LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush.  I have long hair. Kid has shoulder length hair.  It takes NO time at all to brush our hair wet or dry.  LOVE This brush. Can&#x27;t say it enough. I even let the kids brush my hair b/c not pain at ALL!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, and if I don&#x27;t untangle it in the shower while it is wet, it becomes a knotty mess once it dries. I can&#x27;t brush it when it has dried as I get a lion mane of frizz! I have always hated brushing my hair wet as it is always sooooo tangled, always hurts as I rip through my hair, even after tons of conditioner, so I decided to try this brush. I LOVE it, use it during every shower, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at ALL. I wish my mom had had one when I was a kid....I hated having my hair brushed! Not only is it gentle, it does a great job, and I&#x27;ve noticed less split ends since I changed to this brush. I highly recommend, and have told several of my friends about it!</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter hates to brush her hair, especially after a shower! We are amazed at how well this brush works!  We don&#x27;t even use a detangler!</li>
    <li> I just used this hair brush on my very long hair(I can almost sit on it) when it was wet and it worked perfectly!! No pulling of hair and no giant balls of hair left on the brush. I have been searching for a good brush and have paid way to much for some. Who would have thought it would only cost me $9 for a brush that blows the rest away!!! No more tears!</li>
    <li> I wonder how so many liked this item. It has the most terrible petroleum smell, that hurts my nose, and sticks to my hands. when i tried to wash it, the bristles immediately shifted in their place to all kind of bent angles.&lt;br /&gt;I will return this item today.</li>
    <li> Only giving this one star as the picture implied, I was getting 5 brushes.  Will buy more so each of my daughters has one for camp.</li>
    <li> WOW!  I wish i had known about this sooner -- like when my kids were little and the tangle fairy came to visit often.  I had no idea a brush could work so well on tangles.  I was skeptical when I read the other rave reviews, but decided to give it a try.  I used to end up with a lot of hair in my comb after washing it, but not anymore.  This brush is amazing!  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could .</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing, easy on your hair does not pull it out like other brushes.  My hair is thin</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It works so well for my daugjter and I and I love the fun design as well.</li>
    <li> Used it less than an hour after it arrived.  Instead of fighting tangles after I washed my hair, I had time to brush my hair and then chat with a friend on the computer, instead of brushing my hair over and over again.  It&#x27;s a great product and I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Kathleen</li>
