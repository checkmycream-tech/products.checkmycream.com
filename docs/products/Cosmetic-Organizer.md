### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this thing is awesome.</li>
      <li>This has been one of my best purchases.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going for aesthetics and you want an organizer to blend with your decor, then this one is probably not the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/04/17&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>, it has been a great 2 years and 3 months!  </li>
      <li>FREAKING AWESOME!</li>
      <li>When I saw this organizer turntable and noticed it had sides, I thought it would be the perfect solution to keep everything in place.  </li>
      <li>Looks awesome works great !</li>
      <li>It fits perfectly on the corner of my desk, which doubles as my makeup station.</li>
      <li>It fits and spins perfectly.</li>
      <li>Perfect size for my bathroom use.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great</li>
      <li>Great product for storing cosmetics that clutter your counter.</li>
      <li>but upon placing my stuff in the organizer, I&#x27;m really GLAD that it IS FLEXIBLE!!</li>
      <li>Is a good product but after using it 2 weeks I am selling it.</li>
      <li>Perfect fit for what I needed.</li>
      <li>good for stuff, liked it</li>
      <li>And I can see the top of my vanity again!</li>
      <li>So, while I enjoyed the product, it should have lasted longer in my opinion, thus I am rating 3 stars!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>My daughter loved this and it can fit almost any size product!  </li>
      <li>It keeps everything handy for applying makeup without being in the way while I work at my computer.</li>
      <li>But kind of pricy for what I revived.</li>
      <li>She saw mine and was quite impressed with the looks and convenience it offers.</li>
      <li>The side &amp;#34;barriers&amp;#34; on both levels keep the products from falling, and the bearings that allow it to swivel do the job; even though it isn&#x27;t a very smooth movement, it does what it needs to without difficulty.</li>
      <li>once it had products on top.</li>
      <li>If it falls off the counter I am sure it would crack into a million pieces.</li>
      <li>Still, it&#x27;s better than the jumble of unreachable items that used to be under my bathroom sink.</li>
      <li>honestly my room became clutter free.</li>
      <li>Omg I love these things i bought two this one and the biggest one and</li>
      <li>She was so pleased to organize her life with this product.</li>
      <li>My granddaughter seemed to have lost the top of her dresser to clutter.  </li>
      <li>I need three more words</li>
      <li>Okay piece.  </li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>My counter top no longer looks cluttered.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>For someone that is overloaded with sink top or bureau counter clutter, this item will sort everything conveniently at your touch.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It performs it&#x27;s function well in terms of stacking and swivel, but it sure isn&#x27;t cute and it sure looks and feels cheap.  </li>
      <li>It has done WONDERS for keeping my counters clean!  </li>
      <li>This allowed for more things to fit and for easier adjusting.</li>
      <li>I have it stuffed full!</li>
      <li>It spins easily and holds a lot of items.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d have rather paid more for something a little more attractive.</li>
      <li>It is nice once you get it filled up with your stuff and haven&#x27;t had any more problems so far.</li>
      <li>Well designed, spins smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Great for saving space in cabinets, especially for make-up and hair products.</li>
      <li>the brush holder insert is a cheap roll-together connecting type piece.</li>
      <li>Thank you for producing such a great quality product.</li>
      <li>Cleared SOOOOOO much counter space and makes everything accessible when I need it - so pleased!</li>
      <li>I can fit so much on this!!!  </li>
      <li>but it is very useful.</li>
      <li>What I like particularly about this is that it has dividers on the different teirs so that the items don&#x27;t go sliding or flopping from side to side but stay upright and in the perfect position.</li>
      <li>all while keeping all your things out where it&#x27;s visible and easily accessible.</li>
      <li>I now have my cosmetics grouped and am able to find things much quicker.  </li>
      <li>I really like the fact that you can put tall stuff on the top like hairspray</li>
      <li>Overall, it has been good.  </li>
      <li>This organizer has a large capacity and spins easily and smoothly, without snagging.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very glad I have it.</li>
      <li>The space-saving and clutter-reducing idea of this organizer is just great, but I wish it could&#x27;ve been a little stronger and not that flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
      <li>Hmmm, my perception seemed right on target from the onset.</li>
      <li>I found that my round brush fit perfectly upside down in it so that is what I use it for.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty coo.</li>
      <li>Really removed all of the clutter from her make-up table!</li>
      <li>I can actually see their bath vanity top now.</li>
      <li>I love the space-saving, clutter-reducing idea of this organizer, but it&#x27;s a little flimsy and doesn&#x27;t spin as smoothly as I would like.</li>
      <li>Fits all of her makeup and her brushes are easily stored in the middle compartment.</li>
      <li>But it certainly does what I need it to.</li>
      <li>Really helps to keep things more organized &amp; less cluttered since you can place things on the top &amp; bottom instead of all flat on desk.</li>
      <li>This product has made a huge difference for me and my husband is much happier to have his side of the counter back!  </li>
      <li>The seller was very accomodating, and I had no problems when returning the item, so I would not hesitate purchasing from them</li>
      <li>This item is very well made and designed.</li>
      <li>This really helped organize my bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>It has been a lifesaver in organzing my makeup and skicare and made it so much easier to find everything.</li>
      <li>The holder for makeup brushes didn&#x27;t hold up very well.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this project!</li>
      <li>It has made organizing the sink in my bathroom very well</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this organizer five stars was because it&#x27;s cheaply made and looks it.</li>
      <li>This item has really helped me organize my make up</li>
      <li>and my time getting ready.  </li>
      <li>and I have so much room now since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
      <li>nice storage for small spaces</li>
      <li>This saved my bathroom counter top from being a cluttered mess.</li>
      <li>This product costs far too much compared with the quality.  </li>
      <li>Functional - very large - not as sturdy as I thought it would be especially for the price.</li>
      <li>I also put two small mugs on the top one</li>
      <li>I would have liked it to be a little more sturdy, but nothing is wrong with it.  </li>
      <li>The solution that I finally settled on was simply to purchase a couple of 2\\&quot; deep cake pans in a size that would fit on my existing double turntable and put all my items inside the cake pans.  </li>
      <li>Less competition allows them to get away with these prices for about $5 worth of plastic assembled into a product.</li>
      <li>I can live with the minor crack</li>

    <li> My daughter loved this and it can fit almost any size product!  Really removed all of the clutter from her make-up table!</li>

    <li> This really helped organize my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have reclaimed my bathroom counter! Thank you for producing such a great quality product.</li>
    <li> Okay piece.  I would have liked it to be a little more sturdy, but nothing is wrong with it.  Does what it depicts to do.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my bathroom use. However, the material for brush holder is not good quality.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my best purchases.  My counter top no longer looks cluttered.  I now have my cosmetics grouped and am able to find things much quicker.  Before I had to pick up each bottle to see what it was.  I am going to buy another one for my daughter.  She saw mine and was quite impressed with the looks and convenience it offers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenagers bathroom and this cleared all the clutter.  Well designed, spins smoothly.  I can actually see their bath vanity top now.</li>
    <li> Great product for storing cosmetics that clutter your counter. It holds taller (8oz) bottles as well. The construction is mediocre. If it falls off the counter I am sure it would crack into a million pieces. Overall, it does what it says it will do.  If you&#x27;re going for aesthetics and you want an organizer to blend with your decor, then this one is probably not the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/04/17&lt;br /&gt;Well, it has been a great 2 years and 3 months!  This organizer remained in my bathroom on the vanity and I used it daily.  The holder for makeup brushes didn&#x27;t hold up very well.  It popped out and the brushes would slide down to the bottom.  Overall, it has been good.  I stored all my necessities for my daily face/hair rituals.  The designer of this product said the &amp;#34;unit is not going to break&amp;#34; because they use the highest quality plastics and the &amp;#34;consumer&#x27;s perception of the world of plastic is limited.&amp;#34;  Well, I used it for what it was designed for.  I didn&#x27;t store canned goods in the the spinner or anything and the the plastic BROKE!  Hmmm, my perception seemed right on target from the onset. So, while I enjoyed the product, it should have lasted longer in my opinion, thus I am rating 3 stars!</li>
    <li> Functional - very large - not as sturdy as I thought it would be especially for the price. Is a good product but after using it 2 weeks I am selling it.</li>
    <li> Great for saving space in cabinets, especially for make-up and hair products. It fits and spins perfectly. I need three more words lol</li>
    <li> It looks crappy because of the plastic but it is very useful. It&#x27;s pretty coo.</li>
    <li> The space-saving and clutter-reducing idea of this organizer is just great, but I wish it could&#x27;ve been a little stronger and not that flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
    <li> Looks awesome works great !</li>
    <li> This item is very well made and designed. It has made organizing the sink in my bathroom very well and I have so much room now since I&#x27;ve been using this. What I like particularly about this is that it has dividers on the different teirs so that the items don&#x27;t go sliding or flopping from side to side but stay upright and in the perfect position. I highly recommend this project!</li>
    <li> The product is flimsy and was broken when I got it in the mail. It is nice once you get it filled up with your stuff and haven&#x27;t had any more problems so far. But kind of pricy for what I revived.</li>
    <li> Would have five stars if it wasn&#x27;t wobbly/uneven. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s designed that way for whatever reason or I just got a defective one, but I like it a lot. Stores quite a few things and keeps the bathroom counter from cluttering.</li>
    <li> This product costs far too much compared with the quality.  It performs it&#x27;s function well in terms of stacking and swivel, but it sure isn&#x27;t cute and it sure looks and feels cheap.  It is made of plastic which feels like the thick packaging of a child&#x27;s toy you are supposed to chuck into the recycle bin rather than keep.  It has organized my bathroom counter, but it&#x27;s an eyesore.  Less competition allows them to get away with these prices for about $5 worth of plastic assembled into a product.</li>
    <li> this thing is awesome. it totally decluttered the counter</li>
    <li> I love this it&#x27;s great I&#x27;m so organized with everything  my perfumes my face creams eyes makeup all separated and organized. Love it</li>
    <li> This item has really helped me organize my make up and my time getting ready.  Also helps with saving space.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Two words. FREAKING AWESOME! It has been a lifesaver in organzing my makeup and skicare and made it so much easier to find everything. I wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for what I needed. Would have given 5 stars but the brush holder insert is a cheap roll-together connecting type piece. I just put a big hair spray bottle in the hole meant for the brush holder.</li>
    <li> Love it. So convenient for all my beauty supplies and takes away all the clutter.</li>
    <li> nice storage for small spaces</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Fits all of her makeup and her brushes are easily stored in the middle compartment. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Unfortunately we have very little storage in our master bath, and I have stuff all over the counter that I use daily, hair products, skin products, medicine, etc.  I sometimes even take up my husbands side of the counter on occasion.  I have been looking for something to use on the counter to store my products and have had no luck, until I came across this!  It has done WONDERS for keeping my counters clean!  The reason I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars is that the sides of the turntable could be a little sturdier, they are quite thin.  However, they still do the job and that&#x27;s what matters.  I really like the fact that you can put tall stuff on the top like hairspray, I looked at a couple of other similar products and they were limiting on the height of product you could store.  It also has a center holder, you can use that for make up brushes, combs, or even your toothpaste and toothbrush.  I found that my round brush fit perfectly upside down in it so that is what I use it for.  I also put two small mugs on the top one holds my make up brushes and one holds my teasing combs and brush.  The turntable works well, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck or rub which was a concern.  This product has made a huge difference for me and my husband is much happier to have his side of the counter back!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I can fit so much on this!!!  I have it stuffed full!</li>
    <li> What can else can I say?!! It spins, minimizes clutter, and saves counter space....all while keeping all your things out where it&#x27;s visible and easily accessible. The only negative is...that I received it with a crack at the bottom, underneath where the spinner plate is. It&#x27;s likely because the packaging came with nothing but a plastic bag covering the organizer. No air packs, no foam pellets, no paper fillers, n.o.t.h.i.n.g! I paid quite a bit for shipping and do not wish to pay it again to return it. I can live with the minor crack so I will not be returning/exchanging it.</li>
    <li> I love this. Really helps to keep things more organized &amp; less cluttered since you can place things on the top &amp; bottom instead of all flat on desk. I like that it spins so I can see everything all around.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter seemed to have lost the top of her dresser to clutter.  This product solved the problem. She was so pleased to organize her life with this product.</li>
    <li> This product wouldn&#x27;t stay round the side kept coming out I gave it&lt;br /&gt;away because it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Omg I love these things i bought two this one and the biggest one and honestly my room became clutter free. It&#x27;s always those small things that add up on ur desk ir bathroom table that can make ur room feel &amp;#34;busy&amp;#34; or unorganized this helped me alot.  I would recommend to anyone for any room</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this organizer five stars was because it&#x27;s cheaply made and looks it. I&#x27;d have rather paid more for something a little more attractive. But it certainly does what I need it to. Everything but everything fits on it. And I can see the top of my vanity again! I&#x27;d hoped to get a three tiered carousel, but I discovered that it would have been unmanageably tall (measure, measure, measure!) once it had products on top. Not only would I have needed a ladder to reach the items on the third tier, but it would have overwhelmed the vanity as well; the diameter was a couple of inches wider than this one. The side &amp;#34;barriers&amp;#34; on both levels keep the products from falling, and the bearings that allow it to swivel do the job; even though it isn&#x27;t a very smooth movement, it does what it needs to without difficulty. Overall, I&#x27;m very glad I have it.</li>
    <li> For someone that is overloaded with sink top or bureau counter clutter, this item will sort everything conveniently at your touch.</li>
    <li> I love the space-saving, clutter-reducing idea of this organizer, but it&#x27;s a little flimsy and doesn&#x27;t spin as smoothly as I would like. Still, it&#x27;s better than the jumble of unreachable items that used to be under my bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> I have prescription medications and other things I use everyday which I keep on a two tier turntable beside my bed.  However, each time I moved it, everything scattered and fell to the floor.  When I saw this organizer turntable and noticed it had sides, I thought it would be the perfect solution to keep everything in place.  However, I thought the sides looked like rigid plastic in the photo, but they were not.  Since it did not work for my purpose, I returned it.  The seller was very accomodating, and I had no problems when returning the item, so I would not hesitate purchasing from them again.&lt;br /&gt;  The solution that I finally settled on was simply to purchase a couple of 2\\&quot; deep cake pans in a size that would fit on my existing double turntable and put all my items inside the cake pans.  Nothing falls off anymore when I spin the turntable to look for an item.</li>
    <li> This should become a built in feature in all bathrooms.  It is such a smart storage solution especially for women&#x27;s products which are small tubes, pencils, and bottles.  No more fishing through the drawer every morning find my eye brow pencil.</li>
    <li> This saved my bathroom counter top from being a cluttered mess. It spins easily and holds a lot of items.</li>
    <li> This organizer has a large capacity and spins easily and smoothly, without snagging. It fits perfectly on the corner of my desk, which doubles as my makeup station. It keeps everything handy for applying makeup without being in the way while I work at my computer. Comes fully assembled.</li>
    <li> good for stuff, liked it</li>
    <li> Holds a TON of stuff.  Recommended!</li>
