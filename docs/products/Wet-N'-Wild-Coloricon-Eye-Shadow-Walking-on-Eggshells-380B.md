      <li>These are just as beautiful!</li>
      <li>At about $3.50 at the drugstore this will probably be one of the best purchases you ever made.</li>
      <li>THE BEST DRUGSTORE SHADOW I EVER USED</li>
      <li>I found out about this brand on Youtube and glad I did!!!  </li>
      <li>My favorite of the three pan trios!!!</li>
      <li>and I think it will look good on anyone!</li>
      <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re buttery,  they&#x27;re pigmented and they blend beautifully.  </li>
      <li>A great, inexpensive eye shadow set.  </li>
      <li>That being said, the colors still are very nice and put together well.</li>
      <li>This brand is impressive and this palate delivers everything I could ask, and more.</li>
      <li>but the quality is good.</li>
      <li>colors were gorgeous and with a swatch of&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good colors.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great place for beginners to start and learn more makeup techniques.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I know I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t prefer to use the sponge tip applicator that comes with the set, I prefer to use makeup brushes for an easier application, but for the price this is an amazing starter or understated eyeshadow palette.</li>
      <li>Some are amazing dupes for MAC shadows</li>
      <li>Amazing customer service.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest.  </li>
      <li>The eyeshadow has good color payoff and is easily blendable.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re nice :)</li>
      <li>These colors are so beautiful and so highly pigmented!</li>
      <li>This is a great eyeshadow trio that I go to when I need to be out the door quickly but still want to do a light eye makeup look.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Climate Zone palette and was really impressed with the pigmentation, texture, and lasting power of the eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>all, I really love this.</li>
      <li>and I really love the quality of the eye shadow.</li>
      <li>and I love the way these colors look on me.</li>
      <li>A cult favorite of many make-up artists.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome to see that, especially in makeup like eyeshadow</li>
      <li>I am glad that I am over that.  </li>
      <li>I think they are better quality than NYX shadows</li>
      <li>I love this pallet, and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m so glad I did bc</li>
      <li>texture that the top luxury brands share.</li>
      <li>i was also pleased with the fact that the seller emailed me saying thank you.</li>
      <li>The quality of this eye shadow trio is surprisingly awesome and really could compare to most high end lines.</li>
      <li>but if you use the right brush and a nice eye lid primer, you will be able to make this eye shadow work well.</li>
      <li>It came very quickly.</li>
      <li>gave this four stars instead of five because the eyeshadows are prone to shattering fairly easily.</li>
      <li>This little trio has been perfect!  </li>
      <li>The package came 2 days after I ordered it!(which is a huge bonus)</li>
      <li>This trio works perfectly for everyday looks.</li>
      <li>Great color palette and the colors last throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I useally put the browbone color (light cream color) all over, put the eyelid color</li>
      <li>Best eyeshadow for everyday!  </li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t know why so many ladies despies this awesome eyeshadow palette from wet n wild, but i happen to like this eyeshadow palette.</li>
      <li>They are smooth and super pigmented-</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the larger palette which is just gorgeous</li>
      <li>Sweet As</li>
      <li>haha, it just made that more pronounced.</li>
      <li>Since they is shimmer touch, they seldom clarifies, but since all of these 3 colors become cool eyes, they is good for time, such as summer!</li>
      <li>I am in love with this product and will most likely be buying it again.</li>
      <li>The colors are very pretty and pigmented.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite eye shadow pallet.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>this is just the most flattering eyeshadow trio for blue or green eyes, I absolutely love love love this product</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re more soft and flattering.</li>
      <li>I am completley pissed off right now.</li>
      <li>Wet n&#x27; Wild Color Icon shadows, whether they be in triplet or quadruplet, sextuplet or more are amazing shadows for the price.</li>
      <li>I tend to go for more natural looks, and not those natural looks you see in magazines that involve a full face of foundations and concealers.</li>
      <li>and yes it&#x27;s higher quality</li>
      <li>pay more for the same pigments?</li>
      <li>Was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I love my Urban Decay too</li>
      <li>I have similar colors in NYX and these are softer and more pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Exactly what was advertised.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply, the instructions are printed right on the shadows themselves, and the colors are almost universally flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is small enough to fit into the smallest pocket of my purse, and the price is great for the quality.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to try Wet N Wild products until I started to hear a lot of good things about their products.</li>
      <li>in all I recommend this to anyone searching for a true natural tone.</li>
      <li>The colors blend easily and last for a while.  </li>
      <li>Great everyday palette!!!</li>
      <li>so well I do not have to wear much.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t a whole heck of a difference between this and</li>
      <li>These three shadows are all I need to create really flattering day and</li>
      <li>I really have found some gems like this eye shadow palette.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>and it was packaged very well.</li>
      <li>got the product really fast</li>
      <li>This whole palette features MAC &amp;#</li>
      <li>This is smaller and more nude natural colors for day wear</li>
      <li>I would love to try this in the other shades.</li>
      <li>shadows themselves are very finely-milled and have that nice, almost slick &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Overall its a good alternative to more expensive eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>Love wet n wild shadows</li>
      <li>Love Wet N Wild brand.</li>
      <li>I love all the Wet N&#x27; Wild eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>just buy it already knowing that it&#x27;s decent stuff.</li>
      <li>Anyways,&lt;br /&gt;The package came tightly and safely wrapped.</li>
      <li>Goes with every outfit and skin tone - highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The colors are great for a everyday eye or can be used as staples with any other shadows you have.</li>
      <li>Very pigmented and natural looking.</li>
      <li>I like that it has a visual guide about how you can apply this eyeshadow on the back of the packaging, but it is versatile enough that you can create your own look if you want to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>, I see ALL of these only being able to be used on the brow bone, its very highlighted, and I only use a luster, its not so glittery, but just very highlighting, so if you know you can get away with highlights get this, or if you are like me, who doesnt have (and never did) have a flat eyelid</li>
      <li>I would recomend this to anyone who wants a good everyday trio pallette that is not to dark but gets noticed.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>I was looking for something simple and it was a bit more shimmery than I expected</li>
      <li>I also found the bottom color for the “eyelid” to be a lot more pink than I expected</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I heard about the quality of Wet n&#x27; Wild shadows from the Beauty Broadcast on Youtube.  I purchased the Climate Zone palette and was really impressed with the pigmentation, texture, and lasting power of the eyeshadows. Some are amazing dupes for MAC shadows I think they are better quality than NYX shadows (although I like those too).  These three shadows are supposed to be dupes (according to the Beauty Broadcast) for Shroom (lightest), Cork (mid), and Naked Lunch (bottom).  I have similar colors in NYX and these are softer and more pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give them a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest.  There isn&#x27;t a whole heck of a difference between this and Sweet As Candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we have the brow highlighter in a completely acceptable bone-ish colour,  the crease is a shimmery brown and the lid shade is a  pearly buff which reads like a very pale rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re buttery,  they&#x27;re pigmented and they blend beautifully.  Soooo....well,  there&#x27;s only so much you can do before you end up reviewing two palettes using the same terminology!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just buy it already knowing that it&#x27;s decent stuff.</li>
    <li> The package came 2 days after I ordered it!(which is a huge bonus) i was also pleased with the fact that the seller emailed me saying thank you. Amazing customer service. Anyways,&lt;br /&gt;The package came tightly and safely wrapped. It&#x27;s awesome to see that, especially in makeup like eyeshadow so the makeup doesn&#x27;t shatter or anything.&lt;br /&gt;The colors were gorgeous and with a swatch of&lt;br /&gt;My primer underneath stayed on for a long&lt;br /&gt;Time. Love it!</li>
    <li> Since they is shimmer touch, they seldom clarifies, but since all of these 3 colors become cool eyes, they is good for time, such as summer!</li>
    <li> The Wet &amp; Wild \\&quot;Walking on Eggshells\\&quot; palate is my go to for everyday looks.  I found out about this brand on Youtube and glad I did!!!  I bought mine for $2 on sale at Dollar General and have never regretted it.</li>
    <li> I give this 4 stars because the crease color (brown/middle color) is harder to blend in and the applicators that come with it are not very good but will do an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; job. I use elf brushes with it instead.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the colors go very well with each other and stay on all day with concealer or eye primer. I useally put the browbone color (light cream color) all over, put the eyelid color (pale shimmery pink color) on my eyelid. I dont like it use the brown color.&lt;br /&gt;I got the product really fast and it was packaged very well. I would recomend this to anyone who wants a good everyday trio pallette that is not to dark but gets noticed.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I really love this. I would love to try this in the other shades.</li>
    <li> Good colors. I use a eyelid primer, and this stuff stays all evening when I go out. No creasing, goes on dark as desired.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite eye shadow pallet.  I&#x27;ve had this since February and I use it at least 2 times a week and I&#x27;ve hardly put a dent in my.  Very pigmented and natural looking.</li>
    <li> I love this pallet, and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
    <li> This is an essential in my make up bag. These three shadows are all I need to create really flattering day and simple evening looks when I want to carry a small amount of products with me or for travel.</li>
    <li> Wet n&#x27; Wild Color Icon shadows, whether they be in triplet or quadruplet, sextuplet or more are amazing shadows for the price. Beauty bloggers and youtubers can&#x27;t get enough. This one, walking on eggshells, is among the most-recommended of the bunch. It is easy to apply, the instructions are printed right on the shadows themselves, and the colors are almost universally flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this little set three times, once for myself and twice for others who have complimented me on my eye shadow. It&#x27;s a great place for beginners to start and learn more makeup techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shadows themselves are very finely-milled and have that nice, almost slick &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; texture that the top luxury brands share. The colors are pigmented, but are not in-your-face-- they&#x27;re more soft and flattering. I don&#x27;t prefer to use the sponge tip applicator that comes with the set, I prefer to use makeup brushes for an easier application, but for the price this is an amazing starter or understated eyeshadow palette.</li>
    <li> The colors on this palette work well together. I was looking for something simple and it was a bit more shimmery than I expected but the quality is good. I also found the bottom color for the “eyelid” to be a lot more pink than I expected but it didn’t look as ridiculous as I’d imagined. Overall its a good alternative to more expensive eyeshadows. The colors also seem to last through the day.</li>
    <li> Great color palette and the colors last throughout the day. It looks like it should last a while, although I would never use the brushes that came with it. Get your own brushes as they are pretty bad.</li>
    <li> THE BEST DRUGSTORE SHADOW I EVER USED</li>
    <li> I tend to go for more natural looks, and not those natural looks you see in magazines that involve a full face of foundations and concealers. I use a simple black eyeliner, some shadow, and concealer on problem areas. That being said, this is basically the ONLY eyeshadow I use! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-stays put even without eye primer&lt;br /&gt;-vivid colors and no gritty texture&lt;br /&gt;-comes with a tiny little applicator&lt;br /&gt;-long lasting color, and long lasting package-I&#x27;ve had it for a year and there&#x27;s still quite a lot left!&lt;br /&gt;-has instructions on the back how to apply it perfectly&lt;br /&gt;-natural shades that complement any skin tone&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-on people who tend to have &amp;#34;oilier&amp;#34; eyelids, the colors may smudge by the end of the day, but it doesn&#x27;t look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I recommend this to anyone searching for a true natural tone. This brand is impressive and this palate delivers everything I could ask, and more. Plus, it&#x27;s only $6. Compare that to all those big name brands, and you&#x27;ve got yourself a deal.</li>
    <li> The pink is much more flesh-toned (at least for me) than I expected, and the brown for your crease is more tannish in person. That being said, the colors still are very nice and put together well. I was actually *COMPLIMENTED* on my eye shadow as I wore this! That&#x27;s never happened before! I use neutrals for work since I&#x27;m in more of a holistic profession, and these are neutral enough to wear and not look crazy.</li>
    <li> Best eyeshadow for everyday!  I&#x27;m a brunette with hazel eyes and I love the way these colors look on me.</li>
    <li> I have always been a little hesitant about using this brand.  I am glad that I am over that.  This little trio has been perfect!  I do not like to wear a lot of make up and since the colors hold so well I do not have to wear much.  I am in love with this product and will most likely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> A great, inexpensive eye shadow set.  The colors are neutral, and I think only the bottom shade (one marked eyelid) has a little bit of shimmer to it.  The colors blend easily and last for a while.  The shimmer is a soft shimmer, not a glitter, so it looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;  Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> this is just the most flattering eyeshadow trio for blue or green eyes, I absolutely love love love this product and I think it will look good on anyone!</li>
    <li> This is a great eyeshadow trio that I go to when I need to be out the door quickly but still want to do a light eye makeup look. It is small enough to fit into the smallest pocket of my purse, and the price is great for the quality. The eyeshadow has good color payoff and is easily blendable. I like that it has a visual guide about how you can apply this eyeshadow on the back of the packaging, but it is versatile enough that you can create your own look if you want to.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this four stars instead of five because the eyeshadows are prone to shattering fairly easily.</li>
    <li> I like it alot. Smaller than I thought it would be and the colors are sheer but they&#x27;re nice :)</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know why so many ladies despies this awesome eyeshadow palette from wet n wild, but i happen to like this eyeshadow palette.</li>
    <li> The quality of this eye shadow trio is surprisingly awesome and really could compare to most high end lines. The colors are great for a everyday eye or can be used as staples with any other shadows you have. I was hesitant to try Wet N Wild products until I started to hear a lot of good things about their products. Now I&#x27;m so glad I did bc I really have found some gems like this eye shadow palette.</li>
    <li> So I bought this because of glowing reviews on MUA and well I suppose this is something meant for younger girls, Im 28, often people think Im 22,23, anyways, I cant stand this palette because it excenuated my wrinkles on the corner of my eyes, like really really bad, I see ALL of these only being able to be used on the brow bone, its very highlighted, and I only use a luster, its not so glittery, but just very highlighting, so if you know you can get away with highlights get this, or if you are like me, who doesnt have (and never did) have a flat eyelid, mine is kinda crinkly haha, it just made that more pronounced.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was advertised. It came very quickly. The colors are very pretty and pigmented.</li>
    <li> This whole palette features MAC &amp;#34;equivalents&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;MAC Shroom&lt;br /&gt;MAC Cork&lt;br /&gt;MAC Naked Lunch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why pay more for the same pigments? These are just as beautiful!</li>
    <li> Smooth and pigmented,  but half the bottom came broken. Other than that I really like it</li>
    <li> My favorite of the three pan trios!!! Great everyday palette!!! Goes with every outfit and skin tone - highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These colors are so beautiful and so highly pigmented! If you are a lover of neutral shades, you need to get this. At about $3.50 at the drugstore this will probably be one of the best purchases you ever made. I know I love it!</li>
    <li> I am completley pissed off right now. I orded this about a MONTH ago. Finally comes after a month of waiting and whole thing is shattered. nothing in there. Weird that it was sealed so well but everything cracks. Also, they sent me hair barrets? Not like I can complain for recieving something extra but just suspicious that I got something I didnt order nor do I want. I am so pissed. I want a refund.</li>
    <li> Beatiful, creamy and pigmented shadows. A cult favorite of many make-up artists.</li>
    <li> Love wet n wild shadows but I can get it hella cheaper at drugstores</li>
    <li> Love Wet N Wild brand. I&#x27;ve been using the larger palette which is just gorgeous but I decided to throw this in my Amazon basket too. This is smaller and more nude natural colors for day wear and I really love the quality of the eye shadow. I love my Urban Decay too but it&#x27;s so so expensive and yes it&#x27;s higher quality but if you use the right brush and a nice eye lid primer, you will be able to make this eye shadow work well.</li>
    <li> I love all the Wet N&#x27; Wild eyeshadows. They are smooth and super pigmented- a little goes a long way! This trio works perfectly for everyday looks. I don&#x27;t have any problems with creasing, but I use it with an eyeshadow primer just in case. I love it and I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Was exactly what I needed.</li>
