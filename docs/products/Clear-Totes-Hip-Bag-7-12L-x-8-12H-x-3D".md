      <li>Price was really cheap as well..</li>
      <li>This bag would be a lot more useful with a longer strap.</li>

      <li>This bag is great for anyone who needs extra space to hold their keys, cigarets, wallet, medication, etc.</li>

      <li>Many however, will okay having a bag if the bag is clear.</li>
      <li>The bag itself is a good size, with more than enough space for: a large wallet, glasses, keys and even my daughters baby bottle.  </li>

      <li>So I got through the security line quickly.  </li>

      <li>well, very durable and light weighted...will do business real soon to order more for work</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as described!</li>
      <li>great bag just wish the strap was a little longer.</li>
      <li>Once again I love the fact that these bags are clear.</li>
      <li>The neasurements were completely off and on top of that</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I would purchase them again, but they have been useful.</li>
      <li>Nice bag zipper not stready brokr vCard on second day.</li>
      <li>Okay, I got this because of the new NFL rule with bringing certain bags in.</li>
      <li>The zipper could be better, and the strap could have been longer, but none the less, when it&#x27;s only used to bring into work, this bag is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall I love these bags</li>
      <li>The strap came apart at the seam the first time it was used.  </li>
      <li>The strap broke on the first day of using it.  </li>
      <li>This item was exactly what I was looking for, and it arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
      <li>but the zipper broke the first week.  </li>
      <li>First Aid Kit for road trips, by the pool, sporting events, etc.</li>
      <li>Zipper broke the first time I tried to zip this up.</li>
      <li>With two teens, everything needed for first aid or medicine cabinet never was where it should be.  </li>
      <li>Can group items together and be able to instantly see what each tote contains.  </li>
      <li>my own fault for not really checking the dimensions well.</li>
      <li>, what more could you possibly ask for?</li>
      <li>I usually get a good 6 months out of them before it starts to rip.</li>
      <li>While the strap is not long enough to fit cross-body (except for very small folks, I imagine), it does work perfectly as a shoulder bag, freeing my hands for holding my coffee &amp; badging into my workstation.  </li>
      <li>When the NFL changed their rules for bags for the 2013 season, I immediately started looking for something in between carrying a clutch and the large shoulder bag that they endorse.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I really recommend them.</li>
      <li>But when I&#x27;m only going to use it 8 times per year, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>Price was reasonable, but now it is in a bin in my daughters room.</li>
      <li>transaction very speedy..</li>
      <li>I paid $15 to get fast, this companies idea of fast is one week.  </li>
      <li>I truly did enjoy my bag when I took it on my last trip.</li>
      <li>I used this bag and it worked really well.  </li>
      <li>Not too big, fits easily in my locker at the end of the day &amp; not too little, the perfect size for a small brush, lip balm, hand sanitizer, etc.  </li>
      <li>I bought this bag for my daughter who is going to a football game and would have liked the strap to be able to be opened longer so that she could use it as a cross body bag...</li>
      <li>The plastic is a nice, heavy gauge &amp; so far, all the stitching is intact.  </li>
      <li>A decent bag for the cost.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for my mom , it was good , no issues getting into the Titans Game fast through security .</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I work in a high security building</li>
      <li>What I like most is that you can spot what you&#x27;re looking for instantly due to the clear plastic exterior.</li>
      <li>Zipper on top a little flimsy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly small, which is okay for certain things.</li>
      <li>Oversized wallet, diabetic supplies, keys, and a few more things.</li>
      <li>The quality of the plastic and zipper are fairly good; not the best quality but certainly not the worst.  </li>
      <li>The NFL adopted a new policy about bags.  </li>
      <li>The concept is nice, but the size makes it functional only for a small child.</li>
      <li>Had to have clear bag for work.  </li>
      <li>I have to use a clear bag at work</li>
      <li>They sent me a team clear bag</li>
      <li>This bag is clearly called a Hip Bag, which it is not.  </li>
      <li>strap was too short to fit over your chest, my zipper was broken on arrival, plastic is made of a cheap material DO NOT BUY</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t very durable and it is smaller than it looks.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have noted, it would be nice if the strap was a little bit longer, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
      <li>The company I worked for made us carry clear bags so instead of a regular purse.</li>
      <li>I bought this because where I work you can only have clear bags.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Had to have clear bag for work.  I paid $15 to get fast, this companies idea of fast is one week.  Did get a day earlier but the zipper broke the first week.  I am closing this bag with Velcro.  the picture of the bag makes it look like you could lengthen strap.  You can but not long enough.</li>
    <li> Great bag that serves its purpose. Not a lot of room though. Fits one drink and a small container or sandwhich ans chips.</li>
    <li> Was not long enough to use as a crossbody. And it did not last long.</li>
    <li> strap was too short to fit over your chest, my zipper was broken on arrival, plastic is made of a cheap material DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I work in a high security building it&#x27;s so easy, no more opening my purse to show then, just walk on by.. Love it!</li>
    <li> Once again I love the fact that these bags are clear. It makes finding things easy. They are well mad and very useful. I really recommend them.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a NFL game, (no regular purses allowed). the product did the trick of holding the phone, glasses, keys money etc. will never use again.</li>
    <li> great bag just wish the strap was a little longer. Can&#x27;t wear it across chest very easy.</li>
    <li> Most jobs that require security, require no bags. Many however, will okay having a bag if the bag is clear. This bag is great for anyone who needs extra space to hold their keys, cigarets, wallet, medication, etc. while they are on the job. This bag is unisex, and quite sturdy. The zipper could be better, and the strap could have been longer, but none the less, when it&#x27;s only used to bring into work, this bag is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping took a little while, so I highly suggest buying one now to have stored away. You never know when you may need one (pool, government buildings, parks).</li>
    <li> Too small not for an adult</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a graet bag for the price, just smaller than I wanted.  my own fault for not really checking the dimensions well. transaction very speedy..</li>
    <li> The bag itself is a good size, with more than enough space for: a large wallet, glasses, keys and even my daughters baby bottle.  The quality of the plastic and zipper are fairly good; not the best quality but certainly not the worst.  My only disappointment was the length of the strap.  This bag is clearly called a Hip Bag, which it is not.  You can see a buckle to slide the strap, but even slid open the bag strap barely went over and around my neck!  I could very tightly put it on my shoulder under my arm and I&#x27;m 5\\&quot;5\\&quot;. I have a sewing machine, black thread and I had a one inch nylon strap, so I cut one end off and sewed on the strap in 5 minutes total.  The strap is about 24 inches from end to end, so I added another 2 ft to it.  Great bag, but be prepared for a very short \\&quot;hand strap\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> this purse works great... it was shipped in a week. Its a little long for my taste  but workable.The zipper feels a little fragile but hold up.. The strap is adjustable so it works for holding it or on the shoulder too. i would suggest this.      update....maybe a month later my zipper broke...not sure how to fix that but id like one to last longer.......</li>
    <li> Okay, I got this because of the new NFL rule with bringing certain bags in. I like it, I mean you get what you pay for but it was totally useful. The only negative/warning I can give everyone is that the strap is very VERY short. I&#x27;m a petite gal, and it was sorta uncomfortable having the strap crossed over my body. Mostly used it on my shoulder, and will probably get another NFL bag (official). I guess, I can reuse for a makeup/travel bag later on.</li>
    <li> My wallet couldnt even fit in it. This was suppose to be my purse for work but it was barely big enough to hold a disposable camera. The neasurements were completely off and on top of that the strap broke day 2 of me using it. Bad quality. I would not recommend unless u just wanted to use it for one day, or give it to a little girl as a play purse.</li>
    <li> I chose this bag to carry my items through my visit at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.  We went to all four theme parks for 6 days.  The bag held up wonderfully.  It was big enough to hold what I needed it to (i.e. cell phone, small wallet, sunglasses, small camera).  Plus it was not big and bulky on the rides.  Security loved it because it was clear and they could just look at it without going through it.  So I got through the security line quickly.  I would recommend the bag.</li>
    <li> very bad quality i give it away very short hard to used</li>
    <li> zipper broke, almost immediately</li>
    <li> Sturdy plastic. Zipper on top a little flimsy. Strap to short for a adult to wear crossbody.</li>
    <li> Poorly made bag has a whole from not being sewed properly. Not happy with this bag thought the strap would be longer. And the envelope it came in had some kind of stuffing that got all over my house. Just not happy</li>
    <li> This item was exactly what I was looking for, and it arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> The zipper broke in two weeks of wearing it. It was not very useful for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> I truly did enjoy my bag when I took it on my last trip. It was convenient and I could see all of my stuff. Didn&#x27;t have to guess where my lipstick was. Thanks</li>
    <li> Arrived way before expected. However product didnot meet my needs according to description. In the process of getting rid of it. Strap is not long enough for the sling look I was going for it hangs like a necklace..just didnot work for me</li>
    <li> These are good for travel because you can see what you have at a glance. I gave some away and my friends also like them. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase them again, but they have been useful.</li>
    <li> With two teens, everything needed for first aid or medicine cabinet never was where it should be.  I bought the 3 different sizes of this line and now we&#x27;re organized.  What I like most is that you can spot what you&#x27;re looking for instantly due to the clear plastic exterior. The whole family appears to appreciate being able to go right to what is needed. I organized 1: all tanning lotions, sunscreens, lip balms, aloe vera gel, etc.;  2: Nyquil, Pepto Bismol, Neosporin, Tylenol, band-aids, thermometer, etc; 3: First Aid Kit for road trips, by the pool, sporting events, etc.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bag due to the new requirements for bags brought into NFL stadiums.  It was damaged when I received it but I unfortunately did not have time to exchange it prior to the start of the season.  A few of the seams were not stiched well and had holes between the zipper and the plastic part of the bag.  Rather than return it I opted to fix it myself.  I guess that&#x27;s what you get for a ~$9-10 product.</li>
    <li> The NFL adopted a new policy about bags.  They sent me a team clear bag but it is too big.  I used this bag and it worked really well.  I just wish the strap was a little longer to use as a purse.</li>
    <li> This bag would be a lot more useful with a longer strap. But for use as a temporary work purse, it worked well.</li>
    <li> When the NFL changed their rules for bags for the 2013 season, I immediately started looking for something in between carrying a clutch and the large shoulder bag that they endorse. This bag is perfect. Is it indestructible? No. But when I&#x27;m only going to use it 8 times per year, it&#x27;s fantastic. I highly recommend. As other reviewers have noted, it would be nice if the strap was a little bit longer, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for my daughter who is going to a football game and would have liked the strap to be able to be opened longer so that she could use it as a cross body bag...it is slighter short for that!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom , it was good , no issues getting into the Titans Game fast through security .</li>
    <li> very pleased with quality</li>
    <li> The bag was a gift, so I didn&#x27;t use it immediately. I took it to the event it was purchased for and it fell apart (before even being used!)...the zipper split. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> This bag was perfect for work. The company I worked for made us carry clear bags so instead of a regular purse. I&#x27;m not with that company anymore but I still use the bag, it&#x27;s a great travel bag for cosmetics, medications, personal care supplies. It also works out great for my 4 yr. old grand-daughter to carry small supplies (crayons,pencils small tablet) with us when we are travelling. Great size &amp; quality and a great price too, what more could you possibly ask for? I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love using these for traveling.  Can group items together and be able to instantly see what each tote contains.  I use them for both items for me, and for grandkids toys for use on car trips.</li>
    <li> Needed this for a government restricted area thing - where you need clear bags to see items - worked well for cell phone/camera/chapstick - it&#x27;s not way large - but great for our purposes!</li>
    <li> In regards to this purchase, I received Great Customer Service and Super Fast Delivery! Product was exactly as described! 100% Satisfaction! 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> The concept is nice, but the size makes it functional only for a small child. I can&#x27;t come up with a use for it. Price was reasonable, but now it is in a bin in my daughters room.</li>
    <li> I love this bag.  While the strap is not long enough to fit cross-body (except for very small folks, I imagine), it does work perfectly as a shoulder bag, freeing my hands for holding my coffee &amp; badging into my workstation.  Not too big, fits easily in my locker at the end of the day &amp; not too little, the perfect size for a small brush, lip balm, hand sanitizer, etc.  The plastic is a nice, heavy gauge &amp; so far, all the stitching is intact.  My co-workers are always asking where I got it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for taking to an amusement park.....water proof...and you can see what your looking for...why ruin an expensive leather bag.</li>
    <li> Thought it was bigger.</li>
    <li> A decent bag for the cost.  It wasn&#x27;t very durable and it is smaller than it looks.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money I paid at all. The strap broke on the first day of using it.  Required a star rating. I gave (1), because it was required.  They should give options of negative star ratings.</li>
    <li> i use this for work purpose ...work well, very durable and light weighted...will do business real soon to order more for work</li>
    <li> I bought this because where I work you can only have clear bags. It&#x27;s a perfect size for my stuff.. Price was really cheap as well..</li>
    <li> if the strap can only be longer and detachable then that would be awesome! I can go in and out of the employee entrance... I bought the large carry tote so this hip bag tote can fit... and it fits perfectly... I hate clutter in my bag....</li>
    <li> Can fit my wallet, phone, makeup bag, and keys very nicely. Doesnt fit like a across the body bag but more hangs off one shoulder</li>
    <li> The bag ended up being slightly smaller than I needed for the specific purpose I bought it.  (To take a few incidentals to the gym with me.)&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a good quality &amp; I&#x27;m trying to make it work.</li>
    <li> I guess the saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; is true. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this bag. It&#x27;s fairly small, which is okay for certain things. The strap is too short and it hurt my neck a little. It came with a broken zipper and the plastic wouldn&#x27;t stretch to where it was suppose to. it kept caving in. Do not buy this product. It is poorly made and isn&#x27;t big enough for any decent use.</li>
    <li> I have to use a clear bag at work and I love these ones! I can fit everything I need into it, which is a lot. Oversized wallet, diabetic supplies, keys, and a few more things. I wish they lasted a bit longer. I usually get a good 6 months out of them before it starts to rip. But it&#x27;s to be expected since I use it everyday and it&#x27;s stuffed full. Overall I love these bags</li>
    <li> I purchased this bag for work.  The strap came apart at the seam the first time it was used.  The zipper is still in place.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too small it&#x27;s not as big as it looks.</li>
    <li> I ts too small,I guess I&#x27;m not good with measurement. I was going to use it for work. I thought when u adjust the strap it will be long enough so it can go across your body. I guess I can use it for lunch bag.</li>
    <li> I thought the quality would be better. I don&#x27;t feel it will last long for my purposes.</li>
    <li> My strap popped I put a water and small bottle of soda in it. I still use it but I put it inside another bag</li>
    <li> Nice bag zipper not stready brokr vCard on second day. Bag was still useable though</li>
    <li> Zipper broke the first time I tried to zip this up.</li>
    <li> GOOD FOR GOING TO SPORTS OR CONCERTS&lt;br /&gt;THEY DON&#x27;T HAVE TO LOOK IN YOUR HAND BAG AND OPEN IT UP AT THE GATE.</li>
    <li> needed for work. reasonably priced.</li>
