<li> Stiff, sheds bristles.</li>
<li> It is thicker than brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
<li> A little thin</li>

    <li> This lipstick brush is &#x27;just&#x27; what I was looking for!  This bristles are sturdy but just enough to draw a fine outline, soft enough for lips.</li>
    <li> perfect for carrying in purse. this retractible brush has a safeguard to protect accidental seperation of cover from brush. it remains retracted until cover is placed on other end as it forces brush forward for use.</li>

    <li> I find it a little too flexible otherwise it is just fine.</li>

    <li> Got this for my elderly mother, who cannot apply lipstick without one. She said it&#x27;s easy to hold, the bristles are very fine and soft. Don&#x27;t get one that&#x27;s not retractable unless you like messy.</li>

    <li> This lip brush has a cover. You remove the cover, turn it around and put it on the other end. By putting it on the other end the brush tip comes out. If you lose the cover you can&#x27;t use the brush. Be careful to keep track of the top cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is soft and has a tapered tip. It is thicker than brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past. It is a good balance of stiffness with suppleness.</li>
