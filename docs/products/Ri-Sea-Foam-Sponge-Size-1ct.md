### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>What a joy in taking a shower!</li>
      <li>The  best  price  I  </li>
      <li>The sponge is wonderful!</li>
      <li>This is probably the best synthetic sponge I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly sturdy and makes a lot of suds!</li>
      <li>However, her dog chewed it up before she got home— Her dog loved it!</li>
      <li>The product is working out great for my daughter and myself.</li>
      <li>Great sponge in my opinion</li>
      <li>But it is a good synthetic sponge.</li>
      <li>GOOD luck.</li>
      <li>Bar Soap or Bath Gel lathers nicely.</li>
      <li>I liked them better than the &amp;#34;mesh-poufs.</li>
      <li>I love these sponges.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better for washing a car than my body.</li>
      <li>Like, if it were a rectangular shape it would somehow be better suited for shower royalty?</li>
      <li>I could have bought so many more frivolous Amazon impulse buys with that</li>
      <li>And don’t for a minute let the description imply that the oval shape somehow detracts from the extravagance of this sponge, “Features an oval-shape to fit your hand better but still retains that luxurious feel in the bath.”</li>
      <li>They are very nice to my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Product is fine</li>
      <li>like it because it suds up nicely, and it&#x27;s got a gentle feel to it.  </li>
      <li>As far as sponges go, this one is nice to bath with, and I bought several&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first time I tried the sponge, I was immediately surprised and impressed at how much it lathered with the normal amount of body wash</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t fall apart, lasts long, and feels good on the body.</li>
      <li>Was hoping for something more absorbant and natural feeling.</li>
      <li>You’re damn right</li>
      <li>This sponge in particular is as smooth as can be.</li>
      <li>came across these for a great price, and the only knock on them seemed to be that they were synthetic, instead of the real deal, formerly alive sea creature.</li>
      <li>Item exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>First of all this is a synthetic sponge.</li>
      <li>Do not hold much water either.</li>
      <li>I really like these sponges.  </li>
      <li>Like, too much.</li>
      <li>The sponge is firm but soft and feels good against the skin.</li>
      <li>good value..a lil smaller than I expected</li>
      <li>But, no one wants to actively GET OUT of a soothing, warm shower — you only do it because you find yourself at a point where you literally have nothing left to clean and</li>
      <li>, I would highly recommend it if you&#x27;re seeking a sponge which</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them for a spa like feeling.</li>
      <li>Cheap material and rough.</li>
      <li>I have only recently been introduced to the use of a sponge while showering, and it fantastic.</li>
      <li>Now you have an excuse — you’re just trying to keep things sanitary and fresh by “resetting” your sponge before you get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t be ripped off with this and buy the exact same thing from Wallmat for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>It was so soft, I hesitated even putting it in my butt in fear of hurting its feelings</li>
      <li>These things cannot be natural sponges, as the \\&quot;sea</li>
      <li>are  really  soft  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After I started my routine, I was awestruck at how incredibly soft it was on my skin.</li>
      <li>I had one of these for a long time and just today replaced it with exactly the same one.</li>
      <li>I’ll assure you when you use this sponge, you’ll feel like nothing less than a smooth-skinned, fresh smelling shower Sheik.</li>
      <li>I think this is because the large pores on the sponge are throughout the entire sponge, unlike other sponges of this type that just have the large pores on the outside.</li>
      <li>Apparently 3 came in the box?</li>
      <li>if it’s not painfully obvious at this point, I am more than a little fond of this little synthetic squeezebox.</li>

<li> They are soft and don&#x27;t shed like the previous sponge I was using.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money and get a natural wool sponge.</li>

<li> The only complaint was the slow delivery time (about 2 weeks).</li>
<li> Some of the things I wash out of the crevices of my body are too grotesque to subject any organism to, I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re dead and never even had a brain or central nervous system.</li>
<li> Needless to say, every single one of these sucked, and lasted less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> you either know you’re going to be late to an appointment or are just mindfully jacking up your utility bill.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a tad inconvenient in that I have to order them rather than just run out to a chain-store and pick some up, but if you do that they will Not be the same as these.</li>
<li> Seriously, I should try to find those.</li>
<li> They are VERY rough and scratch badly, even when saturated with soap and water.</li>
<li> Definitely terrible sponges.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Surprisingly sturdy and makes a lot of suds! I like it!</li>
    <li> The actual item is not like the photo. It&#x27;s better for washing a car than my body.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best synthetic sponge I&#x27;ve used. It also seems to dry quicker than other sponges of this type. I think this is because the large pores on the sponge are throughout the entire sponge, unlike other sponges of this type that just have the large pores on the outside.</li>
    <li> These things cannot be natural sponges, as the \\&quot;sea foam\\&quot; name seems to suggest. They are VERY rough and scratch badly, even when saturated with soap and water. Do not hold much water either. Definitely terrible sponges. I would not even wash my car with these! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money and get a natural wool sponge.</li>
    <li> The product does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Before trying this sponge, I would use your garden-variety plastic, unravel-in-your-hand-like-your-first-marriage-and-then-leave-you-stuck-in-the-shower-at-the-worst-moment-trying-to-put-it-back-together-with-shampoo-in-your-eyes-and-now-you&#x27;re-swearing-and-flailing-around-naked-in-the-shower-and-about-to-slip-then-grab-the-shower-curtain-for-stability-but-collapse-halfway-out-of-your-shower-wrapped-in-the-curtain-like-an-angry-half-dirty-burrito mesh ball. Needless to say, every single one of these sucked, and lasted less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across these for a great price, and the only knock on them seemed to be that they were synthetic, instead of the real deal, formerly alive sea creature. I thought, what the hell? All of my other bathing materials have been synthetic — as long as it can wash the day&#x27;s thin layer of sludge off my pale skin in a lathering and lasting way, we&#x27;ll be good. Besides, I&#x27;ve seen Spongebob, I kinda like that dude. Some of the things I wash out of the crevices of my body are too grotesque to subject any organism to, I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re dead and never even had a brain or central nervous system. But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried the sponge, I was immediately surprised and impressed at how much it lathered with the normal amount of body wash I was accustomed to. Like, too much. WTH. Why have I wasted so much body wash in the past when it takes about half the amount using this sponge?! I could have bought so many more frivolous Amazon impulse buys with that money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I started my routine, I was awestruck at how incredibly soft it was on my skin. Running it over my arms and shoulders, it felt like a silk cheese wheel from the gods. It was so soft, I hesitated even putting it in my butt in fear of hurting its feelings (I eventually overcame this fear).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the longevity. I bought this monnnnths ago. Apparently 3 came in the box? I literally forgot that happened. I wonder where I put theothers. Seriously, I should try to find those. in other words, one lasts for a hell of a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you’re slightly OCD like me, you try to squeeze every last bit of soap out of the sponge when you’re done. GOOD luck. I’ve counted at least 24 squeezes before I had to give up on numerous occasions. But, no one wants to actively GET OUT of a soothing, warm shower — you only do it because you find yourself at a point where you literally have nothing left to clean and you either know you’re going to be late to an appointment or are just mindfully jacking up your utility bill. Now you have an excuse — you’re just trying to keep things sanitary and fresh by “resetting” your sponge before you get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if it’s not painfully obvious at this point, I am more than a little fond of this little synthetic squeezebox. And don’t for a minute let the description imply that the oval shape somehow detracts from the extravagance of this sponge, “Features an oval-shape to fit your hand better but still retains that luxurious feel in the bath.” You’re damn right it “still retains that luxurious feel.” Like, if it were a rectangular shape it would somehow be better suited for shower royalty? I’ll assure you when you use this sponge, you’ll feel like nothing less than a smooth-skinned, fresh smelling shower Sheik. Now go find $6 to splurge on this, your highness.</li>
    <li> The product is working out great for my daughter and myself. We use them every day when we take our showers.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it was similar to an item I found in a local supermarket a while back, and they never seemed to carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it suds up nicely, and it&#x27;s got a gentle feel to it.  As far as sponges go, this one is nice to bath with, and I bought several&lt;br /&gt;which will probably last over the next few years.  Great sponge in my opinion, I would highly recommend it if you&#x27;re seeking a sponge which&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t fall apart, lasts long, and feels good on the body.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described.  Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Cheap material and rough. Was hoping for something more absorbant and natural feeling.</li>
    <li> I really like these sponges.  They are soft and don&#x27;t shed like the previous sponge I was using. I would highly recommend them for a spa like feeling.</li>
    <li> I bought a 3 pack and shared one sponge with my daughter. However, her dog chewed it up before she got home— Her dog loved it! The sponge is firm but soft and feels good against the skin. Bar Soap or Bath Gel lathers nicely. The only complaint was the slow delivery time (about 2 weeks). There was a snow storm in the North East and I figure this was the reason for delay. Allow plenty of delivery time.</li>
    <li> I tried these out a few years ago. I liked them better than the &amp;#34;mesh-poufs. I&#x27;ve been using them ever since. It&#x27;s a tad inconvenient in that I have to order them rather than just run out to a chain-store and pick some up, but if you do that they will Not be the same as these. I try to order before I run out but, I&#x27;m on a&lt;br /&gt;fixed-income and sometimes it&#x27;s not as convenient as it used to be. Try it, if you don&#x27;t like them blame&lt;br /&gt;me and use them  for something else.</li>
    <li> The sponge is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges. They are very nice to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The  best  price  I  could  fine!!&lt;br /&gt;They  are  really  soft  but  still  allows you  to feel  scrubed.</li>
    <li> Product is fine but I thought it might be a little larger.</li>
    <li> good value..a lil smaller than I expected..they seem to last a long time..</li>
    <li> Thier a sponge what can I say.</li>
    <li> I have only recently been introduced to the use of a sponge while showering, and it fantastic. This sponge in particular is as smooth as can be. What a joy in taking a shower!</li>
    <li> First of all this is a synthetic sponge. But it is a good synthetic sponge. I had one of these for a long time and just today replaced it with exactly the same one. Which I bought from Wallmat for $1.20. So don&#x27;t be ripped off with this and buy the exact same thing from Wallmat for a fraction of the price.</li>
