    <li> This is perfect for all products used to dampen brushes appropriately. Whether acrylic liquid or 99% alcohol used for gels, there is no problem with this dish.</li>
    <li> I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT IT WAS SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT, BUT ONCE I USED IT, I LOVE IT. THE SMALL SIZE ACTUALLY HELPS TO KEEP FROM USING TOO MUCH PRODUCT. WHETHER IT BE ALCOHOL OR CLEANSER OR ACETONE. THE LID GOES ON JUST RIGHT AND IT WAS EVEN KNOCKED OFF THE TABLE BY ACCIDENT AND HIT OUR TILE FLOOR BUT DIDNT BREAK OR SHATTER (PHEW!!). I WILL KEEP IT FURTHER BACK FROM NOW ON BUT I AM HAPPY WITH IT AND WOULD BUY MORE IF NEEDED</li>
    <li> Handy little dish with a stainless steel cover lid.  Very versatile. Keeps fine powders from blowing out in a well-ventilated area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I received my item thank you!</li>
    <li> What you see in the picture is what you get. They are perfect for putting alcohol in for gel polish clean up to remove gel from around your nail or acetone for regular polish, the lids help to keep the product from evaporating while doing your mani or pedi, easy to pore what you don&#x27;t use back in the bottle. They are not for storage. I brought 3, I use two when doing my mani n pedi&#x27;s one for my alcohol, one for my acetone when doing my pedi n I use the 3rd to soak my electric file bits in to keep clean n sterile. It&#x27;s important to keep all your files n bits sterile and clean even if you are the only one using them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would def recommend :-)</li>
    <li> Received broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CO</li>
    <li> Small, but perfect for its job. If you&#x27;re looking for a huge dish, this is the wrong one for you.</li>
    <li> This is perfect size if you do your own nails.  Does not waste acetone.  Perfect size for dipping brush or dipping an occasional nail</li>
    <li> they serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> Love this. perfect size and the lid fits wonderfully. I know I will get a lot of use from this product. It will help cut down on product use and evaporation and odor control in my tiny work space.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday and I love it! With the lid, I can store acetone in it without having to pour back and forth between bottle and dish! No product waste and saves my hands spills! And it&#x27;s small so I can store it with my nail polishes and brushes! It&#x27;s cute too! LOL!</li>
    <li> This dappen dish is small and holds the right amount of alcohol so that I can clean a brush to keep soak-off-gel polish cleaned up around my cuticles until I&#x27;m finished. Or if I am using gel, clean up that, too. I can hold the brush flags over the holes in the alcohol pump, and squeeze it, but every so often I miss a hole, and a jet of rubbing alcohol squirts out--perhaps hitting the dog! This dappen dish on the table is much handier, and very little evaporates, unlike the great deal that does from an open dish or pump bottle.</li>
    <li> This dappen is great for cleaning up my nails. It&#x27;s a perfect size. Oh! and I like that it has a lid. I ordered two so I have an extra one.</li>
    <li> Exactly like described but the lid isn&#x27;t secure what so ever</li>
    <li> Mines was $1.25 at our local beauty supply store, you can also purchase this product on ebay from BeautyHeadquarters . this cute little glass container is very convenient when dealing with chemicals such as the monomer liquid and polymer powder. It is a good use for preventing any toxic smells from the chemicals. I think the price on amazon is a bit much, but if you don&#x27;t mind spending a few dollars then be my guest.</li>
    <li> The dish was excellent and as represented in the description and as pictured was accurate.  I can recommend this small dish highly.</li>
    <li> Received it today.  Not much to say about a Dappen dish, but it&#x27;s a good one and the lid fits well.</li>
    <li> Great! So cute. I&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.</li>
    <li> Bought three. Prefect size for several little jobs. Love them.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. great product.</li>
