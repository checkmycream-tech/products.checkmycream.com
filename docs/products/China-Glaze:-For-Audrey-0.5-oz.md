<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just to clear any confusion, you only get one bottle when you order this, even though the picture and the description implies that you get a &#x27;6 pc counter display&#x27;. It would have been absolutely crazy for them to sell 6 bottles for such a cheap price but I admit that a part of me was still kind of hoping to receive 6 bottles when my package arrived :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was pretty excited when I received my bottle. The bottle itself is pretty nice quality and the color is BEAUTIFUL. I was searching for a kind of robin&#x27;s egg type of blue and this color is just that with a hint of green. I wasnt sure what Tiffany blue looks like, so I looked it up and it looks exactly like that lol. I found that one coat was too streaky for me, but that may have more to do with my technique. It looks absolutely perfect with two coats though :]</li>
    <li> I will probably never get tired of this color. Very sophisticated and light without being too pastel. Formula and coverage were both great--the usual 2 coats were all it took. The color is almost exactly Tiffany blue. I think this would be flattering on many different skin tones. It looks classy and pretty by itself, but I think it also provides a nice canvas for maybe some white or black nail stamping in a simple design.</li>
    <li> I ordered this color and I didn&#x27;t know that it is exactly the same shade and brand of another product on Amazon. Any way, it is just perfect that i ordered 5 of them and intended to give them as gifts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, especially not for nail polish but wow this shade is SO BEAUTIFUL. Perfect for Spring/Summer, it&#x27;s a very unique shade of Tiffany blue. The formula was great. I recommend this for all nail polish enthusiasts. Thanks \\&quot;For Audrey\\&quot; and thanks China Glaze. Really great brand.</li>
    <li> By the description, I was expecting 6 polishes with a counter display for my store!  I received one bottle with no counter display.  The description said-&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;China Glaze &#x27;Something Blue&#x27; 6pc Counter Display, nail polish set features a limited edition \\&quot;For Audrey\\&quot; Tiffany inspired turquoise creme nail lacquer. This also makes a luxurious counter display.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;NOT True.</li>
    <li> Great transaction. Item came before the alloted time frame and packaged well! Love the color! Get compliments everyday!</li>
    <li> Beautiful Blue...&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention I love this brand as well great polish!!!</li>
    <li> I had this color on my wishlist for awhile. But, by chance I was at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply &amp; they had a 2x$10 sale &amp; I picked this up. I haven&#x27;t worn it yet, so I can&#x27;t say how long it will last before chipping, but the color is as lovely as shown here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this shade of robin egg blue, it&#x27;s lovely and very flexible without seeming too \\&quot;odd\\&quot; (I tend not to really like blue nail polish, but I love this).  It&#x27;s flattering on a lot of skin tones, something I have issues with sometimes but again, it&#x27;s lovely.  There need to be more creamy colors like this :D    At first I was a bit hesitant about the formula as it was very streaky but with three coats it looked great.  It keeps up really well too, I&#x27;ve had mine on for quite a while now without a single chip.      Awesome color, I can see why it&#x27;s so popular :)</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as described and in great condition. The transaction was simple and easy, and delivery time was great. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I ordered a bottle of \\&quot;For Audrey\\&quot; for my younger sister&#x27;s birthday not too long ago. The product came exactly when it said it would however not only did the bottle not come in any form of formal packaging but i&#x27;m 98% positive it was used. There was no seal and the polish was incredibly thick and gross. She literally used the color once and threw it away. I was so upset. Never purchase from this seller, I certainly won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> As a huge Audrey Hepburn fan, I knew that this color was a must-have for my nail polish collection. Not only is it a beautiful color (it really is a true Tiffany blue), but I was also surprised by how opaque it is. I normally have to do two coats of nail polish to get a good finish, but one coat was perfectly sufficient with this color. Being a loyal fan of OPI, I had never tried China Glaze before, but after having such a positive experience with this product, I very well may purchase from them again. In short, I highly recommend this nail polish to anyone.</li>
    <li> For Audrey is a very pretty blue color.  I am giving it 4 stars because I am not really a fan of blue nails.  Everyone compares it to Tiffany &amp; Co.  I&#x27;ve never owned anything from Tiffany &amp; Co., so this is as close as I&#x27;ll get.  If you love blue nail polish, you can&#x27;t go wrong with For Audrey.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a color that matches the Tiffany bag this is it! The color is vibrant and long lasting. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have a bottle of this and its really fun, its a great color for spring or summer and its a decent price. I almost only use professional brands and China Glaze is one of my favorite brands- theres only a few of there colors that I don&#x27;t like because some don&#x27;t stay on as well as others. I get lots of compliments on this color and its good nail polish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few blue polishes before and the bottle looks great but they look horrible on your nails and I eventually give them away or throw them away.  I was in a risky mood, apparently and went with the descriptions by people and bought this and everyone was right - it is a perfect Tiffany Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!  First of all, this was my first time ever trying China Glaze polish - bought a few bottles in this order in different colors-For Audrey, Recycle, Rainbow.  The creme colors like this one and recycle are absolutely amazing.  I have used the cheapest $1 bottles of polish, Revlon-drugstore/middle of the road, Zoya, up to OPI&#x27;s DS at $12.50 and was shocked how much better China Glaze (cremes) is better than anything I have ever tried before - EVER. I do my own nails, haven&#x27;t had a professional manicure in 7 years-since the price has skyrocketed where I live, never heard of China Glaze, and for $3.99/4.99 was skeptical - but could get so many more colors for my money, so I took the risk. It is the perfect thickness so you can use only 1 or 2 coats, depending on your preference, has a nice size quality brush, dries nicely and quickly, no streaking, no lifting of the color on the second coat (since I never wait until the first coat dries).  When it dries, it is unbelievably glossy - looks wet for a week.  I was afraid to touch anything for 3 hours on my first china Glaze manicure (which was Recycle)-because it looked WET! For Audrey is the same - STUNNING, really stunning. I finally was sure it was dry and realized days later, it really stays looking like the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the color, it doesn&#x27;t look like grade school blue or baby shower blue or trendy but tacky, or \\&quot;I wish I was in high school\\&quot;.  It could be worn with your most casual clothes-sweats, jeans, or dressy-casual, or sundresses -too blue for professional/work wear/corporate wear or for formal occasions (in my opinion)but still classy and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use a top coat because it really wasn&#x27;t needed but about four days into the polish, I painted over it with China Glaze Recycle (a beautiful glossy medium gray) which changed it a little to have a nice gray with blue tint, another beautiful manicure - that lasted a week.It looked beautiful as a totally different look. Everytime I have used my China Glaze polishes, I have removed the polish before the tips even started showing wear - no chipping, no wearing, no changes from day 1.  I have not had to re-polish due to wear even once, each time, it was solely for the purpose of changing the color. So far, they have lasted at least 6 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it can be worn in so many ways and be classy.  I would bet you could use a matte top coat to change it from glossy to matte if you wanted or use a no-bling glitter top coat (OPI Glitter bit of music is one I tried and loved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who can only wear certain colors:&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is medium/slightly tan, medium brown hair, and nails are usually medium to short, always trying to get them to grow long, strong and healthy, with only intermittent luck.  My For Audrey manicures were with medium nails -thought they are usually short/medium but after having them polished for a couple weeks, they were a nice solid medium length, getting close to long.  I don&#x27;t know if the polish kept them healthy enough to grow or not, but they have not broken since I started using the polish in this order (which had a couple OPI and a ZOYA).  Keeping them polished at all can be helpful so it may have nothing to do with the China Glaze brand. Because of health reasons, I can&#x27;t keep them polished as much as I would like, but it&#x27;s a goal for the new year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the seller - NailEtc., they were quick, got the order here by Christmas, even though it wasn&#x27;t likely to get here in time, well packaged, and good prices for the polish itself.  HOWEVER, the shipping is outrageous.  It is better than a number of other nail polish sellers on Amazon (some charge $2-4 per bottle, no matter how many you get) but it&#x27;s not worth the cheap prices if you don&#x27;t get multiple bottles-but not too many.  Only a bottle or two and you pay the same or more for each bottle than a regular priced seller - too many bottles and the shipping price jumps WAY up.  I say \\&quot;bottles\\&quot; but it is based on the amount of money you spend, not number of bottles so if you get a few expensive items, it may be a smaller package and weigh less, and technically cost much less to ship, but you actually get charged much more to ship.  BE CAREFUL, and check the shipping prices before clicking to purchase. But if you aren&#x27;t concerned with pinching pennies, they are a terrific seller.how many you get) but it&#x27;s not worth the cheap prices if you don&#x27;t get multiple bottles-but not too many.

    <li> I came across this when I was at my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply a year or so ago and didn&#x27;t realize it was such a popular color. To be honest I picked it up because my best friend&#x27;s name is Audrey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice however that it was the same shade as a Tiffany &amp; Co box (based on pictures I&#x27;ve seen) and it matches the cover for \\&quot;Sunday&#x27;s at Tiffany&#x27;s\\&quot; (the book).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color itself is gorgeous. It&#x27;s an eye catching color that doesn&#x27;t stand out too much. Perfect for Spring and Summer. I&#x27;m a big fan of China Glaze&#x27;s formula, it dries quickly and you only need two coats to get it&#x27;s true color that you see in it&#x27;s bottle.</li>
    <li> the quality is amazing, and the color is classy.&lt;br /&gt;i would never wear any other shade of blue nail polish , i usually like light colors, pink etc...&lt;br /&gt;but this one is absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  It goes on smooth and has some staying power.  I generally get about 12hours without chips in polish and I got about 36 with this polish.  I originally wanted the Chanel color similar to this but got it as an alternative since it was sold out and am EXTREMELY happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I normally buy only OPI nail polish, but I&#x27;m sold on China Glaze now.  Not only is this color fabulous, but it dries quickly and goes on thick and smooth.  I used 2 coats, and I&#x27;m very happy with the result!</li>
    <li> Color is completely off. not anywhere near tiffany blue</li>
    <li> Just like the Tiffany&#x27;s box color. Really nice color. I did need to use two coats to achieve desired coverage though. Really great addition to your nail polish collection nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a bright, Tiffany blue. This was pretty disappointing. It looks VERY close to Aquadelic by CG. The formula is good though. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore For Audrey. I wanted the perfect shade to show off my engagement ring and it was perfect. I added an accent nail in Essie&#x27;s Beyond Cozy and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Beautiful color exactly what I expected it to be ...</li>
    <li> Love the color and the formula, hate the brush... The brush is very thin and it takes some patience to get the application even... Maybe it&#x27;s the same with all China Glaze polishes?    Did some konading with white on top and a friend said \\&quot;Wow, you&#x27;re nails look like a Tiffany&#x27;s box\\&quot; &#x3D;) So the effort is well worth it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Quality product, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Product was received on time.  It is great color closets to Tiffany blue.  Color does when  photographed appear to be a different color.  But still a great color.</li>
    <li> love the color and china glaze always makes the best polish, you&#x27;ll love this color it&#x27;s amazing!! i love it</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this shade forever since I saw it advertised in my InStyle magazine.  I could never find it anywhere and I had almost given up.  It has been over a year that I have been searching for it.  Finally Finally on Amazon!  I ordered 4 bottles.  I cannot wait until I receive it and put it on my toes.  Thank you thank you Amazon.com!!!  My search is finally over.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Tiffany&#x27;s blue, and this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it is truer to Tiffany&#x27;s blue than Essie tried it to be. This nail polish is great for anytime of the year. I also got it in the time that was said so I could use it right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for Tiffany&#x27;s blue, then here it is!</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for turquoise polish and this is it.  China Glaze has created a wonderful shade that is perfect salute to Audrey, Tiffany&#x27;s and the Pantone color of the year 2010:  turquoise!</li>
    <li> This color has always been out of stock at my local beauty store, and I&#x27;m so happy I found this online!  Shipping was fast, I ordered Saturday night and its was at my house by Wednesday. Application is very smooth and the color is so pretty with two coats on. I got tons of compliments :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve always wanted a bottle of this because I just love the Tiffany Blue color.  For me China Glaze&#x27;s for Audrey definitely lived up to its hype.</li>
    <li> The color is not as bright as the picture. Kind of a greyed out version of the color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a China Glaze polish before but could not resist this color.  I waited quite patiently for this to arrive. I was quite concerned when I opened the cushioned envelope and the polish was unscrewed quite a lot.  How does this happen??  I screwed the top back on, let the polish warm to room temperature and applied it the next day expecting the worst since it was half way open before.  Luckily, the polish was undamaged and the color went on beautifully with one coat.  Do yourself a favor and get a nice top coat like Seche Vite and this polish will remain glossy and strong for a week.  Love the Tiffany color but hate that a company can send a polish out half open and not even notice.</li>
    <li> ...and I am in LOVE with it!  It looks great on fingers and toes!  I am going to take some white and put a bow and some lines on my toes so they look like little Tiffany boxes!  It stays on a LONG time too before chipping.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For Audrey is the first and only China Glaze nail polish I have bought and tried. I&#x27;m pleased with this nail polish color. Tiffany and Co. have the most appealing, beautiful, and charming jewelry pieces. Right now, they have the cutest charms - cupcake, lollipop, ice cream, etc., and the nicest rings including the Tiffany Moderne ring, Tiffany Hearts ring in sterling silver and 18k rose gold, and a ring made of Tiffany Blue enamel. Right now, I&#x27;m watching my budget, and I consider Tiffany and Co. jewelry a luxury, but yes, a lot of women dream of owning Tiffany and Co. jewelry pieces. I love the scene when Meg Ryan and Bill Pullman are visiting New York&#x27;s Tiffany and Co. store in the movie, \\&quot;Sleepless in Seattle\\&quot;. I love the close-up of Meg Ryan opening the blue Tiffany jewelry box. In my entire lifetime, I have personally bought and owned two pieces from Tiffany and Co. I also have bought and tried two of their perfumes. For a woman, it is a really special experience to open a blue Tiffany box. In my opinion, each hardworking woman, deserves at least once in her lifetime, to absorb the Tiffany and Co. experience. Anyways, this is a pretty nail polish, and a very unique nail color. I highly recommend applying the trio of OPI blue Shatters: Navy, Blue, and Turquoise on this nail polish. OPI&#x27;s trio of blue Shatters really look nice on this For Audrey nail polish. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this China Glaze nail polish, and I will try other nail shades from them in the future when I have the chance.</li>
    <li> Pretty close to the Tiffany &amp; Co. shade of blue I was going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze is always a good brand to purchase nail polishes under.</li>
    <li> I love love loved this color.  It looks exactly like the picture! But it won&#x27;t last longer than a year, it gets very goopy.  To fix it, you can add a few drops of nail polish remover as a temporary fix.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! It&#x27;s high quality, true to color and lasts long time. It&#x27;s just the right hue I was looking for; bright but not too light. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it so far. Gotta love tiffany blue! (AKA For Audrey)</li>
    <li> beautiful color. and fast shipping</li>
    <li> my cousin got it and i loved the color so then i wanted to buy it cause they sold out at salley hensen so i bought it online right here and i loved it it got dried but thats ok because i have this other nail polish that also got dried and i think its because of the sun or were i left it</li>
    <li> I love this color its definetly the tiffany blue i was looking for! Thanks! Arrived way faster than i expected as well!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the China Glaze fingernail polishes and this color stood out among so many others.  I have received many compliments on the color and even my nail technician was surprised because she has never seen this color.  The price of the product was great and even though I could not get this color locally, it arrived much sooner than expected from the seller.</li>
    <li> This was just the color I was looking for. Perfect combination of light Tiffany blue. I use it all the time!</li>
    <li> LOVE! One of my all time favorite nail polish colors! I wear it often and is so pretty on nails. It is exactly Tiffany blue and has not gotten thick in the bottle. It also stays on a long time and does not chip like some nail polish colors sometimes do.</li>
    <li> If you want nail polish the color of a Tiffany&#x27;s box, this is your go-to color.  It matches perfectly and looks great on the nails.</li>
    <li> Everything is okay&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Absolute fave nail polish color. I get a different design each time but always with this Tiffany blue.  The color lasts without chipping.</li>
    <li> ... before you buy this product. This color is somewhere between a teal and mint and may be too close to other colors to truly make it different. While still a beautiful color and perfect for summer, this nautical nail color is lacking in originality.</li>
    <li> I love love love this color! It is a perfect Tiffany blue match. Formula is very good. Wear is ok.</li>
    <li> Awesome color came in on time great product very happy</li>
    <li> And I love it. It&#x27;s a great nail colour and I also plan on painting it on the inside of a clear phone case because I love it so much. :)</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using China Glaze nail polish. It wears  incredibly well and is such a nice fresh color for spring. It actually wore as well as a shellac ( I don&#x27;t have good luck with shellac).</li>
    <li> The color was a little darker than I was expecting. Painted on my toes, it fades to white after some time. Not terrible...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this color for about five days now and its only just now chipping, partly because i&#x27;m rough. Its a gorgeous color on the nails, i&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on it every day i&#x27;ve worn it. It took nicely with one coat and looked flawless with two coats. Of course placing a bottom coat and a top coat of polish makes it look ten times better.</li>
    <li> If you love Audrey and Tiffany&#x27;s you will love this color.  The product itself is great, the hardeners really make it last a long time, especially when used in a professional mani or pedi.  Happy Shopping!</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect egg shell color, more green than blue but it&#x27;s still an amazing color. Goes on excellent with only one coat.</li>
    <li> this is a beautiful color at a great price.  I am very happy indeed. Planning to do a chevron stripe nail :)</li>
    <li> I have tried many polishes in my day, but \\&quot;For Audrey\\&quot; is at the top... cream of the crop, for sure!!!  I&#x27;m on my third bottle, and I have given many of them as gifts... and have seen the recipients wearing it!!  Awesome color (what girl doesn&#x27;t love a Tiffany box?)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze is my favorite nail polish, and a favorite of most of my friends too.  I&#x27;ve heard some complain on here (Amazon) about how it&#x27;s too thin, requires several coats, color is not true, yada yada yada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dispute all of that.  China Glaze is NOT your average nail polish.  Apply ONE (1) VERY THICK COAT.  One thick coat that you would never do with another polish... real thick, so that you have full coverage and there&#x27;s no nail showing through.  Let dry... it dries really fast compared to other polishes.  You&#x27;re done!  No second coat ever needed, and I have about 20 different colors... it&#x27;s been the same with every one!  I have never found a color that required more than one THICK coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides on beautifully, dries quickly... but my favorite thing about it is the relatively low odor.  The \\&quot;nail polish smell\\&quot; dissipates pretty quickly.  An hour or two after I paint my nails, I can no longer smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, a dark color like this is going to show chips... touch ups are easy and look great.  I often get a week or more from my manicure, just by touching up.  Light colors, I get even more time from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough great things about China Glaze.  It&#x27;s the best polish on the market, in my humble opinion!</li>
    <li> I use all brands of nail polish, opi and Essie are more expensive but china glaze has the same quality and sometimes even better. Drys quickly, looks beatiful and glossy when dried.  Stays beatiful for many days. Would recommend to family and friends!</li>
    <li> This color looks so amazing on me, I got it because I was trying to match a Tiffany&#x27;s box, not quite sure why. But the color is fantastc.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for blue nail polish but this color is OUTSTANDING and it looks great with my very pale skin too. I painted my nails with it 3 days ago and there is almost no chipping at all. I am very impressed with this nail color and the brand, and I will be buying China Glaze again!</li>
    <li> I love this color! This is my first product from China Glaze and I&#x27;m so glad I found this. I&#x27;m loving blues and greens in polishes these days and this one is like a Tiffany blue! Very pretty, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this polish!</li>
    <li> exactly what i was looking for</li>
    <li> This product came on time and was exactly what I expected! 100% satisfied!</li>
    <li> Might need two coats, but is definitely true to color and is very shiny without a top coat. Also has hardeners built in.</li>
    <li> I love it! Bought because I saw the Flotus sporting this color in her workout video clip. love!</li>
    <li> The only reason I bought this nail polish was to match the Tiffany blue... And it does look pretty close! Great color.</li>
    <li> Perfect shade! True to Tiffany&#x27;s and would make Audrey proud!! It came in the mail the same day as my new Tiffany ring and pendant. Fate!! You will not be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful! However, even after I put two coats on, followed by a top coat finish, the polish still chipped! Maybe I&#x27;m too hard on my nails? I work in an office and am on the computer a lot. For everyone who is looking for that \\&quot;tiffany blue\\&quot; shade, this is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love the way it looks. Its very bright and stands out but in a good way. i like when people comment on my nails.</li>
    <li> I ordered this so my nail tech could do Tiffany and Co. nails.  The nail is Audrey and the tips have chunky glitter on them.  It was the perfect &amp;#34;Tiffany&amp;#34; blue and my nails look too cute!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the delivery time of the product. I wasn&#x27;t supposed to receive them until 02/26-02/28 but I actually got them on 02/25/2013! The quality of the nail polish is fine but the color was not at all what I was expecting. It is not a &amp;#34;Tiffany Blue&amp;#34; color like it shows in the picture but rather just a duller version of it. It seems to have a bit of a grey hue to it as well. I am going to try and add some white to the color to see if it will lighten up and be a color that I am happy with. Overall I am happy with the VERY FAST delivery but unsatisfied with the color of the product.</li>
    <li> A perfect match to Tiffany blue, so I polish my nails with this, then wear my Tiffany jewelry.  Yay, me!</li>
    <li> My favorite nail polish is this color. Perfect for mani-pedi. When I first got this color everyone complimented me on it and my friends borrowed it. Definitely a color to keep</li>
    <li> This color is a true Tiffany blue.  it is a must have for any spring wardrobe.  I love this color!</li>
    <li> This color is amazing.  It PERFECTLY matches the colour of a Tifany box!  And as always, China Glaze polish is amazing and even with little to no chipping!</li>
    <li> China Glaze has great quality polishes and this color is the truest I have found to that real Tiffany blue.</li>
    <li> This color is a fabulous Tiffany blue! BUT, it only looks that amazing in the daytime or white lighting. Naturally colors change in yellow lighting. Nonetheless came out pretty in pictures and didn&#x27;t chip too much, however it came off my cousin about 40% after one day. I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a good Tiffany blue at a good cost!</li>
    <li> Good quality nail polish with the perfect color I was looking for.  Something like a robin egg blue.  The polish isn&#x27;t thin like cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle and the color had a bit of seperation in the dye tint.  Kind of looked like old nail polish that had settled a bit.  I have not used it yet so I can not give a TRUE rating.  This weekend I will use it and rate it based on actual use.  It came packaged very safely.</li>
    <li> This is totally classic Tiffany&#x27;s &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; - nearly matches their bag; just a little more muted, but the hue is pretty spot on. It is technically a matte color, but China Glaze always shines more than regular nail polish. I get TONS of compliments for this very classic, classy, yet unusual polish. Further, China Glaze is the best brand of nail polish I&#x27;ve used in 30 years. Rarely chips, dries quickly. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in good shape and quickly. The color of the nail polish is not the &amp;#34;Tiffany&amp;#34; blue that i had expected having a name like &amp;#34;China Glaze for Audrey&amp;#34; which i expected to be just like the greenish blue of &amp;#34;Tiffany and Co.&amp;#34;. Dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Perfect mix of baby blue and sea green . . . . . . if that makes sense. Very summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on nail polishes to match the color of Tiffany&#x27;s and this is the best.</li>
    <li> The color wasn&#x27;t the tiffany color I wanted over all it was cool polish</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the polish yet but checked the color and it is very close to Tiffany Blue.  Will use it for my shower this weekend!</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is extremely close to the iconic Tiffany Blue, which is exact;u what I&#x27;ve been looking for. When the nail polish first arrived, it looked like it had been opened and dripped down the side. I immediately contacted the seller, and within 24 hours, they had shipped me another one! It arrived extremely fast, and was in perfect condition. I&#x27;m really impressed with the seller communication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish took only two coats to look flawless, and is definitely a high quality. I will continue to purchase China Glaze nail polish.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this polish.  The color is dead-on Tiffany &amp; Co. blue.  Ever since Essie discontinued their Tiffany Blue, I&#x27;ve been looking for something like it.  I get compliments on this polish from both women and men every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this color. Really, really, really. But it&#x27;s just too dusty for me. I was expecting a brighter blue and this looks just too dull and dingy. I&#x27;ve only used it once since I received the bottle, and maybe I need to give it another chance, but this didn&#x27;t do it for me. The formula was nice, though, not too thick or runny. Average dry time.</li>
    <li> OMG I&#x27;m in love with this color. Got so many compliments and the polish didn&#x27;t chip for a week. It&#x27;s the same color as the Tiffany box:) Not feeling so Blue...Blue</li>
    <li> As a huge fan of China Glaze (better quality than even OPI imho), this just solidifies that sentiment exactly..This color is beautiful and dries up shiny (even though I still had a clear top coat)..I recommend this especially because the price on Amazon is better than at other stores and tax free..</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. I got it because it looks like Tiffany&#x27;s blue. I love China glaze polishes because they agree with my nails better than anything else, including essie. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Shipped on a timely manner, love the quality and I love this product! Very happy with the color! Matched the Tiffany blue perfect, but be careful not out too many coats!</li>
    <li> Perfect for our Audrey Hepburn Bedroom</li>
    <li> Thick yes, but 2 coats will stay on nicely for a week.  The color is that of a 50&#x27;s car, a very tame blue.  My new fav color!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite shades. It has been my default color during spring/summer of the last two years!</li>
    <li> With the slightest touch of teal, this color has good saturation with quick dry time and easy layering. I used 2 coats then followed up with a topcoat from another brand and was very happy with the results.[[ASIN:B001AL4DBA China Glaze for Audrey 1bottle]]</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful blue! Thought it was going to be a little bit lighter than what I imagined but if you mix it with a little white or base coat it looks great!:)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color and it is the perfect shade of Tiffany Blue.  If you love the blue, you will love this!</li>
    <li> This bottle was everything I expected.  The polish is a great formula. No bubbles, not streaky, dries fast, and two coats is good enough, along with a good top coat. This color is very hard to find in other brands, and china glaze makes one of the best tiffany blues</li>
    <li> For Audrey is the perfect tiffany-ish blue matte color. I have put CND super shiny over it and just worn it with out a shiny top coat and it looks great either way! It&#x27;s a gorgeous year around color and a great addition to any nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> I wanted so much to buy the Chanel-Tiffany color- But so much I can not afford the Chanel version. This was a close second though. And anyone who loves the Tiffany color will note how close this is.</li>
    <li> It was not the same color as it appeared on-line.  I expected some difference, however, this was totally different.&lt;br /&gt;Not the Tiffany Blue. Not even close.</li>
    <li> My nail polish came in within 4 days of ordering it, and It is amazing and brand new i love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS COLOR! just like tiffany blue! Paints smoothly</li>
    <li> I loved it looks just like Tiffany boxes, The polish was a little too thick, but I added some thinner on and the brush is not to perfect but the color and results are just like Chanel loved it</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colour and didnt take too long to arrive!</li>
    <li> Nice color, got it on time, but a little more teal-ish than minty. Other than that, good polish.</li>
    <li> Pretty tiffany blue. Colorful but not trashy. Better on toes than hands imho. Good application. Dries hard and lasts long.</li>
    <li> I love the color ,he is not a color that you will see everyday and in last a long time with only 2 coats.</li>
    <li> My sister has received multiple compliments on this nail polish and she loves it as well. Top notch polish. China Glaze is the real deal son.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful blue color.  One of my favorite springtime colors, or a nice color to brighten up the winter dullness.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze&#x27;s For Audrey! The color is close to the Tiffany blue (hence the name) and is a creme polish. The coverage is pretty nice - it only took me two coats to achieve a good, opaque color.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish. It has the best formula of all my polishes, and it is the prettiest color. It is a true tiffany blue. If I had to choose only 5 polishes that I could keep, this would be one of them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this FIVE stars because it&#x27;s a beautiful color,went on smooth,&amp; dried quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have had this polish on for a little over 2 weeks now. I never have polish on this long because not only do my nails grow so quick, but they chip no matter what polish I use. This is the first time I&#x27;m using China Glaze and let me tell you it&#x27;s been over 2 weeks and my polish hasnt chipped yet. I&#x27;m super happy 😊 will continue buying China Glaze.</li>
    <li> gorgeous color, lasted awhile with Seche Vite as the top coat.</li>
    <li> Iv seen tons of reviews for this color online and decided I wanted to try it. Well I received it in the mail and it didnt look anything like the color in the reviews or the tiffany box its supposed to replicate! The dye was settled in the bottom and even after trying to stir it with a toothpick it still didnt look right. The color was way too dark. Its either expired or the seller refilled it with some other nail polish and decided to sell it. That was my experience with it... I wont be buying anymore.</li>
    <li> This polish is really cute and with a few coats you can get a few days with no chips. I mean I use my hands a lot to clean around the house so I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle but it was much better than paying the shop money when their polish chips off just as fast. I&#x27;ve been looking for a polish to match my wedding color tiffany blue. I think it was pretty light for that but I still love the color.</li>
    <li> I got this nail polish as a gift for my friend and she loves the color but hasn&#x27;t put it on yet. I don&#x27;t know at this point how the quality is but the color was exactly what I expected :)</li>
    <li> its not the greatest nail polish in the world you can get the same or very similar color at Walmart for 1$. this nail polish chips very easily and takes forever to dry.</li>
    <li> I love the color because it is exactly like Tiffany&#x27;s! China Glaze has Great color options and the paint stays on your nails for a long time! :)</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful I just love it  and wear it very often,  it is the perfect Turquoise color not too blue not too green.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Tiffany Blue nail polish. Yes, like the jewelry store. Although in the picture it looks like this just might be a pastel blue, the name, \\&quot;For Audrey\\&quot;, seemed like an homage to Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s and therefore possibly what I was looking for. Turns out it was exactly what I was looking for! Exactly the Tiffany blue I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I love the quality of China Glaze nail polish, long lasting, high shine.  For Audrey is a close to robbin&#x27;s egg blue cream (there is a slight hint of turquoise).  Nice color for summer fashions.</li>
    <li> This color is in and if you are looking for that blue box color this is definitely it.  Goes on smooth comes off easy and doesn&#x27;t stain cutilces.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color for my daughter&#x27;s wedding. The color is Tiffany, which is why the bottle is named: For Audrey. Evidently the movie Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s starred Audrey Hepburn, therefor the honor of the bottle&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is great; however, having a great color is useless when the polish is such low quality that it will look as if you let a 4 year old paint your nails. I do not believe this is true China glaze because of the poor quality.</li>
    <li> I love this color and the formula of this polish. But I have to say that my bottle was not at all a Tiffany blue. When I received it I noticed that some of the dye had separated and settled into the bottle and no amount of shaking would mix it back into the polish. I don&#x27;t know if this was a very old bottle, or perhaps because it was shipped to me in intense summer heat that could have caused it. I still love the color, I just noticed it wasn&#x27;t how others describe it.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend who tends to be more girly. I want sure about the color but it was on her wish list. She totally loved the color and wears it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;If your into a more not traditional color thats not too bright you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> One of the best colors I&#x27;ve ever used on my light skin tone. Only took one coating if this and a clear top coat. Gorgeous!</li>
