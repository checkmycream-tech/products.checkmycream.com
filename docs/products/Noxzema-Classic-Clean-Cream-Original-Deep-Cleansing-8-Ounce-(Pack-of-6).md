      <li>I love rediscovering products I used years ago.  </li>

      <li>I love Noxzema products, I have used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>I love the product and it has a soothe and cooling effect after you wash the cream off.</li>
      <li>I have been using this cream for many many years</li>
      <li>With me I&#x27;ve found that salicylic acid really irritates/dries my skin causing more acne, and this cleanser doesn&#x27;t have that in it which is great.  </li>
      <li>Noxzema is still around because I&#x27;m back to using it every day and my skin feels wonderful.</li>
      <li>I love this brand</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with process of this order.</li>
      <li>It has a sort of menthol cleaner that is refreshing, and I like it... but miss the Original formula -</li>
      <li>Just as great as it ever was and has such a refreshing tingle.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the purchase. :)</li>
      <li>The price is fantastic.</li>
      <li>lol I use only Noxzema products and it works gloriously for my skin.</li>
      <li>This product keep my face clean an smooth.</li>
      <li>that clean tingly feeling</li>
      <li>When you massage it in it feels like you&#x27;re really working it into your skin unlike the more soapy/sudsy cleansers.  </li>
      <li>This is a good deal in comparison to the local grocery store prices.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably never switch facial cleansers because this one is just simply perfect and definitely</li>
      <li>It is a hassle to use another soap, but I am willing to deal with it for so the sake of being acne free.</li>
      <li>Leaves a menthol scent afterwards which is not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>This Noxzema Classic Clean, Moisturizing Cleansing Cream gives off a strong \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; odor.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for dry seasons.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite products from my early days....</li>
      <li>well worth the price</li>
      <li>It was a great difference from the last noxema experience i had with watery white lotion looking stuff.</li>
      <li>My skin feels super refreshed, clean and soft after use.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin clean and soft and helps with break outs.</li>
      <li>, Noxzema is a basic no nonsense cleaner that will make your face feel clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Other products feel like they wash away more oils, but I end up with acne still.</li>
      <li>In the many years that I tried other facial cleansers my face never felt really clean</li>
      <li>Of course there are the smile lines, and the general gravity pull,</li>
      <li>The consistency is unique - almost like a facial mask - and if you want a more creamy/watery consistency you simply add water or apply it to a wet face.</li>
      <li>Pretty simple.</li>
      <li>Worked like a charm and completely cured my problem.</li>
      <li>but wow.</li>
      <li>My mother-in-law is 90 and has the skin of a 45 year old.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s definitely not the original Noxzema, or at least not what I have been using.</li>

    <li> it&#x27;s good for dry seasons.</li>
    <li> Works good for my husband.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for many many years and I shall continue to do so!  After i take a shave, I rub this cream as a way to heal any blister that may occur during the time spend outdoors. especiall the winter months. T recommend this you guys. The price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Just as I remember when I was a kid. Smells great. I love it. Good price for bulk purchase too.</li>
    <li> I have used. Noxzema since I ws a girl&lt;br /&gt;It cleans I luv that clean tingly feeling it smooths I don&#x27;t wash my face with anything else</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin clean and soft and helps with break outs. I use it as a mask, I slather it on and wait and hour or so till it dries and wash it off</li>
    <li> Was expecting &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; but this stuff works about the same.  It has a sort of menthol cleaner that is refreshing, and I like it... but miss the Original formula - but I wouldn&#x27;t send it back.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS MANY USES.  I USE IT TO SHAVE WITH, EVERY DAY.  HAVE A THICK BEARD AND THIS PRODUCT SOFTENS THE STEEL LIKE WHISKERS.</li>
    <li> I now have enough Noxzema to last me several years. lol I use only Noxzema products and it works gloriously for my skin. I love the product and it has a soothe and cooling effect after you wash the cream off. I love this brand and I love this great deal!! Definitely worth the purchase. :)</li>

    <li> The Noxzema experience for this gal is wonderful. I love this stuff. And a great story, as well...  My mother-in-law is 90 and has the skin of a 45 year old. Of course there are the smile lines, and the general gravity pull, but wow. As the daughters all joined in unison asking her why her skin looked so amazing, she answered, &amp;#34;Simple. I&#x27;ve been using Noxzema for over 40 years.&amp;#34; We were all dumbfounded. We had all used it as teenagers... and moved on too spend untold amounts of money over the years searching for something we had all along. Needless to say... several of us (daughters) are all now back to using Noxzema! I&#x27;m in my late fifties - so let&#x27;s see what this does for me over the next few decades. In the last few months, it&#x27;s caused my husband to comment on my skin several times -- and that says it all!</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and was in excellent condition. I&#x27;m pleased with process of this order. However, it&#x27;s definitely not the original Noxzema, or at least not what I have been using. It doesn&#x27;t have the same scent....</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 star rating becaus the containers came in a brown box inside of the Amazon box which was great and told me that it was in-store quality. When i opened the 1st container and used it, it felt like the consistanmcy it was suppose to be. It was a great difference from the last noxema experience i had with watery white lotion looking stuff. Great product and would recommend to anyone!!! Great buy.</li>
    <li> Love Noxema, have used it for 40+ years and have great skin.  Can&#x27;t find it anymore.  However, the packing was not good - all the lids were loose, and it could have easily dried out.</li>
    <li> Great value as a 6-pack deal.  Beats the prices (including delivery &amp; taxes) of Wally-world and the 2nd place guys with the bulls-eye logo.  If the price stays stable, I&#x27;ll stick with Azon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is something I&#x27;ve used for years and years.  I use it before shaving to help with razor-burn and it works well for your skin for long-term use.  Even had a doctor once tell me I had amazing skin and asked what I did.  Use Noxzema and stay out of the sun or use sunscreen.  Pretty simple.</li>
    <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and I get occasional acne. Tried several other products till coming across this stuff. It is a hassle to use another soap, but I am willing to deal with it for so the sake of being acne free. Leaves a menthol scent afterwards which is not unpleasant. Does not over-dry my skin while clearing up my face. Other products feel like they wash away more oils, but I end up with acne still.</li>
    <li> I use Noxema for my face cleansing as my mother showed it is a great product and I was able to get 6 in a case at a great price, will do business for this product again</li>
    <li> This product keep my face clean an smooth. .. this is a must have product. .</li>
    <li> I love Noxzema products, I have used this product for many years.</li>
    <li> I have previously reviewed this product but now my review is about the price.  This is a good deal in comparison to the local grocery store prices.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery and product. Great price will buy again. Three kids go through it like water.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal with Prime.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS CREAM FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS.  I USE IT FOR MY FACE AND DRY SKIN ON FEET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I USE THE CREAM FOR GAULDING UNDER UNDER THE ARMPITS. IT GETS RED AND BURNS .&lt;br /&gt;I SWEAT A LOT.  IT BURNS A BIT WHEN YOU APPLY IT, BUT IT GOES AWAY.&lt;br /&gt;IT ALSO WORKS GREAT FOR THE CROTCH AREA.  NOTHING I TRIED WORKS AS WELL FOR THIS RED SORENESS&lt;br /&gt; DON&#x27;T KNOCK IT UNTIL YOU TRY IT AND GET RELIEF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D MAZZEO</li>
    <li> This Noxzema Classic Clean, Moisturizing Cleansing Cream gives off a strong \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; odor.  I remember basic Noxzema having a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; plain type odor and not one of perfume.  For those who have allergies or sensitivities to scents, this is probably not the product to get.</li>
    <li> I have been using Noxzema for over 35 years and will continue to use it.  My sons and granddaughter are user after seeing how it affects me.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that you either love it or hate it. Personally, I love it. I started using Noxzema in my teens and then stopped using it because my husband didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled. Yes it does have a &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; scent, but that&#x27;s why it works, Noxzema is a basic no nonsense cleaner that will make your face feel clean and fresh. In the many years that I tried other facial cleansers my face never felt really clean and I always had to use several products to get similar results to what I could get with a simple wash with Noxzema. Thank goodness Noxzema is still around because I&#x27;m back to using it every day and my skin feels wonderful. If you&#x27;re wondering about my husband, well, I&#x27;m a widow, now.</li>
    <li> What can I say? One of my favorite products from my early days....I love rediscovering products I used years ago.  Just as great as it ever was and has such a refreshing tingle.</li>
    <li> Noxzema arrived, loving that I was able to purchase in bulk!!! I will be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I started using this to get rid of saddle sores caused by 200 miles a week on the bicycle. Worked like a charm and completely cured my problem.</li>
