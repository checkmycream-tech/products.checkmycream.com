### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Aquis towels are the best.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and well happy for this discovering this product!!!</li>
      <li>Does a great job drying my hair without lots of rubbing.</li>
      <li>Great for drying hair or as hand towels.</li>
      <li>Really happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>I also love the color!</li>
      <li>Absorbs incredibly and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>The towel is OK just for drying the hair but not for drying off after a shower.  </li>
      <li>Vwry pleased......</li>
      <li>These textured towels are wonderful; they dry your hair 50% faster than terrycloth.  </li>
      <li>Great product, as soft as the aquis, which I have, but for 1/4 of the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Others charge more per towel but give free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This truly is very quick to wick up water.</li>
      <li>so it dries much more quickly in the bathroom and in the dryer.  </li>
      <li>love this towel  bought to dry hair quickly</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t appreciate it being changed without contacting me first.</li>
      <li>Really like this towel!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m all for faster ways to get ready in the morn!  </li>
      <li>I will definitely be getting more of these.</li>
      <li>They dry super fast too, so no damp musty towels hanging in the bathroom - and faster washing and drying, so easier on the environment :) I even bought one for my dog</li>
      <li>Microfiber towels in general really are noticeably better at absorbing water than normal ones.</li>
      <li>it downs frizz my hair and its very absorbent.</li>
      <li>These towels don&#x27;t seem very absorbent and sort of stick to my skin when drying.</li>
      <li>They are almost as much as the towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;$25 to ship 5 towels is reasonable.</li>
      <li>Fluffy is nice; but not always practical.</li>
      <li>highly recommend</li>
      <li>also it is not thick like bath towels</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but already notice a difference - my hair doesn&#x27;t get as frizzy, dries faster, and the curls are much bouncier :)</li>
      <li>- she is almost completely dry after just a quick rub down with one of these - MUCH better than a traditional cotton towel!</li>
      <li>Not cheap, but this towel really dries hair quickly.  </li>
      <li>No, these are not the luxurious fluffy towels I usually enjoy wrapping up in post-shower.</li>
      <li>Soft microfiber hair towel.</li>
      <li>only thing I find misleading is the price, shipping was as much as purchase.</li>
      <li>It is soft and as absorbent as a paper towel.</li>
      <li>One warning: When laundering this type fabric in your washing machine be sure there aren&#x27;t any bras or other items with hooks, as they get tangled up with the towel fabric and create quite a mess, doing harm to the towel.</li>
      <li>These are lightweight, small but a quick pat down is truly all that is needed - no more scrubbing dry with my cozy fluffy towel - and best of all it&#x27;s healthier for skin.</li>

    <li> Look at the shipping charges before you buy. They are almost as much as the towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$25 to ship 5 towels is reasonable. I think it is deceptive advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others charge more per towel but give free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking elsewhere...</li>
    <li> Microfiber towels in general really are noticeably better at absorbing water than normal ones. This one is no exception. Performs as expected. Great for drying hair or as hand towels.</li>
    <li> Too small for bath. Too heavy for hair.</li>
    <li> The towel is OK just for drying the hair but not for drying off after a shower.  It is too thin and seems to stick to the skin.</li>
    <li> These towels don&#x27;t seem very absorbent and sort of stick to my skin when drying. They don&#x27;t glide over my skin.</li>
    <li> love this towel  bought to dry hair quickly and it does that.  also it is not thick like bath towels so it dries much more quickly in the bathroom and in the dryer.  I think I bought 2 of them.  highly recommend</li>
    <li> Really like this towel!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but already notice a difference - my hair doesn&#x27;t get as frizzy, dries faster, and the curls are much bouncier :)</li>
    <li> I do like the product but I ordered a set of two and got only one. I didn&#x27;t appreciate it being changed without contacting me first.</li>
    <li> Same quality as the more expensive microfiber towels found in stores. Really happy with the purchase. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Aquis towels are the best. My hair drys in a fraction of the time, their a compact towel. Vwry pleased......</li>
    <li> Not cheap, but this towel really dries hair quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t feel thick, but it absorbs a lot. I like the look, too.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and immediately noticed a reduction in frizz after switching to this product from a cotton towel. I usually co wash my hair and then leave it wrapped up in the towel for a while until I am ready to do my hair routine.</li>
    <li> Absorbs incredibly and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> No, these are not the luxurious fluffy towels I usually enjoy wrapping up in post-shower. Fluffy is nice; but not always practical. They often don&#x27;t dry me or themselves efficiently either. These are lightweight, small but a quick pat down is truly all that is needed - no more scrubbing dry with my cozy fluffy towel - and best of all it&#x27;s healthier for skin.

    <li> This truly is very quick to wick up water. Even the smaller size I got is absorbent enough to act as a bath towel. I will definitely be getting more of these. It is soft and as absorbent as a paper towel.</li>
    <li> I like the size of the towel. its just enough to wrap it around my head and leave it there to soak up the water from my hair. it downs frizz my hair and its very absorbent.</li>
    <li> Does a great job drying my hair without lots of rubbing. Helps keep frizz down as a result. I also love the color!</li>
    <li> Great product, as soft as the aquis, which I have, but for 1/4 of the price. Would recommed this item.</li>
    <li> Got this for my fiance.  She loves it for her curly hair!</li>
    <li> These textured towels are wonderful; they dry your hair 50% faster than terrycloth.

    <li> Soft microfiber hair towel. My hair is almost completely dry after using this. It cuts down on blow dry time.</li>
    <li> I have used a couple microfiber towels before, it seems like the waffle texture helps both in absorption and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem a little small, but I can dry my whole body and long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I find misleading is the price, shipping was as much as purchase.</li>
    <li> This is thicker than the other flimsy ones I have got here before but is small as a &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; towel</li>
