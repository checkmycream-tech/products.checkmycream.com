### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are excellent for removing &amp;#34;Flash&amp;#34; from parts.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll just make the best use I can of them and know not buy them again.</li>
      <li>They are an ideal size for carrying in my purse for touch ups</li>
      <li>Great nail files and wonderful price!</li>
      <li>So this is a Great Product for doing this.  </li>
      <li>great value</li>
      <li>I needed a ton of nail files for a project, and these worked great.</li>
      <li>Got the boards when they stated and they were good quality.</li>
      <li>Good product and good price.</li>
      <li>I use emery boards for so many things around the house, it was great to get them in bulk.  </li>
      <li>As well as your own fingernails.  </li>
      <li>I bought these for work (I work in a full service salon) and these are great for the manicures and pedicures.</li>
      <li>These will do the trick for many moons.</li>
      <li>Most all models have them.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I can still use them, okay for the money.</li>
      <li>I am using these for a humanitarian project and was pleased with the quality for such a great price.  </li>
      <li>They are remarkably insubstantial and I&#x27;m lucky to get all ten fingers shaped with one board.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s just that the light side peels away from the board, maybe they got too hot in transit and the glue vaporized.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I would certainly purchase these again.</li>
      <li>They are thinner which makes it easier to get to the smaller nails and shape them better than larger files.</li>
      <li>The package I guess could have been a little better in my opinion.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re ok for the price, but they&#x27;re a little flimsy.</li>
      <li>A normal board would usually last me quite a while and in the future I will return to them.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m not sure if that is the way Emery Boards are ???</li>
<li> hard to find thse oldies anywhere.  </li>
<li> They are dusty</li>
<li> Thin but inexpensive.  </li>
<li> Disappointed that these emery boards aren&#x27;t sturdy, and I expected the grit to be coarser.  </li>

    <li> Use these with Jamberry samples. great value</li>
    <li> These work okay, it&#x27;s just that the light side peels away from the board, maybe they got too hot in transit and the glue vaporized.  I can still use them, okay for the money.</li>
    <li> I am using these for a humanitarian project and was pleased with the quality for such a great price.  They are an ideal size for carrying in my purse for touch ups so I&amp;#34;m snagging a few for me.  I would certainly purchase these again.</li>
    <li> hard to find thse oldies anywhere.  Everyone seems to want the  larger, broader emeries.</li>
    <li> Good product and good price.</li>
    <li> Great nail files and wonderful price! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Thin but inexpensive.  These emery boards are too flexible.  I use them on calluses and corns, but they just bend back so you have to press them down with your fingers on the back.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok for the price, but they&#x27;re a little flimsy.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I like to build plastic models in my spare time.  These are excellent for removing &amp;#34;Flash&amp;#34; from parts. Which is excessive plastic. Most all models have them. So this is a Great Product for doing this.  As well as your own fingernails.  But this is what I use these for.</li>
    <li> I say that because what can you expect from a 100 count bag, I would buy them again..These can be used for art projects as well.</li>
    <li> I like them...They are dusty I&#x27;m not sure if that is the way Emery Boards are ??? not sure...I always bought the seven side one at Sallys. The package I guess could have been a little better in my opinion. But, overall it gets the job done</li>
    <li> Disappointed that these emery boards aren&#x27;t sturdy, and I expected the grit to be coarser.  However, the price was low so I&#x27;ll just make the best use I can of them and know not buy them again.</li>
    <li> Got the boards when they stated and they were good quality.</li>
    <li> Shorter than used to using and somewhat flimsier, bu having 100 of them will work!</li>
    <li> I use emery boards for so many things around the house, it was great to get them in bulk.  Delicate filing of various work projects using an emery board is easier than a strip of sand paper.  These will do the trick for many moons.</li>
    <li> I bought these for work (I work in a full service salon) and these are great for the manicures and pedicures. They are thinner which makes it easier to get to the smaller nails and shape them better than larger files. And once I&#x27;m done I can just throw them away!</li>
    <li> I needed a ton of nail files for a project, and these worked great. They&#x27;re a bit flimsy, but get the job done.</li>
    <li> I guess the price should have tipped me off. They are remarkably insubstantial and I&#x27;m lucky to get all ten fingers shaped with one board. A normal board would usually last me quite a while and in the future I will return to them.</li>
