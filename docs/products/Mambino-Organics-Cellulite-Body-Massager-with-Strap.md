      <li>The massager looks really nice and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>This made a huge impact!</li>

      <li>so I going to keep using it to see if I see more results along with my work out regimen &amp; healthy diet.</li>
      <li>One month the most</li>
      <li>It is enjoyable.  </li>
      <li>Just got this, need to try it for more than a week though</li>
      <li>I love this tool.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not a terrible product.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;ll probably be ok.</li>
      <li>However, I love using it...</li>
      <li>I bought this product mostly to get more into the habit of moisturizing and figured if it could help problem areas, then why not?</li>
      <li>If you are prone to bruising take it easy when using this.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>It still works fine.  </li>
      <li>Feels like it actually can make help me win in the war with cellulite</li>
      <li>For some reason I was expecting this to be a rather cheaply made product.  </li>
      <li>You are worth it!</li>
      <li>Was really excited about using this thing.</li>
      <li>and I got so excited when I opened the box.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in very good shape, but can&#x27;t seem to get rid of a few pesky dimples on the backs of my thighs.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet to be able to tell you if it really works.</li>
      <li>Thanks to amazon customers helping me, I was able to make the right decision.</li>
      <li>Highly reccommended!!!</li>
      <li>I have been using it every other day with a super hydrating scrub that has good slip... along with diet and excersize.</li>
      <li>So far no improvements in my cellulite, but as for a massage brush it is okay.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working, especially since I work out a lot.</li>
      <li>It is a lot of fun for both of us...</li>
      <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
      <li>However, it does offer a nice leg massage while applying lotion (I use either my regular Jergen&#x27;s or Nivea Goodbye Cellulite gel)</li>
      <li>i start off with the massager for the first 15 minutes</li>
      <li>When I use it, my skin gets very tingly and I can feel the blood is really moving around and flushing those toxins!</li>
      <li>I workout pretty much every day and do weights, intervals, and run.</li>
      <li>It fits easily into my hand, so I can attack my cellulite from different angles!</li>
      <li>It&#x60;s good, but don&#x60;t last so long.</li>
      <li>and if I hold my legs in a certain way.</li>
      <li>However, it might be good to point out not to rub too hard.</li>
      <li>I used it in combination with the Nivea cellulite gel, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a change.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and can&#x27;t really tell a difference in my cellulite.</li>
      <li>So it takes maybe 10 minutes for my whole body...</li>
      <li>As to whether this really helps decrease the cellulite remains to be seen.</li>
      <li>Not only do I enjoy massaging her buttox but after about 2 weeks of massaging some cream she bought to go along with it, her butt looks</li>
      <li>I put the mixture in a glass spray bottle and like using the brush rather than trying to massage with my hands so this method works really well.</li>
      <li>and I notice a big difference with how smooth my skin is.</li>
      <li>granted I have been working out harder and drinking more water so that helps...</li>
      <li>For me, the most effective solution to help reduce cellulite on my pale legs is a daily self tanner, like the Jergen&#x27;s natural glow medium.</li>
      <li>It has worked for me much better than any other cellulite massager.</li>
      <li>So while I have seen a reduction in cellulite, my guess is that it&#x27;s more due to the workouts, than the brushing.</li>
      <li>My first rubbing I was determined to rub the fat right out and actually gave myself some pretty significant bruising due to the pressure I used.</li>
      <li>I personally have a big cellulite problem so this product kept me waiting very excited when i received it...</li>
      <li>Had rather high hopes for this brush</li>
      <li>Overall, I think for the affordability of the product, it is worth the effort.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll start seeing big results in just one month;)</li>
      <li>then i finish with the body brush for the last 15...its very important to drink lots of water (half of your weight</li>
      <li>The little nubbies are smooth and don&#x27;t scratch at all.  </li>
      <li>Concept made sense but don&#x27;t really notice any different look in the cellulite on my legs.  </li>
      <li>It did it&#x27;s job, but unfortunately not for too long.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good quality but the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because when I got it the pad with the knob area is half pushed down and I can&#x27;t get it back up to make it even.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with these types of bristles other than some of the other brushes I saw on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The massager itself is made out of hard, smooth, clear plastic nubs attached to a flexible rubber piece.</li>
      <li>So now I only use it once a day after I get out of the shower on my thighs and butt, but not too hard and not for too long (to avoid any more bruises).</li>
      <li>Be careful not to press too hard or use it too many times a day.</li>

<li> The handle is woven and it&#x27;s attached to a wooden base that is very easy to hold on to.</li>
<li> I just go in little round circles with firm pressure over any &amp;#34;bumpyness&amp;#34; for a minute in each area ( back of the thigh, buns, sides, inner knee, belly etc...)</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite, but it seems to have gotten slightly worse as I&#x27;ve gotten a little older</li>
<li> I guess it&#x27;s made cellulite less visible.</li>
<li> Seriously recommend also as stimulating massager with lotion over the back if you can get someone else to do it.</li>
<li> I use this with Nivea lotion that helps reduce cellulite so it could be the lotion that is making things less visible.</li>
<li> I believe I can see a slight difference in my thighs/butt.</li>
<li> My cellulite is less visible...</li>
<li> I use lotion, not a special cream.  </li>
<li> If anything, at least I won&#x27;t have to worry about dry skin and the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; helps when my muscles are sore from running and working out.</li>
<li> The material the bristles connect to seems a little flimsy</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll keep using the brush once a day for a little while longer, but so far not impressed.</li>
<li> basically if u want results make it an everyday thing for 30 minutes</li>
<li> We have been using the product on my girlfriends legs and butt for a few weeks now.</li>
<li> I have been using the anti cellulite cream for a few months with no improvement, but coupled with this massager</li>
<li> I use this tools everyday on my thighs</li>
<li> I have a noticable difference in the &amp;#34;cottage cheese thigh&amp;#34; after just a few uses.</li>
<li> He said to use it a few times a day, which I did at first, and I guess I got carried away with it and ended up with horrible small circular bruises all over my legs, which looked far worse than the small amount of cellulite I had.</li>
<li> After searching for a cellulite massager that would work for me, I bought this one, not really sure what it would be like.</li>
<li> Knobs are hard</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Had rather high hopes for this brush and it delivered. My cellulite is less visible...granted I have been working out harder and drinking more water so that helps...regardless I am happy and have been telling friends about this brush.</li>
    <li> So far no improvements in my cellulite, but as for a massage brush it is okay. If you are prone to bruising take it easy when using this.</li>
    <li> I have been using the body brush for about two weeks in combination with Jergen&#x27;s firming lotion. I believe I can see a slight difference in my thighs/butt. However, it might be good to point out not to rub too hard. My first rubbing I was determined to rub the fat right out and actually gave myself some pretty significant bruising due to the pressure I used. Overall, I think for the affordability of the product, it is worth the effort. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It feels good when I use it.  I use lotion, not a special cream.  I cannot notice any difference, but it seems to stimulate circulation when I use it.  It is enjoyable.  We&#x27;ll see about the effects...</li>
    <li> Not only do I enjoy massaging her buttox but after about 2 weeks of massaging some cream she bought to go along with it, her butt looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Win, Win.</li>
    <li> Fell apart after a very short time of use. It did it&#x27;s job, but unfortunately not for too long. One month the most</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and can&#x27;t really tell a difference in my cellulite. I don&#x27;t have a lot of cellulite, but it seems to have gotten slightly worse as I&#x27;ve gotten a little older and if I hold my legs in a certain way. I workout pretty much every day and do weights, intervals, and run. I&#x27;m in very good shape, but can&#x27;t seem to get rid of a few pesky dimples on the backs of my thighs.  I saw a brush like this recommended on Dr. Oz, so I decided to give it a try. He said to use it a few times a day, which I did at first, and I guess I got carried away with it and ended up with horrible small circular bruises all over my legs, which looked far worse than the small amount of cellulite I had. So now I only use it once a day after I get out of the shower on my thighs and butt, but not too hard and not for too long (to avoid any more bruises). Be careful not to press too hard or use it too many times a day. I used it in combination with the Nivea cellulite gel, but haven&#x27;t really noticed a change.

I&#x27;ll keep using the brush once a day for a little while longer, but so far not impressed.</li>
    <li> I must say that this brush is amazing . Feels like it actually can make help me win in the war with cellulite BUT :( You need to use it all the time.hate the fact that I am so lazy!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet to be able to tell you if it really works. The massager looks really nice and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> For some reason I was expecting this to be a rather cheaply made product.  I don&#x27;t know why.  Instead this is a very nice, sturdy brush that gets the job done.  I use it with lotion after the shower (and use a dry brush on the same area before the shower).  I&#x27;ve been doing it for 1 week and I think I&#x27;m seeing results!</li>
    <li> I bought this product mostly to get more into the habit of moisturizing and figured if it could help problem areas, then why not?

Do not use it without lotion though...not too comfortable :P</li>
    <li> Good brush! Were wore the last one out in a year...</li>
    <li> I love this tool. Yes... Tool. I use this tools everyday on my thighs and I notice a big difference with how smooth my skin is. It is made well and it works. Well worth the investment. You are worth it!</li>
    <li> Concept made sense but don&#x27;t really notice any different look in the cellulite on my legs.  Wasn&#x27;t expensive but probably would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Amazing! After searching for a cellulite massager that would work for me, I bought this one, not really sure what it would be like. Thanks to amazon customers helping me, I was able to make the right decision. The massager itself is made out of hard, smooth, clear plastic nubs attached to a flexible rubber piece. The handle is woven and it&#x27;s attached to a wooden base that is very easy to hold on to. It fits easily into my hand, so I can attack my cellulite from different angles! It has worked for me much better than any other cellulite massager. Highly reccommended!!!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t  permanent fix for cellulite but it massages nicely and promotes blood flow and circulation of lymphatic system so you do get temporary cellulite reduction.</li>
    <li> Was really excited about using this thing. I guess it&#x27;s made cellulite less visible. I go to the gym and tan so after I shower I use this with Nivea lotion that helps reduce cellulite so it could be the lotion that is making things less visible.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve never used anything like this so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  This seems well made.  The little nubbies are smooth and don&#x27;t scratch at all.  When I use it, my skin gets very tingly and I can feel the blood is really moving around and flushing those toxins!</li>
    <li> Feels real good, have not had chance to see results. However, I love using it... Great massager, I have been using it on my legs.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Perfect size.  The material the bristles connect to seems a little flimsy but I think it&#x27;ll probably be ok. It&#x27;s not like you apply real hard pressure when you&#x27;re using it anyway. I&#x27;m glad I went with these types of bristles other than some of the other brushes I saw on Amazon. These seem to do the job and don&#x27;t cause any pain/skin irritation like some of them look like they would. I&#x27;ve been using it with a mixture of jojoba oil, grapefruit, lemon, and cypress essential oils. I put the mixture in a glass spray bottle and like using the brush rather than trying to massage with my hands so this method works really well. As to whether this really helps decrease the cellulite remains to be seen. I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any magic &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for the dreaded stuff. Heredity, what you eat, your activity level all comes into play. I don&#x27;t expect any miracles here but I thought what the heck, why not try it. If anything, at least I won&#x27;t have to worry about dry skin and the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; helps when my muscles are sore from running and working out.</li>
    <li> Just got this, need to try it for more than a week though so i dont have any result yet</li>
    <li> It broke after a 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> We have been using the product on my girlfriends legs and butt for a few weeks now. It is a lot of fun for both of us...</li>
    <li> I got this as part of my wedding beauty regimen.... I have been using it every other day with a super hydrating scrub that has good slip... along with diet and excersize. I have a noticable difference in the &amp;#34;cottage cheese thigh&amp;#34; after just a few uses. I just go in little round circles with firm pressure over any &amp;#34;bumpyness&amp;#34; for a minute in each area ( back of the thigh, buns, sides, inner knee, belly etc...) So it takes maybe 10 minutes for my whole body... then I follow with a firming cream. This made a huge impact! I have been using the anti cellulite cream for a few months with no improvement, but coupled with this massager it is great! Seriously recommend also as stimulating massager with lotion over the back if you can get someone else to do it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality but the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because when I got it the pad with the knob area is half pushed down and I can&#x27;t get it back up to make it even. It still works fine.  Knobs are hard so be prepared to bruise when you do it.....or it was just my thighs. Ha!</li>
    <li> Really does an excellent job with celluite! Also gives an awesome massage for your aching thighs! Brenda</li>
    <li> I use the brush twice a day and it appears to be working so I going to keep using it to see if I see more results along with my work out regimen &amp; healthy diet.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s good, but don&#x60;t last so long.</li>
    <li> Got this product and I got so excited when I opened the box. It&#x27;s comfy to use, feels nice, washable and it&#x27;s cute!</li>
    <li> I personally have a big cellulite problem so this product kept me waiting very excited when i received it...basically if u want results make it an everyday thing for 30 minutes...i start off with the massager for the first 15 minutes then i finish with the body brush for the last 15...its very important to drink lots of water (half of your weight ex.:140 lbs.&#x3D;70 ounces of water)and also try do do treadmill for 30 minutes 5 times a week and you&#x27;ll start seeing big results in just one month;) HAPPY!&#x3D;)</li>
