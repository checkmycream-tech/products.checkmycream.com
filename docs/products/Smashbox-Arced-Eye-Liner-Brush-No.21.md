### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This brush is PERFECT.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for the cat eyes line!</li>
      <li>The best eyeliner brush ever for applying gel liner.  </li>
      <li>The line is just perfect</li>
      <li>Perfect brush</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works beautifully.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not too great for getting a defined wing.</li>
      <li>This brush is great.  </li>
      <li>I use it with Tarte&#x27;s Liquid liner and it works great.</li>
      <li>So it looks like a great liner brush, but it just is not...</li>
      <li>Great experience with my purchase ...</li>
      <li>The angle of the brush allows for a perfect line every time - except when the fine hairs pull apart over time.  </li>
      <li>Then you have the pencil brush which is good for a thicker line.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be great for a discrete application of eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I love this brush!</li>
      <li>I got a better deal than through Smashbox on-line!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every kind of liquid eyeliner and using this brush with a good liquid eyeliner is just about the easiest way to do the perfect cat-eye.  </li>
      <li>Great product and fast delivery</li>
      <li>I have tried many eye liner brushes, but this is definitely the best!</li>
      <li>I love this brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try.  </li>
      <li>Just saying :)</li>
      <li>I can not remember for sure.</li>
      <li>Like Bobbi Brown much better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just &#x27;OK&#x27; and that&#x27;s all.</li>
      <li>Love this brush for my waterproof jet set smashbox eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I could NEVER apply eyeliner to my top lids until this brush.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money! :)</li>
      <li>This arced brush makes it SO easy to use either cream or liquid liner.</li>
      <li>I have to twist the brush into a fine point before dipping into the gel pot.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Smashbox makes fantastic brushes.</li>
      <li>I have many other brushes from Smashbox that I have purchased over for years and have been quite happy with.</li>
      <li>WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s certainly the most \\&quot;ergonomic\\&quot; eyeliner tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>It applies the liner smoothly and in a perfectly straight line.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
      <li>Now I can get eyeliner right at my lash line, but I think that also has to do with using the Smashbox cream eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>perfect for achieving the dramatic cat eye with liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Thanks Smashbox!</li>
      <li>The angle the brush is at makes it just a little bit more ergonomic!</li>
      <li>The only downside is that the cap comes off too easily.</li>
      <li>The tip of this brush looks very defined in the picture</li>
      <li>I really like this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>The brush is easy to clean and is capable of giving a really thin, precise line.</li>
      <li>This brush is really &amp;#34;nothing special&amp;#34; at all, and I would not have ordered it if I had known it was just going to be &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I feel like I have more control with this than Mac or other sephora eyeliner brushes where the tip is straight rather than angled.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this brush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a newbie when it comes to makeup and after watching a few tutorials on how to use gel liner and bloggers talking about this brush I&#x27;ve decided to get it and do not regret a bit!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very precise</li>
      <li>Then you have the thin angled brush which is good for dense creamy products, powders, and the brow.</li>
      <li>and I can find similar angled/fine bristled brushes for much less at stores like Sally&#x27;s Beauty, however, I own two of these and use them often.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have to be a professional make up artist to achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
      <li>You have the standard liner brush, much like the brush you&#x27;d find inside a pot of liquid liner.</li>
      <li>I can definitely live without this brush and to be honest, I really expected a much higher quality when I ordered this speciality and delicate eye liner brush from Smashbox to use with their gel eyeliner - especially for this price.</li>
      <li>It seems expensive, but is worth the cost to get your eyes right, and I am sure it will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had 4 of these brushes over the last couple of years and had the same consistent problem.</li>
      <li>It is thin and the angle is really just right!</li>
      <li>I use this brush to apply my bare minerals powder eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>Bristles are way to soft and will not properly apply cream eyeliner</li>

<li> My old one gave out after a few years.</li>
<li> I tried pencils, liquid liners, other regularly shaped brushes and every eyeliner known to man.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m never going back to pencil brushes that pull at my eyelid or straight brushes that are so awkward.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a liquid product that needs a brush such as this to deliver the smallest amount of product over a very small area, all the while avoiding getting the product in the eye.</li>
<li> Finally you have the bent liner brush which, ugly as it may seem, once you use it you&#x27;ll never go back to the standard liner or angled brush for liquid products.&lt;br</li>
<li> However, this eye liner brush is really quite disappointing.</li>
<li> The handle is narrow, so it never seems to get in the way of my line of sight</li>
<li> I have worked around this by putting the brush in a small ziplock</li>
<li> I have found without this brush, it does pale in application!</li>
<li> This lets you apply eyeliner (Smashbox, at least) like a pro.  </li>
<li> Have not located there lately, may be on HSN?</li>

    <li> Was straightened out when I goofed up and got three! I have found without this brush, it does pale in application! My old one gave out after a few years. I got a better deal than through Smashbox on-line! With QVC it had been icluded. Have not located there lately, may be on HSN? I can not remember for sure.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced and I can find similar angled/fine bristled brushes for much less at stores like Sally&#x27;s Beauty, however, I own two of these and use them often. I use mine specifically to apply Latisse to my lash line every night. It&#x27;s a liquid product that needs a brush such as this to deliver the smallest amount of product over a very small area, all the while avoiding getting the product in the eye. This brush handles the job well.&lt;br /&gt;Also perfect for achieving the dramatic cat eye with liquid eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every kind of liquid eyeliner and using this brush with a good liquid eyeliner is just about the easiest way to do the perfect cat-eye.  I use it with Tarte&#x27;s Liquid liner and it works great. Highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I could NEVER apply eyeliner to my top lids until this brush.  I tried pencils, liquid liners, other regularly shaped brushes and every eyeliner known to man.  This brush is PERFECT.  Now applying eyeliner to my top lids isn&#x27;t a time-consuming and FRUSTRATING task!  It applies the liner smoothly and in a perfectly straight line.  Thanks Smashbox!</li>
    <li> The angle the brush is at makes it just a little bit more ergonomic! The brush is easy to clean and is capable of giving a really thin, precise line. Worth the money! :)&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: A month into using it, it fell apart... the brush went into the metal part. Such a bummer!</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye liner brushes, but this is definitely the best! The line is just perfect and you don&#x27;t have to be a professional make up artist to achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie when it comes to makeup and after watching a few tutorials on how to use gel liner and bloggers talking about this brush I&#x27;ve decided to get it and do not regret a bit!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very precise and it&#x27;s perfect for the cat eyes line!</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with eyeliner brushes. This arced brush makes it SO easy to use either cream or liquid liner. I feel like a Pro.</li>
    <li> This brush is great.  It is thin and the angle is really just right! Now I can get eyeliner right at my lash line, but I think that also has to do with using the Smashbox cream eyeliner.

    <li> Liner brushes 101: You have the standard liner brush, much like the brush you&#x27;d find inside a pot of liquid liner. Then you have the thin angled brush which is good for dense creamy products, powders, and the brow. Then you have the pencil brush which is good for a thicker line. Finally you have the bent liner brush which, ugly as it may seem, once you use it you&#x27;ll never go back to the standard liner or angled brush for liquid products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lining with this brush is a dream. You have precision and control AND since it is bent you can also SEE with the eye you are lining. It&#x27;s a beautiful thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smashbox makes fantastic brushes. But you know what? You can get a brush just like this for about $7 or $8 at Target and even cheaper from other retailers if you are willing to accept a brand other than Smashbox. I have this brush and I also have one from Crown and another one from Sonia Kashuk. They&#x27;re IDENTICAL except for the color of the handle. Just saying :)</li>
    <li> The bend in the brush makes it go on with a thinner line.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply my bare minerals powder eyeliner.  The handle is narrow, so it never seems to get in the way of my line of sight and it&#x27;s certainly the most \\&quot;ergonomic\\&quot; eyeliner tool I&#x27;ve ever used.  Fantastic product.  I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try.  I&#x27;m never going back to pencil brushes that pull at my eyelid or straight brushes that are so awkward.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I do not think this is an actual smashbox product. Bristles are way to soft and will not properly apply cream eyeliner and I have bought this product several times at Macy&#x27;s and never had an issue. I guess I have to go back there and get it for the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great experience with my purchase ...</li>
    <li> Love this brush for my waterproof jet set smashbox eyeliner. Works beautifully. The only downside is that the cap comes off too easily. I have worked around this by putting the brush in a small ziplock</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner. I feel like I have more control with this than Mac or other sephora eyeliner brushes where the tip is straight rather than angled.</li>
    <li> Goes hand in hand with the eye liner. Perfect brush</li>
    <li> The best eyeliner brush ever for applying gel liner.  The angle of the brush allows for a perfect line every time - except when the fine hairs pull apart over time.  I have to twist the brush into a fine point before dipping into the gel pot.  I&#x27;ve had 4 of these brushes over the last couple of years and had the same consistent problem.</li>
    <li> The tip of this brush looks very defined in the picture but it&#x27;s not so in reality, so it&#x27;s not too great for getting a defined wing.</li>
    <li> Had to take a layer off when it arrived.  Kept flaking off after application.  Like Bobbi Brown much better.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this brush to use when applying Latisse to my eyelash line. It is perfect! I&#x27;m sure it would be great for a discrete application of eyeliner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just &#x27;OK&#x27; and that&#x27;s all. This brush is really &amp;#34;nothing special&amp;#34; at all, and I would not have ordered it if I had known it was just going to be &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;. I can definitely live without this brush and to be honest, I really expected a much higher quality when I ordered this speciality and delicate eye liner brush from Smashbox to use with their gel eyeliner - especially for this price.

So it looks like a great liner brush, but it just is not...It&#x27;s just &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
