      <li>If you&#x27;ve seen the ads on television, this &#x60;Micro Touch&#x27; seems to be able to shave anything safely and smoothly from chest hair to goatees.  </li>
      <li>The product is OK and works fine.</li>
      <li>received very quick in new Zealand  great product just what I wonted .... ...</li>
      <li>Should have paid alittle more and got a trimmer that had a light that works.</li>
      <li>I received this product and it is great for getting the sensitive areas around your ears and nose without causing irritation.</li>
      <li>Oh to work better or it should be free.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This thing is terrible.  It does not work at all like it is advertised.  It is super cheap and is comparable to something you would find in a dollar store for half off.  Dont waste your mone ylike I did!!</li>
    <li> The way this piece of crap is designed won&#x27;t allow for me to use the trimmer length attachment.  It just stops working when I put it on.  Threw it away after the first and only use.  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I bought a couple of other brands that broke or just didn&#x27;t work right, but this one is perfect for me. I use it to shave my neck in between hair cuts and it works quick and pain free.</li>
    <li> It comes with a battery, but it was dead by the time I recieved it.  The unit is cheaply built, and does not appear to be very sturdy - I don&#x27;t think it would hold up to any sort of travel, such as being packed in a suitcase.  That being said, if  you just keep it in your bathroom cabinet it does work as advertised and I am happy with the results.  It comes with an attachment that allows you to trim your eyebrows that works very well.  Take the attachment off and it easily trims nose hair.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Should have paid alittle more and got a trimmer that had a light that works. Will only order books online from now on</li>
    <li> For $10 I can&#x27;t complain much.  Doesn&#x27;t really trim too well, especially with thicker hair/beard.  Worth the risk, but won&#x27;t be buying a replacement battery once it dies.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of CRAP! Even with a brand new battery it has hardly any power at all, and usually won&#x27;t even turn on! Why can&#x27;t they make one of these trimmers that actually works?</li>
    <li> We were really disappointed in this device.  Not enough power. We sent it back. They refunded our money, no hassle....</li>
    <li> this works good out of box, but three or more uses and it cloges up easily and difficult to keep clean. cant get it clean and doesnot work. received as christmas gift and already want to toss it.</li>
    <li> I saw the TV ad and thought I&#x27;d try this in spite of the bad star rating. Big mistake. It ran for about 3 minutes, cut okay but then slowed down as if the battery was low...then it stopped. Put in another battery, the item would not run. I have a battery tester and checked the power. I was using used batteries which that tested 1.32V on one and 1.26 on the other. Cool! must need a fresh battery. I put one in that tested at 1.49 and the item ran!...for about 10 seconds and stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolute waste of time. Try something else.</li>
    <li> It works ok as a trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t provide a very close shave, as stated on the ad. It works perfectly if you just want to trim down, like on your side burns.</li>
    <li> I bought two of them. I tried to clean, the plastic is so brittle that the holding part broke so easily. Then poof. The device is useless. Money is gone. Regret buying it.</li>
    <li> Maybe I expected too much, but this trimmer worked OK the first time, then the   motor seemed to drag thereafter. New batteries didn&#x27;t help. The thing barely   operates, and pulls rather than cuts. Would never buy this again, and cannot   recommend it to anyone else (even at the low price).     JF, New York</li>
    <li> A few years ago I started getting those Brezhnev eyebrows, mine were not as bad as his and I would get them trimmed by my barber till I started getting the Gorbachev scalp and had a diminishing reason to visit the barber so often not to mention the waiting time in the barber shop.    I got this item from the CVS pharmacy a few days ago at the spur of the moment. Normally I would not take the time to write a review but I have to tell you this is a five star item. For about $10.00 which is less than the price of one barber visit I was able to groom my self much better than the barber ever did.    It has an eyebrow attachment that works great. I trimmed the hair and the peach fuzz on and in my ears. It destroys the nose hair. I even trimmed the hair above my ears.    Dont wait to buy this till you see it in the store by chance like I did. This will be the best $10.00 you spend on yourself.</li>
    <li> used this item one time and it worked great, next time all it did was pull hair.  in my opinion not worth the 10.00 it cost.  the company I bought it from AS SEEN ON TV was great they replaced it with the micro max free of charge no questions asked.</li>
    <li> I saw this advertised on TV while I was in Canada and it looked good so when we returned home we ordered it.  During the order process my wife clicked on the shaver alone and she checked out. Afterwards we noticed that the amount charged was more then expected turns out despite her having clicked the razor only they had added the stupid grooming kit on top charging us the S&amp;H for that.  The shaver itself is not worth what they charge for it. First it is battery powered (AAA) so it has no real power and it cuts horrible. Takes me 2-3 times as long to trim my face then it does with my normal rechargeable shaver. This is a horrible waste of money and I can not recommend others to buy what I consider to be a poor as seen on TV product!</li>
    <li> This item is very cheaply made and consequently broke on the third time I used it.  Save your money and buy somethng else.</li>
    <li> Piece of s***. I read the reviews and figured I would give it a try anyways, but boy was I stupid.  The trimmer got here and I was really excited and it didnt work at all!  My husband then messed with it and it broke right away and he told me how stupid I was for buying it.  He was totally right.  I threw it in the trash the same day I got it.  It wasn&#x27;t worth paying the shipping costs and getting a refund.  Save your money and go \\&quot;shaving store\\&quot; (there actually are a lot around).  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Poor little thing barely able to cut any of my nose hair  I miss my Panasonic Ear and Nose hair trimmer (lost the blade)</li>
    <li> This item was sent with dud batteries.  Not a good first impression!  It works, but not as efficiently as presented in the advertising.  0verall, disappointing.</li>
    <li> Worked fine the first couple of days now nothing, changed battery still nothing. Now it is taking up space in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> JUNK!DOES NOT WORK WELL AT ALL!NOT WORTH RETURNING!</li>
    <li> The item looks just like it appears on the site. However, it is very lightweight. It is very cheaply made. It will cut hair, but it has little to no power. This is good for trimming nose hairs only. It is not sharp enough or strong enough to do much more. it does not shave close. It doesn&#x27;t seem as though it will last very long. If you need something long term to shave arm hair, leg hair, or bikini lines pay a lot more and get a more powerful mainstream shaver.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve seen the ads on television, this &#x60;Micro Touch&#x27; seems to be able to shave anything safely and smoothly from chest hair to goatees.  It is light and fits in the hand comfortably.  But it is cheap plastic and very very limited in its real use.  The AAA+ battery simply has no power.  I was unable to make any dent in my sideburns, goatee or moustache.  It comes with three plastic trimmer attachments which are virtually useless.  Even shaving at an angle and slowly, you can barely make a dent in your hair.  It will shave fine hair off your body but you are better off simply buying an electrical trimmer for other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not thick or rough, so this really showed me that there were only a few things I could do with this device.  It works great for shaving those errant ear hairs (the blades are about 1/16 inches wide).  It also works well on nose hairs with a little work and persistence and trimming your eyebrows works fine.  The blades are safe enough that you are unable to cut yourself.  If you did, this device would be crushed out of anger the first time you did!  The light is an unnecessary gimmick and for the price, this simply is not the best choice.  I doubt it will last very long.</li>
    <li> We brought this one to replace one we broke. It works good but uses batteries up to fast I think.</li>
    <li> Very cheap.  Will not always turn on, have to manipulate it to work.  Made of plastic material.  Not happy at all.  It&#x27;s obvious that it will not last long at all.</li>
    <li> I have to pretty much agree with what most other people have said.  When the trimmer works, it works great, but it dies way too quickly.  I had one that only lasted about three weeks.  I wouldn&#x27;t ever bother changing the battery because that&#x27;s never the problem.  It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s so cheap, but the manufacturer should charge a little more and spend the money on better parts.  If you&#x27;re sick and tired of replacing the trimmer when it dies, just buy one that&#x27;s rechargeable or use the trimmer on an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I saw the tv commercial and I really thought it was good as advertised. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Can tell by its build it won&#x27;t last very long, but I only use it to even out eyebrow length (~once a month), so it will last me a while. Its motor is actually stronger than a similar Remington product.</li>
    <li> It really works just as advertised and now my beard is well trimmed withot problem and with great ease, blah, blah blah..</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It feels more substantial than the old version. That one broke after awhile. Hopefully, this one will hold up longer.</li>
    <li> This is a completely useless product, don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I believe the 5 start comments are paid comments.</li>
    <li> The product is OK and works fine. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in the effectiveness of the trimmer combs... they ruffle my mustache, eyebrows and stuff, but are not well designed for trimming. Without the comb attachments, it&#x27;s an effective trimmer and the light is a nice feature, but it&#x27;s just not a stand-out product. There are others by Phillips Norelco and by Wahl that have impressed me more with their versatility and the effectiveness of their combs, especially...</li>
    <li> Aww, man, I fell for the marketing hype.  If this is truly the \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy a previous version.  But first, the image currently shown of the product isn&#x27;t quite correct; what you get is actually better looking overall, though it&#x27;s mostly a day-glow green color.  There seem to be many versions of this product, but what I got looks more like this:  [[ASIN:B003ZW9LOQ Micro Touch Max Hair Remover]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros/Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It looks nice, but... it feels cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get more attachments than expected, but... they&#x27;re better quality than the actual unit, so, they don&#x27;t (can&#x27;t) work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a battery, but... the product sheet tells you that the included battery is for \\&quot;trial purposes\\&quot; and \\&quot;not for extended use\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does trim hair, but... even brand new, it tugs/snares thicker hairs and misses fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light works and is a nice feature... but you wouldn&#x27;t really need it if the cutting blade trimmed all hairs on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, but... yeah, you get what you pay for.  In this case, it really is NOT a rip-off, because it does its job (not as easily nor as completely as the way it&#x27;s marketed claims, but it provides a reasonable result.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  Ok, but just ok.  I&#x27;ll be buying a higher-priced, more effective (and built to last longer) unit in the near future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for around 2 years now and have very few complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the price was right at less than $10 so I figured I&#x27;d give the gadget a shot. And, while I tend to be leery of products of the \\&quot;As seen on TV\\&quot; variety, this item is one that proves that they aren&#x27;t all just cheap pieces of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very efficient and economical when it comes to battery usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the blade, even after two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job well enough and is built for easy transportation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its cheap construction can sometimes causes minor problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - it&#x27;s a good value and worth trying out.</li>
    <li> I thought the product will be cutting edge machine but it runs on a single battery, which is best used for the light than for its trimming ability. Its definitely worthless on trimming even small beards or making goatees.</li>
    <li> Not real happy with this. Put the battery in turned it on , used it seemed ok and since then it has not worked. I changed the battery still didn&#x27;t work. Seems like once the light is used the device dies for a while. Tried 2 times since and still doesn&#x27;t work. Was hoping for better. Sorry</li>
    <li> Purchased the Micro Touch Max for my husband. It would not trim anything. He tried the back of his neck, around his mustache and even down his arm and not one single hair was removed. What an horrible Christmas gift this made.</li>
    <li> This product is very cheaply made.  Half the time it won&#x27;t turn on and when it does it does a poor job of trimming.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, pay more and get something that will actually work.</li>
    <li> I have used manual and battery operated twirling circular blades, Tweezerman tweezerlike circular blade in blade, and scissors to trim my nose hairs. All not too satisfactory. I bought this only for that dedicated purpose and it is easily the best. The others obscure your view of the cutting process and don&#x27;t trim as well. With the Microtouch, using a light behind you and a magnifying mirror, you can actually aim, monitor the process, and see the results. The little LED is, however, just about useless. Even this does leave some stubble. Not surprising given it&#x27;s shaving type action, but way better than the alternatives.</li>
    <li> Having tried what was supposed to be a better-quality trimmer made by Norelco, and found that it didn&#x27;t cut hair nearly as well as the MicroTouch, I made another purchase of the latter (my third in the last 6 years) and am very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many complain that the MicroTouch mechanism wears out sometime after one to three years of use. Well, indeed it does -- but then, how long does a straight-edge razor last? About the equivalent length of time, at most? So, why should anyone be surprised that a device costing only $10 would last any longer?&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point to bear in mind is that for the length of time that the MicroTouch works, it works extremely well, shaving hair closely but safely. In my experience, the same cannot be said for the Norelco NT9110 (the model that I tried and abandoned after one use); and from what I&#x27;ve read, none of the other devices in this category perform any, if at all, better. The Micro Touch is the exception, and if I have to replace it every 1 to 3 years, then so be it. At least during the product&#x27;s lifetime, it works the way it should.</li>
    <li> This Micro Touch Max, trimmer for nose, ears, mustache, and eyebrows, does not shave anything off or barely anything. Would look for a better product than this one.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when I opened the package, put the battery in and it wouldn&#x27;t work.  Then when it finally did turn on, I couldn&#x27;t shut it off.  Then everything fell apart.  I didn&#x27;t get to use it even once.</li>
    <li> Very cheap shaver notice in the comerical the guy never actual shaves his mustache because its under power to cut it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHAVER!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> trims hair as promise painlessly a little light but works fine no problems with it cuts does not pull or pluck as other trimmer do sometimes</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This thing&#x27;s junk.  It didn&#x27;t work at all when I first got it, but after I straightened out the contacts on the on/off switch it sort of worked.  It runs very slow, even with brand new batteries.  And the built in light might as well not be there at all.  It doesn&#x27;t perform anywhere near as well as the TV commercial would have you believe.</li>
    <li> Good idea this item, it does cut, but the cutting action needs to be jus a lil faster, maybe with elec current.</li>
    <li> I received this product and it is great for getting the sensitive areas around your ears and nose without causing irritation.</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would work better. But for $10 what to you expect.. Oh to work better or it should be free.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all its not sharp wont cut beard or other fecal hare the attachment is useless also, I wish i could get my money back, This thing is only good for removing long peach hare.</li>
    <li> just purchased it in early april..does the job.  it is kind of cheaply made but for 10 bucks it&#x27;s pretty good..great for trimming the nose hairs. the blades havent dull yet..let&#x27;s see when i get to the 6 month mark.</li>
    <li> To use it on your face is a joke, your better off using a razor, however it is good for nose hair except it hurts, but it does work.</li>
    <li> This was my comment in response to the most helpful review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I would&#x27;ve given 0 stars if possible, for all the gullibles out there, this product was designed JUST FOR YOU, because you THINK you need it. And hell, it was on TV so it must be great!) Insert long farting sound with a giant thumbs down here-----&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And FYI, I never have and never will purchase this sorry excuse for a trimmer. Funny story, a friend who got it as a gift didn&#x27;t want it( must&#x27;ve known how crappy it is) so they gave it to me, unopened...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve owned 6-8 over the years??? How many years we talking? Let&#x27;s say 16 years, probably longer than they&#x27;ve existed. So that means 2 a year paying a minimum of $10 each. $160 for 8 of them. When the Gillette fusion pro glide trimmer only costs $30 and ive had mine for AT LEAST 2 years now, not a SINGLE problem or complaint. Yes I know it doesn&#x27;t do nose hairs, but we are MEN, right? Tweeze those SOB&#x27;s out and deal with the minuscule pain. And shaving your eyebrows? That&#x27;s GHETTO, looks like crap. Again, MAN UP and tweeze. Plus tweezing keeps the hair gone 3 times as long and looks MUCH better. Oh, by the way, I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to use my Microtouch, the POS wouldn&#x27;t even work right out of the package, and yes I checked the batteries. I will do my absolute BEST to DEFACE this product and it&#x27;s company</li>
    <li> I purchased a this product to trim hair from the nose and eyebrow. It worked great however, when the blade gets dull  which is pretty quick. You have to throw a perfectly good equipment away because you CANT GET BLADES EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN TAKE THE BLADE OFF. I contacted supplier and that is all they are. Replied they don&#x27;t know where to get replacement blades. Now this I do not believe since they know the manufacturer and could get the blades. However this is a way for customers to by another one over and over again. Man sure glade that you do not have to purchase a new lawn mower or other products with a blade.</li>
    <li> The easiest way I have discovered to shave those nose hairs, that seem to grow faster, the older I get.  And it doesn&#x27;t even try to cut my skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> After going through several other trimmers that fell apart, ran through batteries non-stop &amp; most commonly didn&#x27;t cut at all, this is the hands down best out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t buy it off the infomercial ad. They&#x27;ll rip you off on shipping/handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a better one out there at a fair price, I&#x27;m not aware of it &amp; I tried at least a half dozen others (including Remington, Conair, Norelco, Wahl, etc.) before this one &amp; they all failed bigtime.</li>
    <li> Cheap, I think it was $10 bucks, but it doesn&#x27;t get the hair off like in the commercials, it pulls and saws and even hurts at times and gave me road rash in my sensitive areas. I couldn&#x27;t get the attachment to trim my eyebrows like in the commercial either, but it&#x27;s better than trying to trim up with nothing, and it didn&#x27;t draw blood, so for $10 bucks I&#x27;ll use it until I can afford the expensive hair removal system that doesn&#x27;t use a sawing type blade that resembles a little hack saw - but I&#x27;m not bitter :)</li>
    <li> Product broke with in a week of use. Really don&#x27;t think my nose hair is that tuff, I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product continues to be lauded in ads as the end all, be all of personal trimmers.  I have had several before that I would trade this product for in a minute.  This product is very unhandy and can be painful to use.  Very disappointed after all the hype...........</li>
    <li> spend a bit more for a better item. i&#x27;ve used a few trimmers like this one over the years. the price here is too good to be true.</li>
    <li> Pretty good device for it&#x27;s price.  Will probably need to replace once per year, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  Will purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> Most of the moustache, nose, ear trimmmers I tried were junk,  This ones a winner. It&#x27;s very sturdy and works well without cutting  the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this sort of item before with great results but this item tore the skin and caused bleeding.  I threw it in the trash in less than a minute.</li>
    <li> Husband didn&#x27;t feel it lived up to the hype and only used it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> The price was right and I like it, because I can keep the hair off my ears and keep my nose hairs trimmed.</li>
    <li> Ugly, fat, noisy, terrible build quality, falls apart during battery replacement. An ear trimmer should not be unnecessarily noisy. The old version was quieter, sleeker, and better.</li>
    <li> This cuts the small unwanted hairs well enough to warrant the price.</li>
    <li> This product I could tell when I recieve it that was used. Totally used. The \\&quot;light\\&quot; that has in it didn&#x27;t worked, but still it worked for what I wanted. And the battery that comes within it, it was like medium charged because in a while of use it suddenly stopped.</li>
    <li> the picture shows a microtouch max     but when I got the product it was the microtouch magic.   return to sender..</li>
    <li> Price is right and the product works as expected.</li>
    <li> This device seems to be running on half power even with a new battery. It pulls, lags and takes forever to do the job.  I have a 5 year old conventional nose hair trimmer that does a better job.  Spend a few extra bucks on a beard trimmer and the results will be better.</li>
    <li> Bad design, no power when you try to use it. If you move it around it stalls.   Dont waste the $10</li>
    <li> I purchased this in May 2011 at CVS Pharmacy for $10.00 on Clearance.  Now I know why it was on clearance. This is a total piece of crap and made of very low quality, weak, plastic construction.  I tried using it several times in the first week and the results did not please me.  I have used several Conair and Panasonic models priced between $8.00 and $11.00.  None of them were really spectacular.  I am going to continue looking until I find one that is rechargeable and does the job well.  Definitely stay away from this one as it does ot do anything that is marketed to do.  This one was the biggest waste of money and I still have it but never use it.  It is a waste of time as my nose hair and ear hair is never looking any better after using it.</li>
    <li> It was poorly made; already broken</li>
    <li> What a waste of money.  I didn&#x27;t need a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;.  I needed a grooming device that worked and this one didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s now in some landfill.</li>
    <li> The idea is wonderful. But the one I received only operated for 3 uses. Not worth the low price for only 3 uses.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001CD3M72 Touch Technologies Micro Touch Magic Lighted Personal Grooming Device For Men]] very good trimmer , works just as described .</li>
    <li> no good, looks like a toy does not cut anything, dealing about 15 and about 2 days to shave. .</li>
    <li> My husband got 20 seconds of use out of this &amp; then trashed it. He has one that is round to do his ears &amp; nose, but wanted this straight one to get a little closer.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient is happy with it, especially that it has a light built in.</li>
    <li> This grooming tool works great and has come in so handy for quick clean-ups when a haircut isn&#x27;t really necessary.</li>
    <li> Este producto realmente es muy bueno, para la limpieza de los pelos de la nariz, oreja y bigotes, es muy facil de manejar y controlar.</li>
    <li> Not strong enough to satisfy my husand&#x27;s needs.  He would prefer a much stronger tool to use on a more regular basis.</li>
    <li> best trimmer you will ever buy with a built in light. clean up is quick and easy you will enjoy it very much</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT TOUCH TECH NOLOGIES MICRO TOUCH MAGIC LIGHTED PERSONAL GROOMING DEVICE. I HAD ONE BEFORE AND WORE IT OUT</li>
    <li> ok product, good buy for the price.  They wanted twice as much to order direct from the company,  Overall good purchase</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like too much.</li>
    <li> It doen&#x27;t work right/the light does not come on/there seems to be a short&lt;br /&gt;in the unit/not able to use it. do not want to pay shipping charges to&lt;br /&gt;return.</li>
    <li> Never worked properly from day 1. Cheap, plastic, inconsistent motor speed, starts and stops. Utter waste of money, avoid like the plague.</li>
    <li> My teen-age boy saw the commercial earlier in the year for this and asked for it for Christmas.  So I bought one for him and one for my other son.  They tried them out first thing after opening and like the way they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Came on time or early nice item why do I have a word limit own items to rate good item</li>
    <li> The light never did work and the on off switch is not reliable. The blade cuts well at first but is dull after using it 4 times. I am still looking for a product like this that works much better.</li>
    <li> I was able to use this trimmer two times.  Then, it was impossible to shut off.  The only way I could get it to stop was dismanteling it; i.e. just pull it apart.  It did work fine--two times.  I would be happy to pay double the price if it were made more durable to last a lot longer.  Other than that, I will never buy another one.  Pure waste, except for the nail clippers, tweezers, etc.</li>
    <li> i have had one of these since 2008, trimming mustache, ear and nose. still works like a charm. the best mustache trimmer out there IMO.&lt;br /&gt;all i have done is keep the blades clean.</li>
    <li> I use the Micro Touch for shaving nose hairs only, since my Norelco does the rest. It sure beats hassling with dangerous scissors! The light helps.(I mention this because I saw a snarky review that said it didn&#x27;t work or was useless.)</li>
    <li> The light goes on but the motor quit.  This thing just feels like it was made for under a buck.&lt;br /&gt;Everything about it feels cheap - while it worked (for a very short time) it did the job, but&lt;br /&gt;if you have to keep buying new ones, forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
    <li> This product worked for the first couple of times but its cheap and can barely trim/cut anything. The light is about the most pointless thing.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work when I got it</li>
    <li> These type of things never work as well as you would like.</li>
    <li> The only thing this product is good for is trimming nasal hair.  It very terrible at trimming or cuttin facial hair or any other hair on the body!</li>
    <li> Tried this device on hair in ear but did not notice any change. Also not very functional for nose hairs. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The build is pretty cheap and it&#x27;s not very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up switching back to my normal razor half way through.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the money i paid works fine when it works. will i buy another one no thank you.</li>
    <li> As many say, these are not all that reliable. Clearly the switches are defective. However, when they work they do a great job, much better than their competitors, which are more expensive. As opposed to the more expensive ones I have, this never cuts my skin, an important point when dealing with ears and noses. When one does not work, I simply put it aside and use one of others I have. (Another of the same kind,) After using it a few times this one too usually stops working. I then try one which had stopped working in the past: Frequently they start to work again! If one can keep several around, I personally Recommend using this system.For me, it beats buying a different brand, which always cause me pain, cuts, and blood.</li>
    <li> The light did not work since the beginning, the battery was dead, finally when started  it sound like it was falling apart and did not cut any hair. Junk..junk</li>
    <li> Product is very cheaply made.  I purchased this for my husband and after the third use it fell apart.  Not happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> It works great for my occasional use. I don&#x27;t know how well it would last with a lot of use.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this very inexpensive toy devise , but it does work if you feed it batteries. STEVE F.</li>
    <li> I got it in few days and it is a god product.&lt;br /&gt;I very like to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Good Good Good</li>
    <li> this is no way what I expected for this Item sorry I wasted my money on this will not order again</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I purchased this product. They pretty much indicated that it works well, but won&#x27;t last forever. Going into it with that mentality, I think it does just fine. The lighted version really is much better than ones we had that weren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have had this more than a few months (thought I had already reviewd it but guess not) so far it does what I expected. If you expect it to trim your beard forget it, if you expect it to trim your hair at home forget it. I look at this and know it wont work that way. What it will do is loose hairs on sideburns, nose hairs without having to worry about cutting yourself and thin out eyebrows. Thats all folks, not meant for heavy  duty use. I use it for those things and it works wonderfull.</li>
    <li> received very quick in new Zealand  great product just what I wonted .... ...will trade a g a I n  les</li>
    <li> First the bulb did not work and it won&#x27;t cut anything but fine hair. This is a very cheaply made product.</li>
    <li> I bought this only for my husband to use on his eyebrows. The first time he tried to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. He had to fiddle with it and finally it turned on. Still did not cut like expected to. He changed the head to try again, and then it wouldn&#x27;t start again. This will be thrown on a shelf and not used. The saying you get what you pay for is true. Do not waste your money buying this. The price might be right, but if it does not work, its not a good deal.</li>
    <li> This product lasted two uses! It would barley turn on and the light would flicker. DO NOT BUY! The Remington is a much better model.</li>
    <li> Worst electronic device I ever had.  You get about 10 minutes use out of every battery and then it&#x27;s time to replace the battery again.  I can&#x27;t fathom what it&#x27;s doing, but it&#x27;s not worth the $14 I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Not very efficient, always leave hairs and does everything its makers say</li>
    <li> An old man asked me to buy this for him.  To this day I don&#x27;t know why I bought a low quality razor for him.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for 21 months now and it finally died. It worked great during that entire time. I used it regularly without issues. As long as you clean it there are no issues. I just placed an order to replace my broken one. And it costs 22 cents less than what I paid in early 2011 on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time, received as advertised, would recomend this product to a friend. Do not have anynnegative comments about this product.</li>
    <li> Not what it states it will do. Very disappointed thought it would work so much better tried it once and now it sits.</li>
    <li> Does not work as advertised, barely cuts and batteries die quickly (one use).Spend a little more and get a WAHL.</li>
    <li> For what I paid for it, I got my money&#x27;s worth. It&#x27;s just that if you had the light on it would take power away from the shaver. So I used a flashlight instead.</li>
    <li> It works Great does was its supposed to.Good for in between haircuts grooming..</li>
    <li> They all seem to be about the same quality wise, but can&#x27;t complain they do as they promise.</li>
    <li> not that I need it but the light does not work. And sometimes I got a smack it to get it to turn on.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Easy to use , set-up and maintain. Very ergonomic and practical. Sturdy design and properly contoured to fit anatomy</li>
    <li> The minute it came in the door he tried it and loved it. Said it took care of the grooming instantly (Nose) and that he wishes he had gotten it sooner.</li>
    <li> Fairly effective for really short hair, but not so with longer hair.  I have tried simular products that work better.</li>
    <li> its not good its just cheap thats it old maybe cant cut hair alltime simetime turn of itself. very bad</li>
    <li> This is the worst thing I have ever bought, the light does not turn on, its materials are pretty cheap, I do not recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Item started out great, not a lot of power, very cheaply made. Lasted only 2 months and broke. Had other trimmers that lasted much longer.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for Amazon before, but this product so failed to live up to its hype that I felt compelled to do so.&lt;br /&gt;  From the moment I opened the package, the Microtouch seemed flimsy. The light never worked, and most annoying, the unit frequently would not switch on. I messed with the battery several times trying to improve the contacts, but because the battery needs to slide down a tube, the contact spring cannot be stretched and then the battery inserted into its slot.&lt;br /&gt;  I had never seen this type of trimmer, was using one of those spinning tip units which was sorta painful and imprecise. But once the Microtouch proved to be such an abysmal failure, I searched the web and found quite a few similar devices. I finally bought a Norelco NT1930. It uses an AA battery vs the Microtouch AAA. Much heavier duty, switch feels solid and price was the same. The Microtouch can be found in my garbage can</li>
    <li> item came prompt and is working in good conditions.</li>
    <li> Just as seen on tv!  Works to the T!!</li>
    <li> not good it doesn&#x27;t cut right</li>
    <li> Terrible, low quality junk...</li>
    <li> All the negative stuff already said is absolutely true. Thing fell apart right out of package. Battery wouldn&#x27;t fit in right and then the plastic covering kept falling off. Battery sucks and barely works out of package. The razor part barely shaves if at all and when it does you have to mash it hard against your skin. What a rip-off. Not sure how companies get away with this stuff in legal terms.</li>
    <li> bought this as a father&#x27;s gift for my husband. he finds it very handy in trimming unwanted hair in the ears and nostrils. the built in LED lamp makes it very useful.</li>
