### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is awesome!</li>
      <li>These work great!  </li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re great for sneakers or flats.</li>
      <li>These work great.</li>
      <li>Provide good pain relief in shoes</li>
      <li>good product, protect the edge of the foot from rubbing</li>
      <li>It was good but was was torn after two days of use.</li>
      <li>If they had a normal size, I might consider them as the best corrective product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I accidently purchased another brand, which I love, and am keeping these as a spare pair.</li>
      <li>I bought another Ace-bandage-like product that works better for me.</li>
      <li>Perhaps because they are not being inflamed or injured any more, they just haven&#x27;t grown.  </li>
      <li>but they are not awful.</li>
      <li>I am still able to use the inbetwinn toe portion.  </li>
      <li>easy to use</li>
      <li>these separators are so comfortable you don&#x27;t even feel you have them on.</li>
      <li>It doesnt fit in to my toe.  </li>
      <li>They stay on through the night, are comfortable, light, and keep my toes from rubbing.</li>
      <li>They are as well made as the others, and comfortable.</li>
      <li>I really haven&#x27;t used these enough to give them a fair rating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>however they tend to slide around in your sock and shoes unless you get your sock on just right.</li>
      <li>Most spacers have a size based on the general population.  </li>
      <li>These things are great, they stay in place because they fit around your big toe, and they hold my toe out enough so that it doesn&#x27;t push in on my middle toes.</li>
      <li>They absolutely need to reduce the size of the stretchers.  </li>
      <li>I use cushions with the toe loop but without the toes spacer with most other shoes.</li>
      <li>Not sure that I love these</li>
      <li>so they are nice and cool unless you do not like that because you have cold feet like</li>
      <li>I have a tiny bunion and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much but after using the gel separator it does not hurt at all...</li>
      <li>it is too soft that I dont think it will correct my toe bone.</li>
      <li>This really protects and straightens my big toe...</li>
      <li>My toe is feeling much better after a few weeks of daily wear.</li>
      <li>It seems to wear well, but not sure if can help readjust my bunion, maybe waited too long for that to happen, but comfortable</li>
      <li>Only works when I have them on I don&#x27;t think they will every straighten my toes completely because you cant have them in long enough</li>

<li> not had it long so hoping it works over time</li>
<li> These lasted a long time, the material isn&#x27;t too sturdy so they should not be worn for vigorous activities.</li>
<li> think these came from somewhere else and were a long time getting</li>
<li> And it took a long time to ship to US from Shenzen,China</li>
<li> These are a little weird to get used to at first but then very comfy after I got used to them.</li>
<li> I have tried about 3 other products and this is the only one that works on me.</li>
<li> I hike and work out and in the past few months my left foot bunions have really started causing pain- to the point where I was considering surgery.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re the only things I&#x27;ve found that actually work, after trying a few things that didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> The product was not what I expected.  </li>
<li> They help to correct the problem caused by the other shoes.</li>
<li> The only complaint is that the outer gel side ripped off the inbetwinn toe part.  </li>
<li> These are not very comfortable.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
<li> after I wore these for a few weeks the pain went away.</li>
<li> sometimes I have very bad bunion pain and can hardly walk and put these on and it helps big time but sometimes after having them on for so long they start to hurt my toes and make my skin dry out and peel between my toes.</li>
<li> Just useless, won&#x27;t stay in place, cannot wear it under your shoes, do not protect.</li>
<li> They do help seperate your toes (for those of us who have painful bunions)</li>

    <li> The product was not what I expected.  It doesnt fit in to my toe.  it is too soft that I dont think it will correct my toe bone.</li>
    <li> These lasted a long time, the material isn&#x27;t too sturdy so they should not be worn for vigorous activities.</li>
    <li> Not sure that I love these but they are not awful. They do help seperate your toes (for those of us who have painful bunions) however they tend to slide around in your sock and shoes unless you get your sock on just right. They are gel so they are nice and cool unless you do not like that because you have cold feet like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not say do not buy them, just do not expect them to perform miracles.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wear the sandals that go between my toes either -- these feel a lot like that.  I bought another Ace-bandage-like product that works better for me.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! The Dr said I was going to need surgery because I was in constant pain, after I wore these for a few weeks the pain went away.</li>
    <li> sometimes I have very bad bunion pain and can hardly walk and put these on and it helps big time but sometimes after having them on for so long they start to hurt my toes and make my skin dry out and peel between my toes. Only works when I have them on I don&#x27;t think they will every straighten my toes completely because you cant have them in long enough</li>
    <li> Toe Gel  works for me.  You can wear it 24-7.  The only complaint is that the outer gel side ripped off the inbetwinn toe part.  I am still able to use the inbetwinn toe portion.  I have problems with only one toe.  After three weeks the pain is beginning to subside.</li>
    <li> It seems to wear well, but not sure if can help readjust my bunion, maybe waited too long for that to happen, but comfortable</li>
    <li> Just useless, won&#x27;t stay in place, cannot wear it under your shoes, do not protect. And it took a long time to ship to US from Shenzen,China</li>
    <li> This really protects and straightens my big toe...again a plus that I can wear it with sandles and tennis shoes.</li>
    <li> Most spacers have a size based on the general population.  I have a size 10 foot, male, 5&amp;#34; 10&amp;#34; inches in height.  These spacers ARE BIG.  It hurts to wear them.  They absolutely need to reduce the size of the stretchers.  If they had a normal size, I might consider them as the best corrective product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Definitely can&#x27;t wear these with open toed shoes or pointy pumps but they&#x27;re great for sneakers or flats. They help to correct the problem caused by the other shoes. I use cushions with the toe loop but without the toes spacer with most other shoes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> good product, protect the edge of the foot from rubbing</li>
    <li> For friend -- didn&#x27;t use -- can&#x27;t rate.</li>
    <li> I accidently purchased another brand, which I love, and am keeping these as a spare pair. They are as well made as the others, and comfortable. No problem wearing with shoes.</li>
    <li> These are a little weird to get used to at first but then very comfy after I got used to them.</li>
    <li> I can actually wear shoes again and I think my bunions have not progressed in size.  Perhaps because they are not being inflamed or injured any more, they just haven&#x27;t grown.  I won&#x27;t go out without them.  They have to be rinsed every day, just as you would your toes.</li>
    <li> These work great!  They stay on through the night, are comfortable, light, and keep my toes from rubbing. They&#x27;re the only things I&#x27;ve found that actually work, after trying a few things that didn&#x27;t. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I hike and work out and in the past few months my left foot bunions have really started causing pain- to the point where I was considering surgery. These things are great, they stay in place because they fit around your big toe, and they hold my toe out enough so that it doesn&#x27;t push in on my middle toes. I have tried about 3 other products and this is the only one that works on me. I wear it every time I hike or run and it does the job.</li>
    <li> These are not very comfortable.  I only wear them at night.  I can&#x27;t even imagine trying to squeeze them into a pair of shoes.</li>
    <li> easy to use&lt;br /&gt;just slip it on and wear it under your stockings all day&lt;br /&gt;hardly realize it is there&lt;br /&gt;have not had it long so hoping it works over time</li>
    <li> I have a tiny bunion and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much but after using the gel separator it does not hurt at all...these separators are so comfortable you don&#x27;t even feel you have them on.</li>
    <li> It was good but was was torn after two days of use. I think it can,t  be used in shoes</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t used these enough to give them a fair rating.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered several different things for the feet about the same time.&lt;br /&gt;I think these came from somewhere else and were a long time getting&lt;br /&gt;here, so I got use to the others.</li>
    <li> These work great. My toe is feeling much better after a few weeks of daily wear.</li>
    <li> Provide good pain relief in shoes</li>
