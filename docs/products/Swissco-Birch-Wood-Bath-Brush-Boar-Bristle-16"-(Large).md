### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is a great brush to use in the shower !</li>
      <li>I ordered this because I&#x27;d read that boar bristle&#x27;s are the best for body brushing.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased this bath brush because of the awesome reviews I have seen.</li>
      <li>They are  perfect for my skin.</li>
      <li>I was impressed when the brush arrived.</li>
      <li>This brush is one of the best I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Best looking brush</li>
      <li>A very good value.  </li>
      <li>It is very good.  </li>
      <li>Great brush and great pricing.</li>
      <li>but it is great.</li>
      <li>Its SO good, it keeps disappearing from my bathroom.</li>
      <li>Quality appears good.</li>
      <li>I love this brush !</li>
      <li>so this is OK !  </li>
      <li>Strong, smooth handle and an excellent quality brush!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much the makers of this great product !</li>
      <li>but it did slip out of my hands many times, but I always was able to catch it lol ...  </li>
      <li>I have seen others that have had this for many years &amp; I am so far very very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Thsi is a great looking brush for a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>because it was one piece, had a straight handle and looked beautifully finished.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pleasingly smooth construction, very attractive, has put up with....unconventional use without a problem (wink wink, say n&#x27;more...) and is the kind of simple beautiful that good design naturally conveys.  </li>
      <li>Still loving it.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As of Aug, 2013, my brush is still going strong.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is the best back brush I&#x27;ve owned to date.</li>
      <li>When I remember to check for it before I step into the shower, its lovely on the skin, fits the hand nicely, and is a comfortable length.</li>
      <li>Still LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I keep my shower brush in the shower as I suspect most people do.</li>
      <li>The best thing about the brush is it is one solid piece of wood vs a head with a seperate stick insert.</li>
      <li>If those issues are not a problem for you, then it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight, easy to handle, and has superior scrubbing effectiveness compared to the first one.  </li>
      <li>but I would think if you were willing to spend the money it would be nice to have a better quality brush than this one.  </li>
      <li>It really did have a beautiful finish and the bristles were just the right stiffness for me.</li>
      <li>Very pleased and the delivery was fast.  </li>
      <li>Mine worked fine for 3 years</li>
      <li>Plastic handle does fine</li>
      <li>the length is perfect and the handle is sturdy (2 previous plastic ones broke).</li>
      <li>Nice brush and very well packaged.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s designed with edges rather than a smooth handle.  </li>
      <li>great back scratcher.</li>
      <li>So far so good with this bath brush.  </li>
      <li>I am enjoying this bath brush very much...</li>
      <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t compare in quality to my original brush from Crabtree and Evelyn.</li>
      <li>Works great for dry OMG</li>
      <li>This brush feels soft and smooth and it helps my soap to lather nicely.</li>
      <li>The wooden handle was a pleasant surprise after using plastic ones for years.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of bristles to hold and lather the soap, yet easily rinsed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Right length; easy to hold onto.</li>
      <li>All wood, none of the plastic brush face, and cheap bristles found on so many models these days - This is a classic.</li>
      <li>Full disclosure:  </li>
      <li>This is only the second bath brush I have ever used, and it is also the best.  </li>
      <li>I have used several different types and for the $$, this is the best.</li>
      <li>The bristles lather up easily and the texture is perfect, not too stiff and not too soft.  </li>
      <li>However, after the very first day a crack appeared in the wood.</li>
      <li>I owned a brush that I purched more than ten years ago from Crabtree and Evelyn which worked fine until it cracked.</li>
      <li>This is my third back brush that I have had and the absolute best.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brush so far.</li>
      <li>Other than that it is a good product for the money.</li>
      <li>On my very first purchase I must have been sent a defective item the first time.</li>
      <li>Works just right.</li>
      <li>so my soap would fall right out of the brush.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>Handle is nice and long tho!</li>
      <li>The long handle makes it very easy to use.</li>
      <li>The wood started to crack within the first two weeks and began discoloring as well.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found many wooden  brushes that don&#x27;t do this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m back to order another after this one has seen more than 2 1/2 years of service.</li>
      <li>I recommend this bath brush to anyone who  is looking for a sturdy reliable bath brush that will last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It crackled &amp; started flaking off after the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>It works really well and the wooden format is elegantly crafted.</li>
      <li>That positive review was an error.  </li>
      <li>The first two that I purchased had way too much space between the bristles</li>
      <li>; (Large)]]</li>
      <li>Ithas certainly lasted longer than the one I bought from Target, which I had to return after two months, but it does already have a crack in the wood.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and a reasonable price for the quality.</li>
      <li>This product was constructed very well and met my expectations.  </li>
      <li>is the real thing.</li>
      <li>so much, I think I&#x27;ll go ahead and order the Swissco nail brush.</li>
      <li>I go through those plastic/nylon brushes way too fast.</li>
      <li>But as other have said, the top cracked after a month or so and the bristles started to fall out.  </li>
      <li>Wish it had a BIT more severe curve to really scritch the back, also a bit stiffer bristles, which may not be possible.  </li>
      <li>The presentation is excellent, but the bristles are a little hard.</li>
      <li>so I cant really compare, but it did work ok for a little bit.  </li>
      <li>One reviewer recommended leaving it head-side up, so I have been, as I live in a very humid climate.</li>
      <li>Probably just my particular brush</li>
      <li>I love how the bristles are soft and not to rough.</li>
      <li>The bristles hold a goodly amount of bath-soap to clean those hard to reach places in the middle of my back</li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s hoping it will hold up to normal use.</li>
      <li>and it is still like new.</li>
      <li>If that is all that happens, I&#x27;m fine with a crack, but I&#x27;m concerned that the head will crack all the way in half.</li>
      <li>The bristles are just right- not harsh but firm enough and the handle is nice and long.  </li>
      <li>Imwrote a positive review earlier for a brush made by Earth Therapeutics.</li>
      <li>This Bath Brush is much nicer quality than you&#x27;ll find in your average bath/drug/discount store, yet the price is very reasonable.</li>
      <li>Works great to stir your bath if you are a bath-person, in addition to scrubbing bits it is awkward to reach.</li>
      <li>After about three weeks, it looked three years old</li>
      <li>I find that the bristle is too soft.  </li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t lather-up like my old brush.</li>
      <li>I do not have anything else much to say; am just writing this sentence in order to exceed the 20-word minimum noted above.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft, but do the job.  </li>
      <li>I threw it out after that as I had pretty much gotten too lazy to use it anyway.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Right length; easy to hold onto. Bristles hold up well.</li>
    <li> I like this brush.  The bristles are just right- not harsh but firm enough and the handle is nice and long.  I have had similar brushes before and the downside of the wood is that it eventually develops a crack.</li>
    <li> I like this brush, bristles are not too hard and it reaches my center back just right. Works just right.</li>
    <li> I bought this [[ASIN:B000ROKSYC Swissco Birch Wood Bath Brush Boar Bristle 16&amp;#34; (Large)]] because it was one piece, had a straight handle and looked beautifully finished. I naively thought that with that comparitvely high price, it might last longer than other brushes I&#x27;ve had.  I was impressed when the brush arrived. It really did have a beautiful finish and the bristles were just the right stiffness for me. By day two the wood around the base of the bristles had turned black and by day five, the nice brown finish had begun to flake off, exposing the pale wood underneath. After about three weeks, it looked three years old and I threw it out.  I won&#x27;t be buying from Swissco again.  Edit: Shortly after writing the above review, I discovered that Acca Capa makes a bath brush with real bristles embedded in a one-piece, dense plastic head and handle. It was pricy, at about $45, but I bought one anyway. Four years later, July 2015 and it is still like new. The bristles have gotten a little softer, but otherwise it shows no signs of deterioration at all. Well with the extra money.</li>
    <li> Thsi is a great looking brush for a very reasonable price. The wooden handle was a pleasant surprise after using plastic ones for years. It should last a long time.</li>
    <li> The wood has cracked on the head which is letting the bristles fall out. I have had other wooden brushes that have gone 4-5 years before bristles started coming out. Handle is nice and long tho!</li>
    <li> This brush is one of the best I have ever had. It works really well and the wooden format is elegantly crafted. I do not have anything else much to say; am just writing this sentence in order to exceed the 20-word minimum noted above.</li>
    <li> The best thing about the brush is it is one solid piece of wood vs a head with a seperate stick insert. Several people have said it split down the middle. The way to fix this is place standing up on a shower shelf with the head upright. Do not hang by cord. Mine worked fine for 3 years and this is my second one.</li>
    <li> It is very good.  Since I live in a humid climate, I must be diligent about hanging it afterwards so it can dry out thoroughly .  Plastic handle does fine but mold can grow between the bristles if it doesn&#x27;t air dry completely!  I have used several different types and for the $$, this is the best.</li>
    <li> Swissco Birch Wood Bath Brush Boar Bristle 16&amp;#34; (Large)&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Cosmetic Solutions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best back brush I&#x27;ve owned to date. I&#x27;m back to order another after this one has seen more than 2 1/2 years of service. It lost very few bristles over the years and appears just as full as the day it arrived. The bristles are right at the Goldilocks level - not too stiff, not too soft. Just the right amount of bristles to hold and lather the soap, yet easily rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much, I think I&#x27;ll go ahead and order the Swissco nail brush. I go through those plastic/nylon brushes way too fast.</li>
    <li> The base of the brush cracks/splinters within a month of using it. Haven&#x27;t found many wooden  brushes that don&#x27;t do this.</li>
    <li> Bristles too short - doesn&#x27;t lather-up like my old brush. Quality appears good.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I&#x27;d read that boar bristle&#x27;s are the best for body brushing.  I find that the bristle is too soft.  Also the design of the handle hurts my hands.  It&#x27;s designed with edges rather than a smooth handle.  Unfortunately, this was a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my third back brush that I have had and the absolute best. Granted, it was the most expensive one that I&#x27;ve purchased but it is great. The first two that I purchased had way too much space between the bristles so my soap would fall right out of the brush. They were also prickly and uncomfortable on my back.  This brush feels soft and smooth and it helps my soap to lather nicely. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is only the second bath brush I have ever used, and it is also the best.  It is lightweight, easy to handle, and has superior scrubbing effectiveness compared to the first one.  The bristles are just stiff enough to give a good scrub, but not so much as to be unpleasant.  I believe if I keep it dry between uses (store with brush end up as others have advised), it will last a long time and maintain its usefulness.  I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The presentation is excellent, but the bristles are a little hard. I ewait that in time they will turn softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is elegant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package is very big.</li>
    <li> Works well, bristles not falling out. Scrub scrub scrub!</li>
    <li> Wish it had been a little longer and wider. Other than that it is a good product for the money.</li>
    <li> the brush is what we wanted and we are using it in the shower every day. However, after the very first day a crack appeared in the wood. So far it hasn&#x27;t gotten any worse but I assume it won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> All wood, none of the plastic brush face, and cheap bristles found on so many models these days - This is a classic.</li>
    <li> I keep my shower brush in the shower as I suspect most people do. I owned a brush that I purched more than ten years ago from Crabtree and Evelyn which worked fine until it cracked. When it was time to replace the Crabtree and Evelyn brush, they no longer carried the same brush. I searched Amazon.com and discovered this brush. It had a long handle for back scrubbing and it was reasonably priced. However, it developed a large crack on the back of the wooden brush within a few months. The brush doesn&#x27;t compare in quality to my original brush from Crabtree and Evelyn. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> 1st shower and the finish already cracked and crazed. It&#x27;s not going to last very long. The &amp;#34;swissco&amp;#34; had me sold I think.</li>
    <li> I like the look of it and it functions well. Ithas certainly lasted longer than the one I bought from Target, which I had to return after two months, but it does already have a crack in the wood. If that is all that happens, I&#x27;m fine with a crack, but I&#x27;m concerned that the head will crack all the way in half. Here&#x27;s hoping it will hold up to normal use.</li>
    <li> great back scratcher. Got one for the shower too.</li>
    <li> Not quite as long as I needed</li>
    <li> FOR THOSE HARD TO REACH PLACES.</li>
    <li> This Bath Brush is much nicer quality than you&#x27;ll find in your average bath/drug/discount store, yet the price is very reasonable. A very good value.  The bristles are soft, but do the job.  The handle is a little bit slippery, because there is no grip marks, but this is a minor complaint and may actually keep the item cleaner as there aren&#x27;t crevices to collect mildew.  After all, the thing does hang in the shower all the time.  Very pleased and the delivery was fast.  I would recommend this item and the seller.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this bath brush because of the awesome reviews I have seen. On my very first purchase I must have been sent a defective item the first time. It cracked right down the middle on the wood part. This happens in mass production I understand so this is OK !  I have had the bath brush now for a few weeks and have use it several times with no problems. I love how the bristles are soft and not to rough. They are  perfect for my skin. I love this brush ! Especially because this bath brush has no plastic that will detach the bristles from the handle. I have seen others that have had this for many years &amp; I am so far very very happy with this purchase. I absolutely love this brush so far. I recommend this bath brush to anyone who  is looking for a sturdy reliable bath brush that will last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;I like how this brush makes the lather foam up  with all types of soaps I use daily. Thank you so much the makers of this great product !</li>
    <li> If those issues are not a problem for you, then it&#x27;s a pretty good product. Strong, smooth handle and an excellent quality brush!</li>
    <li> Terrible brush for the price point. The birch wood started splitting in less than 1 week of use.</li>
    <li> Imwrote a positive review earlier for a brush made by Earth Therapeutics. That positive review was an error.  The poor relative quality of that product was what motivated me to write the positive review for what I thought was this brush.&lt;br /&gt;This is the real thing. The other is am imposter.  Sorry for the confusion.</li>
    <li> Nice brush and very well packaged. Fast shipping and a reasonable price for the quality. The long handle makes it very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Used this brush once and worked like it should. The next time I used it I noticed cracks in the wood and the bristles are falling out where the cracks forming.</li>
    <li> Wish it had a BIT more severe curve to really scritch the back, also a bit stiffer bristles, which may not be possible.  I&#x27;ve attempted CLEANING (as in house and tile) brushes for this (the handle is never right) so I may be a person who likes particularly hard bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleasingly smooth construction, very attractive, has put up with....unconventional use without a problem (wink wink, say n&#x27;more...) and is the kind of simple beautiful that good design naturally conveys.  Works great to stir your bath if you are a bath-person, in addition to scrubbing bits it is awkward to reach. Full disclosure:  I&#x27;m a smallboned average-to-underweight person, which may matter to you.  Works great for dry OMG AN ITCH problems, too.</li>
    <li> Its SO good, it keeps disappearing from my bathroom. When I remember to check for it before I step into the shower, its lovely on the skin, fits the hand nicely, and is a comfortable length. One reviewer recommended leaving it head-side up, so I have been, as I live in a very humid climate. Still loving it.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As of Aug, 2013, my brush is still going strong. Carefully keeping it dry, outside of shower, between uses. Still LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Bristles firm enough to do the job without feeling like they&#x27;re &amp;#34;tearing up&amp;#34; your skin.  Best looking brush I&#x27;ve had, too.</li>
    <li> So far so good with this bath brush.  The bristles hold a goodly amount of bath-soap to clean those hard to reach places in the middle of my back</li>
    <li> Sturdy handle, soft brush, but peels/wears terribly if left in shower.</li>
    <li> Bristles came out after short time usage.  Purchased another (same brand) from Bed, Bath and Beyond with same results.  Suggest product be reviewed.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this bath brush very much...the length is perfect and the handle is sturdy (2 previous plastic ones broke).</li>
    <li> Great brush and great pricing. I wish the handle was a bit longer. The bristles lather up easily and the texture is perfect, not too stiff and not too soft.  It works with bar soap and bath gels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an interior designer and needed an accessory for inside a teak shower, with a spa look!  Going for spa or yacht?  This works!</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t have an actual finish, just a thickly painted on imitation veneer.  It crackled &amp; started flaking off after the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had one before so I cant really compare, but it did work ok for a little bit.  The handle was way too slippery though and I never &amp;#34;dropped&amp;#34; it to the ground but it did slip out of my hands many times, but I always was able to catch it lol ...  But as other have said, the top cracked after a month or so and the bristles started to fall out.  I threw it out after that as I had pretty much gotten too lazy to use it anyway.  I would not tell anyone to buy this.  As I said before I have never had a different one but I would think if you were willing to spend the money it would be nice to have a better quality brush than this one.  But if your not willing to spend the money, then don&#x27;t spend any money and go without because it will be wasted on this brush.</li>
    <li> The wood started to crack within the first two weeks and began discoloring as well. Probably just my particular brush but I already scrubbed my butt with it, don&#x27;t think they want it back.</li>
    <li> This product was constructed very well and met my expectations.  It is a great brush to use in the shower !</li>
