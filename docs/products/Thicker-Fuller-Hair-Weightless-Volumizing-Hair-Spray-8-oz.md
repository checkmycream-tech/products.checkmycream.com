      <li>Great hairspray I will continue using it as long as they keep making it!</li>
      <li>I have to pull off the hardened hairspray and clean it off each and every time...</li>
      <li>This is my FAVORITE hairspray that holds lightly but very well.</li>
      <li>Although it may have appeared thicker, that was the only thing it was good for...</li>
      <li>Such a good deal.</li>
      <li>It looks as though I have a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>This one really does give you more volume.</li>
      <li>I too loved this hairspray and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else until they changed it and totally wrecked it!</li>
      <li>Coming from a super finicky user - this stuff is a home run.</li>
      <li>super brand..</li>
      <li>I do see that if I need to order some more before going back to Michigan, Amazon.com has a better price than Rite-Aid.com.    </li>
      <li>I could not believe the volume it gave me the very first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine and this makes it feel and look so much thicker than it is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not always the most touchable, as it gives a slightly gritty finish for texture, but I can always count on it giving reliable hold &amp; texture to the shape of my style.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>It is definitely one of the better products for thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I was not aware if the other volumizing oriducts in the line and am very happy I decided to branch out and try others.  </li>
      <li>I love this hair spray and it is the only one I have used for years!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, nothing will ever keep my hair perfect.  </li>
      <li>The last one was still 3/4 full!</li>
      <li>This hairspray is  great if you want a hairspray that holds your hair where you want it for the entire evening, without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>Whom ever came up with the new formulation should be fired !!</li>
      <li>This is the BEST hairspray for fine, thin hair !!!</li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>Very sticky.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much, it holds very well.</li>
      <li>spray really holds my hair in place and has practically no fragrance.  </li>
      <li>it really does make your hair feel and look thicker</li>
      <li>Thanks for listening.</li>
      <li>and it still is better than any other spray I&#x27;ve tried to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s back to the original fragrance and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
      <li>Light hairspray doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or make it greasy, yet it flexibly holds hair style.its hard to find this product &amp; amazon offers at a great price.</li>
      <li>Why do companies (and producers ;) always have to mess with the fine thing that worked to start with.</li>
      <li>having the burden of extremely baby-fine and thin hair, this hairspray is the best i&#x27;ve found.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does not weight hair down and brushes out easily.  </li>
      <li>Reminds me of Coca-Cola&#x27;s decision to change to \\&quot;New</li>
      <li>It holds my fine hair without weighting it down.  </li>
      <li>This year I purchased about 14 cans to bring down with me--some of them were buy 1 get 1 free.  </li>
      <li>I have fine curly frizzy hair when air dried.</li>
      <li>It holds and is not stiff</li>
      <li>Hair does not look natural when sprayed.</li>
      <li>BUT STILL FEELS SOFT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Thicker Fuller Hair spray for several years and find it really does make my hair thicker and fuller.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve learned not to spray too much of it on my hair because too much can make your hair sticky and matted down.</li>
      <li>I used to need the super stiff hairspray for hold before</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to stop using it and just go back to my old brand.</li>
      <li>I have soft hair that lies flat.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I too loved this hairspray and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else until they changed it and totally wrecked it! It now smells like a barnyard and makes my hair feel terrible.What were they thinking ? Whom ever came up with the new formulation should be fired !! Why wreck a great product.  Please change it back !      December 2010, Thank goodness they heard us and changed it back. It&#x27;s back to the original fragrance and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. This is the only hairspray that works in the rainy season. Thanks for listening.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is wonderful...especially if you have fine or thin hair.  They no longer carry it in my department stores, so I have been ordering online for a couple of years now....it holds without any heaviness and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard.</li>
    <li> Good ,light hairspray</li>
    <li> 1.RATING IS FOR THE &#x27;OLD&#x27; PRODUCT:  LOVE, LOVE, LOVED IT.  BUT ------  2.But as I get on to order... I am struck by these reviews and did not know the one and only product I&#x27;ve ever found to work on my sparse, baby-fine hair, is no longer as it was.      It dulled my hair, sooo I used a shine spray... Otherwise, it truly was the only hair product I&#x27;ve EVER found that enabled a great style for me.      I will indeed be finding the web site and letting them know I need my excellent original product. Why do companies (and producers ;) always have to mess with the fine thing that worked to start with.</li>
    <li> I too LOVED this hairspray and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else - even bought it on-line when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. Then they changed the formula and TOTALLY wrecked it! The smell is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE and makes my hair feel terrible. What were they thinking? They wrecked a GREAT product. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only hairspray I have used for years.  It holds my fine hair without weighting it down.  The only place I can find it in Michigan is Rite-Aid Pharmacy, so while in Florida for 6 months I was ordering it online from them.  This year I purchased about 14 cans to bring down with me--some of them were buy 1 get 1 free.  For the first time this year, I have had 2 cans go bad and stop spraying.  The last one was still 3/4 full! I tried cleaning the nozzles, etc., but no luck.  I do see that if I need to order some more before going back to Michigan, Amazon.com has a better price than Rite-Aid.com.    If it wasn&#x27;t for the bad cans, I would have rated this product five stars.</li>
    <li> does what its supposed to do</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair spray for about 4 years now. The product lives up to what it&#x27;s claimed. The hair  looks fuller, it doesn&#x27;t leave white flake on the hair like some of other product do. You don&#x27;t need much, it holds very well. It does tend to dry out the hair but what hair spray don&#x27;t?</li>
    <li> This hairspray is  great if you want a hairspray that holds your hair where you want it for the entire evening, without weighing it down. The smell is not to strong. Great hairspray I will continue using it as long as they keep making it!</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Have been using it for about ten years and it still is better than any other spray I&#x27;ve tried to use.</li>
    <li> Coming from a super finicky user - this stuff is a home run. It gives my hair body and hold without stuff or stickiness.  It gives me the ability to have great hair on the second day without buildup.  I used to need the super stiff hairspray for hold before so I was skeptical the first day.  By midday, I was pleased that my hair hadn&#x27;t fallen. Then later that night I still had bounce and body.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, nothing will ever keep my hair perfect.  But it is as close as I have ever come.  Haven&#x27;t used anything in the past 4-5 years.  I have tried others, but have returned or thrown them away and returned to this.</li>
    <li> Very sticky. Hair does not look natural when sprayed.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist, this is beyond a doubt the best all around hair spray.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray and I order it whenever I run out.  It is not too stiff but holds any style well.&lt;br /&gt;It is sometimes hard to find in stores so I just order it online.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair it is great product</li>
    <li> This product seems to add volume to my hair but after a couple of uses it builds up and gets flakey and sticky.</li>
    <li> Moderately good product... not sure if I will repeat purchase...</li>
    <li> My daughter just loves this hair spray.  It&#x27;s not sticky and your hair has movement.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair or flatten it.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin &amp; fine - I use this with the Thicker Fuller Hair root lift spray &amp; Progaine Volumizing Shampoo. It looks as though I have a full head of hair. With just a tiny spray with this product I am set to go for the day. It holds well with a natural look - not stiff - Good product!!</li>
    <li> Love this product, this is my first time I have used it.  It holds and is not stiff</li>
    <li> Product is very sticky and stiff on hair, I don&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
    <li> super brand..I I great faith in your brand name..I will do repeats</li>
    <li> I always come back to this one. It just works. It keeps my fine hairstyle all day and evening intact.</li>
    <li> I had used this wonderful hairspray for years and loved it.  When they changed the formula earlier this year (2009) to include caffeine, I felt sick.  It smells terrible and no longer works like the old formula did.     Reminds me of Coca-Cola&#x27;s decision to change to \\&quot;New Coke\\&quot; many years ago.  They had to go back to the original Coke because people were so angry.  Same thing here.</li>
    <li> Not wild about this on my hair - not enough hold for me and makes my hair a bit oily.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray I&#x27;ve ever found. Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried most of them. This one really does give you more volume.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again. It is definitely one of the better products for thinning hair. It holds my hair better than any expensive salon product, and I have used them all.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It holds my hair in place all day no matter what the weather. I have soft hair that lies flat. This product gives fullness and body to the hair. It also easily brushes out at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I weaned myself off of my hair product &amp;#34;addiction&amp;#34; years ago, but there&#x27;s always a need for some hairspray sometimes for dressy occasions &amp; I always keep can of this hairspray at home (as well as at work). This is my FAVORITE hairspray that holds lightly but very well. It feels like an invisible hair net that holds my hair together into the shape I want without weighing it all down. I love it for holding the formed curl in my hair or for special-occasion hairspray. I always pack it for vacations. Easy &amp; pleasant to use (in light spritzes, not heavy-handed) &amp; washes out cleanly &amp; easily.  It&#x27;s not always the most touchable, as it gives a slightly gritty finish for texture, but I can always count on it giving reliable hold &amp; texture to the shape of my style.</li>
    <li> After styling my hair, I shake my head upside down and spray with this.  I could not believe the volume it gave me the very first time I used it.  I do use another finishing spray afterward, but I will never go without this unless the company stops making it.  I would recommend it to anyone needed a &#x27;boost&#x27; to their hair style.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray.  I hope to God they never stop making this.  My hair is fine and this makes it feel and look so much thicker than it is.</li>
    <li> great product.  it really does make your hair feel and look thicker</li>
    <li> This Item was purchased for my wife along with the Thickener. This is hard to find in stores and more expensive when you do. My wife loves this product line and i will continue to get it on-line for her through Amazon. Hifgly reccomend f anyone with thinning hair that needs more body.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair spray for over 10 years. It does what it says it will do. Gives you the feeling of having thicker, fuller, hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Pretty good but rather &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; when first sprayed...</li>
    <li> This product works very well.</li>
    <li> Light hairspray doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or make it greasy, yet it flexibly holds hair style.its hard to find this product &amp; amazon offers at a great price. Plus FREE shipping within 3-5 days.</li>
    <li> I absolutely am obsessed with this product.  It makes my hair so much thicker and has the best hold.  Such a good deal.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spray I have ever had!!! It doesn&#x27;t build up on your hair &amp; makes your hair look thicker!! Love it!!!SHERRY ERNATT</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT HAIRSPRAY, HOLDS THE HAIR BUT STILL FEELS SOFT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this before and will say again that this is an awesome hair spray. I used to be able to buy this in store, but for some reason, they stopped selling it.  I was livid, as I&#x27;d been buying this for years. My hair is fine and this does boost the volume.</li>
    <li> Gives great volume and hold my hair for days</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect much if you don&#x27;t have a thick head of hair, does make the hair stiff</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray for fine hair.  It does not weight hair down and brushes out easily.  Great product.</li>
    <li> For many years I used the shampoo from this line with satisfying results.  I was not aware if the other volumizing oriducts in the line and am very happy I decided to branch out and try others.  Good product.</li>
    <li> love the spray!!!  Hate the spray spout... get&#x27;s clogged after each use... I have to pull off the hardened hairspray and clean it off each and every time... Might switch just because I have never, ever had this happen with a hair spray can.</li>
    <li> I used this spray for the first time and it smells nasty. I&#x27;m going to stop using it and just go back to my old brand. Pantene has a volumizing spray that works much better and smells delicious. I wanted to try something different but I&#x27;m sorry I did.</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray and it is the only one I have used for years! It works really well and feels light and nice.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hairspray for fine, thin hair !!!</li>
    <li> Great hold, with no sticky residue, Terrific Product!</li>
    <li> This product works as it says but in a small quantity, you do not have to apply a large amount otherwise it wont work.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Was not happy with this purchase, it made my hair frizzy and unruly. Although it may have appeared thicker, that was the only thing it was good for...</li>
    <li> A hairspray that holds without the stick.  I have fine curly frizzy hair when air dried. After blow dry, style stays.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thicker Fuller Hair spray for several years and find it really does make my hair thicker and fuller. I&#x27;ve learned not to spray too much of it on my hair because too much can make your hair sticky and matted down. In the past, I bought Thicker Fuller Hair spray at a Rite Aid store but they seldom have it.</li>
    <li> This is a functional hairspray - and that&#x27;s all I can say about it. It will not make your hair any bigger or grow any faster, and the hairspray makes your hair very hard and easy to crack. I suggest a water-based hairspray rather than an alcohol-based one such as this. It&#x27;s much better for your hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> having the burden of extremely baby-fine and thin hair, this hairspray is the best i&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;if it&#x27;s ever discontinued i won&#x27;t be able to leave the house without a bag over my head.&lt;br /&gt;this spray really holds my hair in place and has practically no fragrance.  priced reasonably,&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for years, so am very glad amazon offers it.</li>
    <li> all naturak, no laquer.  how can I use ut to remove zSharpie markercstains if no.laquer?</li>
