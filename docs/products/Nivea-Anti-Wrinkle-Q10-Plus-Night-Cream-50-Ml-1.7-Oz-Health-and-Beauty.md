      <li>So glad I found this company to order my wonderful Nivea Anti Wrinkle Cream with Q10 from.</li>
      <li>Love this cream, not greasy and goes on nicely!!!</li>

      <li>Awesome, already can see improvement in fine lines.  </li>
      <li>Arrived in good condition</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>Try it, you will love it!</li>
      <li>This along with Nivea Activa is by far the best Face cream out there.</li>
      <li>although I have not seen that much of a significant difference, it just feels good when I put it on before bed (after washing and toning) and when I wake up my skin feels more supple and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE the way my skin looks without makeup now.  </li>
      <li>I never knew where to begin when it came to a nighttime moisturizer (as there are so many out there)</li>
      <li>and I have shared this with my friends and they love it also.</li>
      <li>Price was more than I used to pay</li>
      <li>I love the smell and consistency of this cream.  </li>
      <li>I just love this cream.  </li>
      <li>Has a nice light floral scent.</li>
      <li>Love this cream.</li>
      <li>Very soothing and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This cream smells amazing, feels amazing and has really improved the look and texture of my skin.  </li>
      <li>Not seeing great changes so far, I&#x27;ll wait till I finish this jar to rate it again.</li>
      <li>that I like to put on as a mask before bed and then just before retiring I smooth and massage it into my face, neck and décolleté.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The four stars are actually a split rating: 5 stars for the cream--which is one of the best face creams ever made--and 3 stars for implying that you will absolutely be receiving the \\&quot;made in Germany\\&quot; product as shown.</li>
      <li>Plus quite by accident after using doctor prescribed Retin-A for years and years (no granny wants wrinkles!!!).</li>
      <li>CoQ10 ARE THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
      <li>At 36 I started seeing wrinkles on my forehead, but this cream has helped tremendously.  </li>
      <li>Price a little high, but the quality, and end results adde great!!</li>
      <li>It is the best way I&#x27;ve found to keep red dry patches on my face at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>worth the wait and price</li>
      <li>and I am enjoying this product so far.</li>
      <li>However, it makes my face feel soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>The most unexpected bonus has been the brightness my skin now has.  </li>
      <li>I use Nivea&#x27;s deodorant that comes from Germany, that I like very much.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, the fact that this CoQ10 cream is no longer distributed in the US is, I believe, the primary cause of the \\&quot;presumptions\\&quot; that the ONLY ORIGINAL Nivea CoQ10 cream that could be found was cream still manufactured at Nivea&#x27;s home-facility in Beiersdorf, Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTELY</li>
      <li>I am glad you can get the European versions here.</li>
      <li>I have no idea because, unfortunately, I no longer have the box to make any comparisons.&lt;br</li>
      <li>More later.</li>
      <li>Most others make me scratch and give me red blotches.</li>
      <li>but now I am trying to be consistent and cost efficient with the products I choose and use on my face</li>
      <li>After being without it for several years, was so glad to see it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Third-party sellers have been quick to mark-up their products as being \\&quot;the original cream from Germany,\\&quot; implying that the ingredients may be different if the label is not in German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Third-party sellers have been quick to mark-up their products as being \\&quot;the original cream from Germany,\\&quot; implying that the ingredients may be different if the label is not in German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the only cream she claims moisturizes her face perfectly and doesn&#x27;t dry back afterward.</li>
      <li>Not only is Nivea much better, in my opinion, but it made my skin much smoother and softer to the touch and</li>
      <li>Thanks to Nivea Q10 cream, my year long search for appropriate cream for aging skin is over.</li>
      <li>Have tried others but nothing worked to keep my face adequately moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>Good as usual, fast deliver from Uk</li>
      <li>Certainly hasn&#x27;t kept me from aging, though, as life has intruded.</li>
      <li>it definitely is a super help with softening up fine lines, just start using it early enough in life and continue the rest of your life.  </li>
      <li>Will absolutely re-order when I&#x27;m out.  </li>
      <li>and i really like the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
      <li>delivery fast from UK.</li>
      <li>It has really helped my flare-ups.  </li>
      <li>But is this the actual original formula?</li>
      <li>I plan on getting the coordinating Q10 Plus Day Cream but for now I use the original Nivea cream in the Navy Blue tin (this cream is quite dense but my thirsty skin soaks it up like nothing).</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this night cream to anyone needing intense moisture at night and a boost in skin brightness, texture and pore refinement.</li>
      <li>The cream has a lovely scent and has a light, whipped texture (a little goes a long way).</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using for a month with the exact same positive results.</li>
      <li>and I find that Nivea results are far better than other brand.</li>
      <li>I have very dry skin and have read many reviews of various products of the Nivea skincare line.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and</li>
      <li>CoQ10 ARE THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.AME for BOTH products, the are also the SAME regardless of whether the cream was made in Germany (with the label in German) or from Poland, Mexico, Thailand, or Maylasia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to be able to purchase this in stores and then was not able to it find anymore.  </li>
      <li>I know this because I received an Amazon email question about the product from someone wanting to know if it WAS the German product, and I was able to see the responses from other purchasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my 18 year old granddaughter raves about</li>
      <li>Regenerative Skin Serum is all I need for baby soft skin all winter in the Chicago area when the snow and the wind are blowing.  </li>
      <li>(You may want to go directly to my update.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good product, a bit expensive, but leaves my skin silky when I get up in the morning.  </li>
      <li>Grandma, you have the prettiest skin, and I hope when I am your age mine is half as nice.\\&quot;  Not a bad compliment to get for someone pushing 70, huh?  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many things and spent much money the past 10 years</li>
      <li>The product I received from Poland [just over the border from Germany] smelled as I remembered, same Nivea thickness, and I definitely notice a difference in the depth of some significant 65 yr old wrinkles in just a few weeks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme is in the same glass container (though white and with a fancier lid), also made in Europe and, aside from a slightly different color and no scent (much preferred) seems to be the same stuff.</li>
      <li>naturally it will not get totally rid of wrinkles, only surgery can do that, but your lines will become so soft that no one notices them.  </li>
      <li>&quot; Not only are the ingredients the EXACT SAME for BOTH products, the are also the SAME regardless of whether the cream was made in Germany (with the label in German) or from Poland, Mexico, Thailand, or Maylasia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am 30 years old, have combination to dry skin and wanted to start a skin care routine to ward of wrinkles.  </li>

<li> It took a long time for me to receive it</li>
<li> Plus, I like that its rooted in German ingenuity and if I ever go back to vacationing in or around Germany , I will definitely be picking a few of these up for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;There are two slightly different packages used: One is listed as \\&quot;Nivea CoQ10\\&quot; and the other is \\&quot;Nivea Visage CoQ10.\\</li>
<li> My skin was really dry until I found this product.</li>
<li> Of the reviews posted, several received the actual German product; others received \\&quot;made in Poland\\&quot; cream; and at least one customer received cream \\&quot;made in Thailand.\\&quot;</li>
<li> Searched for a long time for this product only to find Not available in the USA any longer.</li>
<li> She is 74 and has very dry skin.</li>
<li> but I suppose that is to be expected.  </li>

    <li> Not seeing great changes so far, I&#x27;ll wait till I finish this jar to rate it again.</li>
    <li> perfect! delivery fast from UK. I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> I have Psoriasis and every now and then it flares up on my face.  Here lately, it has been bad.  I have tried all kinds of face creams and nothing helps.  I use Nivea&#x27;s deodorant that comes from Germany, that I like very much.  In searching for it, I found that they have face cream.  I read the reviews and decided to try it.  It has really helped my flare-ups.  They are practically non-existant. I have now decided to try the body lotion.  I ordered that yesterday.  We will see how that goes.  More later.</li>
    <li> I found Nivea Anti Wrinkle Night Cream with Q10 Plus quite by accident after using doctor prescribed Retin-A for years and years (no granny wants wrinkles!!!). Not only is Nivea much better, in my opinion, but it made my skin much smoother and softer to the touch and my 18 year old granddaughter raves about it everytime she is around me.  She is forever grabbing my cheeks and rubbing them and saying \\&quot;Oh Grandma, you have the prettiest skin, and I hope when I am your age mine is half as nice.\\&quot;  Not a bad compliment to get for someone pushing 70, huh?  So glad I found this company to order my wonderful Nivea Anti Wrinkle Cream with Q10 from.</li>
    <li> hard to get in stores, my wife swears by it.</li>
    <li> Good product, a bit expensive, but leaves my skin silky when I get up in the morning.  Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. It makes my face feel moisturized and leaves no oily residue. I use it during the day as well as at night.</li>
    <li> Have been ordering this from all over the world for five years. It is the best way I&#x27;ve found to keep red dry patches on my face at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my last Amazon order took too long (six weeks) to arrive I went looking at my local pharmacy for something else to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme is in the same glass container (though white and with a fancier lid), also made in Europe and, aside from a slightly different color and no scent (much preferred) seems to be the same stuff. I&#x27;ve been using for a month with the exact same positive results.</li>
    <li> I just love this cream.  Feeld great and smells wonderful.  It took a long time for me to receive it but that&#x27;s because it shipped from the UK.  Will absolutely re-order when I&#x27;m out.  Price was great too.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have read many reviews of various products of the Nivea skincare line. I never knew where to begin when it came to a nighttime moisturizer (as there are so many out there) but I knew I needed to get something substantial without breaking the bank. I have been using this for several months and although I have not seen that much of a significant difference, it just feels good when I put it on before bed (after washing and toning) and when I wake up my skin feels more supple and hydrated. The cream has a lovely scent and has a light, whipped texture (a little goes a long way). I plan on getting the coordinating Q10 Plus Day Cream but for now I use the original Nivea cream in the Navy Blue tin (this cream is quite dense but my thirsty skin soaks it up like nothing). Plus, I like that its rooted in German ingenuity and if I ever go back to vacationing in or around Germany , I will definitely be picking a few of these up for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going on 30, I have learned that simplicity is the key element within a skin care regimen. I have tried so many things and spent much money the past 10 years but now I am trying to be consistent and cost efficient with the products I choose and use on my face and I am enjoying this product so far.</li>
    <li> (You may want to go directly to my update.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four stars are actually a split rating: 5 stars for the cream--which is one of the best face creams ever made--and 3 stars for implying that you will absolutely be receiving the \\&quot;made in Germany\\&quot; product as shown. The jar I received was NOT from Germany. The picture you see may not be what you receive. Of the reviews posted, several received the actual German product; others received \\&quot;made in Poland\\&quot; cream; and at least one customer received cream \\&quot;made in Thailand.\\&quot; I know this because I received an Amazon email question about the product from someone wanting to know if it WAS the German product, and I was able to see the responses from other purchasers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it has been over 10 yrs since I have had or used this cream. The product I received from Poland [just over the border from Germany] smelled as I remembered, same Nivea thickness, and I definitely notice a difference in the depth of some significant 65 yr old wrinkles in just a few weeks. But is this the actual original formula? I have no idea because, unfortunately, I no longer have the box to make any comparisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT UPDATE: June 20, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been a lot of questions--and conjecture--here on Amazon as to whether the CoQ10 creams made in Germany are different/\\&quot;superior\\&quot; to the CoQ10 cream manufactured at Nivea facilities in other parts of the world. I did some serious research on this yesterday. Below are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the fact that this CoQ10 cream is no longer distributed in the US is, I believe, the primary cause of the \\&quot;presumptions\\&quot; that the ONLY ORIGINAL Nivea CoQ10 cream that could be found was cream still manufactured at Nivea&#x27;s home-facility in Beiersdorf, Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two slightly different packages used: One is listed as \\&quot;Nivea CoQ10\\&quot; and the other is \\&quot;Nivea Visage CoQ10.\\&quot; Not only are the ingredients the EXACT SAME for BOTH products, the are also the SAME regardless of whether the cream was made in Germany (with the label in German) or from Poland, Mexico, Thailand, or Maylasia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third-party sellers have been quick to mark-up their products as being \\&quot;the original cream from Germany,\\&quot; implying that the ingredients may be different if the label is not in German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST A MARKETING PLOY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have SEEN the actual ingredient lists from non-German labeled cream and they are 100% identical to the ACTUAL German product made in Beiersdorf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you DO NOT have to pay $40-50 dollars for a little $15 jar you can find here on Amazon that comes from one of Nivea&#x27;s facilities anywhere else in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL BLUE JARS OF NIVEA CoQ10, OR NIVEA \\&quot;VISAGE\\&quot; CoQ10 ARE THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.AME for BOTH products, the are also the SAME regardless of whether the cream was made in Germany (with the label in German) or from Poland, Mexico, Thailand, or Maylasia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third-party sellers have been quick to mark-up their products as being \\&quot;the original cream from Germany,\\&quot; implying that the ingredients may be different if the label is not in German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST A MARKETING PLOY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have SEEN the actual ingredient lists from non-German labeled cream and they are 100% identical to the ACTUAL German product made in Beiersdorf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you DO NOT have to pay $40-50 dollars for a little $15 jar you can find here on Amazon that comes from one of Nivea&#x27;s facilities anywhere else in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL BLUE JARS OF NIVEA CoQ10, OR NIVEA \\&quot;VISAGE\\&quot; CoQ10 ARE THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my Mom regularly. She is 74 and has very dry skin. This is the only cream she claims moisturizes her face perfectly and doesn&#x27;t dry back afterward. She uses the day version in the  morning and the night cream at night and is perfectly moisturized. Thanks to Nivea Q10 cream, my year long search for appropriate cream for aging skin is over.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have re-ordered it already and I have shared this with my friends and they love it also.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and at a much better price than what I was paying on another import site.  I will be purchasing again.  Only thing I would warn is to check who is listed as the seller before you submit your purchase.  Mine was from Febstore.</li>
    <li> I have written a review before and can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  it definitely is a super help with softening up fine lines, just start using it early enough in life and continue the rest of your life.  naturally it will not get totally rid of wrinkles, only surgery can do that, but your lines will become so soft that no one notices them.  Try it, you will love it!</li>
    <li> that I like to put on as a mask before bed and then just before retiring I smooth and massage it into my face, neck and décolleté.  I have noticed a smoother quality to my skin since using this product.</li>
    <li> This night time cream is a wonderful moisturizer.  I love the smell and consistency of this cream.  It does not work &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; but nothing I have tried does do what it advertises it will do.  However, it makes my face feel soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to purchase this in stores and then was not able to it find anymore.  After being without it for several years, was so glad to see it on Amazon.  Price was more than I used to pay but I suppose that is to be expected.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Q10 continues to be a very superior product.  Price a little high, but the quality, and end results adde great!!</li>
    <li> I used this cream before, and this one I think it is fake, because feeling and smelling is different., why no more Nivea in store.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> It is a great addition to Neiva which I have used for years.</li>
    <li> I use this night cream every night after removing all makeup and applying a toner.  I am 30 years old, have combination to dry skin and wanted to start a skin care routine to ward of wrinkles.  This cream smells amazing, feels amazing and has really improved the look and texture of my skin.  The most unexpected bonus has been the brightness my skin now has.  I absolutely LOVE the way my skin looks without makeup now.  I would highly recommend this night cream to anyone needing intense moisture at night and a boost in skin brightness, texture and pore refinement.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Sorry I cannot find in the US.  Very soothing and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t go out in the sun after using this product.....even days after using....does seem to help with wrinkles, and softness.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for couple of years and i really like the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition</li>
    <li> i have used this face cream for years. I have very sensitive skin and this cream does not make me itch at all. Most others make me scratch and give me red blotches. It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in the U.S. anymore. Has a nice light floral scent. Certainly hasn&#x27;t kept me from aging, though, as life has intruded.</li>
    <li> My family is from Germany so I would always stock up on this product. Finally they were selling it here in the states. Then gone, could not find it. My skin changed ...I was so upset. I am elated that I saw it on Amazon. My skin is happy again. This along with Nivea Activa is by far the best Face cream out there.</li>
    <li> Awesome, already can see improvement in fine lines.  It is not sold in the states.</li>
    <li> Love this cream, not greasy and goes on nicely!!! On my 5 or 6 jar!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Searched for a long time for this product only to find Not available in the USA any longer. Great stuff. Have tried others but nothing worked to keep my face adequately moisturized and soft.</li>
    <li> Good as usual, fast deliver from Uk</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hit or miss as to where the cream actually comes from.  I&#x27;ve had Germany and Poland, but honestly, outside of a small difference in the jar, felt no difference in the skin cream quality.  I&#x27;d prefer  less fragrance in a cream, but with ultra sensitive skin that gets horrid dry patches in the winter, this, paired with my Frangipani Body Products (from Indianapolis) Regenerative Skin Serum is all I need for baby soft skin all winter in the Chicago area when the snow and the wind are blowing.  It also doesn&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea, even with the scent.</li>
    <li> iam already looking like iam 18 again  it works.  no kidding  iam 54  . and getting younger looking everyday. so get it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. My skin was really dry until I found this product. At 36 I started seeing wrinkles on my forehead, but this cream has helped tremendously.  I will definitely recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Keeps me looking younger than my years!</li>
    <li> I have been using Nivea Anti Wrinkle Q10 for about three years now. Every once in a while I&#x27;ll switch to some expensive name brand and I find that Nivea results are far better than other brand. I recommend this. I wish I can still purchase this on the shelf at the drugstore because this is very effective.</li>
    <li> worth the wait and price</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I am glad you can get the European versions here. The ingredients are different and it matters.</li>
