<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love product very satisfied. Smells awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I love using the Snooki Dark Tanning Maximizer!  I have only used it two times and I am way more darker than I was before I used this product.  I don&#x27;t like using a tanning bed so instead, I tanned outside.  I will most definitely be purchasing more once I run out!  It is definitely a GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This product made me break out in a rash on my legs, arms, chest and worst of all, my face!! I have used indoor tanning products too many times to count and the only other time I&#x27;ve ever gotten a rash is when I had the lotion for over a year and I had kept it in my car the whole time. I was told that over time, the chemical makeup changes and can cause an adverse skin reaction. So I feel they are selling old product.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed!!! This was sent to me very fast and was exactly like it was advertised!!! I used it just once and I can tell a difference!!</li>
    <li> I loved the way it felt and smelled putting it on and after my tan, but low and behold, the next day I started itching, and after a day of getting an itchy rash all over my body, I broke out in hives ALL over my body (even on my feet and hands). Had to go to the ER it was getting bad. Wish this lotion didn&#x27;t give me such a bad reaction because it did smell and feel good going on. Obviously will never use it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, First time use was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the smell also, that&#x27;s a huge thing for me when I use a tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product... Highly!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion twice now and it seems to work nicely. It&#x27;s a little oily and remains on your skin for quite some time after.  If you like a quick absorbing lotion this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very potent STRONG smell.  It&#x27;s not bad...but it&#x27;s like bubblegum...and it also lingers for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion for beginners or those who haven&#x27;t tanned in awhile and want to start again. Or someone who wants a natural looking tan. This doesn&#x27;t seem to look like a bronzer at all when you apply it and there is no warning about streaky palms like other Snooki products, especially when you look at it next to other Snooki products it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s tinted, I have used some bronzer lotions when first starting out tanning after not going in months/years and the lotion can sometimes make you look orange, streaky, fake etc especially when your getting the hang of getting undressed and putting on your lotion in 3 minutes (for the first time or again.) This is also a nice product if your getting really tan and you don&#x27;t want to look fake this is a good lotion to switch with, I&#x27;ve used some lotions with bronzer and it made me so unrealistically dark. Also this is not a tingle so that&#x27;s another plus for beginners or people who just don&#x27;t like tingle lotions. It smells delicious, fruity like some kind of fruit snacks. I recommend using this with other Snooki products, I use other Snooki products like Snooki ULTRA dark lotions in the gray and purple bottles too when I want a bronzer. (Once I build a base tan or when I switch lotions every few sessions in between after tanning a lot.) I&#x27;ve used a lot of lotions but I keep coming back to Snooki&#x27;s lotions because there good products.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. It smells AMAZING and gives you a great tan. It&#x27;s the tan extender so it doesn&#x27;t have bronzer in it but if you already have a base tan its great it brings out the color!! Leaves your skin very moisturized and smelling good.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. I worked very well for me. I could see it working after only a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this tanning product. Recommend this to everyone. Great for people like us with personal tanning beds that can&#x27;t afford the high cost for lotion they love.</li>
    <li> I know my tanning lotions because I have tried so many through the years . Supre Snooki is by far one of the best Maximizers I have ever used . Remember this is NOT a bronzer ! I began using this on my first tanning session of this year and could see the difference right away . AWESOME product and smells great too :)</li>
    <li> I think this one works different for different people... My cousin first bought this lotion and recommended it to me, she is an experienced tanner and the maximizer alone worked fantastic for her (and quick!). So I bought this lotion and started tanning. I should mention that I&#x27;ve never tanned before and I&#x27;m fairly light skinned (my cousin is a little darker skinned and also has brown hair) so I wasn&#x27;t able to stay in a bed very long at first. It took me awhile before I started seeing results but I&#x27;m seeing them. So depending on your skin type it might take a little longer to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this lotion is AMAZING!!! I would buy a hand lotion with this scent in a heartbeat. And it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling funky after tanning, which is a relief because I do a lot of errands after tanning and don&#x27;t have to worry about stinking. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that the bottle is super cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I found  that if I put the lotion on my neck and face it would burn. Not a \\&quot;fire, hot, get it off me\\&quot; burn but just a tingly burn and it only ever happened on my face and neck. . I did try a different lotion and my face didn&#x27;t tingle at all. Just a little weird but I&#x27;d still recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I got this lotion wks ago but wanted to finish the 1 I was using 1st, well I became impatient and today was my 2nd time using this lotion. Yes the smell is nice, it goes on smoothly, no funky after tan smell... But as for color or enhancing (Ive been tanning for a month now) I dont really think its right for me! ALSO-the person who said they started &#x27;twitching&#x27; after using it, that is SCARY! I did notice after using in the 1st time I was VERY ITCHY later in the day (I work overnights so I tan in the morning, sleep and then go back in at 10pm) all night long I was sooo itchy! Could of been cause I burned slightly?!!! I will let you guys know tomorrow if the same thing happens again (I used a different bed on a lower time today)... Happy Tanning :)</li>
    <li> I Saved so much money just like the tanning salon. I would buy this item again.Keep up the good job.</li>
    <li> I only gave this 3 stars because it does smell wonderful and leaves skin feeling so soft,but i have a great base tan and have been using this for about a wk and havent noticed anymore results.</li>
    <li> Exellent. I&#x27;ve always loved snooki Stuff</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this product was fake. I bought from a a salon before &amp; used with no problem...this time I ended up with a terrible allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!! I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT!! FIRST OFF, I LOVE SNOOKI EVERYBODY SAYS SHES MY TWIN OR IM HERS. LOL I AM A VEERRRYYY SERIOUS AND DARK TANNER!!!! I TAKE MY TANNING PRODEUCTS (ALL 28 OF THEM) VERY SERIOUSLY AND PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO HOW EACH ONE PERFORMS. THIS MAXIMIZER IS BY FAR MY FAV!!!!!!!!!!! &amp;#60;3 THANKS SNOOKS</li>
    <li> As far as some of the complaints on this product goes. The lotion is SUPPOSED to be white.  It&#x27;s not a bronzer! Bronzers have color added, the maximizer doesn&#x27;t.  So those people don&#x27;t even understand what they are buying, so they probably shouldn&#x27;t review it.  I have yet to try this lotion, but I will say snookis lotion smells so much better than jwows.  Supre always makes a nice product.</li>
    <li> Great dark tanning results with a light white formula that does not rub off on clothing or towels, great scent.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for anyone who already has a base tan &amp; is looking to get much darker without bronzers. It is very moisturizing &amp; smells fruity, leaves my skin velvety soft afterward:). Nice job Snooks ;).</li>
    <li> I saw results after about two uses however I do tan easy and I&#x27;m medium skin conplaction, the product smells great and leaves skin soft, no complaints will defiantly buy again</li>
    <li> I just received my lotion in the mail, it did come very fast but unlike most tanning lotions, it&#x27;s stark white. I can&#x27;t find online what color the lotion is actually supposed to be, and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve been jipped because the bottle was already opened when I received it.</li>
    <li> I love love love this lotion! I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and I honestly think with even one use you can tell a difference! Also the smell is amazing! Definetly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> As the last reviewer said - this is a maximizer, not a bronzer. It&#x27;s supposed to be white! You definitely need a base tan in order to see results. This a great lotion to throw in with a bronzer and a tingle. I use all three Snooki lotions in combination with a couple others as well and see great results. I recieved this lotion very quickly and it came in plastic wrap. Great smell with no odor afterwards and extremely moisturizing. I have yet to use a bronzer at the same time as the maximizer, but I look forward to seeing if it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend especially for the price compared to a salon!</li>
    <li> This is the first tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and it is so awesome! I could see results the first time i used it and it smells wonderful. The after smell is alright, it isn&#x27;t the best but it doesn&#x27;t smell awful either. I highly recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> First off I love the smell and bottle! So great! Second I had the same result as another review. I was tanning forever with this lotion and not getting results. I finally decided to put it on after my bronzer and BAM amazing results! It also is a Maximizer so if you are using it by itself it is best to have a base tan first. Love it when used with a bronzer though. I am pasty white and I haven&#x27;t burned yet. I have only been tanning over a week (this year not ever) and since I started using both bronzer and this lotion I look like I&#x27;ve been going for at least 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps you to get tan. The smell is also very nice. The only bad thing I have to say is that the sweet aroma attracts bees and mosquitos lol.</li>
    <li> I love this compared to other lotions because it smells like bubblegum. I use this lotion in addition to a bronzer and I see great results with the two</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It is the only one I use for indoor tanning. It is the best smelling lotion I have ever used. It even smells pretty good after tanning when most of them make you smell bad afterwards.</li>
    <li> Works so well on my skin. I&#x27;m Italian with an olive tint and it is the best lotion I&#x27;ve used to far. So much cheaper to over on Amazon than elsewhere and it ships quick. I would absolutely recommended it</li>
    <li> It was okay. I&#x27;ve had better. I didn&#x27;t get a good dark tan. It smells good.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!  And I&#x27;ve used a lot of different ones!  I&#x27;ve never been this dark and the smell is fabulous!!  I like that it isn&#x27;t a bronzer and there&#x27;s no tingle!  Also love that there&#x27;s no parabens!  I&#x27;ll only buy this from now on, the price is really good too!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t care for it,i think my skin got lighter every time i used it..</li>
    <li> i was very excited to get this tanning lotion, and after i used it i was very disappointed. ive tanned with it about 10 times, and there is hardly any evidence of doing so. i prefer the $8 lotion i got at wal mart.  btw, yes the lotion in my bottle is white too</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best! This isn&#x27;t a bronzer, but rather a maximizer, so it brings out my natural tan, and quickly. Was sent to me so fast, and has an awesome smell that doesn&#x27;t leave you with a burnt, unpleasant smell after. Since I tan very quickly, I saw no use in purchasing a bronzer lotion. The Snooki Maximizer really emphasizes my natural tan, and really makes me glow! Will purchase over and over.</li>
    <li> Gives nice golden color! I would buy this product again . It is 90 dollars In the tanning salons! Buy it!</li>
    <li> Nice light smell and feels like a normal tanning lotion. I haven&#x27;t done much tanning yet so I can&#x27;t say I have seen any results as of yet.</li>
    <li> It was a really good  product. It was  just like the picture. It made me really tan . I looked like Casper the ghost before and now I&#x27;m tan like Snooki !&lt;br /&gt; I would order this again .</li>
    <li> smells awesome and was black in a week :)</li>
    <li> Not sure I am getting any darker, but the price was right and the fragrance is nice.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion it smells good and works great. No funny smell after tanning with this lotion. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Although this is only the second tanning lotion I have ever tried I love it.  I first got hooked by buying a very small package of it and using it once.  I had results within the first tan.  I have naturally fair skin.  I would say I have a normal tanning speed.  I don&#x27;t soak up the sun like a sponge, but I don&#x27;t have to go to the tanning bed five times before I see a result.  Mostly because I use this product.  I recently used it for the first time since last tanning season (about 5 months ago) and within the first two tans my friend was already telling me I looked darker.  I am able to get very dark with this lotion.  I like the smell, but I do sweat in the bed.  After I sweat I don&#x27;t smell like roses and dandelions; therefore, I always shower after tanning, but I would do this after tanning with any lotion.  I would definitely recommend this lotion.  You get what you pay for when it comes to tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> This smells delicious and works great! Definitely can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> love this lotion it is my new favorite it smells good and works great</li>
    <li> Love the subtle smell. Definitely notice color change after A few used</li>
    <li> I used this all last summer and loved it. Its not the absolute best tanning lotion in the world but it still perfect for the price i payed for it. It smells great and and is super cute!</li>
    <li> Not fond of Snooki- Im much too old to be a Jersey Shore fan - but this product is pretty amazing! The smell is great &amp; the feeling when it goes on is nice and it moisturizers the skin and seems to &amp;#34;maximize&amp;#34; the tan like it claims.  People did say I looked tan when I was using this product...I would definitely purchase it again</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It works great I have an amazing tan!!! I recommend this lotion to anyone that loves indoor tanning.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion.  It seems to work outdoors as well as in tanning beds. I noticed a difference either way.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion does the job and smells very good. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and gives me an awesome tan. The fact that there is a good tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell horrible is a huge plus for me. You could actually go do something right after tanning without smelling like you swam in a bath of terrible perfume. Nice even dark tan. I would definitely purchase this again. Its been a while since I&#x27;ve found a great product like this. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for use in tanning beds. It is way cheaper, as most salons want you to pay for their tanning products which are outrageously expensive, (cheapest starting around $30).</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion it works awesome and I love the feel of it.so soft and such a great smell.ive used alot of lotion but this snooki is the best.the best part is its not a bronzing lotion and washes off easy.it tans u great.thanks.love it</li>
    <li> did what it was supposed to. It has a really nice smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it on for long periods of time its starts to make my skin irrupted. Other then that it lived up to its expectations.</li>
    <li> So far I love it, smells great &amp; seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  I&#x27;ve only been able to use it twice so far and within the two times I have definitely noticed a major difference! As soon as I put it on i can feel it start to tingle and once i get out I take off the sticker and see how much darker i am after the first time using it!&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this product to everyone who wants to get dark real fast!&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to use another tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;i am very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> Love this works very well n I love it</li>
    <li> smells better than any other tanning lotion .. like a glass of hawaiin punch tastes lol but it didn&#x27;t get me any more tan than I already was .. love her other products tho !</li>
    <li> This lotion gave me a nice base tan and smells great going on and after tanning. Would buy again to alternate between Bronzer.</li>
    <li> Not what it was advertised to be something is lost if you are looking for &amp;#34;ultra dark&amp;#34; get something else.</li>
    <li> Has a good smell&lt;br /&gt;Pretty bottle&lt;br /&gt;Not as dark as I hope to be&lt;br /&gt;Need a lot of sessions&lt;br /&gt;To just see the tan</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is so moisturizing. It doesn&#x27;t have any bronzers in it, so I apply it before I use my tanning lotion that does have bronzer in it. It smells delicious and leaves you smelling delicious after tanning.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! Love the snooki lotions, I work at a tanning salon and it&#x27;s by far my fav line with the best scents. All of her bottles are delicious!</li>
    <li> Great price offered by Amazon and great product ! The smells is fantastic and leaves skin smooth , creating a beautiful tan look ! I will buy this product again for sure.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Smells REALLY good and doesn&#x27;t stain the skin. Gives me great results and will buy again!</li>
    <li> very good lotion! ive held my tan a while now</li>
    <li> Loved the smell and how my skin felt after tanning but did not notice any difference in making me darker. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Love love love! Silky smooth texture and I&#x27;m super tan after 2 uses!</li>
    <li> Smells great, got a nice base in prep for our vacay. Yay Snookie?!?!</li>
    <li> the lotion: first time use&#x3D;good. DONT USE EVERYDAY. your body will get weird reactions (twitching, etc)&amp; it hurts. i regret buying.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I have never used this before but love it and is a great price. I also received it much sooner than expected!!!!! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Great product, it gave me a wonderful tan!</li>
    <li> It smells great and worked like a charm.  I was about to buy this same bottle at the tanning salon until I saw the $60.00 price tag. I&#x27;m glad I got it here.  It was quick shipping and I love the results from using this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a GREAT smell to it. Almost yummy! What i really like about it though is that is seems to make your skin feel so much softer after you use it. I have bought it multiple times for myself and friends! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> the product was a typical lotion. nothing great. did not really maximize my color despite going tanning everyday. it also came with a piece of tape over the top so not sure what really was going on.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It smells amazing, I already had a base tan when I used it but since I have used it I stopped going to the tanning bed so much and havent lost any color!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells fantastic, and gives me a great color fast! I&#x27;m tan already with yellow undertones, And this makes my skin soft, silky and golden. Shipment was prompt as well. :) I recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product good price !</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because of the &amp;#34;maximizer&amp;#34; part, but I got this and started using it and it smells good, but also enriches the tan a lot more!</li>
    <li> This works great if your at that point where your not seeing yourself tan that much anymore Wow- I used it and the 1st time I saw a major difference!! I recommend this for someone who reached there tanning plateau! Great Tanning Maximizer!!</li>
    <li> Product smells awesome and works really good! My girlfriend is nice and brown!</li>
    <li> Im not necessarily a fan of Snooki&#x27;s but I figured she&#x27;d have a good tanning line because of her love to tan. I just received my tanning lotion and LOVE the smell of it! It smells amazing and it leaves my skin feeling super soft. I will continue to use this product. I love how golden my tan is getting and I love how moisturized my skin is after using this.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing, doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky, and it helps me tan very well. I will be ordering more when the one I have runs out</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tanning maximizer. My tan looks great. The lotion smells amazing. I didn&#x27;t get it from Amazon. I paid twice as much at the local tanning salon. Loved it so much I decided to search for it and let you all know it&#x27;s awesome and this is a great price.</li>
    <li> Use to be very pale...I&#x27;ve been tanning 4 months..Tried this almost 2 months ago..FELL-IN-LOVE with it as A Must Have *BEFORE* putting my bronzing lotions.  I&#x27;ve used with and without in all the level beds at my tanning salon..This product works best put on 1st, then my main bronzing lotion..and I use several.  I alternate them.  When I used alone or ran out and tried a cheaper maximizer..Couldn&#x27;t tell a difference, But..in between, used it as a single pack-COSTLY-that way..Could tell the difference again.  Everyone brags on how dark I am!!! It&#x27;s A MUST HAVE for the serious tanner!!! Just bought it online..HUGE SAVINGS, along with my favorite bronzer and a new moisturizer/extender, I wanted to try.  Got all 3 cheaper than 1 bottle at my salon...EXCITED TO SAVE SO MUCH!!!</li>
    <li> Every time I use this it works to the fullest!!! I get the most out of every tan. I love it</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.  It is very reasonably priced.  The bronzers aren&#x27;t too dark.  Over all great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used. Even though I am not a fan of Snooki or Jersey Shore, this lotion is great. Smells great an makes your skin feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Doesn&#x27;t feel slimy after I tan like others do. I can&#x27;t even tell I have on lotion. Also smells great :) def recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion works really well! I went running for a week and was as dark as my body can get! Only downside is that my skin got super dry while using this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE EVERYTHING about it! The smell,formula,consistency...all of it! No bronzers to throw you off of your true progress and you tan so fast with this stuff..you don&#x27;t need bronzers! I also use Tanamins and tan indoors 5 days a week. This lotion plays a VERY important part in my results. Try it.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome! Got it at a great price too!</li>
    <li> This lotion is now my favorite I love the way it smells and it moisturizes great leaving my skin soft and silky</li>
    <li> Soo I just got my lotion in the mail today! It came super fast, sooner than what I thought it was going to. The lotion smells AMAZING!!! I can&#x27;t wait to try it out. The bottle didn&#x27;t come wrapped soo I&#x27;m hoping that its the real deal and hasn&#x27;t be tampered with! The bottle is super pretty and I really can not get over the smell!! It smells like you could eat it!!</li>
    <li> Great lotion.. Fabulous smell...Silky soft skin for the rest of the day!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all that i look for in a good lotion &amp; Yay! i found it with snooki&#x27;s line.. go figure.&lt;br /&gt;I tan easily &amp; like to tan with no bronzers, tingles or heat. Just a good moisturizer that dosn&#x27;t leave me greasy or smelling weird or like burnt skin... i usually tan during my lunch hour at work. I will use this outdoors as well.&lt;br /&gt;Good price compared to others &amp; a good size bottle as well :)</li>
    <li> this worked really good last yr i have been tanning yet this yr but when i did use it i loved it the smell is great .</li>
    <li> This product works great! I&#x27;ve used it many times and have seen great results! Even after one use I noticed a majOr difference, unlike any products I had used before!</li>
    <li> I used this product over a one week period when i was in the Bahamas. I now look like a umpa-lumpa. I guess that&#x27;s what you get when you purchase a snookie product. As pauly d would say- WHAT THE HELL! Check this out:  [...]</li>
    <li> Smells great! I&#x27;m not a person that tans all the time, but when I do I like to use this product. It doesn&#x27;t have the after smell like some lotions do either.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. This lotion soaks right in, unlike most tanning lotions that sit on your skin. I didn&#x27;t burn with this lotion but I&#x27;m not sure if it helped me get darker than I would without it. Either way, it made my skin very soft and good smelling, even after a sweat session at the gym and a sweaty tanning session. Plus, I LOVE Snooki.</li>
    <li> This bottle of lotion has lasted me a long time and it works really well. I can notice a drastic difference from days that I don&#x27;t use lotion at all to days when I use this. The rhinestones on the cap of the bottle have started falling off but other than that great product.</li>
    <li> This is the bomb! This lotion smells delicious and makes you sooooo tan! I&#x27;ll never use anything else ever again!</li>
    <li> I saw results after the first use and it gave me a completely natural looking tan. The price is great too compared to the $65 that my tanning salon sells it for. And it does smell good!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this as I had only heard about &amp;#34;Snookie&amp;#34; tanning lotion. Used it for a month and had great results. Smells fantastic and left my skin super soft after every use.</li>
    <li> Really works!! Only a couple times in the tanning bed &amp; I&#x27;ve got great color!!  Worth the buy and smells great :)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Only downfall and reason for giving it 4 stars is that I find the lotion is extremely greasy. Other than that, good smell and great color after only 3 uses.</li>
    <li> This is a great accelerator to have in your rotation. It&#x27;s one of the lotions that gets me the darkest (along with Designer Skin&#x27;s Phoenician and Australian Gold&#x27;s Fierce D Fense). I was worried about the smell (it&#x27;s very fruity / candy-ish) but it actually smells really nice, and it isn&#x27;t obnoxious like some lotions. I get a lot of compliments on my scent when I use this. The smell is on the girly side, though, but I don&#x27;t mind. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion, especially at Amazon prices.</li>
    <li> It made both me and my boyfriend break out with acne on the same parts of our backs because of all the oils in the lotion.</li>
    <li> No streaks! !! Has a good smell like others don&#x27;t. &amp; I love the bottom but that&#x27;s an extra plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very hard to tan, but this year I spent a little money &amp; bought this lotion&lt;br /&gt; With in a week I was darker than I had ever been. I just ordered my 4th bottle of Snooki  lotion&amp; I love that it keeps skin so soft &amp; the smell stays with you all day. I love it &amp; won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT and I LOVE THE PRICE</li>
    <li> This bottle in Any salon ranges from $80-$90. I was very happy to purchase this lotion at $27. I managed tanning salons a few yrs ago and I can say without doubt that the Snooki lotion works well!!! Gives a beautiful deep color.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I don&#x27;t smell burnt after tanning like I notice with some lotions, and the smell is amazing.  I notice I&#x27;m tanning quicker than usual with it (I am very fair complected with red hair, freckles, and blue eyes).  Not to mention that I only spent 1/3 of the money by buying off here vs in a salon (my salon charges over $60 for the exact same product).  It came sealed in plastic and got here way before the estimated date...since I currently live in Alaska, where it takes forever to receive anything, this is a huge plus!!&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again when I run out of my current bottle!!</li>
    <li> Snooki&#x27;s dark tanning lotion is not the best for asain skin. I tried it twice and it gave my a couple faded looking spot plus its really watery.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much, I&#x27;ve used this twice now and have already got so much more tan plus it has a great scent. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It got to me super fast within two days!!! A lot cheaper than than the tanning salon works great and made my tan brighter and so pretty!! Definitely will be buying more from them!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, would buy again</li>
    <li> Loved it and loved the price!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells great, not like the other after tanning lotions out there. It does exactly what it should do! If you want a lotion with a bronzer however, I would not recommend this one. I have dark skin so this wasn&#x27;t a factor for me when purchasing it.</li>
    <li> this product smells great but I didn&#x27;t seem to get any better tan with it than I did with the stuff I normally use.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I received the lotion fairly quickly also. - A lot of people keep complaining that this lotion is white, instead of the brown-ish orange color most other tanning lotions are, but they don&#x27;t understand that this is a tanning MAXIMIZER. A maximizer is to help enhance your natural tan, whereas a BRONZER has topical ingredients. A bronzer will only have temporary results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product! It smells wonderful, so much so that I don&#x27;t mind tanning on my lunch break anymore.  Before, I would smell like a tanning salon, but this lotion smells like a pretty perfume. I recommend this to everyone! The results are amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for about a month and I dont feel like it is getting me dark... I smells good though.</li>
    <li> Exactly as describes, smells nice, pretty bottle, keeps your tan long</li>
    <li> This was the first tanning lotion I ever used and it produced great results when I first starting tanning. Within two weeks of starting to tan with this lotion I already had people complimenting me on my tan! I have very sensitive skin and this lotion has never caused me any irritation not to mention the smell is great!</li>
    <li> It smells great and spreads evenly.  Gradual color increase but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m gross after tanning like I do with some other lotions so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
