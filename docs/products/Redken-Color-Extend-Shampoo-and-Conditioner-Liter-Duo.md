<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Working well with my hair.</li>
    <li> The worst experience of my life.  I got this shampoo because Redken is supposed to be a good brand but THIS IS A FAKE.  I had no idea this was causing itchiness on my scalp.  I was scratching my head for months thinking that it was from stress.  Then one day I began using an antifungal, antiseptic, antibacterial oil on my scalp to relieve my problem.  It really did help.  I was free from the soreness and itchiness for days I didn&#x27;t wash my hair. Then the next time I washed my hair was with this shampoo.  My scalp became itchy and very sore (running my fingers through my hair was painful and I couldn&#x27;t flip my hair around with experiencing soreness). That&#x27;s when I realized that the shampoo was causing this!  Fake ones have been tested to have living bacteria in their shampoo whereas the authentic ones don&#x27;t!  I&#x27;m FINALLY free of it since I&#x27;ve stopped using it and religiously applying oil every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life lesson - NEVER BUY SALON NAMED SHAMPOOS FROM AMAZON OR ANY DRUG STORE - THEY&#x27;RE NOT AUTHORIZED TO SELL.  There are MANY fakes out there.  Only go to Ulta, beauty salons, or other beauty stores.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and even with high lights I am careful with the products that i use. Most products weigh my hair down. This product creates a great feel and smell but does not weigh my hair down. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I always buy my hair products at my sister&#x27;s salon, but she went on vacation and I was almost out of shampoo and conditioner. So I used my Prime account to purchase the products that I always use. When these arrived, we compared both to what we bought from the salon. The shampoo seemed similar to the salon purchased product, but the conditioner was a totally different texture, smell and consistency. I compared I would definitely not buy these again and would not recommend anyone purchase these knowing that weren&#x27;t the same as salon sold products.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  Also love that I can buy it in the large bottles and save money.  I always save on these kinds of products at Amazon, instead of buying them in my salon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a year, my hair stylist says my hair has never been healthier.  Amazon is far more affordable than the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other salon products but I keep coming back to Redken Color Extend Shampoo &amp; Conditioner! I will definitely purchase this and other items from this vendor on Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product relying solely on the reviews I had read. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it truly helps extend the life and vibrancy of my haircolor. I do know that I will never purchase this shampoo &amp; conditioner again. It is extremely over priced and after using it my hair still feels like before I washed and conditioned it, dry straw!! Pantene Brunette Expressions shampoo &amp; conditioner works much better and cost a lot less!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I get my hair colored every 5 weeks.  I have noticed a big improvement in how long the richness of my color (reddish brown) lasts using this shampoo compared to drugstore color shampoos.  I have also used several different salon shampoos that have not maintained the texture of my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I dye my dark brown hair to a supperr brightt almost magenta color and i started using this product because it sounded like it would really prevent my fading! unfortunately, this shampoo is sooooo heavyy, first of all, color still fades out! second, leaves a nasty residue on your scalp and it just keeps packing and packing on. its disgusting, if i scratch my scalp i can show you all the gunk that this shampoo has left. PLUS! it gives you horriblee pimpless on your scalp that are painful and gross. my hair does NOT feel clean whatsoever but i have a gigantic bottle that i have to finish. SAVE YOURSELF, DONT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> This time I don&#x27;t want to talk about the product itself (and yes, it is great, I have thick, dry hair and this shampoo and conditioner are just healthy for my hear, with a great shiny smooth result...), I want to talk about the seller, \\&quot;wholesaleproductsfourless\\&quot;: I get a lot of packages from amazon, but wholesaleproductsfourless wraps its products with  bio degradable packing material made out of corn. It is basically compost - the styrofoam packaging material others use stays forever, it is not compostable at all. It is made out of oil, one of our most precious resources, just to use it for a couple of days and throw it away where it cannot be integrated into nature anymore. So thank you, wholesaleproductsfourless, for this contribution for a more healthy environment.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of redken products but I recently dyed my hair blue and black and I&#x27;m naturally blonde. This line totally locks in my color for reeks longer!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells so good.  It&#x27;s my new favorite color extend shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried many brands including a lot of other \\&quot;salon\\&quot; brands like Paul Mitchell, Nexxus, Matrix... I tend to get easily annoyed when I can&#x27;t sleep on my hair at all without waking up feeling like my hair looks like a grease ball. I&#x27;m guessing my scalp just produces a little more than average oil. My hair is also thick and wavy and I like to straighten it.     Having compared closely with other brands, my hair usually still feels clean the next morning with this and has a very smooth texture which takes to my flat iron very well. The only major drawback is the cost. I hate to spend so much on such a basic product when there are much cheaper alternatives, but other stuff really doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helps to extend the length of time that non-permanent hair color lasts.  The conditioner works great to keep hair soft even with our hard water.</li>
    <li> These took over 2 weeks to arrive by mail, but the deal was worth it. I paid near 3x the amount per oz when buying the smaller size retail at the salon. GREAT DEAL!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a family member.  They find that it helps their hair retain color touchups longer than other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have used redken all soft for years and after a few dye jobs I wanted to see if I could retain the color longer by switching.  The first thing I noticed is it felt like It dried out my hair a lot. I also seemed to loose a lot of hair in the shower, which I have never noticed before with other shampoos. After about a month of use my color still faded the same and I needed a trim due to split ends. I am going back to All Soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this shampoo and conditioner. Unfortunately, after about 2 months I starting developing AWFUL bumps on my scalp (like large painful zits). They were very painful and I finally went to the Dr. and stopped using this shampoo/conditioner since the dermatologist said whatever I was using was leaving a heavy residue on my scalp! After stopping the shampoo/condtioner and using a special shampoo the Dermatologist recommended (T-sal) my scalp bumps were gone thank God! I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking, but after a few bad hair days I tried the shampoo/conditioner AGAIN and yes...the bumps returned! I thought maybe the first bumps I had were a &#x27;coincidence&#x27;? Nope! They were definitely caused by this shampoo/conditioner...</li>
    <li> I had gotten a perm and had my hair colored at the same time and well you know girls that is a very costly visit to the salon.  I wanted to take care of both additions to my hair and was recommended by my colorist to purchase Redken.  Her salon offered the product but being a wise buyer I declined her offer to purchase from her and went to the Amazon website and took care of business.  I&#x27;m still using the product and it&#x27;s been a while but the bottles are very big and should last a while.  The promise to keep your color lasting longer has been kept and I love the way my hair is easy to comb after shampooing and condtitiong.  I find that I only need a very small amount of condtioner and only need to leave it on for just a few seconds; well around 30 seconds then rinse.  I have fine hair and leaving on longer would take out some of the body.  I think this shampoo would be great for any hair to be honest.  I remember one time on Oprah that they were saying that the shampoo isn&#x27;t a big deal that most of them are alike and put your money into the conditioner.  Well for me I think both are important and I would invest in a shampoo that doesn&#x27;s strip your color or perm out of your hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone and will be buying again.  The price is very fair for the length of time it last and the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner for highlighted hair.  It helps maintain the color (which we all know cost!) better than any other marketed product!!</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo and conditioner from Redken.  Love the scent too.  Will keep on using for a long time.</li>
    <li> used this brand for over a decade. good price on amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy both with this product and its delivery schedule.  My only concern is that I am not able to purchase the conditioner separately.  I use up the conditioner much faster than I go through the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great deal on this shampoo. My stylist strongly recommended shampoo for colored hair to help mine retain its color. I thought it was BS and didn&#x27;t want to invest in the cost of expensive shampoo. So, I bought this stuff (great price!) and I&#x27;m almost to the bottom of the bottles and will say that it helped my color stay in for much longer! I&#x27;ll be keeping this up.</li>
    <li> I was worried about spending this kind of money and possibly hating it. But it leaves my hair nice, smells good.  The conditioner doesn&#x27;t allow me to comb my hair through while wet in the shower but that doesn&#x27;t matter for when I get out. It&#x27;s fine, not drying.</li>
    <li> I have elbow length hair. The shampoo alone is conditioning! I can comb my hair wet with shampoo only. Use both shampoo and conditioner and you hair will be super soft and plumps up your hair.  Shampoo smells wonderful!  I am a shampoo junkie and considering throwing away my stash and keeping this exclusive.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dark brown very think hair, for atleast two years now I have been dying my hair a dark burgandy and this duo prevent fades between colors for sure. Nothing else I have tried has ever worked better.</li>
    <li> If you have oily hair, but still need conditioner at the same time, than this shampoo is perfect (even if you do not put color in your hair). It makes my hair shine and the shampoo is not heavy. This is one of the first shampoos that has really worked for me.</li>
    <li> Okay girls if you can find a Walmart Salon you can get this duo a few times a year for only $22!!! I am so annoyed that it is $44 on here! It is the only shampoo and conditioner I love though.</li>
    <li> keeps color but dries the scalp</li>
    <li> Color Extend?&lt;br /&gt;How long is shampoo supposed to extend the color. If you can answer that then I can better rate the product. I do like the conditioner.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo and hair conditioner for colored hair. Product came quickly.</li>
    <li> I have tried many color extending shampoo and conditioners, but may seem to weigh my hair down with a waxy build up.  This Redken color extending shampoo is wonderful!  It smells great, leaves hair soft and smooth, without a waxy build up.  Another bonus is that a little, goes a long way.  This is a great product, which I&#x27;ll be using from here on out.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand and type of shampoo and this is the best price I&#x27;ve ever been able to find.  It&#x27;s great for conditioning but not making your hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I love it. Not as harsh as cheap shampoo &amp; it helps my color last</li>
    <li> My favorite hair products...leaves my hair soft, manageable, and healthy! Would recommend to everyone! Liters will last you a long time!</li>
    <li> Works great for my color-treated hair. Lathers well and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great light weight shampoo for colored hair.  I noticed my hair isn&#x27;t as dull with this shampoo.  It also blow dries really fast. Good job Redken!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is by far my favorite shampoo ever. It has helped my hair stay soft and smooth for days straight. It is so nourishing and smells so good! I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner at a great price.  Exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this is real Redken product. The scent was way off on the conditioner and quite strong. The shampoo seemed to create more suds than what I&#x27;m used to in the past. Will not be purchasing again. I was lured in by the price, but sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner. I use pumps with these bottles and I find that it helps keep me from using too much at one time. I ordered the 1 liter pumps from Coppola and find they work very well.</li>
    <li> i love this product will be buying again</li>
    <li> Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Leaves nasty buildup on your scalp and hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Causes Dandruff&lt;br /&gt;3. completely washes off your hair color&lt;br /&gt;4. Hair becomes greasy the next day&lt;br /&gt;5. Clogs pores on your skin (back and chest)&lt;br /&gt;6. Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NONE</li>
    <li> Huge size, gentle product, definitely keeps my hair color from fading.  Only problem is the smell is not enjoyable, but not stinky just blah.  My hair is fine and tangles easily, and this product is pretty good for that, not the best, but good enough.</li>
    <li> The order came sooner than expected. I love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and I am so glad you have it on your website.</li>
    <li> Wien you are European this deal is a bargain. Looking forward to nice smelling, silky soft and shiny clean hair.</li>
    <li> I have my hair colored every five weeks, and while I have tried many other shampoos and conditioners, some more expensive than the Redken, this duo is simply the best for color treated hair.  It keeps hair soft, the scent is never overpowering, and best of all it does not strip the color out the way other products do.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great , but the conditioner does not make my hair easy to comb.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Smells great and make my hair feel great. I am got my product right away and am very happy with it. I would definately recommend getting the pumps, as the bottles are big and not fun to deal with in the shower....</li>
    <li> Love tjis product. Great pricing.</li>
    <li> Does great keeping the color in my hair</li>
    <li> Let me put it this way. I now get touch ups every six weeks vs four.  How&#x27;s that for great results?</li>
    <li> Best combo and an excellent value for a professional product! I really like that I can purchase this in this large size.</li>
    <li> I love this particular type of Redken hair product. I use the Color Extend shampoo as well as the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and can get dry with harsh shampoo products.&lt;br /&gt;The Redken Color Extend is lightweight, yet nourishing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;No greasy after effects.&lt;br /&gt;The large bottles are a much better buy, price wise. Free shipping also !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QA7HNC?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00</li>
    <li> Great price for shampoo and conditioner. Will last longer than the store bought bottles. Super fast shipping and comes packaged so it will not leak.</li>
    <li> Got them on time, in great shape and i love them! thank yall! It helps my hair alot and i will get this everytime</li>
    <li> Great buy I have been using this for quite some time and will continue.</li>
    <li> My item arrived on time, was packaged perfectly, and was exactly what I wanted. The seller exceeded my expectations with my purchase. The shampoo and conditioner work great with my hair!</li>
    <li> Redken Color Shampoo and Conditioner are simple the best. Economically, I need to use so little that these two bottles last me many many months (so the initial investment saves me money in the long run). I have also stopped buying oils, leave in conditioners and other hair products because I don&#x27;t need them.When I use these products I can comb my hair easily after I wash it and my hair is softer and more manageable.  Buy it and you will be as happy as me!</li>
    <li> This shampoo costs a small fortune, which is why I went to seek it out online. This store had the best price. I always get the set of 33 oz bottles and they last me MONTHS, like 6 months. Yes, I shower once a day. Shipping was fast and got the goods in one piece. I def would order again.</li>
    <li> Great products and great prices!! Fast service too!!  I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> This product seemed to strip the color out of my hair within the first week. I ended up buying a better product.</li>
    <li> Awesome. As expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo and was a fantastic buy versus the store in town saved me a lot of money and a lot more for my money</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner!  It keeps my red color in my hair for a long time!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just ok, i held high expectations because of its price and my hair dresser recommended it. I dyed my hair plum red, was hoping this shampoo would minimize the fading. Well...as far as I can tell, it makes my hair color fade as much as any other shampoo. it does smell good, and leave me hair smooth... but for some reason i started having dandruff. i stopped using it, went back to my old shampoo and the dandruff went away. I would not buy this product again. I am going back to my Bedhead frizz control, for half the price, same quality without irritating my scalp.</li>
    <li> bought this product for my wife because she just got her hair colored and i didnt want to spend the money that the hair salons want. She loves it btw.</li>
    <li> good on color treated hair-not moisturizing enough and too heavy for fine hair</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Great prices and love the larger bottles too.  I won&#x27;t run out to quickly this way!!! Great products too!!</li>
    <li> I like to switch it up a bit and I like redken but not as much as clear conditioner and shampoo</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s cheaper than buying it&lt;br /&gt;in the stores. Came in fast would buy again.</li>
    <li> Awesome size! Lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I first tried this shampoo and conditioner at my salon and loved it. Was thrilled to see Amazon sold it as the price is much better. My usually coarse hair is so much softer and smells great.</li>
    <li> Bought it to refill my regular size bottles. I like the product for my hair. Was recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It&#x27;s a very good product, makes m y hair feel good, look good, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> i like the conditioner better than the shampoo. i did loose a lot of  color using the shampoo. i recommend using the conditioner first then the shampoo to cut down on color lose</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo/conditioner set for years with great results, until I purchased the new formula (which includes cranberry oil). For some reason this new product left my scalp itchy, oily, &amp; caused me to break out along my hair line. With the old formula my roots would only be a tad bit oily by the 3rd day of not washing it, now on the 2nd day my roots are greasy &amp; my hair feels dirty &amp; looks limp. It feels like there is a heavy build-up on my scalp &amp; hair, which is causing it to look duller &amp; the color less vibrant. Needless to say, I will not be using this set anymore after many faithful years. The old saying definitely applies here: If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
    <li> This maintains &amp;#34;color treated &amp;#34; hair longer than other products I have tried.Both shampoo and conditioner work well,,,and are reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> these items were great</li>
    <li> This product in a salon or beauty store cannot compete w/the price ($42) this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large liter sz, flip top shampoo &amp; conditioner leaves your hair shiny &amp; soft. This is the same product used in salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order this on a Thursday, qualified for free shipping 5-7 business day. I received the products the following Monday @ 1pm. That THREE business days on FREE shipping. I saved money in the product and never left my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! Keeps my hair clean and shiny, and will not fade out my color. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this product.  The shampoo did not lather easily and I did not notice any longer lasting color.</li>
    <li> i didnt like this product at all my hair become like a sponge, weak and breaks easily&#x27;</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful.  It totally stripped my hair color in one use.  I&#x27;m very confused as  to why it would do this....    Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this combination for years. The shampoo feels so creamey that you would think it would not clean your hair sufficiently, but it does and without &#x27;stripping&#x27; it. The conditioner is creamey and very nice does not make my hair feel limp but it does condition well. I have very fine hair that likes to tangle so I use an additional conditioner to really smooth it down and make it more combable. But I wouldn&#x27;t think many people would feel the need to do that. My highlights have stayed great since I have been using it. Used to have alot of trouble with them turning orange-ish.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out to it&#x27;s natural color (from blonde to brown). My hairdresser dyed my hair brown to match my natural roots. This product has been fabulous at helping my hair to hold it&#x27;s color and not fade so much.</li>
    <li> Chose this rating for price saving.  I paid this much for two smaller size bottles from the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to order the pump for these size bottles.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and condition due doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than any other that I&#x27;ve tried.  So not really work the price.  The size was huge though.  But will be trying something different.</li>
    <li> It smells great and keeps my red hair, red for weeks. It&#x27;s worth the extra money. I also ordered the pumps, so it makes dispensing super easy. I&#x27;d recommend getting the pumps too because these bottles are quite large and can be awkward to hold, especially in the shower.</li>
    <li> a good one with a good price</li>
    <li> i wouldnt buy them again</li>
    <li> I love redken products, they are the best.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite hair shampoo/conditioner product out there so far for colored hair in general. I use this for the first little while after getting my hair colored and then I switch to John Frieda - Sheer blonde color renew in between when my tone starts to get off. The two combined seem to work great. Love the setup, the smell, and the way my hair feels afterwards.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo &amp; conditioner! Leaves your hair feeling silky &amp; smooth.</li>
    <li> My Stylist used this product on my hair in the Salon and I LOVED it!! Bought from this Vendor and seemed watered down.. Would not buy this Product from them but would in Salon.</li>
    <li> When my stylist used this on me a week or so ago, we were talking about how fragrant this product is. Super fragrant. But I used both this morning and it isn&#x27;t fragrant at all.  And the shampoo is foamy, like when you first beat egg whites......I was looking forward to the fragrance,  aside from the color extend, so I am disappointed with this product. I&#x27;m a little concerned that it may have been tampered with...... Maybe  things like this need to be bought at a salon?  I really wanted to love it.  I bought it from \\&quot;Beauty in Style\\&quot; with the order  fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
    <li> this shampoo and conditioner is a great buy and is really wonderful for professional color hair care and a great price</li>
    <li> I used WEN for years until my hair seemed to be too oily.  This is the best shampoo and conditioner out there.  This is the same shampoo and conditioner that my hair dresser uses.  Love it!  Very gentle.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have found this on Amazon.  These bottles would cost more than twice as much in my Salon, so this is a great, great buy.  At this price and size, it&#x27;s barely more expensive than some drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have colored-treated hair that is fine and oily.  Redken Color Extend has a nice lather, mild scent, and makes my oil scalp feel squeaky clean.  The conditioner does NOT weigh my hair down, which is sometimes a problem for me.  My color looks great - I am certain that it doesn&#x27;t get as brassy as it did when I was using regular old Herbel Essence.  And my hair has great body too!  I used to wear my hair back most of the time, but since switching to Redken I can wear it down more often because it&#x27;s not as flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this set.  If you have fine oil-prone hair, this should be great for you too!</li>
    <li> Love this Redken shampoo and conditioner. Gentle product...leaves hair with a natural feel and holds in the color with little fading.Saves money too...a little shampoo and conditioner goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  But not the genuine Redken product. Shampoo is runny and conditioner lumpy.  Also  missing the unmistakable fragrance.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I purchased this in a grocery store so I&#x27;m not 100% sure it&#x27;s the real deal or not. It&#x27;s not horrible. It did seem to prevent color fading but it really weighed my baby fine hair down. I probably should have gone with a  shampoo that gave volume and maybe I would&#x27;ve had a better result. For the money I prefer the Biolage,but everyone&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
    <li> Love this product by Redken. I usually use the All Soft line but recently got some coloring done and wanted a little more color protection. First of all it smells really good. Secondly I was happy to see that it still gave me the softness to my hair as the All Soft line, but keeps my colored hair bright. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Everything came in and the packaging was excellent.  Only thing is, my order was supposed to be here in two days and it wasn&#x27;t .  Otherwise, I would have added another star.</li>
    <li> I was using the All Soft by Redken for the longest time and started noticing my hair wasn&#x27;t as soft as it&#x27;s been in the past. I did some research into the ingredients and noticed that they had changed the formula and started using the Argon Oil instead. I hate that stuff. Doesn&#x27;t work worth a crap. My hair dresser recommended this shampoo even though I don&#x27;t color my hair anymore. I have loved this product since the first wash. Feels like my hair dresser just washed my hair and it leaves it nice a soft. This has been a great replacement for the All Soft I was using before.</li>
    <li> After coloring my hair red, I couldn&#x27;t find a shampoo that would extend the color. Every \\&quot;color safe\\&quot; shampoo faded my hair color fast. My sister recommended REDKEN and I decided to try it because I would try anything at this point. After the first time washing it I could see a big difference in my color. Plus, my hair was so much softer and dried easier.</li>
    <li> Just great!  I&#x27;ve used it before and it was nice to get it in bigger quantity this time for a great price.</li>
    <li> Great price, large bottles, quick receipt. Definitely prolonged the purple color that I put in my hair much longer than any other product. It also does not weigh my hair down or make it look greasy, which is difficult because my hair is so thin.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal.  The same product we love to use for its unique smell and the way it makes our hair feel soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Same product I have purchase at the salon and drug store.  I was a bit hesitant.  Dont be, this is what your looking for.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000QA7HNC Redken Color Extend Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Liter 2pk]]If it&#x27;s a true Redken product you will see a very small outline of a box imprinted on the top of the dispenser.  If it&#x27;s not there, it&#x27;s being resold as Redken but it&#x27;s not.  Check it out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best! I always buy these big bottles, but it lasts me for months.  I have thick, fine hair about two inches past my shoulders and I wash it once a day.  Doing that, this lasts five months or more.  I can tell a noticeable difference in how long my color lasts.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo about two years and I still love it.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Great price!!</li>
    <li> I agree that this is NOT redken product, I have been using redken for years this is a different consistency and doesn&#x27;t smell like it at all....I will never buy again, there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s a good proce</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sister for Christmas. She loved them! They shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> arrived as advertised</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo/conditioner! I have extremely oily/fine/thin hair and this stuff works great! I have also noticed that it does extend my color in my hair and leaves it shiny and beautiful! When you have colored hair it is important to not wash your hair with cheap shampoo/conditioner and honestly you get what you pay for! I spend $150 bucks to get my hair colored, so I don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra on the products if they&#x27;re going to help the color extend to its fullest! This conditioner is also great because it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy and it helps detangle it in the shower.  I also love the color extend deep conditioner that I use about once a month (same line made by Redken) and it helps your split ends be minimized and your hair restored! Again, I have way oil hair so using a deep conditioner is something I&#x27;m always skeptical about because they&#x27;d typically leave my hair greasy and gross.  The Redken color extend line, including the deep conditioner, have never left my hair gross, oily, or flat! They also have ingredients in them that are good for heat resistance!</li>
    <li> Great product at great price</li>
    <li> Second time buying.  My colored and highlighted hair is much more conditioned that it was with previous products.</li>
    <li> Love how clean my hair feels! The shampoo is creamy but rinses clean so you do not feel weighed down. The conditioner also adds body without saturating your hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of my hair after using this product.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase and I was really hoping that it would be better than some of the reviews said.  This product leaves your hair feeling good, but did not help preserve my \\&quot;Cherry Cola\\&quot; hair color like I hoped it would. I don&#x27;t believe it helped extend my color any more than a regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I will use on my color treated hair - whether I&#x27;m bleaching it or dying it.  In the past when I&#x27;ve run out and have had to use something else, my hair becomes dry, brittle and flat.  This is a great combo for bringing softness back to chemically treated hair, and it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that gives my really thin (and long hair) body.  Can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this product, and the price is great for what you get.</li>
    <li> If it weren&#x27;t so expensive I would rate this 5 stars. The result is strong shiny and high volume, that actually seems to make the color in my girlfriends hair look deeper.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for less than two weeks before my head began to itch. It wasn&#x27;t in one spot, but all over. I thought I didn&#x27;t rinse my hair completely, but days later, the itching turned into small breakouts along my hairline and on top of my head. Those turned into large and extremely painful patches--Something I&#x27;ve never experienced with any shampoo or conditioner. Even product that made my skin break out a little didn&#x27;t HURT like this. I&#x27;m so uncomfortable, even a week after discontinuing use, I went online to do some research. I knew I&#x27;d find other poor reviews and I&#x27;ve found several, on several different websites, that contain almost identical experiences. Apparently, this stuff used to be great. I wouldn&#x27;t know, but Redken needs to be aware. I tried contacting them via the website. No luck.</li>
    <li> I chose to buy this shampoo/conditioner over a more expensive name brand because of price and being Redken, I expected a little higher quality than the cheaper products i have used in the past. I won&#x27;t be doing that again. The positive was the smell. The negative, after rinsing your hair, it feels waxy, like there&#x27;s still conditioner left on your hair. The conditioner is too heavy I think. I feel like it didn&#x27;t extend color any different than other cheaper shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. Also, by the next day my hair was real greasy. So even if I wanted to skip washing my hair the next day, I couldn&#x27;t. Lastly, it clogged my pores causing me to break out. I have never had that happened to me before. So I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Great price. My sister who is a licensed cosmetologist gets these for around this price with her discount.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My color last so much longer and this product goes along way.</li>
    <li> Only products my wife uses.  So much cheaper on Amazon then at a salon.  These last her for months.  They also sell a pump that works with these bottles, really cuts down on waste that way too.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it and gets silky wonderful hair.</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!!!!  This is NOT the REAL STUFF!!!!!!  DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Redken Color Extend Shampoo/Conditioner is the best hair product I have tried yet. This product does not dry out my hair like other shampoo/conditioners.</li>
    <li> Great Product, And amazing price!!!!!! I get blonde high lights and I use Redken Color Extend because it does exactly that, keeps my hair feeling soft and shiny. Along with keeping the blonde looking great.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo - conditioner combo leave hair looking great.&lt;br /&gt;Colored hair retains its color much, much longer.&lt;br /&gt;Redken is a brand that hasn&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
    <li> I like Redken shampoo/conditioner. Buying it through Amazon was easier and quicker than getting to a hair salon to purchase it. It was about the same price.</li>
    <li> I had recieved this and opened the package. The conditioner top was broken off and there was condtioner all over the packaging. The shampoo top was broken but luckly none of the it spilled but I had to put it in another container same with the conditioer.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Great price!</li>
    <li> Delivery as planned, excellent shampoo</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shampoo for heaven&#x27;s sake.  You put it on your head/hair with some water and rub.  It bubbles, smells good and cleans your hair...like shampoo is supposed too!  Did it extend my &amp;#34;color,&amp;#34; well, no, my hair is not bottle colored, so my hair stayed the same color it was before I used the stuff.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife as she enjoys this product already. Product was as advertised, delivery was as advertised. Saved about 20% over my local prices.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product</li>
    <li> It Works. Tried many shampoos and this one makes my hair shine. Seems to stay cleaner longer. Love the large size bottle as I live rural and hard to find product.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I will use for my colored hair! Great portion for the price! It also smells good too!</li>
    <li> Love these products. I use Redken to color my hair and in combination with the Shampoo and Conditioner the color last super long!</li>
    <li> Combo arrived fast.  I love Redken hair products and since I color my hair I decided to try this line for color treated hair.  Only thing I would do next time is purchase the pumps that are sold separately to make it easier to dispense the product.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and seller!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Within two washings my hair that felt like old broom straw now looks just about good enough for a hair commercial. Seriously, its soft and shiny. Even my five year old noticed and complimented it. It does however lose one star for being so expensive. At nearly $20 per bottle I probably won&#x27;t be able to get it every time I need to replenish my supply of hair washing products. Which is too bad.</li>
    <li> I have coarse porous hair and this takes the color out!!!! In fact if I make a mistake and the color goes too dark this is my go to shampoo for fading it fast! It does a good job of conditioning and your hair does shine, but it is also designed to keep color in which it does not for coarse hair.  This should stipulate on the label that this is not intended for coarse hair!</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed Redken products.  My beauty operator uses Redken every time I go to the beauty shop.  Now this new Color Extend really helps keep the color stay in longer and it makes you hair feel soft and manageable.  Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I get my hair colored from either Aveda or Ulta and have been using this for the last several years.  Works well for me!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and for the money I don&#x27;t think I can get better. Yes there is a hair cleaning product sold on tv and one of the shopping channels that is a lot better and REALLY extends my hair color however I cannot afford $170 for a gallon of it.&lt;br /&gt;I think people who have problems with Redken might be using way too much of it. I use a pea sized amount of the shampoo with a rinse and repeat and then maybe a quarter size of the conditioner. I use the dry washcloth to squeeze out excess water and then add the conditioner and finger comb it though my hair. My hair stylist told me years ago to never add ANY conditioner to the root if the hair since my natural hair oils will take care of that and will just make my hair look dirty faster.&lt;br /&gt;I am not able to say for sure if the shampoo KEEPS the color longer but I know it does not wash it out and BTW I color my hair a medium auburn which is one of the hardest colors to keep from fading.</li>
    <li> I have to say, the REAL Redkin Color Extend shampoo &amp; conditioner, purchased from an actual salon is wonderful!!! This however seems to be fake.  I&#x27;ve used Redkin color extend for years on my platinum blonde bleached hair &amp; my hair has always been soft &amp; manageable. I have below shoulder length, super fine hair, naturally auburn that is bleached out to platinum. Always looking to save money (regular priced liters are $25 EACH at salon) I ordered these. The contents of the liters I received was NOT REAL REDKIN formula. I&#x27;ve used the new formulas and these were the same bottle labels &amp; ingredient lists but completely different inside.  After 3 days my hair was dry, droopy, breaking &amp; nasty feeling.  My scalp itched &amp; started breaking out with pimples. On a whim, I brought bottles with me to the salon &amp; we compared. Not the same smell. Not the same consistancy. I bought new bottles from salon &amp; within a week my hair was back to normal. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes my hair feel soft. I&#x27;m not really sure about adding days to my color, but it&#x27;s not hurting.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised and speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> Have been using for a long time. The best</li>
    <li> Price was great,and affordable</li>
    <li> I have always used whatever shampoos and conditioners I found at the supermarket, thinking they all did the same thing. But after I spent a lot of money having my hair professionally colored I figured I might as well take care of my investment and try the &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; brand. I read reviews about Redken Color shampoos and conditioners and figured I&#x27;d bite the bullet..... What a difference!! I&#x27;ll never go back to the other stuff. Immediately I could see the shine, body, and bounce in my hair. I have very curly coarse hair and I&#x27;m kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t use this product sooner. I&#x27;m a believer and definitely recommend you use this product!</li>
    <li> Love this! Has really seemed to stretch the life of my hair color. As a bonus it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I love the Redken shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair. I did stop using it for a while, because the 12 and 8 ounce bottles of each were around $15. I decided to go online and found these 33 ounce bottles for $20. I am a very happy consumer now!</li>
    <li> Great service, good price.&lt;br /&gt;I am however still searching for the elusive magical hair product that is going to change my life.</li>
    <li> the shampoo is great  the grave digger dodge3 1 i never got the toy i purchased it was a different truck it fell a part on the first try the lights did not work , and the vendor did not acknowledged that they did anything wrong it took for ever to get a credit and I ended up paying over $30.00 FOR FREIGHT</li>
    <li> Terrific product. Love the way it smells and leaves my hair in great condition.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am 64 and color-treat my longish hair with semi-permanent color. Since I started using Redken Color Extend Shampoo &amp; Conditioner, my hair has become soft, shiny, and healthy once again. I told my daughter, (who gave me some of this for Christmas) that it makes my hair feel young again. I plan on buying more, both for me and for her.</li>
    <li> I use this product religiously.  I tried to switch to another product for a few months just because I have heard that if your shampoo and conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to be working with your hair to switch it up.. When I switched to another product my hair did not seem as healthy as when I used Redken..so I can back and now my hair is starting to get back to its healthy self again.  Yay!</li>
    <li> For the price.. WOW.. and the product rocks..</li>
    <li> Best For Reds and Purples in Your Hair :)</li>
    <li> I really love the shampoo, but wish the conditioner would leave my hair softer. I have to use a lot of conditioner. Especially on long hair.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Redken products previously so I am familiar with them but the one I received from Seller: Beauty In Style, I am not totally convince it was a Redken product. Redken products have a certain feel and smell. The product I received has a heavy smell of sweet perfume and is too thick to be Redken, similar to Tresemme.  If the product was a true Redken, it would have a subtle smell and smoother consistency. I would recommend this product, if it is a true Redken, but choose the seller carefully because there are fake versions of this product being sold. Previous Customer said, \\&quot;there should be a box imprinted on top of dispenser for it to be a real Redken Product\\&quot;. Mine did not have this imprint. Check yours to be sure.</li>
    <li> This is a counterfeit product. I love the real thing. This stuff made my hair feel so grimy after a couple of uses,</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of the smell of the color extend. The all soft and real control are a lot more pleasant.</li>
    <li> always use this type of product</li>
    <li> My wife asked for it... I bought it.  It arrived promptly and was just what the Dr. ordered. :-)</li>
    <li> Prompt, friendly delivery of quality product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This cleans and conditions my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job at not fading my haircolor.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000QA7HNC Redken Color Extend Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Liter Duo]]&lt;br /&gt;I bought these products at Walmart because the salesgirl told me they were a miracle for dry, damaged, color treated hair.  Admittedly, my hair has been through the ringer and needs a lot of care, but I have been nursing it back to health for months and my stylist finally said it was healthy enough for an awesome color weave.  I was so excited about my new color, then I used these products and was immediately disappointed.  When I got out of the shower I could barely comb my hair out. My hair is actually down past my shoulders but it was so dry in spots it waded up like a giant cotton ball immediately out of the shower, when it should have been soaking wet!  Not wanting to give up because of the price of these products, I bought a leave-in conditioner spray that at least allowed me to comb through the mess the next time I used these products. I then bought a higher end leave-in spray and now am at least able to style my hair.  What a waste of money!  These products may work fine for color treated hair that is healthy, but they are definitely not designed to repair dry, damaged hair!!!  With the addition of the leave-in conditioner I might have been able to save my money and finish using the products. Unfortunately since I&#x27;ve been using them I have broken out with acne, including painful cysts all around my hair line, as well as on my forehead, chest and back. I even have a few blemishes on my checks!!  After reading that others have experienced the acne breakouts as well, I would not recommend this product to anyone!  I&#x27;m changing today.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product from my hair salon. I like it alot and the bottle size I love and the price is awesome.</li>
    <li> I ordered color extended but instead got extreme shampoo and conditioning for distressed hair..??! I am not sure that better but it wasn&#x27;t what in ordered</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it extended the life of my color at all.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair feeling fantastic every time and has a nice clean smell. The bottles are huge, so I will probably order the pumps that go with it next time.</li>
    <li> Packaging was not so great, as the bottle was not sealed but does have a cap, I don&#x27;t feel 100% comfortable but I have kept them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the product is genuine.</li>
    <li> I was not able to use the product. At least it was delivered in time (since I am travelling this is a huge concern) and it was not smashed or anything. Very good. Will try to write a review after me and my wife start to use it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.</li>
    <li> I am going to quit doing reviews if I have to come up with so many words to describe shampoo. Wife loves this product....enough said!</li>
    <li> I use to love this product, however recently noticed that my hair is unhealthy, dull, flat, getting tangled, and large painful zits growing around my scalp. I couldn&#x27;t believe this shampoo was creating this, so I decided to change and use another product. After two weeks of using another product, I came back to Redken Color Extend shampoo and conditioner. And again, my hair felt and looked unhealthy, dull, flat, was getting tangled and started getting large painful zits on my scalp. Sadly, I no longer use this product. I gave it a 3 b/c the product worked GREAT when I first used it.</li>
