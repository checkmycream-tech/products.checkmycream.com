<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No noticeable difference whatsoever. Gave me a little bit of sensitivity during use. It doesn&#x27;t white my teeth but after every use, I noticed small white spots on the same tooth.</li>
    <li> I feel a little uncomfortable at the first time I use it. It getting better from the second time. It need more than 7 pairs to see the result. I love it. I hope the down piece could be a little longer to cover more teeth.</li>
    <li> Love Crest Whitestrips! They work so well but I can&#x27;t use them more than 2 days in a row because of sensitivity.</li>
    <li> The Pro Effects white strips really do work! Unlike the regular ones, which don&#x27;t adhere well, these actually stay in place and get you the results you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, after a few days, I experienced sensitivity with my bottom teeth while brushing and drinking cold fluids. Perhaps a product for sensitive teeth will be my next pursuit of a teeth whitening product. If there is one out there on the market.</li>
    <li> I really liked these. I feel personally,..for me..it worked really well..lightened my teeth about 2 shades...easily became part of my routine..kind of got addicted..so I will be ordering these again!!</li>
    <li> Bought mine from:  (Sold by: Amazon.com LLC)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These did not lighten my bottom teeth and did not lighten the top ones that much.  The Crest Premium ? ones that I used a few years back were great.  Did not realize that the bottom teeth were not lightening that much until I had used almost all of them.  I still have three left.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if I bought a fake product, but have read here and on other sites that these do not perform well.  They&lt;br /&gt;appeared to adhere to my bottom teeth, so I don&#x27;t know what was the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Premium Whitestrips that whitened well were bought at Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a refund from the company by sending back the required UPC cardboard portion of the box.&lt;br /&gt;The company sent me a gift card for the purchase price that I haven&#x27;t used yet.  (I believe there is a 60-day period given to return the UPC for a refund).</li>
    <li> I love these white strips. They work very well and stay on your teeth without any slippage (in fact they&#x27;re a little difficult to remove). I use them as &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; whitening every 6-8 months and am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> *¨¨*:•.FIVE.•:*¨¨*:•.STARS.•:*¨¨*.•:*¨¨*:•.THANK.•:*¨¨*:•.YOU.•:*¨¨*:•</li>
    <li> Price is ok. Product works really well.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay on your teeth too well.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom ones fall off.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the toothpaste. My teeth are now pearly whites. However it does make my teeth sensitive and it hurts.. I personally use it on and off. Whenever the pain is bearable..</li>
    <li> It really does the job, and you can find obvious improvements after using it.</li>
    <li> I can only say this is an amazing product!!</li>
    <li> made my teeth a bit sensative</li>
    <li> These strips work, as do all of the other line of products. I felt like this particular one had a stronger gel to fight against stains... I wore one set of strips for 30 mins a day for two days and on the third and fifth day I went without wearing them because my teeth became slightly sensitive. However, I knew this would happen after reading the pamphlet in the box. My teeth before the treatment where pretty white already but not the white I wanted. After wearing only 4 strips I started to notice the product working on the stains that were visible only to me (since everyone thought my teeth were fine &amp; white looking).</li>
    <li> Got these with a discount, and it was totally worth it!  I noticed a decent difference in shades, but obviously a dentist would do a much better job I am sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to the brightness of my teeth. After I&#x27;ve used for twice, it seems work. I guess I should stick to it for a couple more days and see the result.</li>
    <li> They work! Both my teenagers use these and I can&#x27;t believe the improvement. My son showed great results after four days!!!!</li>
    <li> Great Product ..AAAAA ++++++</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these whitening strips!  No dental molds necessary and you can use the strips at home at your convenience.  THEY DO THE JOB....AND WE&#x27;LL!</li>
    <li> I will purchase these again, My Husband and Dentist noticed a big difference in how white my teeth have become, love these...</li>
    <li> These do whiten my teeth, but they have made my teeth sensitive after using more than a couple times a week.  So I use it less often, only twice weekly, and I have no problems.</li>
    <li> Best over the counter whitener made.  Excellent results every time I use them (about every six months)</li>
    <li> Not working for me and my wife.</li>
    <li> Even my dentist recommended these for whitening my teeth. I pride myself on good teeth at age 65, so keeping them as white as I can is important. These work great.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t see any difference. The product also causes sharp pains in the gums and teeth after a while. Eek!</li>
    <li> work great...teeth are getting whiter :-)</li>
    <li> These work.&lt;br /&gt;Plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note of caution, just depends on user:&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth will hurt if you use it as frequent as they say you can.&lt;br /&gt;Take a day break or so between uses.</li>
    <li> I rate it as a four because they started hurting my teeth after 4 days or so. Now I use them whenever I feel like my teeth are going back. This method is working very well for me.</li>
    <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell if these Crest Whitestrips were working but I stuck with them anyway. The other day my friend complimented me on how white my teeth looked (she didn&#x27;t know I had been using the product)... so I guess that means they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason they only made my bottom teeth sensitive, so I switched from using them every day to every other day. Teeth are still semi-sensitive but its really not that bad.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and they are whitening my teeth</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;m a very mature coffee drinker who works with the public.  I have to work at keeping my teeth smile white.  It never fails to do the job. I always receive compliments on my white teeth!  Our smiles make a difference:)</li>
    <li> The second time (8 months later) it was Very VERY painful with means this product f☆☆☆☆ up your teeth enamel.</li>
    <li> I used them as advised and was happy that my teeth definitely looked whiter but towards the end of course it caused my upper gum on one side to ride up and become inflamed, exposing the root of the tooth. Once I stopped using them over a few days the gum lost its red appearance and I can&#x27;t see as much of the root of the tooth. If anyone at Crest would like to chat about this experience they are free to contact me.</li>
    <li> Waited to use them until closer to my daughters wedding. They didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me. They have a satisfaction guarantee from Crest, which expired yesterday, so I&#x27;m out the money and still have my same discolored teeth.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. My teeth are definitely,visibly whiter! 😆😃&lt;br /&gt;2. The more you use them, the more layers of stains they remove.&lt;br /&gt;3. They are comfortable, don&#x27;t move and all the chemicals stay in the casings and don&#x27;t leak out into your mouth.👍&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. After only two uses, the strips left white spots on my teeth. They are now fading after about 2 1/2 weeks of use. *But this scared me at first. Also, this was little embarrassing as a person who smiles alot during my job working in Customer Service.&lt;br /&gt;(The Oficial Website warns that some people may experience whites spots, but that they are not serious and will diminish with time.)&lt;br /&gt;SIDEBAR - The reason I listed this is because after further research, I learned that whites spots can be results of decalification. (Some people&#x27;s spots have never went away.)&lt;br /&gt;Also, whitening strips can deteriorate your&lt;br /&gt;enamel. (Enamel cannot be replaced)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I experienced 3 Intense Nerve Shocks/Pains after three separate treatments. They really hurt, but only lasted for about 15 seconds. {It feels like someone is drilling a hole through your tooth}. 😭&lt;br /&gt;After experiencing these sudden Nerve Shocks/Pains, I did more research and found that some customers have reported having sensitive teeth after using whitening strips. *Food for thought. 💡&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Summary/In Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are certainly whiter but I won&#x27;t be using whitening strips again. Most likely I will pay for the $300 treatment at the dentist so I know for certain it will be safe and I will be fully aware and informed of all the parameters.&lt;br /&gt;I only recommend this if you need really need it and have something coming up in a week. While my teeth are visibly whiter, the negatives effects outweighed the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND LONG-TERM USE. (More than 20-30 DAYS of consistent use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This quote pretty much sums up my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;You don&#x27;t know &#x27;til ya know...&amp;#34; ▔\▁(ヅ )▁/▔&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the same token, you have now been warned and informed my fellow people. The choice is yours. Stay positive and never stop chasing your dreams! ( ͡- ͜ʖ ͡- )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your brother, DJ.&lt;br /&gt;Tchau! ; )&lt;br /&gt;By the same token, you have now been warned and informed my fellow people. The choice is yours. Stay positive and never stop chasing your dreams! ( ͡- ͜ʖ ͡- )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your brother, DJ.&lt;br /&gt;Tchau! ; )</li>
    <li> Sticks to your teeth and really works nicely.</li>
    <li> I had to take a day or two in between application days because it made my teeth extremely sensitive, not surprisingly the results were not the expected.</li>
    <li> My teeth became quite white after usage. I am very happy with this product. I recommend it highly without reservation.</li>
    <li> These have always been my go to. They work fantastic! I get compliments all the time about how white my teeth are.</li>
    <li> this does not work at all. i did not see anything change in 3 days like what they said on the box. after using all 20, its still the same</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lost for words. I see everyone posting great reviews but my experience was opposite. My teeth did not get any more white or look professionally cleaned after my 20 treatments. I&#x27;m leaving two stars because even though it didn&#x27;t work, it didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive like other whitening products so i&#x27;m just happy it didn&#x27;t leave damage.</li>
    <li> These are the best whitening strips I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stay on your teeth. I have sneezed, drank water, etc. without them coming off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They deliver on whitening as well! Great results!</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest White Strips for about 6 years now.  I use them about every 6 months-1 year.  They really do whiten your teeth.  I get compliments on my teeth from complete strangers!  Even my dentist and hygienist remark how white my teeth are. My dentist says my teeth look like those of a teenager and I am in my 60s! They are simple to use, just apply the strips to your teeth once a day for 30 minutes. . .that&#x27;s it! I highly recommend this product. By the way, this product is MUCH cheaper on Amazon than other stores. Also, no tax, free shipping, and it is delivered right to your door!</li>
    <li> Great deal, arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I used these whitening strips prior to my wedding. I was skeptical at first but extremely satisfied with the result. These are cheap compared to going to a dentist or similar practice. They stick to your teeth easily. I&#x27;d prefer to use these again over the tray systems that are out there. Noticeable results.</li>
    <li> This product works well, but it does lead to tooth sensitivity.  I&#x27;m sure it says that on the product information, but it is noticeable.</li>
    <li> i got these for my fiance and i to use a month or so before our wedding, hoping to have brighter teeth in our wedding picture.  after a month of tender teeth, my teeth looked 98% the same.  waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used nearly 7 strips now and see a noticeable change in my teeth colour.&lt;br /&gt;Although not completely bright but yellowness has started disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;But I found after second use of strip the gums started hurting.&lt;br /&gt;So here is how to avoid the pain:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash your teeth with water before applying the strips.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply the strips just before bed-time so that you wont be eating anything for next 6-10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;3. Take the strips off after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;4. Now most important: brush your teeth thoroughly to clean away all the gel from your teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;5. You will feel that your gum wont hurt as much next morning and teeth will start getting brighter.&lt;br /&gt;6. If teeth still hurt, take a break for a day or two and dont use strips.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Wow, wow, it definately lightened my teeth.  I had a temporary crown in place when I started usig the strips and they tried to match my teeth to the temp and now, the crown looks like a kernnel of corn.  I am so glad I did it now instead of getting the new crown and being disappointed.  What a difference it made.  Love, love, love Crest!</li>
    <li> uSED THE PRODUCT OVER THE PRESCRIBED 20 DAYS FOR 30 MINUTES EACH DAY. DEFINITELY WHITENED MY TEETH AND WAS EASY TO USE. LIKED THE WAY THEY ADHERE TO YOUR TEETH. I TRIED ANOTHER OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND THE STRIPS SLID ALL OVER THE PLACE. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND GIVING THEM A TRY.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and she is probably half way through the box.  Her teeth are very definitely whiter.  They look great!  She has not noticed any change in sensitivity.  She has skipped a day once or twice.  She is very happy about how much better her teeth look.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase.  It arrived quickly as promised and I was able to take advantage of the discounted price which make it more affordable than purchasing it at a retail location.  I haven&#x27;t yet finished my treatments but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m noticing a drastic change....maybe my teeth are a little whiter??</li>
    <li> I can see the difference with only using one application.  I also bought the whitening toothpaste by Crest and am using them hand in hand.  This will save you lots of money by not having your dentist whiten your teeth. Try it..........it is working for me.</li>
    <li> I went through 5 boxes of these hoping to get hood results made it a little bit more whiter but not the results I was looking for also one of my tooth chipped don&#x27;t know if this had anything to do with it as the h202 inside it weakens the tooth</li>
    <li> Very Easy put on. Fabulous - stay on as long as you want them too. THey definitely whiten teeth after a few days.</li>
    <li> I used these for awhile but I didn&#x27;t like the sticky residue on the film. I guess it has to be there but i just wasn&#x27;t a fan and didn&#x27;t really see a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased these again since my original 5 star post and I&#x27;m changing my rating dramatically to 1 star.  Crest seemed to have changed the formula on the strips and they no longer work for me.  I mean NO CHANGE in whiteness anymore.  I don&#x27;t know what happened but it&#x27;s obvious I no longer get any benefit from these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old post:&lt;br /&gt;The Pro version of the strips work well for me.  I see a slight difference after one application and they get whiter with each one.  I never had issues with sensitive teeth.  I guess all those years of taking fluoride pills as a kid helped.</li>
    <li> It did whiten my teeth but omgosh my teeth got SOOO sensitive and it would like be painful so I stopped using it. I was using sensodine toothpaste while using it but it hurt more and more after 2 weeks I stopped and it I think I&#x27;m just going to save up money and go to a professional dentist haha</li>
    <li> WHEN I 1ST APPLIED THE STRIPS, IT MADE MY TEETH ACHE, BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS, IT GOT BETTER. I&#x27;VE NOTICED A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE WHITENING OF MY TEETH, AND SO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE.</li>
    <li> Really works. Can leave teeth a bit sensitive after using consecutive days. Definitely whitens teeth.</li>
    <li> Everyone notices your teeth. The whiter the better. Half way in you will get noticed that your teeth are whiter, mixed feelings, especially when you thought they looked good before. Face it you like to smile, make it more enjoyable. Amazing the boost to the self image too. Would recommend a once a year routine. Try it you will thank yourself. Make sure you get the professional effects they have other systems but this one isn&#x27;t hard on the gums and gives you the results you want. This is it right here people. Heck if not for you, then the rest of us. :)</li>
    <li> These guys certainly work - if you follow the instructions and use them consistently. I get a small amount of sensitivity but nothing serious and I have pretty problematic chompers. Also this is the best price available.</li>
    <li> I have been using crest white strips faithfully for YEARS...maybe a box or 2 per year. I have the whitest (and straightest lol) teeth of anyone I know and I smoke and drink 2-3 cups of coffee per day. I am always getting asked how my teeth are so white and I say crest white strips every time! Love this product! My teeth are my best feature!</li>
    <li> This product definitely whitens your teeth. After using it for almost a week I could see a difference, even my friends told me my teeth have gotten whiter. I recommend these White strips to anyone who wants to whiten his or her teeth easy and fast.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have used it many times over the years since it first came on the market and have NEVER had an issue with them.  They work exactly as you would expect.  Actually, I think they work better than expected.  I have always taken very good care of my teeth - they are naturally straight and white to begin with because I don&#x27;t drink coffee or soda (anything that would cause stain) but still feel like my teeth get to looking &amp;#34;dingy&amp;#34; as I age.  So every couple of years I will get me some of these and within no time, people start commenting how white and beautiful my teeth are.  I must admit (and don&#x27;t necessarily recommend) that I use them for longer than the package says.  Most mornings when I put the strips on my teeth, I keep them there anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes and then brush my teeth as usual.  If you are prone to sensitivity, I would not do this, but I have never had any issues. My teeth look amazingly white after using this product and definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a whiter/brighter smile.</li>
    <li> Easy to use... Love this Product</li>
    <li> They really hurt if you have sensitive teeth. But they&#x27;re legit. Noticable whitening after three or four sessions. Finished the entire cycle and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I like the results when I use the Crest 3D strips. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product bleaching my teeth with the first use. After removing the sticker my teeth were sensitive for a few hours. Be careful, use it from time to time as it weakens the tooth enamel.</li>
    <li> Always seem to have a problem placing strip on lower teeth, but product works very well for whitening teeth.</li>
    <li> Hurt my teeth the first two days even though I used sensadyne toothpaste. After those days I now feel no sensitivity and my teeth are noticeably whiter. My teeth were so sensitive that the touch or sound of paper products made me cringe.</li>
    <li> I tried these, and didn&#x27;t see results like advertised, and they made my teeth hurt after just two uses.</li>
    <li> This was a great item. Works well. I would like more strips since I have 9 kids and 3 wives.</li>
    <li> Erased 50 years of stain. Teeth now match my front two caps from age 21. Much better than I expected. I will use occassionaly to maintain new whiter shade.</li>
    <li> Did 2 boxes of these and lightened my teeth so much that everyone has noticed and my old chip repair on my front tooth doesn&#x27;t match anymore. That repair was done about 8 years ago so it&#x27;s undone more than 8 years of yellowing from smoking</li>
    <li> These white strips always work great, it&#x27;s as good as going to the dentist office and paying allot more for a whitening.</li>
    <li> Sticks perfect.  Whitens if you&#x27;ve never had whitening before. Only takes 30 min a day for 10-15 days you&#x27;ll see a difference.</li>
    <li> Very good .. my teeth it change know</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my teeth professionally whitened but it was tedious and painful.  This stuff works.  I use this as part of my oral hygiene routine (once a week or more if I have an event coming up) rather than a quick temporary effect.  Prolonging the treatment over a longer period actually reduces risk of damaging your enamel, and therefore reducing the chance of discomfort.</li>
    <li> These work very well. I brush and floss daily. I also don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee. My teeth are already pretty white, but these make them Really REALLY white. If you already have semi white teeth like myself, you DON&#x27;T have to use all 20 strips right away. I&#x27;ll do 5 days every few months. Anymore people start saying my teeth are turning neon and blinding them.</li>
    <li> This product actually does what is expected.  It truly whitens the teeth with no aggravation.  The professional effects does not seem any different than the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; effects though.  A good product that behaves as advertised.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time purchasing this anywhere else.  Much more cost effective to purchase this on Amazon.  Works perfectly as described, didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
    <li> The OTC whitestrips work pretty decently. It&#x27;s likely as good as it gets without a professional whitening. Just wish you didn&#x27;t have to use them for so many days.</li>
    <li> Does this whitening strip help whitening my teeth - Yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But make sure that you wear it within the duration that was specify for this product, which I think is 30 or 45 mins. Because this one time, I had the strip on and I accidentally fell asleep, woke up two hours later with my gum hurting and sensitive. Resulted with sensitive gum for the next few days, that was the last time that I will ever use this product.</li>
    <li> It really did what it was suppose to do. I am very pleased with the result of trying the product.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips really made a big difference on my teeth! I sometimes used two treatments a day just to speed up the process, plus I never noticed any sensitivity to the product. I really love how clean your teeth feel after removing them. I will definitely use them again in the future. A great value for whitening your teeth!</li>
    <li> This product will noticeably whiten your teeth, but don&#x27;t expect anywhere near professional results with just one box worth of treatments. After completing one box worth of strips, my thinking was I was about halfway to perfection: Thus, you might be more pleased with your final results if you did two boxes worth of treatments consecutively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The product came with a $10 manufacturer&#x27;s rebate.  I correctly mailed them everything they demanded for the rebate but they never paid it to me. When I sent a follow-up letter to the rebate address, I received my letter back unopened with a message from the post office that the rebate processor&#x27;s PO Box had been shut down. Ripoff! No more of these strips for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheaper versions but they just don&#x27;t seem to work as well as these.  I think they are still a bit expensive but worth it for a white smile.</li>
    <li> If you take good care of your teeth in general, this box should last you for a while. In my case, I used two strips twice a week for 2 hours. The whitening was noticeable. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Was pretty skeptical when buying this product at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are not highly stained, but they are not that shiny white that I am envious of that others have. Bad diet throughout my childhood and lack of care when it comes to brushing and flossing carefully have left my teeth an off-white that is not off-putting, but certainly lowers my self-esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one week of using these (more like 9 days with 2 random days skipped by accident) I am already noticing results. My teeth look whiter, and I am much happier and more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people mention issues with putting them on, or taking them off, but it has been a breeze for me. The top and bottom strip are clearly identifiable, and they go on with ease after you understand how they should be aligned. Taking them off is also a breeze if you just start from the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply use one strip for the top and one for the bottom, once a day. Afterwards, you are left with residual sticky residue which can easily be removed, but it also a great reminder to brush your teeth in case you need that reminder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, albeit a bit pricey, highly worth it if you want whiter teeth for higher self-esteem.</li>
    <li> works like magic!! My teeth are SO white right now!! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I bought these at target a couple weeks ago &amp; my box is almost gone. Extremely disappointed that these didn&#x27;t work at all for me. The only thing they did do was hurt my sensitive teeth. I&#x27;m now gonna try prime smile :/</li>
    <li> Doing what I expected to do. A little pricey but worth it I guess. The box was smashed when I received it was nothing inside was damaged.</li>
    <li> I was using a 20% solution with custom bleaching trays from a dentist and I had to stop because of tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the Crest 3D Whitestrips might be a bit less painful, but I was wrong.  The nice thing though, is my teeth got used to the pain and as a result the Crest 3D whitestrips win over the expensive dentist bleaching trays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips go on easily and after a minute or two they release the bleaching goo, probably from the moisture in your mouth.  One hour per application is all that is needed, and when you take them off it is surprising because there is a lot of bleaching goo to rinse/brush off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results, I am happy with whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> I have tried other whitening strips in the past but havent really enjoyed sticking to them till the whole treatment completes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I really had to push myself with this one. That said, It really wasnt that difficult keeping the strips on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told by one of my dentist friends that whitening should not be done often because it hurts the enamel.I thought this one might be a good choice in that case as it is advertised as enamel safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really did not have any sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except keeping it on is kinda difficult for someone as impatient as I am. Nonetheless its better than sitting with my mouth open under the dentists light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$35 to $50 is not too bad for the whitening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT DID whiten my teeth..But I would give it a 4 out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I used these strips for only a week and there was a noticeable change in the color of my teeth.  The trips didn&#x27;t whiten areas that have long been damaged by plaque; however, those areas were less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only had to use the strips for 30 minutes and after about 10 minutes I was salivating pretty heavily, so I just did my best to keep the strips dry, which didn&#x27;t always work, but it didn&#x27;t even matter.  The strips STAYED on my teeth very solidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying this item from Amazon or within Wal-Mart stores for the lowest price.  Also try out their toothpaste.  I changed to it and it&#x27;s been wonderful!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product.  My teeth aren&#x27;t overly yellow, but with white teeth being the \\&quot;in thing\\&quot; these days,  I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it.  Who doesn&#x27;t want the best smile possible?  I can&#x27;t afford what the dentists charge for whitening (well, I can&#x27;t justify the expense, anyway!), and this is definitely a cheaper option.  I often see coupons in the Sunday paper as well.  The difference in appearance was subtle, but definitely a difference.  None of my friends noticed, but I could tell my teeth were whiter after 4 days.  The only complaint I really have is that it was hard to find 30 minutes in my day to sit with these strips in my mouth.  I would think of it when brushing my teeth, but they recommend not using it right after brushing your teeth, so that didn&#x27;t work.  I wouldn&#x27;t think of it in the middle of the day.  I had to force myself to set a time, and write a note to remind myself!  Maybe others won&#x27;t have this issue, and I&#x27;m just too forgetful?  In the end, these do work as advertised, as long as you aren&#x27;t expecting the same results you can achieve through a dentist.</li>
    <li> I have not tried a lot of products, but I would say there is no need to search farther than the Professional Effects whitening strips. I could see a marked difference after about 5 days (several days I would double up, a morning and an evening treatment). The strips were easy to apply and once on, they stayed put!! And, there was no bad taste...I was expecting alot of peroxide taste, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all! Last comment, the overall ease of use and good results are well worth the money, and I have several strips left over for touch ups later.</li>
    <li> The product I purchased was the [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]] for about forty bucks.  I am in my 50&#x27;s with no previous teeth whitening experience of any kind.  I half-expected some gum sensitivity because these whitestrips are so strong, but I had no problems at all.  The strips are easy to apply; they are thick enough that they don&#x27;t curl up when you remove the backing, the adhesive makes them stick but you can still make minor positioning adjustments, etc.  They stay in place with no problem (after all, it&#x27;s just half an hour).  Some reviewers have complained they are too difficult to remove, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to be a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the real question is: do they work?  And the answer is: Yes!  Frankly, I was amazed at the difference after three daily applications.  I did seven more, but it actually never got much better than it was after three days.  The remaining ten strips will be saved for future use if the need arises.  Are my teeth totally super white?  No, of course not, nor did I realistically expect that.  But they are much whiter than they were and I am very pleased indeed.  I must add that the areas closer to the gums did not whiten as much, and I was hoping that the last seven treatments would help, but there is still a mile color gradient.  Nevertheless, I am very happy with the results and would definitely recommend them to others.  The only thing I would do differently is buy a smaller package - twenty strips was overkill for me.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve used strips in the past, I&#x27;m sure you had the same problems as me with the strips sliding all over, having to keep your mouth more or less in one place, and being able to taste the less then appealing gel.  Not anymore!  These WILL NOT MOVE, have no gel taste what so ever, and will whiten your teeth.  Best strips I&#x27;ve ever used and the only ones I will use from here on out..... ;o)</li>
    <li> I used the Advanced Seal ones when they came out and noticed they worked better than Zoom! whitening when I shelled out hundreds for it. Now they specify on the box that it is just as effective than laser whitening.. and that is an understatement. I used the Professional Effects ones and noticed that my teeth have never been whiter in my entire life. I was not expecting results that incredible. It is worth the extra few days and pain for the results of these (20 days worth instead of 14 assuming you only apply once per day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t apply after brushing; wait a couple hours&lt;br /&gt;-Use twice per day but hours apart (faster and just as effective assuming you can handle it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been a walking advertisement for something until now. People comment on my teeth a lot (more than when I used the 14 day Whitestrips) and I gladly recommend they try these. Do yourself a favor and have a sparkling and un-natural super-white smile with these things! How do those laser teeth whitening companies stay in business with these things around?!??</li>
    <li> Great Product, greatly help my yellow teeth turn 4 shades brighter! I had braces when I was younger and was always trying to approve the apperance of my teeth. This is a wonderful chance to do so at a relatively cheap price. Each strip fit perfectly and were easy to pull off afterward. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Using the Crest 3D Whitestrips keeps my smile bright and white.  I receive numerous compliments on my smile and the whiteness of my teeth.  People ask me all the time if I get my teeth done by the dentist and the dentist has asked me who did my teeth and I tell them I just us Crest Whitestrips a couple of times per year to keep my smile bright... Say Cheese!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 13th day with the strips and have seen very very little change in the whiteness of my teeth. Now, I&#x27;m not a smoker nor do I drink coffee, soda or any sorts of alcohol that can affect the whitening process. My teeth are not very yellow so I thought that just a 20 day treatment would be more than sufficient for the results I want but sadly after close to $50 down the drain I have seen very insignificant results. Maybe I expected too much after years of professionally whitening my teeth with $25 a pop for a small syringe of bleach, but hey, what can you do, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sensitivity, it wasn&#x27;t that bad and it&#x27;s definitely to be expected.</li>
    <li> These worked good for my teeth. I am older and it is getting harder to keep my teeth looking white. I had to reorder and use them again to get the whiteness that I wanted. I am a professional and try to look my best for my clients. I would reccommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only attempted Crest Whitestrips once before - many many years ago when they first came out. So, after 50+ years of drinking coffee and colas, my teeth were really dingy and yellow (embarrassing yellow)...looked even worse when wearing lipstick!  So, decided to try these before investing in Zoom.  I started out following the instructions to the letter, but got a little more agressive as time went by and I wasn&#x27;t experiencing any sensitivity.  I brush my teeth with Sensodyne, then apply and leave the strips on for an hour daily.  After a box of 20, I can say that I don&#x27;t ever remember my teeth being this bright.  They are still not completely, completely white (they are more of an ivory with some tough yellowish at the very bottom of my lower teeth) but way better than they were and no longer embarrassing.  I have decided to continue treatments into a second box since I still am continuing to see a noticeable improvement about every 3 applications.  I am still hoping to get to that moviestar white!  I&#x27;ve been really using my fingernail to push the strip into the cracks between my teeth and along my lower gumline, hoping to improve the lower teeth - the upper teeth are looking pretty darn good.  I&#x27;m still waiting for someone (besides my family who all know what I am doing) to comment on my teeth!  It seems like such a noticeable difference to me - but I guess they aren&#x27;t quite moviestar material yet!  As for the &#x27;hard to remove&#x27; and &#x27;can&#x27;t eat or drink&#x27; comments from others - seems like such a small, small price to pay for big results!</li>
    <li> These little suckers grab onto your teeth and stay there until you pull them off 30 minutes later.  They&#x27;re extremely easy to apply and comfortable.  I starting seeing great whitening results within a few days.  There is a difference between various brands of over-the-whitening strips, and these are the best I have found.</li>
    <li> I finally got around to trying these out and I will say I am pleased with the results. I wasn&#x27;t always consistent with what time of day I put them on, but based on input from others I did switch to a sensitive tooth toothpaste while using the strips hoping to minimize the sensitivity that some experience. When I did notice some slight sensitivity I avoided very cold beverages and hot foods. It wasn&#x27;t hard to manage. I don&#x27;t think I would do it twice a year, but I think it would be worth doing once a year, depending on the types of food and drinks you consume and how much they stain.</li>
    <li> I have not actually used the strips yet, but have always stood behind Crest whitestrips. They work! I was surprised at how fast these shipped! I literally had them within days!</li>
    <li> i noticed difference after like 3 strips and i&#x27;m happy with the results..still haven&#x27;t used them all..they stick just fine,they don&#x27;t slip and u can drink water and talk as described..the only problem is the sensitivity issue..though it&#x27;s temporal but it can be annoying..but the result is worth it..</li>
    <li> I heard good things about the Professional Effects white strips.  I decided to bite the bullet and buy them.  It was a great deal coming from Amazon as opposed to a retail store.  I just got my braces off a month or so prior to getting these so I wanted to freshen up my teeth.  I was greatly impressed with the results.  You really could see whitening after just 3 or 4 days.  The strips really do seal around your teeth, which assures you are getting good whitening coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some staining on my teeth that the dentist said they would not be able to get, and he was right.  As far as sensitivity goes, I did not experience anything too terribly bad.  At least by my standards.  I just got my braces off though, as I said, so that may have just conditioned me for some pain in my mouth : )  All in all, it wasn&#x27;t bad. Had no problem drinking ice water or eating ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I have gone up a few shades in whiteness and I am very pleased.  I actually have a few strips left over that I felt I didn&#x27;t really need to use, so I will save those for when I do another treatment.  I used the strips as well as the Crest 3D whitening toothpaste and I have to say I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I loved these white strips. I noticed on the third day that my teeth were noticeably white. I&#x27;m almost through the box and my teeth are the whitest and polished they have ever been. I get compliments every day on my teeth and people are always asking me what I&#x27;m using and I lie and say i go to a professional lol. but crest white strips did the job. Its worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great price on Amazon vs a store and they do what they are suppose to. These have \\&quot;advanced seal\\&quot; so they will not slip off your teeth at all (finally!). Down side is, then when it comes time to actually take them off after 25mins, they STILL won&#x27;t really come off. So that gets a little tricky but I prefer that problem to the old problem of them not staying on/shifting while I am wearing them.</li>
    <li> I have never worked for Crest and as an architecture student, probably never will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I however have nothing bad whatsoever to say about this product. I was looking round for teeth whitening alternatives and for the price range i deduced that these were the best and most convenient product for the price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 7 days in out of 20 and i would be happy with the results that i have already seen as a finished result! My teeth were off white and coming up slightly yellow in photos due to smoking and coffee drinking etc... I would estimate they are 2 shades white now going off a shade graph on a review site&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as sensitivity goes, i have had none - except once when i had a cup of coffee straight after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the strips feel a bit strange the first time you put them on but they are no hassle really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works, and in my opinion is a bargain. i will be buying them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer the sensitivity that many people have been talking about, i guess the answer is stop using them and use some Sensodyne toothpaste for a couple of weeks then try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want whiter teeth, this is the product.</li>
    <li> Great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At under $30, my teeth are noticeably whiter after completing the entire box.  I can confidently say I can see a 2-3 shade difference and I already had what I thought were white teeth before I placed my first strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> These were pretty good whitening strips overall. I&#x27;ve used the older Crest Whitestrips also, and the advanced seal makes a HUGE difference for me. These definitely stick to your teeth and don&#x27;t slide like the old ones used to. The whitening is significant, enough that my dentist pulled the assistant in to see the difference (approx. 3 shades whiter). The only think I don&#x27;t like about these strips is the amount of time it takes: 30 minutes a day for 20 days. The old ones were used twice a day for 10. This could just be for optimum safety/reduced sensitivity though. Overall I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Makes your teeth white as a sheet of paper. I love them</li>
    <li> It is a really good deal on Amazon compared to stores and they do work as advertised. Their advanced seal technology do keep them in place and do n slip at all! BUT, the bad thing about this technology is that it works a little bit TOO well and when i really have to take them off after 25 minutes, it requires a little time an effort to do so because it sticks pretty tightly. Basically its a choice between it shifting or having it sticking so hard.</li>
    <li> This whitener works great! If you keep up with using them consecutively you will definitely have whiter teeth, and for a fraction of the price that you would see in stores.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for my Granddaughter who wanted her teeth to be extra special white for her wedding.  Her comments were...I Love Them.</li>
    <li> These strips definitly work and the half hour wait isn&#x27;t all that bad. It did take over a week to arrive with the free shipping though.</li>
    <li> After just a few day, I noticed that my girlfriend&#x27;s teeth were whiter than before, and now I&#x27;m tempted to get a box too ^.^</li>
    <li> Ive tried ALL different kinds of whitening kits, gels, strips, ect. I never wated to try out the crest strips because of the cost but when I saw a 10 dollar off coupon by the add to cart button, i figured nows the time to try! :) (I almost missed the coupon button too so look for it! Dunno how long it lasts)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two times I didnt hardly notice anything, but just by the third and fourth day they were getting really white! I did notice some sensitivity happening, it hurt to eat hot foods or cold foods, but that went away within about 2 days of not using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have taken a before and after picture!! Love it.</li>
    <li> These strips made a noticeable difference within 3-4 days.  I am very happy with this product and will purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Really does give you a noticeablly whiter smile. Really noticed results after using 10 treatments. Your teeth do get a bit sensitive after doing it for a couple days in a row but, if you stop for one day it goes away</li>
    <li> I used this product once  day for about a week and there was some whitening as shown in photographs taken. Not as much as I would have liked. Hopefully if I had used it longer it would have been more noticeable.  I will use the rest and see how it does.</li>
    <li> Previously, I had used the old Crest whitestrips.  While they did whiten my teeth, the hydrogen peroxide was constantly leaking into my mouth, and I couldn&#x27;t swallow (or I&#x27;d be slurpping on hydrogen peroxide nastyness).  Because those whitestrips were so juicy, I felt like they were sliding around, and all the whitening properties were escaping into my mouth, rather than staying on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duuude!  These whitestrips however are fantastic!!!!  I&#x27;ve only used 2, and my teeth are already several shades whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t leak and they STAY ON like nobody&#x27;s business!  Since my hubby and I are on a budget, we are maximizing its use by cutting them in half (down the center), and applying them to just the front teeth (so they don&#x27;t overlap onto the back teeth).  We couldn&#x27;t do that with the old ones, because they would slide right off!&lt;br /&gt;These puppies aren&#x27;t going anywhere.  Who really needs the back of their teeth whitened, anyways?  (-:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, keeping them on 45 minutes to an hour, rather than 30 mins.  More bang for my bucks! The only tooth sensitivity was the 1st application, and I think that was because I had acidic things to eat.  Just don&#x27;t drink coffee right before hand. Also, if there is tooth sensitivity, just take a 1-2 day break inbetween treatments, and use some Sensodyne toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. - don&#x27;t forget to clip your coupon directly from Crest, you can redeem them here on Amazon!  $7 off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy whitening!

    <li> I purchased the Crest-Professional Effects from Walmart. I followed the directions. It didn&#x27;t have any effect on my teeth. Even worse, it hurt my gums.&lt;br /&gt;The formula may be good but the prouduct isn&#x27;t well desgined for teeth whitening. The strips only cover your teeth partially (front teeth only) so your side and back teeth arent&#x27; impacted.&lt;br /&gt;The strips also fall off easily or glide. This isn&#x27;t cheap. I paid $40.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommned the Plus + White Ultra 5 Minute Whitening System which you can get at Walmart or other durg stores. This product is excellent and you really get a professional bleaching. This is very well designed and only costs $7.00. You will be amazed with the results. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy Crest Professional Effects.</li>
    <li> Tried to save money and tried the Plus White 5 minute whitener for 2 weeks 15 min each time and saw no results whatever. Finally ordered Crest 3D. I saw no big difference after the first 2 uses, but after the 3rd use I definately saw a difference. The day after I kept checking my teeth in different mirrors to see if I was mistaken and was happy that I was not. This product really does what it claims and I will continue to buy these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used them for 3 days...and I already have noticed a HUGE difference! Unlike other whitestrips I have tried, Crest 3D Pro Effects have not caused me any pain or sensitivity, which typically happend after the first or second day I use any whitening products. LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> Product worked very well.  I saw results really fast.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this product because of the warnings that it may cause teeth sensitivity.  To my surprise I had very little sensitivity and the results were wonderful!  I started to notice results after just a few days and then it seemed nothing was changing during the middle of the treatment, but at the end of the treatment process I could actually see my teeth turning whiter.  I would definitely use this product again!</li>
    <li> This product was highly rated, so I gave it a shot and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I think I&#x27;m at treatment number 15 (of 20), and I&#x27;ll probably just stop now, as my teeth are now the \\&quot;right shade\\&quot; of white.  Over-whitening is a bad look, so I like how this product allows you to carefully control how much whitening you achieve.  True, going to a dentist for a one-time treatment is quicker, but you don&#x27;t get the ability to precisely choose how much whitening is best.  Also, this way is more gradual, so its less obvious what you&#x27;ve done.  Each \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; consists of wearing small plastic sheets on your teeth for 30 minutes.  I found it difficult the first time, but after 2 or 3 efforts, I got used to it, and now just do normal activities (watch TV, clean house, read, do email, etc.) during that 30 minutes, so its not a big deal. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with teeth sensitivity or anything like that.  All in all, a really solid product that seems low-risk and is cheaper than going to a dentist or whitening center.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> These strips work great but do leave that sensitive feeling after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I read such good reviews on this product, I was expecting so much more from it.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Received in a timely manner. The product does indeed have an advanced seal. Anyone who has tried these in the past, the strips begin to slip after a short amount of time. These do not do that at all. I have also had problems in the past with extreme teeth sensitivity. I am not sure if the chemistry is slightly different with the advanced version, but they are bearable to keep on. Teeth are noticeably whiter after two applications. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all 20 strips, one per day, for 30 minutes, exactly as instructed.  At the end of the 20 days, I&#x27;ve noticed no significant results.  It has not whitened my teeth at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have been better off saving $40 and buying a $1 bottle of Peroxide and $1 box of baking soda instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly has worked for many people on here, but not me.  And I would try Peroxide and baking soda before taking that gamble on yourself.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing these strips from Amazon, and I love them! Before these came out, I used the older version of Crest and hated how they made I teeth feel very sensitive for a few days and how my gums would hurt after use. I would usually quit after about three days because I simply could not tolerate the pain. However these strips make it seem painless compared to the other strips I&#x27;ve used! &#x3D;] These strips do cause a little bit of discomfort, but it is very minimal amount that fads in about a day. And the results are astonishing! Being a smoker and wine drinker, my teeth get used and abused frequently. With these awesome little guys, they look like I get them cleaned and whitened professionally. I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: I usually use about half the box when I first get them, and then wait another 6 months before I use the other half, kind of like an upkeep tool. It works great for me this way, and I feel like the whiteness does not dull over the year! &#x3D;] Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Great deal for a wonderfully effective product</li>
    <li> this is a great product its better then paying a large sum of money at the dentist office and your teeth get really white</li>
    <li> great product. expect to see different in 3 days.</li>
    <li> We call this product our family secret. We all use it and have VERY white teeth. I use it twice a year, and it works wonders. I usually throw them on while I&#x27;m in the shower or doing chores. They do make your teeth sensitive for the 20 days you wear them FYI, but they are worth it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It worked gently and consistently to remove yellowing and stains from my teeth. After the 14 days were complete, my teeth were a gleaming shade of white.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me just say that this price beats any other, ANYWHERE. It&#x27;s a VERY good deal.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price, it was a worthwhile buy. I will probably buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not achieve that ridiculous, beauty-queen litebrite smile I was looking for. However, my teeth are noticably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of sensitivity, PLEASE BE CAREFUL. If you leave this on ANY LONGER than the recommended 30 minutes, your teeth WILL hurt. I recommend doing this every other day for 10 days. I didn&#x27;t, and I left it on longer than I should have. The consequence? My teeth were so sensitive that it hurt to breathe, talk, and eat. It was horrible. True pain, too, not just mild discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. Just be careful how you use it.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, when paired with the 3D Whitening toothpaste and mouthwash, the results REALLY ARE maximized.</li>
    <li> My teeth had a pretty acceptable color but this really works.. After only 3 days I could see a slide change in  the color, now they look really white except the lower teeth which seem to have been whitened only in the upper section. Also if you don&#x27;t take care of what you eat or drink, the result will last for 3 or 4 months at the most. Other than that they really work!I receive compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> I decided to give the Crest Professional Effects Whitestrips a try and am so happy I did! They really do whiten your teeth. I used them once a day for 20 days and saw excellent results!! I would recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Worked on my within the 4th treatment. Only bad thing that cost the 5 star was it made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, I have people telling me my teeth look whiter weeks after I stopped using it!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift... They love!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all in the headline. Follow the directions and get ready for whiter teeth!</li>
    <li> I love this product it really really works made my teeth so white, the strips actually stay in your teeth and the results are just awesome... This is the way to go!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular Crest Whitestrips before (probably 7 years ago) and they worked well.  After switching to a Sonicare toothbrush I noticed that my tooth color had improved, but was still a bit yellow, so decided to try these whitestrips based on the higher active ingredient content.  I started by using them two days in a row, and while I&#x27;ve always had teeth that were just a little sensitive to temperature, these made my teeth noticeably more sensitive and a bit uncomfortable (I actually woke up in the middle of the night and the sensitivity was the first thing I noticed).  I spaced them out to every other day, which did help, as did adding a toothpaste specifically intended for sensitive teeth.  Overall, the result was worth the temporary discomfort.</li>
    <li> The product itself is AMAZING. I saw results within 3 days and even more after the next few days. So far, I&#x27;ve only used about 13 days worth of the strips and my teeth look so much whiter. I will continue using the rest of the strips in the next day or two, but I wanted to give my teeth a break since I did get a tiny bit of sensitivity after using them for over a week straight. Unfortunately, the seller/shipper was extremely slow. It took 10 days from the date of my order to receive my item. The shipping itself only took 1.5-2 days but the item was not actually shipped out until 7-8 days after I put in my order. I would use the product again but I am not sure I would buy it from the same seller.</li>
    <li> These work so well! I used a whole box, and over a month I received more and more comments on how white my smile was, and to this day my teeth are shiny, white, and all thanks to these whitening strips. Definitely buy these!</li>
    <li> would make my teeth hurt and the whitening effect was spotty</li>
    <li> I am a heavy tea drinker so I was looking for an economical way to whiten my teeth.  The Crest 3d whitestrips worked as advertised.  They are very easy to use and are comfortable to wear.  I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter but I&#x27;m not blown away</li>
    <li> I am looking for refund . I am  very disapointed.I won&#x27;t buy this product again . I use all the stripes . I didnt&#x27; see any effect at all . while , it also makes my teeth hurt when I am using it</li>
    <li> This item works pretty good, but I expected it to have more whitening power. I might have to purchase another box for better results.</li>
    <li> My teeth were noticeably brighter by the end of 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Awesome whitestrips at a good price too. And shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest whitening strips in the past and hated the feel and they made my teeth very sensitive which is why I was hesitant to purchase these. A friend told me they are much different than versions in the past so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed!! I am able to do up to 5-6 treatments before there is any sensitivity and it is nothing like it was in the past. I have been using a floride rinse to help with the sensitivity and I will take a day or two off. Great product and much cheaper than professional products. I will purchase another box!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product one month ago and I have used it for 20 days until a week ago. I can&#x60;t see the diference between my teeth now with my anterior smile. I took a picture of my smile on the first day and another on the last day and It looks like I brushed my teeth with a whitening common dental gel. I ordered this brand because it has a lot of great reviews but I&#x60;m very very disapointed. I feel that I lost my money. I should save my money to make a profesional treatment.</li>
    <li> This product, while not perfect it did what it said it would do. My teeth are much whiter than they were before. I bought my son an extra box. Too many years of coffee. Didn&#x27;t have the pain I had read about in other reviews. I would definitely recommend Crest White Strips pro Seal to anyone with dingy yellow teeth. You do see results in 3 days. So get some. It seems a bit pricey but the results are worth it. It beats the $$$ that you would spend in a dentists chair for the same results. I don&#x27;t normally review products but the Crest one was worthy.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, having been disappointed with so many health and beauty products in the past. But yes, I did see a difference after three days of use -- and am even more delighted after ten!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well.  I&#x27;ve had no problems and after a few months my front teeth, dulled by years of drinking colas, are much whiter.  Another secret is NOT to drink any more colas, or plastic bottled anything. My city&#x27;s tap water tastes better anyhow.</li>
    <li> Works well as long as you have the endurance to use them every single day for 30 min. a day.  Not good for those with sensitive teeth.  Sometimes my teeth feel sensitive and I have to lay off a day or so.  My teeth are whiter but not as white as I expected.</li>
    <li> rough on enamel  use as directed</li>
    <li> I quit smoking over a year ago and still had not managed to get some of the stubborn nicotine stains off my teeth despite the use of whitening toothpaste and mouthwash. There is one spot in particular on one of my front teeth where a darkish yellow line had formed in on the perimeter of an old filling. These strips managed to lighten that blemish considerably and took my teeth to a new level of brightness/whiteness - I&#x27;m delighted!  Not only are my teeth cleaner and whiter than before, but my gums also benefited from the regular exposure to peroxide, which is the primary active ingredient in these strips. Those with really sensitive teeth and gums may find these uncomfortable. I did not have any issues and was glad to have the enamel protection of these strips in order to safely whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> Would use Seller again. Excellent product as stated.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White Strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call it a love of coffee and red wine, but my smile really takes a beating. The espresso and zinfandels have plenty of staining power to them, but I think I&#x27;d rather stop smiling than give up my consumption of strong dark caffeinated drinks or hearty and succulent wines. A few years ago, I became self-conscious enough about the yellow tinge my teeth were taking on to go through Brite Smile treatment. It was expensive, and frankly, not all that beneficial. Even the every-six month followup treatments didn&#x27;t really brighten my smile to the point where anyone noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for grins, (literally) I tried the Crest 3D Whitestrips to see if they could produce any noticeable improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. After trying the strips for several weeks, I&#x27;m not impressed. Perhaps consistency is the trick here, as I haven&#x27;t been able to use them, say, everyday for a week. My use is more sporadic - more like every week. And in between sessions, of course, I&#x27;m hitting that espresso machine every morning and bathing my teeth in a glass of rich California wine most nights. But I honestly cannot say that my teeth are any whiter than before I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are easy to apply, once you figure out how to peel the strip off the clear film encased in a aluminum-like foil pouch. They apply to your teeth quite easily, and are very comfortable. You are supposed to wear them for about a half hour, but it is easy to almost forget that they are &#x27;there&#x27; after about five minutes. It is quite possible to wear them and conduct a normal conversation. Peeling them off after the 30 minutes is up is another story. The instructions say not to put them on freshly cleaned teeth and I understand why. They really grip to your enamel and really clean teeth would make them stick even more. It is best to grab a corner of the strip in the back of your mouth and gently pull them off from back to front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips also have no noticeable taste. Some bleaching trays have a definite sting to them as the oxygenated bleach work son your gums and imparts a slight bleach taste. The Crest strips, on the other hand have no such taste or irritation on your mouth. I only wish that they worked more effectively. They are not cheap - Amazon sells them at a great price - which works out to a little less than $2 per treatment. But they haven&#x27;t produced much of a change in the overall whiteness of my teeth,able taste.

    <li> After so many disappointments with whitening strips from a variety of companies, I was very pleased with this product from Crest.  The strips are simple to apply, THEY STAY ON, and they don&#x27;t tangle up when you remove them from the sealed protective pouch.  I began to see improvement after 4 treatments.  I experienced very minor tooth sensitivity which quickly passed.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I drink coffee, and don&#x27;t always brush my teeth right after, so I usually try to whiten my teeth once a year. These strips stuck to my teeth like no other, which is awesome. I used all 20 about 1x a day, sometimes 2x a day. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, and these didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive, although if I put them too high up over my gumline I do notice some soreness. At the end of the box, I feel like my teeth are whiter and less coffee stained. Like others have pointed out, this isn&#x27;t a fluorescent white, just a nice, clean white. It does the trick for someone who usually has a cup of coffee every day!</li>
    <li> Crest has made great strides in these whitening strips!  Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I had been vaguely interested in tooth whitening in the past, but not enough to pay my dentist to do it. I was skeptical that the various \\&quot;strip\\&quot; type products on the market would work, so I was eager to try the Crest 3D Whitestrips.  I had never used such a product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how well they stuck to my teeth.  The first couple of times, being unfamiliar with the process, I didn&#x27;t get things lined up properly, but eventually I figured it out. I never had an issue with the strip loosening before its time was up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertising says that you will see results after three days, and indeed I did.  I took photographs to compare and there was a definite difference.  The longer I used them, the whiter my teeth were.  I was not aiming for blinding, just a reduction of the yellow, and I got that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside was that I noticed some irritation of the gumline after using the strips for a few days.  This was minor and disappeared after I finished the package.</li>
    <li> This product surprised me! I was gonna have my teeth whiten from my dentist for $600.00 when I decided to take the chance on these strips and thank god I did. Not only did I save a ton of money it actually worked wonderfully! I&#x27;ve been using them for 6 days and all my major stains are gone and my teeth are so white! My teeth look so much better and I recommended this product to all my friends and family. I use the strips with the crest 3d whitening rinse and so far so good. Before you spend a ton of money try this product!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people are discouraged by the tooth sensitivity from using Crest whitestrips. I have experienced so much pain in the past that I would only make it through about 3 days of whitestrips. I think my teeth were more sensitive than most. I gave up the idea of using whitestrips becuase of the sensitivity and the gel would get it my mouth and gross me out. Then about 5 years later, which brings us to now, I saw these whitestrips and decided to use them. My dentist recommended that I use Sensodyne for a month before I began whitening because I explained to him my problems in the past. And WOW! I cannot believe how much better these are. My teeth have been experiencing minimal and very bareable pain. Also, these ones are not as gross as the original kind. They stick to your teeth way better. I still have the idea of the old ones stuck in my head, so I put part of a paper towel in my mouth to separate my tongue from my teeth and catch build-up saliva. Sounds kind of weird, but it really works! For those of you experiencing problems, I really recommend that you try both using a paper towel and using sensodyne for a month beforehand. I think others might have similar luck so don&#x27;t give up!</li>
    <li> I received this in record time and am very happy with both the product and the seller. I would definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Shipping is fast!</li>
    <li> ever since i used these, friends, family and strangers have told me my teeth look white! its hard for me to see that whiteness in the mirror, but I guess all the people asking about it are good enough of evidence for how great this product is!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how fast this works!!! I noticed the difference from the first use. Great product.</li>
    <li> These are more effective than the regular ones, but be careful not to leave them on too log as my teeth were rather sensitive the next day if I accidentally left them on for longer than a half hour.</li>
    <li> These are effective and much improved from the original Crest white strips- I have no trouble keeping them on! However, at least at first, I recommend using the strips only half an hour a day. as advised. If I leave mine on any longer, I experience senstivity. These brightened my teeth beautifully in a crunch a week before I was the maid of honor in my best friends wedding.</li>
    <li> makes teeth very sensitive...it works but it makes your teeth so sensitive its hard to eat</li>
    <li> whitens my teeth just as good as a dentist&#x27;s treatment would and I don&#x27;t have to go to the dentist and endure the wait.</li>
    <li> I bleach my teeth probably about once a year.  I have tried NUMEROUS products and recently I decided to purchase the Crest 3D professional effects.  I was willing to spend the $50.00 on this product versus having to go to a dentist or cosmetic specialist to whiten my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also decided to take pictures of my teeth every day to see if there was a difference.  There was.  I only needed the treatment for 3 days to see a difference.  I also did not feel intense sensativity and was able to take aspirin for the few times I did experience a little sensation in my mouth.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the product after 5 days since I was able to achieve the whitness that I wanted.  Good thing about this is once my teeth start turning yellowish again, I know it&#x27;ll only take a few days, this product will probably last me 6 months to a year!!!!  Not bad for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the new strips, every effective and very clingly.  They dont move and I am able to wear them at work, I work in a call center and although it kind of alters my speach the strips do not move and are not uncomfortable at all.  I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this to anyone that does not drink coffee, sodas, or smokes.  The product works beautifully and I have had people complimenting me on my smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know where to post the pictures but I do have them up on my social webpage.</li>
    <li> I have use whitening strips for years. all with visible effect. crest 3d though were the best i have found so far. visible result in 3 days as they promise on the packaging.</li>
    <li> great product, great &amp; fast transportation</li>
    <li> I tried Crest strips when they first came out and did not particularly find them easy to use of very beneficial.  This new product is VERY easy to use and produces excellent results.  How long it lasts, time will tell.  Amazon had a much lower price than the company site or the local store.</li>
    <li> I had been thinking about whitening my teeth for quite some time but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend $400 on the process at my dentist&#x27;s office.  My daughter (who had used an earlier version of Crest White Strips which we bought through our dentist) told me that her girlfriend loved the Crest 3D strips.  They were incredibly easy to use.  Since it is recommended that one uses the White Strips BEFORE brushing your teeth, I put them in as soon as I woke up.  By the time I got ready in the morning, and checked on my girls, I was able to take them off.  This version adheres very well to both the upper and lower teeth and is easy to remove.  No bad taste, no mess, just great.  I had no difficulty with increased sensitivity either.  As the box claimed, I was able to notice a difference after just 7 days, and by day 20 the difference was significant.  My oldest daughter still comments on my teeth now and again.  You know, she&#x27;ll say, \\&quot;Dad your teeth really looked bad before, but now they look so white!\\&quot;  Honest kid.  Bottom line is I highly recommend them and plan on using them again in 6 months.  I&#x27;m curious to see what my dentist says when I go in later this month for my 6 month check up.</li>
    <li> With these, my teeth didn&#x27;t get any whiter than when I was using a hydrogen peroxide  rinse. These did, however, make my teeth so sensitive that breathing in winter air was extremely painful.</li>
    <li> I CAN say as someone who has had stained teeth from childhood due to some medication I was given and have lived 50 years now ALWAYS feeling embarrassed about my smile, this is a FANTASTIC product. I&#x27;ve spent $500 on dentist-based teeth whitening in the past (they even did it one more time for free because the results were minimal at best). I&#x27;ve also bought eight or ten different strips, trays, gels, etc.... Nothing EVER helped anywhere close to what these did in one week. I truly thought I&#x27;d never live without being self-conscious about my smile. THESE THINGS WORKED!! I don&#x27;t normally write raving reviews but this product deserves the highest marks and made a difference in my life and my wanting to smile because I&#x27;m no longer ashamed of my smile. Great, fantastic product!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have done professional whitening that hasn&#x27;t worked this well.  My only complaints are that the strips are very sticky and takes a little effort to remove.  Your teeth will have mild discomfort with this product.  I noticed results in 2 days.</li>
    <li> too strong for me. my teeth got sensitive and now i have to use toothpaste for sensitive teeth. other than that, it actually works!</li>
    <li> First whitening kit that I have tried and I didn&#x27;t have any irritation.  Also had a few people notice after finishing the treatment.</li>
    <li> I saw a slight difference.  Bottom stripes don&#x27;t hold on well.</li>
    <li> When I bought the 3D White Crest White Strips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects, I did it because my dentist recommended I try them before paying for an expensive teeth whitening treatment (yes, I too thought it was strange for him to recommend a cheaper solution when the expensive one benefited him). I did a lot of research to be clear on what the pros and the cons were before buying the product. After using the product I am happy to say I am completely satisfied. It did not leave me with a &#x27;Lauren Conrad&#x27; smile but for being a &#x27;do-it-yourself&#x27; product it is VERY good and the results were great. My smile is noticeably whiter and I love it even more than I did before! Thank you, Crest!</li>
    <li> My teeth are pretty sensitive, so if you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth this may not even be an issue. Right in the middle of my first application, I got a really, really painful jolt. I&#x27;m glad it only lasted a second. Just a few hours later, and my teeth are already bothering me. I&#x27;m not going to make it to day 2, let alone 20.</li>
    <li> I have had not extemly yellow teeth but deff. yellowish my whole life ever since i was little. For my sixteenth birthday I went to a denistry to get my teeth professionaly whitened and they said the nerves in my teeth werent mature enough to get them whitened within one hour and they said to use crest white professional strip&#x27;s WHICH I WAS COMPLETELY AGAINST but i decided to try them within one box my teeth were so much whiter and i got so many compliments within 2 weeks they are amazing i would never use anything else also they have a different type of seal its tight and they wont come off when i take them off after the 30 min there on i have to like rip them off but they really do work! DEFF TRY IT ATLEAST! (they dont make your teeth senstive at all btw!)</li>
    <li> excellent seller, very good product, all according to the description recommend</li>
    <li> I tried the crest strips. I got some whitening effect over my teeth, but it was not worth it. Additionally, these strips make your tooth very sensitive, so I couldn&#x27;t use them everyday. I used them every alternate day. Overall, a disappointment considering the amount to discomfort you had to go through for that little whitening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving the CREST 3D WHITESTRIPS a solid four-stars. My teeth were not brown or really yellow, but they weren&#x27;t as white/bright as I would like them to be, since I smoked for nearly 20 years, so that&#x27;s what I was working with. I&#x27;d say that my teeth were kind of yellow and off-white, and other than that, I have no teeth or gum problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after using the CREST WHITE STRIPS, I have really noticed that my teeth are about a shade whiter. Not glowing white, but I can definitely tell a difference. They appear to be lighter, brighter and cleaner looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me longer than the 20 day supply because I had to stop after every 3-4 days because I would get sensitivity issues in my upper and lower canine teeth (I think that&#x27;s what they call them), so I would have to stop for a few days and then continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About day 13 or 14, actually the 13th or 14th strip used, I could really tell that my teeth were much brighter but they never got any whiter/brighter than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really bad discoloration from antibiotics or some other cause these strips may not be enough, so this is just a heads up. Even though I&#x27;m a former smoker, I was very lucky that the smoke didn&#x27;t really discolor my teeth too much. Even my dentist commented about that when I was still smoking, so the strips worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some points of interest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Tricky to put on. Make sure you lips aren&#x27;t dry because it will stick to your lips and it hurts to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Stays put. Once it&#x27;s on it stays put so if you have excessively loose teeth, the strip will pull them out. It&#x27;s like taking a band-aid off of your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** You can only drink water while the strips are on for the 30-minute duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the whitening will last a while because I can&#x27;t imagine having to do this every night!</li>
    <li> After over 5 years of no dental cleanings due to lack of insurance (and no indigent dental programs in my area), my teeth were noticeably stained.  I had been a Coke drinker for several years, as well, and the stains were so compounded that my teeth were a nasty yellow.  They never looked clean, even after brushing my teeth.  I recently went back to the dentist and got a professional cleaning and the dentist recommended the take-home whitening trays for $200.  Although I wanted whiter teeth, I wasn&#x27;t willing to shell out $200 for results.  I did my research on the best at-home whitening treatments that can be bought over-the-counter and this one came out on top nearly every time.  I saw pictures from before and after and was impressed so I decided to give it a try.  I noticed results after the first or second day and it&#x27;s only gotten better from there.  I like that there is no disgusting taste - the taste isn&#x27;t minty but it&#x27;s not horrible, either.  The one thing I was worried about was sensitivity because I had a problem with that already and I was worried that this would worsen the problem.  The increased sensitivity has been relatively minor and has been mitigated by my use of a sensitive toothpaste with potassium nitrate (Tom&#x27;s of Maine Maximum Strength Sensitive Toothpaste).  All in all, I love how convenient these strips are.  I use them for 30 minutes at night before I brush my teeth and go to bed.  Of course, I know they don&#x27;t replace the dentist, but I would rather pay this amount than the high amount for the same effects from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I have tried too many whitening products including previous versions of Crest White Strips.  The 3d Advanced Seal is by far the best adhesive out of strips I have tried.  These actually stayed put and stayed on my teeth, not moving all over and having me in fear of opening my mouth to even speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only needed to use these for a week to see great results but my teeth aren&#x27;t overly discolored to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All whitening products hurt my sensitive teeth and sadly these were no exception.  Perhaps the issue is with my teeth not the products.</li>
    <li> To start, I&#x27;ve used whitening strips before.  And they&#x27;ve always worked very well on me.  I never had any sensitivity to any sort of strip, so, I was confident that Crest&#x27;s newest 3D whitening strips would be fine for me.  And they were!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just 3 days of using the strips, I noticed a dramatic difference in the color of my coffee-stained teeth!  I noticed the change in color both in person, as well as in photographs of myself.  After 10 days, my teeth were glowing white - not so white that you&#x27;d think they were fake, just a nice, healthy white smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but great things to say about Crest&#x27;s 3D Whitestrips!  The \\&quot;advanced seal\\&quot; is amazing - no more goopy strips that feel like they are slipping everywhere in your mouth!  These strips are going to be my go-to strips every six months now!  These are fantastic!</li>
    <li> This product works great and has never disappointed me, but to be honest anything with dental peroxide should make your teeth white. Crest fabricated a great mount to sink onto the teeth and the strip is pretty comfortable. I would recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Although I did begin to see a small change after only a few uses I began to get to a point where I didn&#x27;t see anymore improvement in the whiteness of my teeth and after so many uses my teeth began to become sensitive to them and would hurt for up to an hour or two.</li>
    <li> I used the strips faithfully for the 20 days suggested. My teeth were at least7 shades whiter as a result.  The strips are easy to use.  I definitely intend to use Crest 3D White Strips again.</li>
    <li> After using this product, I did not notice any obvious change in my teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> I drink a couple of cups of black coffee every morning plus smoke a cigar on occasions. These strips remove the discoloration w/o having to pay $$$ to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: B4 applying strips use a dry cloth towel to dab away saliva on gums and teeth, or strips will not adhere properly. Excess moisture causes them to slip &amp; slide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good job at whitening...visual difference in 3 days&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;After applying strips, I must bite down for 15-20 seconds so they stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;Do not leave on more than 30 minutes; whitening solution becomes \\&quot;gummy and sticky\\&quot;, almost glue like, making removal somewhat awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - Brushing  w/baking powder gives the same results</li>
    <li> I used these strips for a week and was finished after that. Then again I always got compliments on how white my teeth were before using the product. As for the product itself I noticed a difference in only a few days and the strips were very easy to use in my opinion, just don&#x27;t lick them while they are in your mouth if you don&#x27;t like the taste of hydrogen peroxide. I did notice some sensistivity a few days into using the product though it wasn&#x27;t painful. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to take a layer or two off their teeth to reveal your natural pearly whites. It may seem as if they are not working at first but give it time and try to use whitening toothpaste to brush your teeth at morning and night to really help it along. Follow the directions and do not brush before using the strips and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> If you want white teeth, this is most definitely the product to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, made my teeth white instantly. Only one issue, and this could be only with me but after I take it off, my teeth get sensitive for about a day. Where to I can&#x27;t drink cold water, eat certain things etc...</li>
    <li> Love it been a faithful customer. Did another box</li>
    <li> CREST WHITE STRIPS ARE THE BEST, SAFEST, ECONOMICAL WAY TO GET WHITER TEETH. IF YOU ARE NOT CONFIDENT ABOUT YOUR SMILE, USE THESE, RESULTS ARE SURELY GUARANTEED!</li>
    <li> These work great for my formerly stained teeth from coffee &amp; red wine :)</li>
    <li> I could never afford the whitening process at the dentist and have been using Crest Whitestrips since the original came out years ago.  Wow, how they have improved over the years!  First of all, if you have really stained teeth the directions in the package says that you may have to do two back to back programs to get your teeth white the first time around, which makes sense.  I use these twice a year to stay on top of it and they work great.  People are always asking if I get my teeth professionally whitened.  Teeth sensitivity is a given for most people with all whitening products.  If you think the whitestrips are bad, get them professionally done and see how bad it is!  I have friends that get their teeth professionally whitened and can&#x27;t eat anything cold for a couple weeks and some of them are in a lot of pain.  I have really sensitive teeth and they do get significantly more sensitive with whitening, but it always goes away within a couple days of stopping and using the strips every other day may work for you if it is too bothersome.  Don&#x27;t bother getting the cheapest strips out there.  I have always bought the most expensive, newest version of the strips and they get better and better with every new version!  The new Advanced Seal technology is great!  They actually stick to your teeth now and don&#x27;t slide off.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different types of white strips and this is one of the best bangs for your buck you are going to find.  The cheaper brands slide off your teeth which restricts the effectiveness of the product. With this product you have to peel on and off the strips from your teeth which secures quite nicely.  if you are serious about your teeth, and hopefully you are :-), then this is worth the money.  I think it&#x27;s also cheaper here on Amazon than in stores like CVS.</li>
    <li> I used them for 4 days and my teeth are noticeably whiter!</li>
    <li> These are longer strips, better adhesive qualities, definitely can see the whitening effects. Not having grown up in an orthodonture country,my teeth have slight misalignments that I can tuck the strips into.  It&#x27;s worked for ten years of coffee build up on my lower teeth with no sensitivity to teeth or gums.</li>
    <li> These strips really work!  They don&#x27;t taste bad either, and they are very easy to use.  My dentist charges $400, but he told me to try these if I have a little longer to wait for results.  His works faster, but I chose to have my results in two weeks and save $360!!!</li>
    <li> This package comes with 20 packets, each of which contains a strip for the top teeth and one for the bottom. You&#x27;re supposed to use them once a day. They were quick and easy to put on and take off. There was a slight taste to them, but it wasn&#x27;t too obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The annoying thing with the strips is that you have to keep them on for 30 minutes, during which you can&#x27;t eat or drink, and I tended to lisp when I talked. And the manufacturer recommends not using them right after brusing your teeth. So you have to schedule a suitable time in the day to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 20 days, my teeth were definitely whiter. Not toothpaste-ad sparkling, but white enought to be worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used regular Crest Whitestrips in the past, these strips are made diffrently, they also have more adhesive stuff on it so they sit better on your teeth.  My teeth were not discolored and were pretty white to begin with. The strips did brighten them up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying and trying to use crest white strips for over 10yrs, I say trying to use because up until now I was never able to finish a box. The earliest forms were the worst, they were difficult to apply and never stayed put, tasted disgusting, foamed in your mouth, and after a day or two left my teeth so sensitive that breathing through my mouth hurt. I&#x27;d suffer through a few days since the results were always good but eventually pain and frustration would win out and I&#x27;d leave a partially used box under my sink until I realized months later it was expired and I&#x27;d toss it. Then a new formula would come out, I&#x27;d have some sort of event coming up and I&#x27;d try again... yes they improved over the years but never was I able to use a whole box until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THESE! They stay on my teeth, I can talk and go about my normal activities without looking like a rabid dog. There is no disgusting taste, heck I can even drink some water if I want. They don&#x27;t slide around so I can apply my makeup, do an exercise video, etc... you get the idea. I do use sensitive toothpaste when I use white strips but that is more for peace of mind (I remember the pain) then because I have to... they seem more effective then ever but cause far less sensitivity then I remember in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great experience and I look forward to keeping up with them this time!</li>
    <li> It was ship on the date you said . It was 3 weeks after I order it .</li>
    <li> I am so happy I tried Crest Whitestrips Professional Effects! It worked as advertised and I now have a white smile! I have so much confidence smiling. I had many complements from friends about my white smile. I did have some sensitivity on the bottom teeth that was pretty bad for one day. But it went away. Thank you Crest! You rock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update** It has been almost 3 months since I used Crest Whitestrips Professional Effects and my smile is still quite white! Not as gleaming white as right after I finished using the product, but much whiter than before I used it. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Noticeably Whittier teeth. However significant increase in sensitivity. Discontinued use and and teeth returned to normal</li>
    <li> After using [[ASIN:B00336EUSG Crest 3D White Vivid Toothpaste Radiant Mint]] for 30 days with barely noticeable results I was not expecting to have any better luck with this product.  Thankfully I was wrong and the [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips ]] did exactly what they claim to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the strips in the evening, because I found that it was easy enough to place them on about 30 minutes before bed. I liked that there wasn&#x27;t any mess putting them on and that the aftertaste was minimal and not bad as some other brands I&#x27;ve tried. One thing I did notice, which was listed as a side effect was \\&quot;sensitivity\\&quot;. I have never had this problem, but after 2 days of use my teeth were very sensitive to cold, although after 4 days of use this side effect went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual whitening, I thought I noticed results after about 8 days and then on day 17 I had a scheduled dentist appointment and I was surprised that even he noticed that they looked whiter. For me it was more proof that these work and it wasn&#x27;t just my wishful thinking! I finished up my carton and I&#x27;ll say that I achieved about 2 shades lighter than when I started.  For me that&#x27;s great and it will be worth the cost to continue using these in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel as if I can rate this effectively as far as whitening goes.  I received a sample in the mail, of one lower and one upper strip.  I applied as directed, but I couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than about 15 minutes. Something about it made me gag constantly.  After taking them off, I rinsed my mouth, brushed my teeth, used mouthwash, and the inside of my lips still kept sticking to my teeth, which was very unpleasant. I am glad I didn&#x27;t purchase these at the store.</li>
    <li> My teeth are admittedly sensitive, but I have been able to \\&quot;power through\\&quot; whitening strips before. My teeth hurt SO badly with these, though. I don&#x27;t know if I will be able to finish the box. If I do finish it, it might take me two months since I can&#x27;t use these on consecutive days. I was woken up last night with sharp tooth pain. Somehow these strips are affecting the nerves in my teeth. I have to take 5 ibuprofin pills just to numb the pain. I am praying that I build up a tolerance to these, but I am not counting on it.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth sensitive after 8 days so I had to discontinue. Can definitely tell the difference in just those 8 days though!</li>
    <li> These took some serious coffee stains off of my teeth.  I have used about half the package.  I am saving the rest for when the coffee stains return, as they will.  Good product.</li>
    <li> While not as effective as the whitening you&#x27;ll get at the dentist, it&#x27;s still a great way to tune-up your smile.  You&#x27;ll definitely notice a difference after one box.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Does a bang-up job of whitening with the very first use.  I had mild tooth discomfort after a few days.  Took a couple of days off till it resolved.  Works much better than the expensive gel and trays I got from my dentist!</li>
    <li> was scared to waste money on a product that i though wouldnt work but by the 4th day seen results time to order more!!!!!! amazing product forget wasting 600 bucks at the dentist</li>
    <li> Honestly you cant go wrong with this product.. You will get results and they are so easy to use you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues at all.. Catch them when they are on sale and you can get an amazing deal on this wonderful product..</li>
    <li> I have used several \\&quot;white strip\\&quot; type products over the years, and have  found these the easiest to use....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And,&lt;br /&gt;they do work.....&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking between MY teeth, there is a definite creamy-yellow there, as though I need to have a bunch of plaque removed, which is NOT the case, as I brush &amp; floss faithfully and have my teeth cleaned at my dentist on a regular basis etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot scrape this discoloration off, and it is VERY noticeable as I stand there and look into the mirror....and my 15 year old son noticed it as well....&lt;br /&gt;The front surface of the teeth are considerably whiter and more polished looking,&lt;br /&gt;but&lt;br /&gt;not what I wanted for in-between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;gel\\&quot; from the strips just does not seem to get between the teeth....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANY SUGGESTIONS?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use whitening rinse as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips before, but I&#x27;d never used the Professional Effects strips.  The Crest strips are always particularly effective for me, and it&#x27;s actually been a couple of years since I&#x27;ve needed to use them, thanks to the 3D White toothpaste. However, after a recent trip to Turkey, where I was drinking very concentrated tea and coffee many times a day for almost a month, I realized that my teeth had become discolored, and I looked for the most intense strips. Sure enough, these are strong and very effective. I did experience a little sensitivity from these strips, which was new for me, but it wasn&#x27;t serious -- I just alternated days for a while, and it was fine. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on the color of my teeth lately; the difference is very obvious, and it looks GREAT. The regular whitestrips are super, but the \\&quot;advanced seal\\&quot; strips are much better to use, and they are much more powerful, as the white result is even whiter. These are my go-to strips for next time!</li>
    <li> THE CREST PRO WHITENER IS GREAT. I&#x27;VE SMOKED FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS MY TEETH WAS COVED WITH NICATIN, TAN COLOR. AFTER 20 TREATMENTS THEY ARE BRIGHT WHITE. THAT&#x27;S JUST ONE BOX. MY ORDER AT AMAZON WAS QUICKLY TAKEN CARE OF,THEY WERE GREAT ALSO. THE CREST 3D WHITE TOOTHPASTE IS FABULOUS USED WHITE THE POR WHITENER.</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of coffee and over the years I realize now why vehicles slow down when I smile, they think the light is turning yellow!  These strips do work, somewhat.  It takes time and patience, and once you get them on you have to be careful removing them, because if you have a loose tooth these will remove it, they really stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to dry you teeth before applying them otherwise they slip around and get wet, fold over and stick to themselves and instead of white teeth you&#x27;ll have a red face, as it&#x27;s frustrating to waste these.  The can get expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also get uneven results, with white spots on some teeth where the strip worked better on a high spot.  The 3D?  Not sure, unless it has something to do with the way you have to use a mirror and both hands to peel and apply them and avoid the roof of your mouth, which I doubt you&#x27;ll want to whiten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall?  If it&#x27;s that important to you, don&#x27;t expect to be blinding people with your renewed glimmer.  Oh, and yes you do have to keep buying them as the change in shade is tempoary.</li>
    <li> Are my teeth whiter? Yes. Was it comparable to the results I get with an in office visit when everything is said and done? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, but the professional effects claim was a tall order. I drink a lot of coffee and wanted to use a product that could counteract the staining effect coffee drinking had. It did just that. Perhaps reframing from coffee would have produced more dramatic results, but the product information doesn&#x27;t suggest this is required.  I found this strips to perform up to my intentions, but didn&#x27;t live up to my hopes. I would use again to maintain a health tooth color, but I would not expect professional results from this product. My in office whitening  results where clearly more dramatic and longer lasting when compared to this product. (even after resuming coffee drinking after the required 3 day waiting period in office treatments require) If your looking for general maintenance, I would go with this product, and reserve in office appointments as a treat for when you have disposable income.</li>
    <li> They shipped quick, great priced, advanced seal truly DOES work, only had to use 7 treatments and my teeth were sparkling white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I suggest with these are if you already have somewhat sensitive teeth to cold things like me; I would use them in the evening time. The first time I used these I tried it in the morning and my teeth were aching by the evening time. So I use it before bed and the aching comes in the night when I&#x27;m asleep I suppose. Nothing some Tylenol didn&#x27;t fix but still, it was uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Product definitely worth buying!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, but did not whiten as expected. My teeth are slightly noticeably whiter. Did not cause sensitivity like other whitestrips have done.</li>
    <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t buy something like this, I would just go to my dentist and have my teeth whittened.  A friend a mine was using crest whitestrips and I noticed a huge difference on her teeth so I decided to try it.  I bought it when it had the $10 off coupon so I paid about $30 for the pack, ended up buying 2 packs one for the hubby and 1 for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the whitestrips work it totally does, but it seems to make a more dramatic difference on me then my hubby.  Not sure the reason why but for $30 it did more than what it had to do. It&#x27;s totally worth the $ and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> These definitely whitened my teeth a few shades, so I can appreciate the end result. They went on easily, and weren&#x27;t too uncomfortable while wearing. I&#x27;ve tried other strips that had a weird taste, before, but these were very mild. My only complaints were that they did cause a good deal of sensitivity on my teeth, especially to cold. They were also hard to get off because they stick REALLY well to your teeth. Overall, though, I am happy with the end whitening result.</li>
    <li> These really do work! I have seen great result but they do cause my teeth to hurt afterwards for a while. I just make sure that I only leave them on for the amount of time on the box and it helps with the sensitivity. I guess I will see how long the whiteness lasts. Its worth it to buy the better kind because they stick better to my teeth and there is less oozing of the gel into my mouth.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the \\&quot;weakest\\&quot; verision of the Crest Whitestrips line to see if they were going to match up to the hype I had been hearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using them for 10 days, I had modest, but noticeable, results. My biggest complaint was they did not hold onto my teeth very well at all and were incredibly messy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after some research I bit the bullet and bought the \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; ones (reviewed here). I must say I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; grips like concrete to my teeth, though I still don&#x27;t recommend you go out in public with them on (haha). Removal of them, for me, still seems to be quite messy, but for the same reason that makes them great. They grip so well to my teeth I sometimes have issues removing them, but that is an observation. I would rather have them stay on then fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to my results? I really did notice a difference after day 3. I am currently about to finish my pack off and I am very happy with my results. I would like my teeth to be a little whiter, but the difference is still night and day. I will be buying more of these every time I need a touchup on my whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but when used consistently and as directed they will actually lighten your teeth. I did not ever achieve that &amp;#34;movie star&amp;#34; white you see in the commercials, but it definitely made a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> These strips not only whitens your teeth but also cleans them. Every time I use my strips, my teeth feel extra shiny and clean. I&#x27;m going out of the country in a couple months and totally planning on buying 2-3 more boxes to bring with me!</li>
    <li> These are the best strips around; however, you&#x27;ll undoubtedly (as I have now twice) find at least one dried-up and unusable strip set in the box. Wish it wasn&#x27;t too much trouble to get a replacement.</li>
    <li> Does whiten your teeth. Not sure if I like these or the ones that you have on for a shorter time. Both work well</li>
    <li> 40 years of coffee drinking , snuff chewing ,stained ,yellow and gray teeth, came white!!!! YA HU!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The Crest 3D I think are the strongest of the Crest strips. They whiten my teeth with one application, so I use them occasionally when I want the dazzle. They stick on well and as another reviewer has said sometimes to the point that I have to grab on hard using a fingernail to get an edge and using tissue, because my fingers get too slippery, and really pull to remove them. I haven&#x27;t noticed any harm to my gums. One thing I do is to cut one strip in half lengthwise and use only half on my upper teeth instead of folding the extra width over the edges of my top teeth. I don&#x27;t seem to need the edges or back whitened and I feel like this helps with my upper teeth sensitivity, plus I can use the other half another time on my upper teeth. I do fold the lower strip over my bottom teeth. Another thing I do is to use the longer strip on my bottom teeth and the shorter strip on my upper teeth (I think they&#x27;re designed the opposite at least in some of the Crest strips I&#x27;ve used.) I use these strips for maintenance along with my Sonicare with the new sensitive softer brushes. (Thank you Sonicare.) For those with sensitive teeth you might want to try the Sheer White strips. They seem to be as effective, they go on the same way except they are made from more of a beeswax type material that&#x27;s thicker and sort of stretches and molds, but they are slightly less sensitizing. I cut one in half lengthwise also and get two applications from the one strip for my upper teeth. (If you peel back the packaging on the Sheer Whites to reveal only one strip you can keep the other one viable. I also sometimes use just strip off of the backing of the Crest strips.) I just noticed today, though, that the Sheer White strips are made in China. The Crest strips are made in the USA. Also, the Crest strips don&#x27;t taste good as another reviewer noted, whereas the Sheer White strips have a sweetish minty flavor.</li>
    <li> To begin with I have never used whitening strips before in my life, but have always wanted to try. I ordered these as they were not overly expensive and the majority of the reviews seemed quite positive. The shipping was prompt, the package was in good shape and everything was in order. Now for those of you who were in the same boat as me, wondering if you should take a chance on these, I would say the results are modest. After using them for a solid 20 days straight, my teeth are definitely a shade or two whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will not, however, blow you away with a bright new pearly smile, and some of the images they have on the crest website seem like a bit of an exaggeration. Do they work though? Again, yes, just don&#x27;t go in expecting too much. Sensitivity can also become an issue, and I did feel some slight pain in my two upper-front teeth, and I had to avoid biting down on apples, drinking beverages that had ice or were just too acidic. It was a minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nevertheless, and it will take around 1-2 applications before you can feel comfortable wearing the strips on your teeth for 30 minutes. Overall a decent purchase, and probably a step in the right direction if you&#x27;re looking for a whiter smile, but just keep in mind it will likely take more time and money than what you get through this box alone.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I am not finished with my pack and my teeth are already quite white.  My teeth were discolored form minerals, tea, and food stains and this product whitened them right up. I am very happy with the result. Nothing bad to say.</li>
    <li> These are worth every penny spent.</li>
    <li> The results are as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;You WILL see a difference after the second application!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it at walgreens or other retailers.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it on Amazon;best price around!</li>
    <li> This product definitely does the job.  However, be prepared for a bit of pain at times if your teeth are like mine.</li>
    <li> Mixed feelings:  I&#x27;m almost done with my first box and the whitening was dramatic over the first two or three days, but the improvements petered out after that.  I do drink coffee (and have continued to drink coffee) so that might be the problem.  My biggest peeve about these is that I do have some sensitivity after using the strips, particularly in areas where I have had dental work (e.g., most of my mouth).  I don&#x27;t like the gumminess of the residue, but at least the strip doesn&#x27;t leak all over your mouth (it does leak a little, you can taste it, but it&#x27;s not a giant leak).</li>
    <li> This product actually works!  I have tried countless other whitening strips before and this one is most definately the easiest to use.  I saw noticible results in 3 days as promised and it seems to have gotten lighter as time went on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d always used the medium grade of Crest Whitestrips in the past and, for the most part, been pleased with the results.  Sure, it was a pain when you&#x27;d apply them and have to worry about the strips sliding around on your teeth.  But they always did what they promised on the box -- made my teeth whiter than they had been before, although never the parts that had been discolored by taking an antibiotic commonly prescribed in the 1970s which, although no one knew it at the time, would turn teeth yellow if a person was exposed to too much sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that Crest 3D White Whitestrips Professional Effects are a major improvement to their predecessors.  Not only is the adhesive SO much better than the earlier product -- these babies aren&#x27;t going anywhere until you peel them off like little toothy BandAids -- but the whitening is amazing.  Even the yellow stains from those long ago prescribed antibiotics have -- after more than 30 years -- disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a believer -- these whitestrips are the best!</li>
    <li> This product really works. I love the new and improved \\&quot;grip\\&quot; that the strips have - much less slipping and sliding. My only complaint is that the lower strip is not long enough to cover all of my visible teeth. Other than that, the strips are totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Purchased on the advice of a friend.  Easy to use and effective.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> i have used a number of different whitening strip products including these. they all worked very well in whitening. haven&#x27;t had much success with non-strip whitening products, but maybe i should give the concentrated pastes an extended run sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but what i wonder about is how often you can use these products. most i&#x27;ve used haven&#x27;t seemed to have had warnings but i think they may exist (and maybe i missed them in some fine print)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have bought one product that came with mineralizing mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i know behind counter at pharmacy they have super high fluoride toothpaste, but apparently it shrinks the front lobes as does lithium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, these are cost effective and work really really well at whitening. i have had effectively no meaningful sensitivity issues with any whitening products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i wonder about proper use of the product.</li>
    <li> First off, I have been using these ever since I purchased them back in early 2010!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all you can try in \\&quot;Teeth Whitening\\&quot; on a non \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; level, and this is BY FAR the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great, I literally started seeing results after the first couple of days! it was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone looking for teeth whitening, that has tried some others but has never been 100% satisfied...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great! A+ all around!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase b/c 1-they offered a rebate of $10 which they will not issue me b/c I used my $5 off CVS rewards at time of transaction. READ the fine print. I went thru completing the paper work, providing original receipt, cutting box for UPC. I called company and rep didn&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;2-I think the generics would just as well as these overpriced strips.3- I prefer the CVS paint on whitening that comes in a bottle with brush. I thought I would try these. They are messy and don&#x27;t whiten as well. WASTE of money!!</li>
    <li> I liked that this product did whiten my teeth noticeably but was not impressed how it doesn&#x27;t mold down to the edges of your teeth(or in between teeth) I am left with whiter teeth but still yellowish looking areas in between. No one will probably ever notice unless get up close but I notice. My teeth grew extremely sensitive right after use and for the day following so for this reason I have to only do it a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I saw a huge difference after using one kit. I don&#x27;t smoke nor do I drink soda or red wine, so my teeth were just naturally a yellower tint. I was very pleased with the results, and I feel so much better about my smile now!</li>
    <li> I just finished my first set of using Crest 3D Whitestrips \\&quot;Professional Effects.\\&quot; It worked out really well. It did say that you can notice a whitening in the first 3 days but I didn&#x27;t notice it on mine until the 4th or 5th day. I did happen to leave mine on for 45 minutes one day and the next day I had a canker sore above my gums. Moral of the story &#x3D; Follow the directions. I&#x27;ve been making sure to take it off around the 30 minute mark every time now and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. It&#x27;s awesome to use it quick before going to work and then leaving it on throughout the entire car ride back! I have physically noticed that my smile is more white and even the person cutting my hair said that something was different about my smile. I guess overall it just made me brighter looking! Hooray!</li>
    <li> If you have used Listerene whitestrips &amp; think these are the same idea, forget it. These are just bleach-goo on a strip of slimy plastic, and tough to get on your teeth. You have to keep still if you do get them on, because they slide around at the slightest movement. The idea that the \\&quot;seal\\&quot; is hilarious. They don&#x27;t stay on your teeth for the time needed to have the bleach work. Plus, to get them off the sheet of plastic, you&#x27;ll waste quite a few, because they wrinkle, fold up &amp; go \\&quot;flop\\&quot;- no shape to them at all. They don&#x27;t dissolve away like the Listerene product. When you&#x27;re sick of the whole thing, you have to pull the gross strip of plastic out of your mouth &amp; toss them. Between getting them on, and taking them off, your fingers get slimed and if you&#x27;re not lucky, your clothes will get dripped with the bleach. Came here to order the Listerene again- Prime Eligible or not. I&#x27;ll be tossing 108 of a box of 112 of these out.</li>
    <li> I have two crowns in the front that are over 30 years old.  The surrounding natural teeth have become darker than the crowns so I thought this would lighten them up to match or come close.  Although it did lighten them somewhat, not enough to match.  I&#x27;d say these lighten maybe two shades.  That isn&#x27;t substantial for the cost of these.  It says you get the same results as a dentist&#x27;s whitening?  Not a chance.</li>
    <li> not tall enough to wrap over the top of teeth and get good coverage on back side, also leaves teeth sensitive</li>
    <li> For whitening power alone, these are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people have not had bad experience with teeth sensitivity with these, but unfortunately, my story is different. I do not generally have sensitive teeth, but everytime I use these, although I don&#x27;t go over the recommended time limit, my teeth are generally very sore the following day and very temperature-sensitive. I end up using them about once/week as it is all I can bear. I still have to give them 3 stars for whitening power. I started out with pretty white teeth, but these have brightened my smile considerably. I wouldn&#x27;t look for drastic results, but defintely some improvement, even if you wear them as infrequently as I do.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using them, as I do think the whitening effect is worth it, but just beware that the possibility for sensitivity is there. Everyone is different.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure these strips would work, but after only 5 days I was able to stop applying and start using the new Crest Whitening Toothpaste. Everyone comments how great my teeth look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to apply and by the time I finish showering and getting dressed it&#x27;s time to remove them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am a red wine and coffee drinker and 61 years old I never thought it would work. I look and feel 10 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count box]]</li>
    <li> my son must love them, took mine</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the Crest Whitestrips.  They really did whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> Return customer always the best!</li>
    <li> Do I need to buy Gel for this product?? If so, where can I buy?  Because when I bought other Crest products I needed the gel.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. No problem with the package.&lt;br /&gt;Only two of the 20 strips worked and stuck fine. The others were falling off my teeth and causing too much trouble staying in place. After 20 days of struggle, I didn&#x27;t really see much difference.Needless to say, the great pain and sensitivity I had . Sorry to say, I am extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Significantly whitened my teeth, however, the whitening seems to only last for about 2 months instead of the advertised 6+ months.</li>
    <li> I got a good deal for this product on Ebay.  Unfortunately, it did not live to my hopes &amp; expectations.  It did not whiten the yellowish-light brownish color on my teeth.  Also my teeth became more and more sensitive after using it.  I decided to stop using the product after weeks of noticing  barely no change or no change at all.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  If I&#x27;d known this wouldn&#x27;t work,I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  I prefer to spend a few hundred bucks at the dentist(for real results!).</li>
    <li> I bought this because I received a free sample in the mail, and liked how well the strips stuck to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I ordered this product, the strips didn&#x27;t stick as well and the whitening was far from noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the entire box, and was disappointed. I decided to write this review after I decided to try swishing hydrogen peroxide in my mouth and using it along with my electric toothbrush, and my teeth are sparkling white now -- $2.00 for a giant bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if this box of crest whitestrips was only $1.00, it still wouldn&#x27;t be worth at much, noting the poor results.</li>
    <li> This product did exactly as advertised and after three days i saw results and by the end of all of the strips my teeth are definitely shades whiter than before.</li>
    <li> Ive been playing around the idea of using white strips for awhile but I always thought that my sensitive teeth couldnt handle it, but I was so wrong. I knew someone who uses the once every 3 months strips and the outcome were impressive, but I couldnt dream of having them on my teeth for 2 hours so I went with these. 30 mins for 3 days and you&#x27;ll see results and they werent kidding. I got noticeable results after 2 days. I like that the whitening isnt super dramatic. My teeth just look healthier. I plan on only using for them 3 days in a row per month. The best past was that my teeth havent bothered me at all. They feel a little weird once you take the strips off. The instructions say that you should not brush your teeth before applying and I think that makes a big difference for the sensitivity.  I dont know why people expect HUGE results with these cause youre not going to get it. Its a very subtle change but its more than you can get from just whitening tooth paste. I highly recommend people to at least try them and if you dont like them Amazon is usually really good about return items you are not pleased with.</li>
    <li> I use the strips about twice a month and every time I do I get great results, but I also have a lot of pain on the surfaces of my teeth lasting for about 24 hours, becoming noticeable about 5 hours after I remove the strips.</li>
    <li> I bought the 3D white strips because I received a sample in the 3D toothpaste.  The stick to your teeth much better than the regular white strips.  I have used 10 since I purchased them and there is a noticeable difference in my teeth.  I am using the rest as &#x27;touch up&#x27;.  I did expereience a bit of sesitivty, but I used them everyday.  I would recommend these to my family and friends.  Hope this helps.  Enjoy your whitest teeth if you purchase these~!</li>
    <li> didnt see effect in three days, but thats ok, I saw it evetually. it tastes nasty, and my teeth were very sensitive for a whole day after i used them. I recommend not eating anything sweet when you use these. they stayed put, and wasn&#x27;t much of a bother for the thirty minutes a day. I would recommend these to anyone willing to go through the pain for whiter teeth. no pain no gain :) but i would not buy these again, they taste so gross.</li>
    <li> These really stick to the teeth as opposed to the other types of whitestrips, but you still get that whitening cream taste. Heads up: you&#x27;re not supposed to brush your teeth before or after application.  It did its job after only half the box, so I&#x27;m planning to go through the other half in a year. It does make my teeth sensitive, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d get with any whitening strip and the sensitivity goes away in a day after not using the strips. Overall, when this product is on sale on Amazon, it&#x27;s a good deal (unbeatable even by Costco sales).</li>
    <li> I was really hoping these things would work. To be fair, I only used half of the strips before I gave the rest to my friend to try. So, it&#x27;s possible that if I used all of them I might have seen my teeth get whiter. But it seems after using half, I would have noticed something. But nope. My teeth are not exactly yellow so maybe it really only helps people with really stained teeth. I have seen people walking around with incredibly white teeth and there is no way crest strips were the reason. They must have gotten professional treatment somewhere. So in my opinion that is the only way to go if you want truly white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the fact they did nothing for me, using them was no fun. The first time I put them on, I wrapped the strips over the bottom edge of my teeth, causing minor pain and losing some sleep in the process. I did not do that again. It&#x27;s not entirely obvious which strip is for the top and which is for the bottom teeth. I have a pretty wide smile and applying the strips as they came did not cover all my teeth that show when smiling. Cutting the strips solved this, so not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to apply the strips to your gums. I did this and the next day my gums were white in those two spots. Then they turned raw and brushing my teeth was painful. That led me research sonicare toothbrushes and buy one but I guess that is another story/review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is: they did not work for me and if you think they will get your teeth movie-star white, think again. You need to get that done at the dentist. 99% sure about that.</li>
    <li> Used only half the cycle a few weeks before my wedding, and my teeth were noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> Love the fast-whitening action of these, do not love how sensitive they make my teeth afterwards.  I would recommend using them 2 times a week maximum to allow your teeth to recover.  I usually use one on Sunday and one on Wednesday and they still work great!</li>
    <li> Whitened pretty good, I think my expectations were a little high.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband after getting his teeth cleaned and they work really easily.  The promotional $10.00 off - on the product was also pretty nice!</li>
    <li> To start - I have worked in dentist offices for a few years, and a couple of my closest friends are top notch dentists. My teeth have always been white, just not white enough for my taste. I like to have a smile that pops. I have had professional whitening done (Britesmile), and these strips are great for maintaining my whiteness. Even if you haven&#x27;t had that, these should work well for you. Keep in mind that I don&#x27;t smoke, and I never drink coffee, tea, or colored drinks. If you&#x27;re someone who always drinks java or things like it, you might not keep your results very long - as anything that can stain a white T-shirt will stain your teeth (but if you brush your teeth a least 2x a day you should be okay;-).  The adhesive nature of the strips are great and such an improvement from the previous whitestrips. First and foremost, the most important thing is to make sure your mouth is healthy all together because one can have very white teeth but have underlying issues with gums and decay. If your teeth are particularly sensitive, you might get an occasional \\&quot;zinger\\&quot; when whitening, or your teeth might become more sensitized throughout your whitening process. If this is the case, definitely use a toothpaste like Sensodyne - that should greatly help you. I recommend to apply the strips at least twenty minutes after brushing. I know everyone has different results, but overall you should see improvement. If you&#x27;re someone with white teeth to begin with, you might get a shade or two lighter, but if your teeth are off white you could be lightened several shades. Another little piece of advice - chew gum (sugar-free of course). Funny thing - for as long as I know every time I see my friends (the dentists) they are always chewing gum in and out of the office.  I prefer Orbit or Trident. The action of chewing gum can greatly help your teeth because of the added flow of saliva, which helps inhibit tooth decay.  I wish everyone good luck and a happy mouth!</li>
    <li> Using a $10 coupon from Crest&#x27;s website, [...] , I was able to purchase this whitening strips that are regularly $55, for just $24. They were originally $34 without the coupon. Within one use of the whitestrips I saw a noticeable difference, two uses I could notice even more, and by the third use, I could definitely see a huge difference just like the box says. I will continue to buy this product to keep my teeth white. Just after 3 days of using there is no reason to stay with the product with the results I have gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all. It is a must BUY! And use the coupon on 3dwhite.com to save even more money on this already cheap product.</li>
    <li> did not work well- will not buy it again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a week and my teeth are noticeably whiter! With the first use I did notice some sensitivity but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable (and hasn&#x27;t happened since). I&#x27;m a pretty avid coffee drinker, so seeing the improvement so quickly was a shock! - Oh, and it couldn&#x27;t be easier. I put them on them before I hop in the shower and by the time I&#x27;m done drying my hair, off they go! I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> they really stay on, and they worked wonders for me. They made my teeth a little sensitive the first three days, after that, they did not bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I bought the same strips from my Target in NYC for almost $70.  They work great.  I would recommend using a Sensodyne toothpaste or something like that to help with the sensitivity.  Great option if you are looking for whiter teeth but dont want to pay $400+ at the dentist.</li>
    <li> This product REALLY hurts my teeth a lot more than I expected it to.  I am in SOOO much pain every time I use this product. I switched over to Sensodyne and there was no change in the pain.  I decreased the time I had it on from the recommended 30 mins to 20 mins and the pain is still there.  For me, this pain is not worth the item!</li>
    <li> I used crest white strips about 5 years ago and had great results but since then have tried them a few times and wasn&#x27;t really getting the effects I was hoping for. I was considering doing ZOOM teeth whitening when I came on and read reviews for this product and gave it one last shot and I am glad I did. I only used them for 8 days and decided to stop because my teeth were as white as I wanted them. I get allot of compliments and you can really see the difference. I can&#x27;t imagine how white my teeth would be had I continued to use them for the amount of time you are supposed to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other whitening products before.  Previously, my preferred product was Crest Night Effects.  It was difficult to use, but cheap and effective.  I&#x27;d tried other strips, but they unpleasant and didn&#x27;t work as well as the all-night-treatment. Until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box contains 20 flat, shiny packets which feel nearly empty.  Opening them up (angle your tear down toward the middle of the packet, or the rip-here arrow may just pull the top off and not actually open anything) reveals a sheet of thin, clear, plastic, with two strips that look like tape.  They peel off easily, apply trivially, and conform well.  At first I wondered if my package was out of date, or something was wrong, because the strips weren&#x27;t particularly gooey or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wait...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening gel is dry, and activated by moisture.  You want to use dry hands, and don&#x27;t brush your teeth first.  Once those babies get wet, they STICK.  In fact, the only challenging thing to the whole process is pulling them off afterward!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say the strips can be used 2x a day, so I did that.  As claimed, the whitening was noticeable the third day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for sensitivity, I was concerned at first.  After the second use, my teeth were feeling achey and super sensitive.  At that rate, how bad were they going to be by the end?  But fortunately, the sensitivity did not continue to get worse.  If anything, it leveled off and then improved.  This is VERY strong whitener though, and if you have sensitive teeth, be aware you are going to feel that something is going on.  It won&#x27;t do you any harm, but personally, I&#x27;d lay off the ice cream for the duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t handle the increased sensitivity, the instructions advise using the strips at a slower pace, even skipping days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> I was curious before start using crest but after 15 day usage i have whiter teeth.sometimes you feel little pain drinking hot or cold but just a while than it turns to normal.i also use other crest 3d products all of them just perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. You can see color change within a couple days of use.  I would recommend it for a temporary solution!</li>
    <li> The strips seemed to work well and fit better than the \\&quot;no name strips from Walmart\\&quot; but $35 or so dollars for 20 strips is just too expensive. I guess Crest believes they can charge this price because they may have a monopoly on the market.  Will go back to the no name strips from WalMart (if we can find them).  If I remember correctly they were less than $20 for a box of 40.</li>
    <li> I have tried other whitestrips and these are far better than the rest - in 2 days noticed a big difference, after a week was almost completely white teeth.  A bit of sensitivity for the first 2 days so I skipped a day, then no problems after that.</li>
    <li> These were just okay I&#x27;m almost through with the box but there isn&#x27;t an outstanding change.  My teeth are a little whiter but not a lot of difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Whitestrips off and on for several years, usually before an important event (ie weddings, birthdays, interviews, etc) and found that my teeth could use a little more \\&quot;sparkle.\\&quot; I am not and will never expect these results to compare to a professional whitening job done by a dentist or dental hygienist, but for cost and convenience purposes, they do a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older strips had a tendency to not adhere very well to surface of the teeth and tended to move around no matter how well I placed them. The Advanced Seal line has completely chanced that cumbersome inconvenience. I can just apply the strips, and then continue with my other activities, be it showering or even driving to work without even worrying about them. Best of all, you can drink water with them on! A definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have sensitive teeth, so even though I use the Advanced Seal Professional line due to its higher concentration of the bleaching agent, I normally do it every other day for about a week to avoid dental discomfort. And by then, are noticeably whiter, greatly improving my overall confidence.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t give a great review because I only used these for a few days. Day 2 resulted in some tooth pain that got worse on day 3 and day 4, so I quit.  Was only intermittent pain...several hours after use...and it only lasted for about an hour...but it hurt something wicked, so I quit. I have used other whitening products before without tooth pain, so this was new to me...and very unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I recommend strongly for that type,it is easy to use and the Results is fast and excellent.&lt;br /&gt; also the price for it Very reasonable.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count box]]  Great product.  I have tried two other types from Crest, these are worth the extra money.  Strips are heavy duty.  Easier to apply and stay and improve on even good whitening effect of the non-professional grade.  No problems with gum irritation.</li>
    <li> I got these crest whitestrips after I started feeling a lil self conscious of my yellow-ish tainted smile &amp; it works! To be honest with you I only used it for about 5 days in a row, then only about twice more after that but I STILL got great results. I saw results after TWO days actually. I&#x27;m sure if I would have continued using this product it would have produced an even whiter smile, but the only con to this product is it does hurt in a weird sort of way after a few usages. My teeth started to feel a bit sore and sensitive when I ate and drink, so eventually I was like ahhhh this hurts too much D: I was a lil worried about it and coincidentally I had a dentist appointment for a regular checkup &amp; I asked my dentist about the issue &amp; he said it&#x27;s completely normal &amp; that he actually recommends 3D whitestrips to his patients, &amp; that it is in FACT 100% safe. He also mentioned that any kind of professional whitening would in fact make most people&#x27;s teeth temporarily sensitive prone. He said one good way to handle this is to counter-act it by brushing your teeth with sensitive toothpaste. Since I have stopped using this product my teeth have indeed returned to normal, so I feel more confident in the fact that the sensitivity IS temporary. (P.S. it&#x27;s been about a month and a half since I partially used this product &amp; I just got told by my best friend the other day that my teeth looked alot whiter! (: &amp; that is after only 7 uses, &amp; after a long time since using it!!!:D ) I currently have about 12 or so of these left, so I&#x27;m going to start using these again regularly as instructed for the next couple of weeks! Oh but this time I&#x27;m going to try the sensitive toothpaste as well! Wooot woot, tryna get dem pearly whites :D</li>
    <li> I used the original Crest Strips before Was very satified ,tried the 3D and its absolutley AMAZING, Try it you will see the difference in 3 days It adheres (advance Seal) to your teeth much better than the original...[[ASIN:B0032EJGK6 Crest 3D White Professional Effects Whitestrips]].</li>
    <li> These stay stuck to your teeth long enough to do their job.  And they cover my teeth well.  I&#x27;m happy with results.  What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> We originally purchased this product at a local store &amp; really liked it. My teenage daughter bought them with her own money to whiten teeth yellowed by years of poor brushing habits. They really worked to whiten her teeth &amp; now they are beautiful. She had to skip a day here &amp; there because her teeth became a little sensitive. We ordered another set from Amazon because the price was so good.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips adhere very nicely to your teeth.  In fact, they need a good tugging to get off, which is great because the old ones would just slip and slide around and the paste would just be all over your mouth instead of on your teeth.  They don&#x27;t hurt my teeth like the other ones that have the \\&quot;tray\\&quot; to put over your teeth.  My teeth seemed minutely whiter after the first use, and certainly by uses three and four.  It is painless for me to use them for seven days in a row as a matter of fact.  I have purchased the 3D white toothpaste to go with it, and I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a big difference or not, but the tooth paste isn&#x27;t very expensive so why not give it a try?</li>
    <li> This is much better than previous versions of whitestrips.  I can get bleach and dental trays for next to nothing, but prefer to use these.</li>
    <li> Both my teenagers use this product and actually asked for these for Easter. So much cheaper than having done at a dentist.  This product makes you look as though you spent hundreds of dollars for teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> I live in the south and ordering anything but sweet or Coke (which means any dark cola) will get you thrown out of most establishments.  This means that prior to the product, my teeth were a lovely pale yellow, reminiscent of daffodils.  While I adore daffodils, I prefer that it not look like I&#x27;ve been eating them.  There was a sale and a coupon clip on this item, and I had a wedding to attend soon, so I bought these whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s begin with the positives.  First off, I personally love the amount of clinginess the strips have.  They are a bit hard to adjust after the first few seconds, but you can wear them out and about if necessary.  I had to go to the grocery store to pick up the !one! thing I forgot for supper.  The strips stayed on the whole time.  An additional benefit was that the \\&quot;leftover\\&quot; taste is very neutral and there&#x27;s little to no stickiness left on your teeth.  As far as actual whitening goes, I didn&#x27;t see much difference between Day 0 and Day 3.  It&#x27;s there, like the infamous difference between ecru and eggshell, but it isn&#x27;t much.  After the whole process, my teeth were significantly whitened.  I didn&#x27;t have sensitivity issues, but I have a feeling that&#x27;s going to be different for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they weren&#x27;t whitened by as much as I thought they would be.  Perhaps the stains from sweet tea and Coke are more durable than most.  The majority of my teeth were white, but the closer to the gumline I looked, the more yellow I saw.  I did my very best to adhere the strips firmly and evenly, but that gumline wouldn&#x27;t budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my teeth were whitened and whitened very well.  The gumline area of yellow is very small and probably only noticable to me.  I would order this product again, though I would be extra careful to press the strips down harder.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Got two for less than the cost of one in stores. Highly recommend, easy to use and a great result.</li>
    <li> It works but it hurts.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped, but I noticed a slight change.  I don&#x27;t have awful teeth but they are a little yellow.  Instead of getting the ivory/ white I was hoping for it&#x27;s just a slightly lighter yellow</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave them on longer than 30 minutes. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;My mother has over 50 years of build up on her teeth and I let her borrow a couple of these so she would not be afraid to smile and I am starting to notice and difference, and more importantly, she is.&lt;br /&gt;We are planning to use them for a week on our teeth and see our results. The only other thing is that I wish my teeth were just a little whiter. But I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.  After 20 days of using the strips, my teeth are white.  The whitening strips were easy to use.  They didn&#x27;t slip off nor were they uncomfortable to wear.  I have used other whitening systems without any success. The Crest 3D whitening strips has been the only product that has produce professional results for me.</li>
    <li> I just took my braces off and used these twice a day for 7 days! loved the new smile. Saving the rest for later!</li>
    <li> This product does everything it claims to do; easy to apply, stays on, whitens great.</li>
    <li> Great for whitening, but made my teeth sensitive for a few days after each application. Because of this I had to space out treatments.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than it did What it said it would. My teeth look noticeably whiter. Will do as suggested and purchase every six months. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Crest Whitestrips are great. It&#x27;s the only way I keep my teeth looking good! This set worked well and didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive - I generally use them every other day though to prevent sensitivity. Will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> These strips made my teeth so sensitive, although I was seeing results on the second day I had to quit using them because the pain was just too much. I even tried using sensodyne during the time I was whitening and I still had intense pain and sensitivity. If you are lucky enough not to get sensitive, definitely use them because they work.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results I thought I would get for such a high priced item. It work, but only as well as the cheapist product they sell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been whitening my teeth ever before. So this is my first time. The result came out perfectly. I never expected it to be this white with this so affordable product. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t attached pictures of before and after because I don&#x27;t like publicizing myself :) And you might be thinking that I&#x27;m working for Crest but no. I am totally satisfied and I will just keep going using this product afterward. Be a happy customer with Crest!</li>
    <li> Say what you want about whitening strips, these are about the easiest to use and best of the bunch. Noticeably whiter teeth in about five days and definitely whiter at the end of the course. Certainly beats the cost of having the dentist do the whitening, too.</li>
    <li> These are everything you need to getting that perfect white teeth. The most amazing product finally created.</li>
    <li> This may be different from person to person, but about 6 hours after i took the strip off, my gum became very sensitive (which was stated as possible side effect), and this last probably another 5 - 6 hours. I tried to reduce the frequency of usage to once a week, but every time I use it the same thing happens, predictably, so I eventually stopped using. I don&#x27;t think it harms my mouth in anyway, but it&#x27;s just not compatible with me. It does work though, if you can comfortably use it at the frequency required</li>
    <li> This item is as good as it says.  Worked perfect, especially the way it sticks on.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for three days so far and can already see some improvement. My teeth are naturally pretty white, but I just got my braces off and want to \\&quot;wow\\&quot; people with a bright straight smile. My only complaint is that they make my teeth extremely sensitive. I do use toothpaste for sensitivity, but it isn&#x27;t enough I need to pop some ibuprofen because the pain is so strong. Is beauty really worth the pain?? But everyone will react differently, some people wont feel any sensitivity at all. Overall I love the fast results, but I might not be able to finish the box because of the pain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used 3 top+bottom strips thus far, and I can tell a difference already.  The main reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5/5 was because I had such teeth sensitivity after just 1 use.  So I&#x27;ve been using the top+bottom strips every other day with still noticeable results.</li>
    <li> 5 stars here. Nevermind the cheap price, the product simply worked!  After about the 6th day ( si skipped a day here and there) of using these my teeth are much whiter. I wanted to buy these numersou times over the last couple years but just didn&#x27;t believe the hype but they do infact work.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> These whitestrips really do work, although they don&#x27;t give the same level of whitening as laser bleaching or other professional techniques. My teeth had some splotchy discoloration from drinking quite a bit of coffee but they weren&#x27;t all that bad to begin with. The strips definately made a big difference, I would say at least 3-4 shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some extremely negative reviews about teeth sensitivity on here. This was not the case for me. I did not miss a day of the regiment and some days even used two strips. Ice cold drinks were about the only thing that caused sensitivity for me, but it really wasn&#x27;t bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 50-ish bucks, was it a good investment? I would have to say yes. It was only a fraction of the cost of professional whitening. Crest recommends you use two kits per year and I may do just that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this level of Crest White Strips every 3 months for about 2 years now, and they have made an incredible difference in how white my teeth are.</li>
    <li> this product is simply amazing&lt;br /&gt;i tried lots of diffrent typs of teeth whitening but this product worked as promised !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had light yellow teeth and after only 3 days with this product I have white teeth !!&lt;br /&gt;everyone should buy this product its amazing</li>
    <li> So i&#x27;m on day three right now and i have noticed a difference in the color of my teeth. I have tried other products before but they have not worked like this one. I was skeptical about using these strips but it really works and i&#x27;m happy about it. My teeth were somewhat yellow because of regular tea/coffee drinking. I started noticing the color difference from day 2. My teeth aren&#x27;t completely sparking white on day three (but they are much better than 3 days ago!). I&#x27;ll post back after finishing the pack to let you know the level of whiteness achieved.</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s do this mother review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off:&lt;br /&gt;I had very sensitive teeth that when I put the older strips my teeth feels like cracking down and ready to break!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used before this Crest Supreme whitestrips which is 14% of hydrogen peroxide + twice a day for 21 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that damaged my teeth badly!! it did whiten my teeth but still made them hurt like hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;ok let&#x27;s leave that aside and let me tell you HOW TO DECREASE THE SENSITIVITY TO 0%....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you need a sensitivity tooth paste that works fast \\&quot;I use Seynsodin Rapid Action\\&quot; it works like in 60 seconds or just use a sensitivity tooth paste a month or weeks before applying the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth now wait an HOUR!! (1) hour before applying it (this is the most important step) the teeth and gum needs to heal alittle bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;drink a glass of water to decrease the dry mouth issue!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after an hour it&#x27;s time to put the strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the way to put is start with the lower ones first!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;start from the center tooth like from the middle, press the strip on each tooth cuz not everyone have a straight teeth so start from the middle press on each tooth from each sides till the end then til it to the back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do the same for the upper tooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now set a timer on ur phone or anything!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is optional but affective I use a scarf to cover my face cuz it&#x27;s winter time and it&#x27;s sooooooooo cold and windy so there are drafts in the house that can cause pain!! so I covered my mouth with a scarf and breath wwith it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY ONCE A DAY!!! not twice only once a day!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the strips can be hard to be removed but try with your fingers to remove it from the edges&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gargle with water!! don&#x27;t brush, don&#x27;t use mouth wash, just water to remove any s!@# left..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now the results here how:&lt;br /&gt;while I was using the supreme I didn&#x27;t see the result until the 6th or 9th day but with these I saw them the 4th day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of course i&#x27;m using them everyday and my teeth don&#x27;t hurt at all!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before a month I used to use a whitening tooth paste to remove stains and they worked too but then switched to a sensitivity tooth paste because I was fearing the pain!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the advance seal is a really good technology !!! they wont slip at all!!! I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t drink while whitening I know I can but I think something wrong will happen XD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do it, it&#x27;s just 30 minutes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update you once I finish to tell you about the results!! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye :Dremove any s!@# left..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now the results here how:&lt;br /&gt;while I was using the supreme I didn&#x27;t see the result until the 6th or 9th day but with these I saw them the 4th day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of course i&#x27;m using them everyday and my teeth don&#x27;t hurt at all!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before a month I used to use a whitening tooth paste to remove stains and they worked too but then switched to a sensitivity tooth paste because I was fearing the pain!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the advance seal is a really good technology !!! they wont slip at all!!!

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried about every whitner around and none have worked as good as this did. My husband and I both saw results after the 1st day.  Then by day 3 (when Crest says you&#x27;ll see results), we saw amazing results.  I&#x27;m not even through the 20 days yet, but if it continues as it is working now, I will have sparkling white teeth. I&#x27;m already impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love how the strips stick to your teeth without moving around or falling off, like other Crest strips I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do want to make sure your teeth are dry when you apply the strips or they don&#x27;t stick as well.  You don&#x27;t have to dry your teeth off, just don&#x27;t brush first or have them really wet with saliva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention ... someone put pictures on their review showing that the Crest strips didn&#x27;t clean much between the teeth.  They are cleaning good on my teeth, but what I do is - after the strips are applied, I take my fingernail and run it between my teeth to press the tape in the crevice some, thus getting the whitner in between my teeth more ... and this is working great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I have no complaints. And Amazon&#x27;s price is great!</li>
    <li> I thought I would need to use the entire box. Turns out one of these bad boys leaves you with a mouth full of pearls.</li>
    <li> When I got my braces off, I was determined to have my teeth professionaly whitened.  I was told by a few people, including an individual who works for a dentist, to give the strips a try first.  Well, of course, I was sceptical.  How could an over the counter product work so well?  Well, I was very presently surprised.  This is the first time in my life that I have white teeth.  No other product whitens my teeth like Crest.  This is a must have for anyone who wants a whiter smile....and who doesn&#x27;t???  Thanks Crest and Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> These whitestrips really do make a difference! I&#x27;m happy with my results. Although it did make my teeth very sensitive at times. I would recommend switching to a Sensodyne toothpaste while using these to help with the extra sensitivity. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee every day and these strips really helped me clean up my coffee stained teeth.  My teeth were not yellow just slightly off color so I used these to get them to the shade of white i wanted.  If you have really yellow teeth, i can not guarantee these will get you to a bright shade of white but if you are a shade or two off these work great.  They are only $25 so what can you expect?</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive teeth, so I do not use these strips for the full amount of time that is recommended, and I still get great results. These strips are very easy to apply, and once you put them on they aren&#x27;t going anywhere! The improvements in whitening strips are amazing. They don&#x27;t slide around like they used to.</li>
    <li> The product does whiten your teeth, and you do see some kind of results after three days... However, I had major pain while using it. It felt like veeeryyy painful sensitive teeth, the pain was constant and it lasted all day long sometimes. This happened after the 5th treatment approx. I read about trying to use the strips every other day but that didn&#x27;t work for me, even if I used the strips 4 days after my last one. I stopped using it after about 9 or 10 strips, so I&#x27;m still missing half my treatment and results are barely visible but I think I&#x27;ll save it for the next time I have really really yellow teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The strips stick very well to teeth and it is fairly easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered these back in September and I&#x27;m long past using the whole box, but I can say that my teeth are still visibly whiter. But I think I&#x27;ll go with a different Crest brand next time, maybe the Advanced whitening.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with whitestrips since I had never used them. I tried them 3 days in a row. They did whiten but I was miserable all day after I removed the strips. My teeth felt soar and achy all day. I dont have any dental issues, I actually am pretty normal. The only reason that I can think that would cause this is that I had braces as a teen and maybe that wore off the top enamel and caused sensitivity. I never have sensitivitey to anything, I just gave to the hubby and he can use. They do work but I dont care for.</li>
    <li> I was very reluctant to try these strips. Had tried whitening toothpaste and mouth wash, and nothing seemed to work. I am a heavy long time coffee drinker. Most products would whiten the teeth that were not stained increasing the contrast with the yellow / stained teeth to the point people asked me if I was smoking (and I am not)&lt;br /&gt;I gave those a chance and so glad I did. The results were amazing. Sure you may need to do it for longer than advertised (two solid months for me) but it really whitened my teeth to the point now people compliment me about their color. Every tooth has the same color and I could not feel better about it. I did get some sensitivity but nothing really intense. Went away a few days after I stopped the treatment and never noticed issues beyond that. I would recommend not letting the strips touch your gum as it gets fairly aggressive and can burn (goes away when you remove the strip). I will keep using this every couple years. A great product!</li>
    <li> Within 3 or 4 days of once a day use, there was a noticable difference. I&#x27;m a green tea drinker but I am careful about rinsing after I drink tea and use a straw, as my hygienist suggested. Still these 55 year old teeth were dull, dull, dull...My smile is bright now, and it was gradual, so it just makes me look fresher--at least that&#x27;s what my husband says!! I totally recommend these strips--I&#x27;ve used other types, and these are the best I&#x27;ve found. The coupon made it nice and free shipping was even better! It doesn&#x27;t taste as yucky as the others do, and they REALLY stick to your teeth too! Also, I didn&#x27;t have ANY sensitivity and I always did with others I&#x27;ve used. Two Thumbs Up!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still working my way through the box but halfway through my teeth are brighter, whiter and cleaner looking. I haven&#x27;t had most of the discomfort that some people report using this product. Because of that, I leave the strips on longer than a half an hour. If you don&#x27;t feel any pain, I would recommend leaving the strips on for at least an hour, or even longer, if you can stand it.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me if you leave them in longer you&#x27;re getting more bang for your buck. Again, I have had little or no discomfort leaving them in my mouth for a greater period of time. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought these to whiten my teeth for prom. I have friends who paid for trays to be made at the dentist, and my dentist said that would be about $400 for me. I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Listerine strips in the past, and got no results. I also tried the cheapest brand of Crest whitestrips, and it wasn&#x27;t fantastic either. But if you splurge and get the professional effects, it will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these cling to your teeth. Really cling. Other strips didn&#x27;t stay in place and felt gooey. Once you pull them off you will see it practically made a mold of your teeth. There is also minimum residue afterwards, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see results after 4-5 uses. Great results. People compliment me all the time. You can get your teeth white and then only use strips to touch up every so often to keep them nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only downfall? They made my teeth sensitive. My teeth hurt the next day after using them and it takes a while to wear off. So I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend buying a new box the second this one runs out, give your teeth a break.</li>
    <li> Any whitening strips sold straight to the public by retailers do not have the actual chemicals that whiten your teeth. These actual whitening products are sold directly and only to certified dentists so that&#x27;s the only way to actually whiten your teeth. These strips DO NOT work.</li>
    <li> I order these strips on a regular basis, I used to smoke and drink coffee and these strips really do make your teeth as white as a $500.00 professional treatment, I like to keep them on hand to maintain my white beautiful teeth</li>
    <li> I love Crest White Strips. This is the second time in the last 12 months I use them, and I am always happy with the results. Not sure if the formula/application has been improved but I feel like the strips adhere better and my teeth are less sensitive after the application than the last time I used them. Definitely expect some degree of sensitivity with these things but it&#x27;s nothing to be worried about. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever using anything else!</li>
    <li> I have tried some of the other Crest whitestrips over the years but I would have to say these ones work the best and are definetly worth the little bit extra money.  They stay on your teeth better then others on the market and they feel more comfortable as well.  Wearing them for only a half an hour is great for me since I can just wear them while I am taking a shower or doing some other activity since they do not get in the way of anything.  The gel whitened me teeth after the first application.  I have a few white spots on about three of my teeth and they looked a little bit more noticeable as soon as I took off the strips.  Within the next hour or so, the white marks started to fade a little bit and the next morning my teeth looked whiter all together, not to mention the white spots did not stand out at all.  With the entire box used, my teeth looked like they were professionally done.  I do have to  mention that I do not drink coffee or red wine and I do not smoke, all in which help my cause.  I also go tanning on a regular basis so that also makes my teeth stand out even more.  My teeth have always been naturally bright so this product works great since it gives me that extra oomph that I need to have them really stand out.  People comment on how white my teeth look at work all the time now.  I will say that after using these, your teeth will be a little sensitive, whether it be on their own or when you eat or drink something cold.  It did not bother me enough to stop using them however some people might be bothered a lot more.  I always say it hurts to be beautiful sometimes and I really do think it is worth suffering the sensitivity for how white your teeth will look once you are done with the entire application.  I think they really do give a professional outcome and for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat by the hundreds of dollars you could be spending at the dentist office for the same results.</li>
    <li> I have tried the regular crest whitening strips before and the results were pretty good considering the price and the strips would slip a litle bit if u werent careful applying them but&lt;br /&gt;These strips are perfect rthey stick like cellotape and the whitening is visible after 2 or 3 days this is my second box in the last 2 years the first time the whitening lasted over a year but because i drink lots of soda im repeating the process but i think if u ditch the soda and the coffee the effect wld last longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice howevwr is skip a day if ir teeth start aching a bit&lt;br /&gt;I totally rcommend its just as good as the dentists but t a fraction of the price</li>
    <li> This product certainly has a much better seal than the other basic whitestrips that I tried. However, I couldn&#x27;t use more than one pair because it made my teeth so sensitive that running in 40 degree weather was painful. I cannot remember ever having sensitive teeth. I would not recommend this product because the whitening chemicals are so concentrated that the sensitivity they cause makes strips to be unusable. I will be returning them or giving them away.</li>
    <li> I have been using the strips for about a week, and I love that they stick to your teeth.  I had used ones in the past, and they would ooze and slide all over my teeth.  I did notice some sensitivity, so I stopped using them every day.  But I have noticed my teeth becoming whiter. Overall good product in terms of whitening strips!</li>
    <li> I would love to say these do good things, they do but after like a week you forget or stop to finish the whole pack. you get busy and forget and then they all go to waste...</li>
    <li> The effect is really amaizing . You will smile all day but it won&#x27;t last long . I totally recommend it .</li>
    <li> I have been wanted to try this, but did not buy because of the price in stores. Amazon sells it at 1/2 price, and it is the same product. How can I not to buy. So far it had worked very well. I used about 8 treatments; it made my teeth looked probably 2 shades whiter. I do not feel any sensitivity when having the treatment, but however it does makes my teeth sensitive on hard bites so far.</li>
    <li> I love this strips. They are very easy to use and people can see the results pretty soon after you start using them. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased these about a month ago and tried them out, with the rather obvious goal of whitening my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did an acceptable job. My teeth are a few shades whiter now than they were before I started using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging, instructions, and application are rather straightforward.  I did not have any issues with them falling off or sticking too intensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have some minor tooth sensitivity, although it has already passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used whitening toothpastes and rinses (including hydrogen peroxide mouthwash, which is the same active ingredient) and the strips did perform better than those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I haven&#x27;t used any other whitening strip products, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price premium over other brands.</li>
    <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened about 5 years ago, so I was in need of a touch up. I asked my dentist about getting it re-done and to my surprise, he said that I should just get the Crest strips because they are less expensive and they really work. So, I ordered the Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects. I&#x27;d used white strips a long time ago and I remember the gooey gel sliding all over my teeth and gums - not with these improved seal ones! They really stick on well and there is no sliding or gel leaking out onto gums. I was worried about tooth sensitivity because I have sensitive teeth and gums, but so far it has been really minimal. I do use Sensodine Pronamel toothpaste, which I think helps when using a whitening product. I honestly noticed a difference after just one use. I would highly recommend these - but switch to a Sensodyne type toothpaste while you are using them.</li>
    <li> Pricing is superior to in store product.  I have used this product in the past with very good results for a non-professional product.  Must buy.</li>
    <li> I was a smoker for 10+ years, finally quit, and it really bothered me that my teeth were stained yellow form it.  My canine teeth were especially yellowed.  I tried these whitestrips and by day 3 I was seriously impressed.  I&#x27;ve taken a photo blog so far... I&#x27;m on about day 10, and the results are amazing.  My family memebers have commented about how bright and white my teeth look only half way thorugh the treatment. There has been some mild tooth sensativity, but when that happens I just skip a day.  It&#x27;s not unbareable pain, but just enough that you are aware of it.  I&#x27;ve had about 3 days out of 10 of sensativity where I skipped a day, and just resumed the next day.  No biggie and DEFINITELY not enough tos care me away from using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I coupled my use of this with Optic White toothpaste, however, I&#x27;m confident the results are from the whitestrips, and not the toothpaste that I&#x27;ve been using for weeks prior.</li>
    <li> I have used white strips in the past with GREAT results... however this time was a failed attempt at teeth whitening. I will start out by saying that I do not have THAT yellow of teeth. However, they are yellow enough to bother me. So I purchased these, used them once a day for the 20 days (except a few days I used twice), and it did not whiten my teeth even ONE level. Not one bit. All it did was create INCREDIBLY painful tooth sensitivity. I kept pushing through it thinking that I would see results, but I never did. I will be sending these in for a refill. If it also helps, my friend purchased some at the same time and had such intense gum bleeding from usage that she had to stop as her teeth were in so much pain.</li>
    <li> These strips work well. I saw a difference after a few days, my boyfriend (who is naturally unobservant) noticed after a week.</li>
    <li> This stuff is decent and my teeth do look a little whiter. I love the excellent seal I get with the crest whitestrips but the bleaching efficiency is much lower than the opalescence or nite white bleaching kits that I can use in my custom trays. I like that this doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your gums, the precision of placement is excellent, and it doesn&#x27;t accentuate white spot lesions on teeth as much as the higher % bleaching kits from the dentist. All in all I&#x27;m happy with this kit, but I think I will go back to using a higher % bleaching kit because it&#x27;s faster and, when purchased on amazon, cheaper.</li>
    <li> Teeth hurt like a bitch</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter.  She has been using it for two weeks now and there is a definite difference in the color of her teeth.  This product works great.  She did not have any problems with sensitivity.  Would definitely buy this product again!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years now.  I receive lots of compliments on how nice my teeth are and I&#x27;m asked if I have veneers or  &amp;#34;Are those your real teeth?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Absolutely no difference after one box used, not worth bothering with. About as good as using a whitening toothpaste, imo.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this product I normally use crest whitening strip and thought this would work better. I certainly grips better and stays on so you can talk as you whitening. I use it for 5 days and my teeth did not get any whiter instead it looked worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very disappointed</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised. It really did improve my smile after 3-4 applications. However, my teeth are very sensitive so I had to apply these every other day or every two days. I like what they&#x27;ve done but I probably won&#x27;t buy them again since the tooth sensitivity never seems to subside with use.</li>
    <li> These really work, I have tried other whitening strips in the past only to be let down when they move around after placing on teeth. These DO NOT move at ALL. They really do work. After a solid week of using I was noticing a dramatic difference. I highly advise buying these if you are in the market for teeth whitening. However be AWARE that these do make your teeth SENSITIVE.&lt;br /&gt;A+, Will buy again</li>
    <li> Ok, I was dubious at first that these were \\&quot;Non-slip\\&quot; and would work in just 3 uses...but I&#x27;ve used them two days in a row now and see a HUGE difference!  My teeth feel so smooth and clean after I peel them off---which, by the way, takes a bit of doing. The \\&quot;advanced seal\\&quot; sticks very tightly to your teeth so they will NOT slip off. My teeth are whiter, healthier and plaque free. What&#x27;s not to love???</li>
    <li> I interested in the 3d white crest strips because I tried it and it gives me a new, white and shiny teeth. I wish to thank the companey and the scientests who aim to find a useful results for all people all over the world.</li>
    <li> These strips work very well, so well that I only used 10 at a time (out of 20 packets in 1 box). It took 10 days to see overall noticeable whitening. The first few days, only the bottoms (tips) of my top teeth were whitening. Just stick with it and you&#x27;ll definitely see results. The instructions say not to brush your teeth beforehand, but since I used them at night, I always brushed and flossed first, then used the strips, then just peeled them off when done and went to bed, leaving the residue on my teeth overnight. Sensitivity was not an issue, and my gums only got burned a couple of times. There is a technique to applying these strips, especially if your teeth are not perfectly straight. You will get the hang of it after a while. These whitestrips definitely stay on your teeth, no slipping and sliding around. Great value! I&#x27;d say give them a try before spending twice as much on gels and trays.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. I try to use this product every six months. There is definitely a visible difference after using as directed, just be aware that it may cause some sensitivity. If that happens just stop using it for 2 or 3 days then continue.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying these because I wanted to make sure they weren&#x27;t going to harm my enamel, and I also wanted a good price. This is a great price compared to what I could find in my local pharmacy. These whitened my teeth within just a couple days. I already had white teeth, but I wanted just to try them and see if they could get better. The reason I gave them 4 stars is because the strips cause my teeth to be in pain (sometimes for hours at a time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- They work, even on already &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; teeth... but they may cause some discomfort.</li>
    <li> The strips come in individual packets. But all these are housed in an oversize strange shaped obnoxious intimidating box. But for the box packaging, all is good. The price is a bit steep at the moment.</li>
    <li> I definitely saw results within a few days. I only needed a little change, though, so I only used them for a few days and I figure I&#x27;ll use some more if I start feeling dingy. My teeth did feel sensitive for the few days I was using them, though. Not fun. But by the next day the sensitivity is gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips off and on for years, and this particular one is certainly the most effective and long-lasting one I&#x27;ve tried.  Of course, it&#x27;s not going to give you &amp;#34;TV white&amp;#34; teeth, but it does whiten to the degree advertised.  It&#x27;s worth the extra expense, especially if you can find it on sale.</li>
    <li> The whitening strips are working really well - I am seeing results faster than when I have used Crest White Strips in the past (their products offered years ago).  They don&#x27;t slip at all when I am wearing them and I find that I end up inadvertantly swallowing MUCH LESS of the whitening agent because they stick so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint (and it&#x27;s a very small one) is that when it&#x27;s time to remove the strips, you really have to PULL them off.  The sealer that they use to make the strips not slip while you&#x27;re wearing them, leaves a thick and funcky residue.  But hey, it&#x27;s nothing that a good teeth-brushing won&#x27;t get rid of!</li>
    <li> I think these strips are awesome and do a great job for $30. I had no teeth pain and I have been drinking coffee every day during the week for years and soda on the weekends, so these strips really got the job done. I used two 2-Hour Express strips 5 days apart (I know it says 3 months, but I wanted results!) and then a week later started this box of 20 strips. I feel like it worked great and am going to submit a Customer Image.</li>
    <li> They worked great. Really made a difference.</li>
    <li> I was a smoker and heavy coffee drinker for decades.  Don&#x27;t smoke no more and my coffee consumption is way, way down so I wanted to try and whiten my teeth a little.  I am please the product works the way it is marketed.  My teeth, while not a bright white, are much whiter than before I started and I am very happy with the results.  I did not have any problem with sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is that out of the twenty strips about 4 or 5 of the bottom strips were a little difficult to adhere at first.</li>
    <li> By drinking some coffee, I tend to have a little stains and I thought I could eventually try Whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;I already read some people complaining about sensitivity after a couple days, however I was seduced by the number of people having great results.&lt;br /&gt;I gave a try, and thought I would maybe get some sensitivity after 3 days. However, on the first try, after 10 minutes of application, I started to get some pain like I never had even with some very icy drink.&lt;br /&gt;I had to remove the strips ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product works. However, don&#x27;t try if sensitivity is something familiar with you already.&lt;br /&gt;I believe I will need to sell my 19 other stripes now!</li>
    <li> I thought my teeth could be a little whiter after using this product BUT considering my age (over 80) I thought it was very good.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how this product worked. In just 3 days, I actually saw results. I have completed the 20 treatments and can honestly say that my teeth are at least 3 shades whiter. Everytime I smile my husband says, \\&quot;Your teeth are soooo white!\\&quot; He now wants to use the strips too. I love love love this product. You get great results for an affordable price. I was considering spending $400 at the dentist for teeth whitening but I am thrilled that I tried this product first. It saved me $350!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the crest whitestrips 6 or 7 times in the past, but this time was the first time for me to try the higher grade of whitening. I was very dissapointed. I did not see ANY real results. I have always been very satisfied with the whitestrips but these are not worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything to my teeth their the same and they are really sensitive I would not really recommend it</li>
    <li> I only used 2 strips  and i still have one unopened pack! I wish i never bought it, completely disappointed, i don&#x27;t have stain i just wanted the bright celebs smile thought this will do it but sadly my teeth are the exact same color, DONT USE if you have SENSITIVE TEETH .. Its gonna miss your whole day, i only drink once or twice coffee and tea per week, but soda almost daily,, anyways after using the second strips now i have crazy teeth pain and sensitivity coz of this useless product, i was super excited to try it coz of the good reviews but yeah guess its not the same results that everyone should get.</li>
    <li> Oh no...really, i paid 59 dollars for 4 strips, got home and was excited to try it... i put it on for 1 hour, because i got the 1 hour express. Then today my teeth hurt so so bad!!! And didnt really see any difference, my teeth werent bad anyway...ive never had this painful reaction to whitestrips before,, now days people need to be careful with these things. I would suggest never buying these, im getting a refund, i should get paid for my pain really.</li>
    <li> I have whiter teeth thanks to Crest 3D white strips.  I use them once a year.  For some reason this time my teeth or gums felt sensitivity for a day.  I just didn&#x27;t use them the next day and then didn&#x27;t have a problem the next time.  White strips are easy to use and I like my whiter teeth.  I&#x27;m buy this product again next year.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and used it once a day for 3 days is all.  My teeth (which have NEVER been sensitive before) are KILLING ME.  I am just grateful it&#x27;s only the the front few.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if it were all of them.  I&#x27;m not going to finish the box.  NOT impressed.  Beauty is not worth pain.</li>
    <li> i bought these several years ago and i, too, experienced quite a bit of tooth sensitivity after using them.  But I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth since i was a teenager.  this kit does whiten my teeth if i can endure 5-6 treatments of it.  besides the pain issue, i was happy with the upper strip but the lower strip always had a hard time staying in place.  i&#x27;ll admit that my lower teeth do need a little orthodontia but they&#x27;re not hillbilly bad.  i thought i might see others&#x27; complaints about the lower strip but i haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;anyway, if you have strong, insensitive teeth that need whitening but not dentist-strength whitening, this is a great choice.  also, if you buy these in a physical store, don&#x27;t buy them without a coupon.  i had a $10 coupon for them and i think crest mailed it to me.  not sure, though.  good luck with these if you try them!</li>
    <li> it is really amazing, and the results came shortly, and to obtain a better result you should continue to use it</li>
    <li> Have never had this done at a dentists - hate going.  These work fairly well and are easy to use.</li>
    <li> Went from &amp;#34;old yeller&amp;#34; to med white with one box. Ordered another box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carroll</li>
    <li> I have really yellow teeth for a 20 year old, so last fall I used up one box of these Whitestrips. My teeth are now pretty white looking, not blinding movie star but enough that my orthodontist keeps commenting on how much whiter my teeth are from my teen braces years. It&#x27;s been about 8 months since I finished using them, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too soon to say I&#x27;m pretty happy with these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a year since 2006 with consistently excellent results. I regularly receive compliments on how white my teeth are from my dentist &amp; complete strangers alike. The results are especially noticeable in lighting scenarios with a cooler color temperature, such as in daylight or when lit by a camera flash. They can cause some tooth discomfort during the first couple days of the cycle for me (even a shooting pain from time to time), but your results may vary based on your tooth sensitivity. But the results make it worth it - make sure to stick it out and finish the whole pack!</li>
    <li> They work but the results do not last very long after you stop. Bummer.</li>
    <li> These strips are awesome. Whitens gradually for a natural look. Follow directions and you will have great results. I used twice a day to begin with.</li>
    <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t going to give you the glowing, artificially bluish white teeth you can get with a dentist treatment, but it does give noticeable results.  It&#x27;s only a 30 minute commitment a day, and I put them in before I get in the shower, so my teeth are done &#x27;soaking&#x27; by the time I&#x27;m cleaned up and ready to go.  It&#x27;s a good way to remove the basic dullness that comes with coffee, tea and wine.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after I use the whole package as directed 30 mins a day. Will not be purshing this product again.</li>
    <li> The white strips worked great.  Also, they &#x27;gripped&#x27; onto teeth, the white strips were not sliding all over like the old ones used to.</li>
    <li> my teeth are hella white now</li>
    <li> I have been able to see a gradual whitening over several days.  Good value for the money. Easy and painless to use. I have sensitive teeth and the strips didn&#x27;t increase the sensitivity at all like I&#x27;ve read that some whitening products do.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest White Strips for years but I have to say the Advanced Seal technology is the best yet! The strips do not shift around at all on your teeth when applied. The whiteness results were the best I have ever seen. I highly recommend paying extra for the Professional Effects, worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Decided to try these as drink 2-4 cups of green/white tea per day and my teeth were getting a bit yellow!......my son tried this exact one and his teeth are gorgeous now......every time he smiles now all i see is white so chose the same ones he used........have only gone through half the box so far and see a definite improvement in my teeth.......i have sensitive teeth so have to use one every OTHER day or my bottom tooth will be throbbing.......by the way 2 aleve seem to knock the tooth sensitivity out if i get any and i have been using sensodyne for about a month now to help with my sensitivity issue........anyway, these are the best whitestrips i&#x27;ve tried to date and seeing how good they work dont&#x27; see why i&#x27;d go to any other brand they work sooo good......IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHITE every time you smile try these!!! (professional effects one)(fyi:  the two hour ones dont work as well and the sensitive teeth ones dont work hardly at all)......kinda expensive but these produce dentist looking white teeth at a fraction of the price of dental office whitening.......</li>
    <li> These were extremley painful. I felt fine directly after using the first set, but a few hours later my teeth were killing.  I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink and my teeth were throbbing (especially on the bottom).  I have never had any tooth sensitivity in the past and I was shocked with the pain.  I waited a few days for the pain to go away and I decided to try them again thinking maybe I did something wrong.  It was the same thing again.  I did them in the evening before going to bed and felt fine.  However I work up in the middle of the night with tons of pain. I&#x27;m definitely throwing these out. It&#x27;s not worth the pain!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  The improvement is noticeable but avoid keeping the strips on longer then 30 minutes; the teeth can become sensitive for a day or so.</li>
    <li> Great price...my fifteen year old daughter has always had a more yellowish coloring on her teeth...she had great results after one week😀 she was able to reduce the recommended frequency and has maintained a perfect white that is not fake looking...Beautiful confident SMILE!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you CREST😀</li>
    <li> I have not been consistent using the strips daily but I already have seen a difference in the color of my teeth. I drink coffee and tea which is the main reason for my teeth having a yellowish tint to them. I have not inquire about teeth whitening with my dentist but I hear it is expensive so this is a great alternative of you want whiter teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy on amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ! Just what I was looking for . Strip is not messy and sticks to your teeth during the while process</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this particular one for the past three years and am very pleased with it. Very easy to use. When I started using it, I did use it everyday but when I saw that my teeth were as white as I wanted I adjusted and began to use it once every 3 days for upkeep. Now, I only have to use them once a week. Also, you cannot beat the price offered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> I love the whitestrips however i ordered the 20 box and the box i recieved only enough for 7 days very dissapointing</li>
    <li> Product works great. I have used the professional before. It worked wonderful as well; however, I encountered a lot of pain. I read many of the reviews and one reviewer suggested cutting the strips in half or in proportion of your teeth so the need to fold under and over is not an option. I have a small mouth, so I cut each strip in half. There were two benefits: no more pain and double the amount of strips if you save the half you cut. I hope this helps for those who love the whitening but hate the pain.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D Whitestrips with Advanced Seal Professional Effects whiten your teeth, but the results are not such effective as I thought.</li>
    <li> I was able to tell a difference after the first application. Easy to apply and they held in place. I give 3D Whitestrips-5 Stars!</li>
    <li> I was about to pay a lot of money to undergo Zoom whitening. My doctor suggested that I try these strips first. My teeth were very yellow and stained from sweet tea and tobacco use. I&#x27;ve used these strips twice a day for three days and I already have noticeably whiter teeth. I can&#x27;t wait to see the final result in a week. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love these especially how they adhere to my teeth rather than slipping off they as comfortable and have quick results I didn&#x27;t think that they could improve from just a few years ago by they defiantly have I recommend that if you tried white strips before and didn&#x27;t like them give them another try</li>
    <li> lightened my teeth some</li>
    <li> Not overly pleased with results.</li>
    <li> Basically, you peel off the strips and fit them over your teeth. The width is maybe six teeth wide. Leave them on for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that time, they&#x27;ll feel pretty gooey when you try to remove them. Haven&#x27;t had much trouble with that, but they do advise you start with peeling from behind the teeth if you have difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, my teeth are noticably whiter, although not evenly. When you apply them, leave some slack to moosh the strips closer to the teeth and that might fix this.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt that this product works. My teeth have always had a natural yellowish tint, so I was skeptical that these whitestrips would remedy that. However, after just a week, I was seeing definitive results. The only problem is that my teeth do get sensitive--it&#x27;s like a constant annoying throbbing (hurts like you got your braces tightened). My teeth aren&#x27;t usually ever sensitive to cold/hot or hard substances, but they did become so after using the strips. Of course it is ephemeral, but no pain no gain right? After using about 10 strips I stopped because I saw the results and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the pain anymore. I recommend using these every other day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and they work amazing.  Can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would go to the dentist to get their teeth whitened.  You notice a difference after the very first use.  I am told all the time how white my teeth are. My husband has told me a couple times that they are too white????  I don&#x27;t think that teeth can ever be too white!  Love these and decided to order on Amazon to save some money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other teeth whitening products and was never satisfied.  WIth these I did start to see a difference in three days and in about 7-10 had a significantly whiter smile.  Also I did not have the sensitivity issues some mentioned in other reviews. My teeth did not get Hollywood White but I am EXTREMELY satisfied with the results.  I&#x27;ve just ordered a second box so I can keep up the look.  THe results would probably last longer(it&#x27;s been about 6 months and I&#x27;m only starting to see them fade) if I didn&#x27;t drink coffee. But I&#x27;m not giving that up :) I would recommend anyone looking to whiten their teeth to just pay the piper so to speak and buy these and skip the other less expensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of advice....Putting the strips on my bottome teeth took practice. I had a little trouble with that.  These are VERY sticky and I got them stuck on my bottom lip a more than once.  LOL</li>
    <li> seems to be working but makes my teeth a little sensitive. my dentist recommended i use this brand and the 3D so i am just going to use my sensodyne toothpaste and hope it helps.</li>
    <li> The Crest 3D white strips really do work. I had noticeable results within a week. Just follow the instructions on the box.</li>
    <li> This really does what it say it would. I really loved it. I see real improvements</li>
    <li> I have treid most all over the counter whiteners. This one by far works the best for me. If one can use two boxes back to back ,,even better. Only needs to be done every six months.Price here on Amamzon is the also the best I have found after searching. My teeth are naturaly white. I like to boost it up for the hollywood look. I always get colmpliments on my teeth. This is a product I will return to again and again. Carol F.</li>
    <li> Made my gums sensitive and had to stop using, but whitened teeth pretty good.  Hope use periodically.&lt;br /&gt;Made my gums sensitive and had to stop using, but whitened teeth pretty good.  Hope use periodically.</li>
    <li> I used a couple different brands before trying this one. The other brands would make my teeth hurt after using it for one or two days. I don&#x27;t have that happening when I use this one. After using it for 2 days I see that my teeth are getting whiter. I don&#x27;t think I would have any problem using it for a week. I would recommend Crest 3d over all the other brands.</li>
    <li> I admit it, I am hooked on coffee. In addition to having teeth that are naturally less than white, I have the resulting caffeine stains from six cups a day of coffee. Unwilling to give up my coffee, I embarked on a journey to find a solution for my less-than-stellar teeth. The combination of Crest&#x27;s 3D Whitening toothpaste and the strips make a world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these strips four times a year to avoid falling too far behind. The strips are easy to apply if you follow the included instructions. The large strip goes on top, the smaller strip goes on the bottom set of teeth. One tip that will improve the ease of use (and, anecdotally, their effectiveness) is to insure that both strips are firmly fitted onto your teeth - on the front side and the back side of the teeth. Once applied, find something to occupy your time for 30 minutes. It&#x27;s really not that hard if you find a good distraction (and remember to set a timer for 30 minutes). Then lean over your trash can, peel the strips off, and spit out the remaining whitening agent from your mouth. I found that after a week of using these daily my smile was indeed whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any sensitivity, soreness, or any other adverse reactions to using this product. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a reasonably-priced path to a whiter smile.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest Whitening Strips for 6 days. I can see big difference before using this product and after. Now I have much whiter smile.&lt;br /&gt;Some people say that they couldn&#x27;t use whitening strips because of the teeth sensitivity. I personally, don&#x27;t have such a problem. My teeth are little bit more sensitive than usual but it is not a big deal. It will go away in a couple of days after stopping using this product. If you are looking for alternative to in office teeth whitening, this is definitely a great alternative! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I like these strips a lot and I use them every couple weeks.  I only use them for 3 days in a row, after which I can notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth, more of a maintenance thing than an instant 20 day 3 shade difference.  It takes me about 6 months to use the box generally.  I also noticed that some people complain that the strips are too short.  I have really big teeth so it only whitens like 6 of my teeth on the bottom.  My remedy for this is to stretch the strip out manually before I apply it to my teeth.  I tug it so that the strip increases in length but shortens in width.  This just means the backs of my teeth are less white, but who the f really cares about the backs of their teeth?  All in all, I enjoy this product.  BTW amazon definitely has the best price.</li>
    <li> My teeth look so white and you see a difference right away.</li>
    <li> Bought these to remove coffee and red wine stains and definately saw difference after 3 or 4 treatments. Experienced some sensitivity, but not enough to discontinue use. Had used other whitening strips in the past and had little results with more sensitivity. I Recommended these to a friend, and they were pleased as well. Would definately buy them again, and Amazon saved me $20 off the store prices!</li>
    <li> These strips are fabulous. They are a complete 360 improvement from what they use to be. They stick amazingly! They cover up around 10 teeth on the top, and about 6 on the bottom. And you start seeing results just after 4 days!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a user of bleaching trays from my dentist, but thought I would give these a try. Although they do whiten my teeth, I still prefer the feel and placement of the dental trays. The coverage of the trays seems to be better than that of the strips. Of course, the trays are much more expensive, but I&#x27;ve had them for more than ten years and rarely need to buy the bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no issues with sensitivity with these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who do not want to invest in dental whitening trays, Crest Whitestrips are a great way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. A secret I learned a few years back to illustrate the rather subtle bleaching process -- try bleaching your top teeth first for a few days and see the contrast between top and bottom. It really is amazing and will make you want to continue the whitening process.</li>
    <li> I order this and I get lt so fast .. It&#x27;s 20 treatment inside  untill know I almost used 6 of these my teeth get whiter little bit . But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gonna give that white if you have a yellow teeth you will get a lighter yellow nothing more and When I start use it I feel it&#x27;s make space between my teeth that&#x27;s so much bother me .. Product still under test .. This the result and how it&#x27;s going with me and I will use utill the ene maybe it&#x27;s going better with whiting .. if something up I will write review agian .. Thanks</li>
    <li> These really work. The results are much more noticeable than other strips I&#x27;ve tried.  The tight seal also makes them less annoying to wear.</li>
    <li> works - but last for only some time</li>
    <li> I seriously love crest white strips, my teeth are super white and i have an obsession with keeping my teeth paper white. This product really does the trick and iv never had a problem with these white strips, i always get complements on how white my teeth are and i would really recommend this product to anyone. Iv tried other whitening products like the luster premium whitening but that didn&#x27;t do anything to my teeth and i always come back to crest white strips, i&#x27;m in LOVE&amp;lt;3.</li>
    <li> These work great, they stay on really well and are actually a little hard to peel off. I can really see a difference and I would definitely recommend them to anyone. I had in the past paid $300.00 for Zoom teeth whiting at my dentist office and this product works better than that, I think because you do it over time instead of in one visit at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these overpriced kits.....$20 an up, the results were good to mediocre. Many times I followed directions,got minimal results, and wasted my money. They all have a great sales pitch.&lt;br /&gt;  Then I saw a kit for $1 at a Dollar Tree store, bought it used it, it is as good as the $35 and up kits you see in groceries or Amazon. They recommend use it for 5 minutes, 10 days straight, or less until you like the results.&lt;br /&gt;  Sure, the dentist would probably be superior, but when you sit in a dentists chair, his goal is to pick your pocket for over $150. My relatives are dentists, I know the racket.&lt;br /&gt;  Buy whatever you choose, I have no vested interest, like a dentist. By the way, all other dollar stores in my area do not carry the whitener kit, just Dollar Tree. And there is no guarantee they will carry it forever.</li>
    <li> White strips were fantastic!  Easy to apply, stayed on just fine, and most importantly they whitened my teeth excellently!  Of course my teeth were somewhat tender after each use, but that&#x27;s gone away now and my teeth look great!  I love how confident I can feel with my smile now!</li>
    <li> I could tell a difference after the first 3 days no problem. They work just like they should. I never experienced any tooth sensitivity problems. Made my smile much prettier!! I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Much nicer than the regular Crest white strips. They feel better made as well. I would HIGHLY recommend using these every other day. They kill your teeth if you use for more than 3 days in a row, at least for me. My teeth are getting whiter and I am eager to see what they look like after I have used the last strip.</li>
    <li> I always used the Classic Crest Whitestrips and they worked really well however, since I can not find those is stores anymore I decided to try these. I don&#x27;t drink coffee, red wine, pop or anything that stains my teeth daily and still, NO RESULTS.  My teeth look exactly the same as when I started the box and they are 10x as sensitive now.  The classic strips made my teeth hurt when I would start the box, but never this bad.  I am sending in my information for a refund, these are way too expensive to get no results.</li>
    <li> They stay on for as long as you want to keep them on ! With just one pack my teeth were noticeably whiter !! I did not have perfectly straight teeth when I tried this and when I went to get braces my orthodontist said he couldn&#x27;t understand how I had such white teeth if they were hard to brush . I told him I used these strips and he recommended I use them after I got my braces off ! Can not wait to use them again !</li>
    <li> I had tried white strips about 3 years ago and while they did help whiten my teeth a little bit, they would always slide around and fall off. The tech has come along way. With these they bolt right down onto your teeth so they do not slide around and they do make a big difference. I smoked for 6 years and quit last year so while I do not have any cavities my teeth do have a yellow tinge to them. These noticeably whitened them and I can tell because I can see the difference between my back teeth that the strips do not cover and my front teeth. That is my only con with them, that they do not cover your back teeth because if you have a really wide smile people might be able to notice. My teeth were a little sensitive while I was using them but nothing too bad. Just go easy on your gums while you are brushing. All in all great product and am going to do another round in a month or so.</li>
    <li> Well, i once tried the classic Crest White strips, and absolutely, this product is a dramatic improvement over the earlier editions. First, the strips are so convenient and easy-to-apply and get rid of. Second, they relatively work out very well (if you have very stained teeth, consider a professional dentist whitening). And above all, the product is great value-to-money and you get fair whitening for the money you pay.</li>
    <li> First of all I am a barista at a coffee shop, so you can imagine how much (free!) coffee I drink and how my teeth would NOT be very white.  When I first started hearing about these fancy white strips I wanted to try them, but instead opted for a cheaper store brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Store brand: chunky thick piece of wax that irritated my gums.  They did whiten my teeth slightly, however, and I was pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later I found out a coworker was using these Crest 3D Whitestrips and her teeth were WHITE! I mean, WHITE WHITE WHITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest strips: Thin strips that conform easily to teeth (store brand strips were too thick and couldn&#x27;t get into the grooves between the teeth).  And within a few days my teeth were whiter than when I used the 2 week store brand strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I have been using the Crest strips for two weeks now (not over the weekends to give my teeth a break) and am just now experiencing a bit of sensitivity.  Because of this I will stop using them for a few days (2-3 days is recommended).  However my teeth are now so white I don&#x27;t even know if I should continue with them or just save them for later! (I have 9 left, enough to do some significant whitening later on.)</li>
    <li> it takes effect but i stopped using it since my gum turned out to be super uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> little difference. but not last long!</li>
    <li> I tried it for two weeks for now. I have to say it worked, and indeed whitened my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;But remember, it might make your teeth transparent and cause some discomfort(which is temporary).&lt;br /&gt;One more, please be realistic, it wont give a smile as those stars, but can improve the whiteness of your teeth to a better level.</li>
    <li> Was very content with this product. However they did not make my teeth as white as I would have liked. I did like the ease that  you had applying them.</li>
    <li> The end result is whiter teeth ... that&#x27;s what you want and that&#x27;s why you  buy it.  When I started these, my girlfriend started using a Listerine-branded product.  We swapped a few and both agreed the Crest strips were more comfortable and had a greater whitening effect.  The downside of these is that the kit comes with 20 and suggests you use one a day.  (I tried 2 a day once and my teeth ached.)  Be prepared to be using these for nearly 3 weeks.  But, as I said at the start, the end result is whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a year since I used these. I was going through my past orders and realized I forgot to write a review for this and I&#x27;m kind of glad I did cause now I can tell you how good it is even though it&#x27;s been a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 days ago I got complimented on how white my teeth are. These come regularly. I am 100% satisfied with this product and will do it again whenever the effect starts wearing off, doesn&#x27;t look like it will be any time soon though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember it did hurt at times when I was putting on the strips but it wasn&#x27;t anything I couldn&#x27;t handle. However if you&#x27;re sensitive or cannot handle pain these are probably not for you. Otherwise these are amazing like I said it&#x27;s been over a year and my teeth are still perfectly white and get compliments regularly. For the price there isn&#x27;t a better deal.</li>
    <li> recommended by my dentist.  Strips stick in place for the full 30 minutes!  so far, I am thrilled with the results.  A must have for those that drink coffee, tea, sodas, and smoke!  (just quit)</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth so I did it every other day instead of every day.  I still had great results and very impressed with the color of my teeth.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews i decided to give these whitestrips a try. I&#x27;m happy with the results of the strips they do work, but not as good as a professional whitening. For the price cant complain also they do give you sensitive teeth but like the other reviews say if it is extreme stop using for a day or two but sensitivity wasnt a big issue for me good product.</li>
    <li> Used this product, the level 4, and was miserable. The warnings are feeble and misleading. Every tooth in my head hurt like I had chewed rocks for a day then swished with boiling water. The drooling was unstoppable and nauseating. Was I foolish enough to try this again the next day? Yes! Worse! Pain went on for eleven hours, when I finally fell asleep.</li>
    <li> These are the best whitestrips out there. Though these are a little pricey, they are worth it for the rapid effects. There is some tooth sensitivity after use, which is completely normal and I take to be a sign that they are working. Noticed whiter teeth after just a couple uses. Additionally, my teeth are looking whiter in photos, moreso than in real life, which is interesting. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> bought this one, keep using it about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;once per day.&lt;br /&gt;But my teeth are still same color.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are painful after every use.&lt;br /&gt;terrible experience.&lt;br /&gt;will not use it again.</li>
    <li> These Whitestrips work extremely well, cause noticeable whitening after using all 20 strips.  I occasionally left these in too long, and experienced some slight pain as a reminder.  Not sure if that is common or not.  Regardless, the product does what it advertises.</li>
    <li> My teeth were stained from years of drinking coffee. I recently switched to green tea but wanted my teeth to look better. Man, these white strips are the real deal. I&#x27;m not ashamed to admit that I use them. They work awesome. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 60s, &amp; I recently had my teeth whitened for the first time, with the $500 1-hour \\&quot;Zoom\\&quot; treatment at the dentist.  Although there was SOME whitening, my teeth were still nowhere near white.  Next I tried the Listerine Whitening strips that dissolve.  They were very hard to get out of package &amp; I received minimal results.  When they ran out I wrote a review here &amp; ordered these 3D \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these strips are much EASIER to use than the Listerine dissolving ones.  These are easy to get out of the package &amp; apply, &amp; you only have to use them ONCE a day.  They are LONGER too, so they cover more teeth than the Listerine ones.  Once you put them in, they barely show and you can talk normally &amp; do everything except eat &amp; drink during the half-hour treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my teeth aren&#x27;t quite \\&quot;movie star white\\&quot; yet, I received clearly noticeable results using these strips, possibly as much change as the dentist&#x27;s treatment achieved, for just a small fraction of the cost.  I highly recommended them!  :-)</li>
    <li> The Crest 3D White Whitestrips work well.  However they didn&#x27;t get my teeth as white as i thought they were going to get.  But i do have to say after using 20 strips my teeth look whiter.  Its more of a natural healthy looking white.  My teeth to begin with weren&#x27;t really yellow.  My teeth are healthy and no cavities but they did have a yellowish tint to them that i did not like.  After using most of the strips i had to take a day or 2 off from them because my teeth did get a bit sensitive.  I think after every 3 strips you start to see a little bit of a difference.  I do recommend this product.  If they ever make a even better product then this i will definitely try that out lol.</li>
    <li> Well, first of all I must say that the price of the product was quite reasonable and well worth it. It does work if you use it on a regular basis as per the instructions. I have seen significant changes in the color of my teeth from off white to whitish. The problem is that it makes your gums and teeth sensitive and tingly ton hot and cold food and liquids for at least a day or two after using the product. So, I have been giving myself breaks before resuming use, else it gets to be physically painful. Otherwise, this is definitely one of the best products out in the market for teeth whitening, not to mention all similar product cause similar side effects as well. I&#x27;d give it 3.5 stars!</li>
    <li> One of the best teeth whitening products out there! This is my first time trying these but they work far better than any other brands ive tried and i could see amazing results in a very short period of time. fit very snug on your teeth and really cant tell that they are on your teeth because of the comfortable fit. highly recommend for anyone looking for the perfect teeth whitening product!</li>
    <li> I have tried it for over a week now, and i did notice that my teeth are whiter now. Only thing is it makes my teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other professional or over the counter product</li>
    <li> The strips do wonders for the price. The only thing is the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; and taste makes me feel sick so I literally have to breath with my mouth open to dry out my mouth. Other than that it&#x27;s good...the price you pay for beauty!</li>
    <li> It arrived fairly quick. I start using it and I really  see results after a few times.I&#x27;m happy with it and looking forward to even better results as I continue using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, easy to use and it really whitens even my old teeth!</li>
    <li> These were amazing and found that they worked within three days, and it wasn&#x27;t a little whiter it was substantial!  Very good product!</li>
    <li> This product REALLY WORKS! I was going to get the 200$ treatment at the dentist office but she suggested I tried these strips to save money. I told her I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve heard different reviews about burning gums and it not really working. I went out on faith and ordered the product... It really works! After a few treatments you&#x27;ll start noticing the difference! I didn&#x27;t feel much of a burning sensation either. I would recommend this product to any and everyone!</li>
    <li> The whitestrips were extremely simple to use and stayed on my teeth for the entire thirty minutes easily. They were barely noticeable when on and only slightly affected my tooth sensitivity to hot and cold. Unfortunately it seems like they barely whitened my teeth at all. The change is so slight, I actually wonder if it is just wishful thinking. One noticeable change that did occur, is a spot that developed on one of my teeth, lighter than the rest of the tooth. I&#x27;m hoping overtime it will become less noticeable. Honestly, I&#x27;m glad I tried these, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted the money.</li>
    <li> Didnt work as well as the package said it would. It is not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Over all I belive that this product works. It made my teeth whiter after 5 days. But the down side was that this product left my teeth brittle to hot or too cold drinks, it phisically hurt. that was probably do to me following the directions. It stated that if i wanted whiter teeth and a short amout of time to use product 2 a day. DONT DO THIS. use it about once or twice a week, of course it will take longer but it will be worth the time to avoid the tingling pain that i went though.</li>
    <li> Tried and true dental whitening. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they honestly suck. I&#x27;ve been buying Crest brand for years because if dependability factor.</li>
    <li> I had honestly really high hopes for this, I mean, look at the raving reviews! See what had happened was I got into my car to drive to my fathers house, I smiled in my mirror and to my absolute horror my teeth looked.. well not as white as I thought they were. Maybe it was the lighting? Who knows. But right then &amp; there I purchased these strips in my car out of sheer panic. I used exactly half the box, and although I did see slight slight improvement in the shade, definitely commendable, I cannot use these simply because half a box in, the thought of placing one more strip on my teeth leaves me with shivers. I have never experiences such horrible tooth sensitivity from anything in life. My teeth hurt for days from my last use and I&#x27;m still feeling the effects now almost 2 weeks later. Reviews say use Sensidyne (sp?) but no, I&#x27;m not buying that because if something is causing my teeth pain it probably isn&#x27;t good for them. I give it 2 stars because you will see results. I used this in conjunction with the Crest HD toothpaste, I saw excellent results with that. I will continue the box some day, but as for now, I&#x27;m still recovering from the pain this product has left me with. Keep this in mind!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product! I was lucky not to feel any discomfort of teeth sensitivity. I do need to be honest though, I wasn&#x27;t a faithful everyday user, I would sometimes skip a day or two of applying the strips and I still noticed results. People would compliment me on how white my teeth were. So I&#x27;m a happy consumer! I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Pros::Quick Results. It works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons::Makes teeth sensitive&lt;br /&gt;  ::Really irritated my gums. I had to stop using after 7 days. I will start it again though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good product.</li>
    <li> Still the best teeth whitening in the business.</li>
    <li> I had used the classic Crest white strips happily several times in the past, but this time decided to try these updated ones.  I&#x27;m not sold on the change. Like the originals, these 3D strips improved the whiteness of my teeth starting at about 3 days, but I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the difference in application.  Like the original, this version comes mounted on a clear plastic support card from which you carefully peel it. On this product, tops and bottoms are mounted on the same plastic, unlike the separates in the classic strips.  The strips are tougher material which do not slide around easily on your teeth but grab hold strongly.  The first time I tried to take them back off I became a little nervous because it was hard to get them to let go! You really have to work at it compared to the older ones. I did get them off, but even after brushing, tiny bits of rubbery adhesive keep turning up in my mouth.  This didn&#x27;t happen with the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t really speak clearly with these things in your mouth, although the phone inevitably rings when I am doing this. I always want to get them off as soon as possible, so I don&#x27;t need a product I can drink water and sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is aggravating, but that is true in both versions. You peel off a foil outer package--which doesn&#x27;t come off cleanly--and try to remove the inner plastic with the strips without tearing anything. The strips themselves look about like the clear plastic they are mounted on so they are hard to see; don&#x27;t put them down on your counter since they will be hard to find again! Such an expensive product should have better designed packaging.</li>
    <li> I took off my braces on December 14th, and i decided to search online for something cheap to whitening my teeth, i didn&#x27;t want to spend 500 dollars to do Zoom, or a professional whitening because my teeth weren&#x27;t that yellow, i just wanted to have really white teeth since i was going to have perfect teeth as soon as my braces were off, and because i am getting married soon. The first day i put the whitening strips i couldn&#x27;t be with them for more than 10 minutes, i knew this was going to happen because my teeth are very sensitive. The second day i said to myself that no matter what i was going to leave them on for the 30 minutes, and i did! to tell you the truth when i took the strips off i saw a BIG difference already , my sister and boyfriend noticed ! so that def motivated me to keep on even if it was going to give me tooth sensitivity, which has gone away since i purchase the \\&quot;Sensodyne\\&quot; toothpaste( It really works for Sensitivity). So far i love it... tonight it wil be my third day and i have already seen results... It&#x27;s worth the money.. it works! If you get a lot of sensitivity like i did don&#x27;t worry just make sure you brush your teeth with Sensodyne, your teeth won&#x27;t get damaged or anything... they will just hurt, but if you want to have a beautiful smile you gotta go through the pain like i did! haha anyways great product, i have never written a review on anything i buy, but i think this strips are worth the post!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Good way to bleach teeth whiter with least amount of effort and at a much lower cost than the Dentist charges. Helps keep teeth white between bleachings. Use for a few days and notice the results!</li>
    <li> its very easy to use! very effective! this brand is really trustworthy! im really happy with my result! i mean my result is very amazing!</li>
    <li> I seriously cannot believe how well these work. I am one of those people who doesn&#x27;t drink coffee or wine or eat many foods that would stain my teeth over time, and yet my teeth were always more yellow than my peers.&#x27; I love wearing red lipstick, but always felt that it would make my teeth look really yellow. Not appealing. So I bought some of these just to try and I seriously noticed an immediate difference after using them. I even started getting compliments on my teeth. These are easy to use -- I just stick them on when I sit down in front of the TV for 30 minutes, then pull them right off. After I used them 3 times, my teeth were [and have remained] noticeably whiter. Red lipstick, here I come! The only thing I would caution: make sure to follow the instructions. I accidentally left them on for 50 minutes once [because you barely notice them!] and my teeth were VERY sensitive the next day. But if you put them on for the recommended time, it should be fine. Get ready for whiter teeth! :)</li>
    <li> Why still 5 stars? Because there&#x27;s no other product that is this inexpensive and easy to get that will do even half as well as these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just checking some of my teeth that I&#x27;ve never used the strips on - huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years ago I used the regular strips, decided I would try these. These stick to your teeth much better than the older ones but they can still slide if you&#x27;re not careful. You still get these weird painful stabbing sensations in your teeth a couple hours after using them, and it usually lasts for a few hours- though the pain is sort of like a quick stab in the gums then will go away for maybe 45 mins, it&#x27;s hit and miss but still pretty annoying to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read this is because of the whitening element in the stips going on your gums, and it&#x27;s unavoidable when using strips like this. No permanent damage, just some pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d take the hassle over the results any day. I noticed my teeth were even whiter after 2 applications over a period of 4 days (I like to wear them once every other day) and they continue to get whiter after continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- These will not get your teeth blindingly white, as another review said most people on TV, commercials, etc use veneers and they are very expensive to get and to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cheap price and being able to order them easily I give these 5 stars. The drawbacks aren&#x27;t enough to crush my rating of this excellent product ;)</li>
    <li> These are the first whitening strips I have ever used, and I will never use another brand again.  My teeth were pretty yellow from a coffee and sweet tea habit, but I did in fact begin to notice results after 3 days.  No, they weren&#x27;t dramatic results, but there was a definite improvement.  After the 3 day mark, it seemed that my teeth began to get whiter and whiter.  After about 2 weeks, I cut back and started using them maybe 3-4 times a week.  Still, my teeth remained white.  They stick very well to your teeth, and you can even drink water while you have them on.  The only time I experienced any tooth sensitivity is when I forgot to leave to time it, and left them on too long.  My teeth hurt, but they also glowed!  So if you&#x27;re looking a good teeth whitening strip, I&#x27;d say give these a try.</li>
    <li> tried to numerous time to contact with no reply at all- product was possibly exposed to high temperatures since was unable to peel off plastic it was applied to and use of product was virtually impossible- felt ripped off since no reply and they could of at least returned or replaced product, out $50- I have used many crest strips in past so I know this was defective-</li>
    <li> I love crest whitestrips. I split this pack with my boyfriend (10 each) and we still both saw an improvement. Also, just FYI, if anyone is a classic user and hasn&#x27;t used the strips in quite a few years (like me), crest did a drastic improvement in design by making the strips fit tight to the teeth so they don&#x27;t slide off like they used to. The only downside is that they can be difficult to pull off, but it&#x27;s no big deal at all.</li>
    <li> You can definitely see a difference in just a few days after using these. The product is much cheaper on Amazon.com than any retailer that I&#x27;ve seen so far and comes packaged great. Great product and definitely recommend it to any coffee/tea drinker! :)</li>
    <li> Love crest strips does exactly as it stated. Whiter teeth 30 minutes a day. No issues putting on or taking them off.</li>
    <li> White strips are much better than earlier types.  I really like the fact you can just stick them to your teeth and not have trays and goop to mess with.</li>
    <li> This product is as good as whitening strips are gonna get. People complain because it makes your teeth sensitive but hey, they work. I used the once like 6 years ago and my teeth go ridiculously whiter. Like people would ask how my teeth where so white type of thing. I decided to use them again as they were starting to dim out and it&#x27;s the fourth day and I can already see a difference. I do remember my teeth hurting last time so I&#x27;m expecting them to hurt again any time soon, but hey, I&#x27;d rather have sensitive teeth for a couple of days that blow 200$ bucks at a dentist office. It also won&#x27;t stain your teeth like those cheap teeth whitening hubs at the mall. If you&#x27;re ready to suck the pain up, buy this! It works. Promise.</li>
    <li> Best way to whiten. I saw that some people said the package was expired so I checked and mine was not. I haven&#x27;t used these in awhile and they now stick on your teeth even better.</li>
    <li> I thought these were the newer version, which has contoured grips instead of being rectangular. This is the old version with a bigger, rectangular strip and doesn&#x27;t stay on as well. Maybe it was the seller&#x27;s mistake.</li>
    <li> I got this whites trips last year and had some improvement that I saw most in the pictures. My sister asked me to get her one!</li>
    <li> wow amazing .great product my teeth look great have to order some more.my friends and family seen a whiter smile thank you</li>
    <li> This product works great. It really whitens my teeth and doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my sensitive teeth much. I use it about once a week for upkeep.</li>
    <li> I think these do a good job whitening but i notice my teeth get super sensitive after using these so i skip every couple days instead of every day use</li>
    <li> I had previously invested in a light treatment at the dentist office which achieved great results. However, over time I found that the whiteness can be difficult to maintain, especially since I like to drink coffee and tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying Crest 3D White Whitestrips proved to be a great solution! The strips are easy to use: just peel and apply to the front teeth for a few minutes at a time. I noticed positive results immediately. My teeth brightened up closer to the point achieved by the dental treatment, but at significantly less cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend the Crest 3D product to persons who want whiter teeth and/or might want to minimize trips to the dental office for more expensive whitening treatments.</li>
    <li> teeth felt cleaner,not much change in color after using them 3 times in one week. Crest classics were the best ones they ever had on the market, at about $20.00 a box. But of course they had to change to&amp;#34; new and improved&amp;#34; and then charge double for a substandard product.. You are better off buying &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; strips&amp;#34;. And now you can no longer find or buy &amp;#34;classics&amp;#34; because teeth whitening became such a huge success.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who wrote all those glowig reviews but this stuff doesn&#x27;t work. AT ALL. I would just save up and go to a dentist and get your teeth whitened properly.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> These whitestrips really work and I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort using them. I could tell a difference in my teeth in less than a week.</li>
    <li> This product worked amazing. I could instantly tell a difference after the first use. My only complaint is that my teeth hurt so bad after about the 5th packet. I couldn&#x27;t even use the whole box because of the pain. I&#x27;ve had other people tell me that they experienced some discomfort after using them but the pain didn&#x27;t last long for them. If you have sensitive teeth like me i would recommend to not use this product because my pain didn&#x27;t stop for day&#x27;s. My teeth look beautiful but it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain and discomfort after using them.</li>
    <li> I am a dentist and I recommend this product to my patients. I saw its results and I believe it could be a better alternative to the home tray bleaching technique.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away.I drink a lot of coffee and had some yellow staining. I am a dental assistant and would definitely recommend this product. Started as a B2 shade, ended up a PW2! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I see the change in just few days</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the middle of the whitening treatment with 3D and already feel an incredible difference in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put on and take 30 minutes a day is enough to have white teeth from now on.&lt;br /&gt;However, those who have sensitive gums may suffer from a mild burning.</li>
    <li> I used the dentist&#x27;s whitening gel with trays for several nights (slept with them on) and did not get the results that I have seen with these strips in just 3 days.  I&#x27;m absolutely serious and do not work for Crest in any capacity.  These strips are amazing and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Used these as described on the box and holy mac do they work!  I really noticed the difference and people noticed too.  It has been over multiple years since I use these and I must say that (in combined with my healthy eating) my teeth has stayed looking white and clean to this day!</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers, I have seen my teeth getting whiter after three days of use, even while drinking coffee and tea during the day at work.  Also like other reviewers, in the past I had tooth sensitivity to prior versions of Whitestrips.  While waiting for the Whitestrips to arrive, I started brushing my teeth with ProNamel by Sensodyne as I was already experiencing some occassional tooth sensitivity.  Just prior to putting on the Whitestrips I brush with ProNamel and immediately after taking the strips off I brush again with ProNamel.  So far I&#x27;ve been able to wear the strips every day without any sensitivity to the product. Most of the time the adhesive is sticking but a couple of times I had problems getting the lower strip to stay on my teeth, even after drying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend using the Amazon $7 off coupon and with shipping and handling I still paid approximately $20 less than what this product is selling for in the local Walgreens in Catoosa, Oklahoma.  Worth the wait to save that type of money.</li>
    <li> Very good price!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought two for my husband and I for our wedding day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*use sensitive toothpaste during use - as your teeth will be a little sensitive.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! The first day I used it I experience really bad tooth sensitivity. So bad I couldn&#x27;t sleep! I took a couple of advil and the pain was gone. Once I figured out how to numb the pain. I take 2 advil before I apply the strips and I notice absolutely NO PAIN! Of course this probably isn&#x27;t a recommended method...But it works for me! I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 4 days. I already had pretty white teeth (B1 to be exact), but I wanted something to brighten up my smile even more. So far I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. Will definitely use this again. There are 20 pouches but to be honest I&#x27;ll probably only use 10. I&#x27;ll use the rest 6 months from now. But like I said I already have pretty white teeth.</li>
    <li> everyone noticed an immeditate difference. i didnt let anyone know that i started this kit. i recieved tons of compliments on how pretty my smile is and how white my teeth are. will be doing this treatment again. :)</li>
    <li> it works, but I cannot handle the acid pain on my tooth. it started after three or four days use.  one of my friends has the same symptom, So i think it is not due to the individual difference.&lt;br /&gt;amazon gives me half of the refund for that, my friend get full refund. we r satisfied with amazon not the product.</li>
    <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended as a cost effective whitening product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the downside is the teeth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I believe these were OLD. When I buy them from the store they are not s o DRY.</li>
    <li> my teeth became white</li>
    <li> I used them for the recommended days and length per treatment and did not see any change in my teeth. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> My teeth was very yellow,i drink alot of coffee and tea,After my second day My teeth REALLY noticeable  WHITE.&lt;br /&gt;I had a little bit sensetivity But I use crest 3d white sensitivity  toothpaste and all is OK .&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t prush your teeth before applying the strips coz it will make your teeth really sensitive,you can prush before applying by 30m and it will work very well, definitely I&#x27;m gonna buy this product again:))&lt;br /&gt;So happy with the results</li>
    <li> Always buy at a popular store with a coupon!! This item was alot cheaper, same quality and received quickly!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Goods as described.  quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Dried out strips! Package was completely crushed, and it smelled of mold. Aren&#x27;t there suppose to be some gel on the strips? They are so dried out, I can&#x27;t get them off the plastic piece.</li>
    <li> After just 2 days, I could see a difference! I will agree that after day 3, I was noticing a minor amount of discomfort but not bad at all. I&#x27;m excited to see how these work after using them for the next week or two! I have very small teeth and the bottom piece covers the front &amp; back AND some of my gums. I think I&#x27;ll try to cut them in half or at least trim them so my gums aren&#x27;t as covered.</li>
    <li> Have really whitened my teeth well and so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Since my bottom teeth don&#x27;t show when I smile, I used it on my top teeth only. Can notice a little whiter, but not very much. I have used the 20 top strips and 4 of the bottom strips on the top also.I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much money again.</li>
    <li> The package claims that you can see visible whitening after only 3 days. This claim is true. I&#x27;ve never whitened my teeth before but they weren&#x27;t too yellow to begin with and I noticed the difference after 3 days exactly. However, I also have sensitive teeth and by the third day, the strips had increased their sensitivity. The instructions say that if your teeth are sensitive, start using the strips every other day (instead of every day), so that&#x27;s what I did. The sensitivity stopped immediately after skipping a day. I used the rest of the package in a similar manner: using the strips every other day, sometimes using them two days in a row. The whitening continued just fine using this method. My teeth are extremely clean looking now, but not that fluorescent look some people get with over-whitening. They just look pretty and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes on usage. The strips are easy to apply, especially if you follow the instructions and put the bottom one on first. I definitely recommend, as the package says, to use them BEFORE you brush your teeth. The instructions say it will reduce tooth sensitivity but there&#x27;s also another benefit: if you use them daily before you brush your teeth, you won&#x27;t forget to do it AND you can brush off the gooey stuff that the strips leave behind on your teeth. Also, the strips are EXTREMELY sticky. They won&#x27;t come off accidentally; they stay on securely. They are comfortable to wear. When you pull them off, make sure your fingers are dry so you can get a good grip to pull off the strip.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth. However, after just 3 days of using the 3D strips, my teeth starts to burn pretty badly. So, although my teeth are a bit whiter, I wouldn&#x27;t use the rest of the strips.</li>
    <li> I am a coffee drinker and have some tetracycline staining. That made me a poor candidate for whitening, as tetracycline is nearly impossible to remove. But that did not stop me from trying professional whitening many years ago. The results were poor and I thought I&#x27;d have to live with yellow teeth. I also tried the Rembrandt method along with the toothpaste. Again, poor results. Fast forward 10/15 years and I thought I would give whitening another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the strips once a day and my teeth were noticeably whiter in about a week. I did not expect gleaming movie star white, but I wanted some improvement.  A couple of shades lighter wasn&#x27;t too much to ask. My expectations were met. There is some sensitivity, but not unbearable. I used this in conjunction with the 3D Luxe Glamorous White toothpaste and I think that is an amazing combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not think there was a huge difference among toothpastes, but I was wrong. The others just did not work as claimed (Colgate, I&#x27;m talking to you). This works for me so I will stick with this particular line.</li>
    <li> I got them for a friend who smokes and drinks coffee, they actually did a great job in just 5 days!</li>
    <li> Simple to use. Great value.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly, my teeth are whiter. It just doesn&#x27;t whiten my fake crown I have in front :D I don&#x27;t get any teeth sensitivity at all.</li>
    <li> Big difference after just one use!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and the results are noticeable.</li>
    <li> These whitestrips are AMAZING. They do cause some sensitivity though but that does not last long once you remove the strips.Don&#x27;t drink cold water after you use it.  I&#x27;m usually a little skeptical when they say &amp;#34;professional like results&amp;#34;, but Crest said it was guaranteed or your money back, so I said I might as well try it. I&#x27;m glad I did, because I started to see results after 3 days, and then a week later, my teeth looked like I got them whitened by a dentist. They also do not taste as bad as the original whitestrips and they actually stay in place, making things easier. This product is worth the $45 because you definitely do get the professional results, which would cost you about $300 at the dentist. So if you want a brighter smile for less, get these whitestrips. :)</li>
    <li> my teeth have permanent former coffee / tobacco stains and they&#x27;re more yellow than the sun.  i ordered the crest strips with great reluctance, having tried many other products over the years.  after 2 weeks, my ex actually complimented the whitening of my teeth!  wow!  i have a bad case of yellow-itis and this product has made an appreciable dent in the problem.  i have ordered a second batch to keep up the process.  so, for me, while this product still didn&#x27;t completely break through my yellow-itis, it did, indeed, work far better than other products that i&#x27;ve used.  i give this product a strong endorsement for those of us with really stained teeth.</li>
    <li> These whitestrips are SUPER effective but made my teeth very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Every year Crest whitestrips get better! I use them all the time and this is the best version yet. People ask how my teeth are so white!</li>
    <li> Teeth were very white! Cept after I used the whole box, a few weeks later the whiteness went down so you mite wanna get more, but while using the product it works great!</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product and to get whiter teeth, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t give me the satisfaction I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did make my teeth a bit whiter, but that&#x27;s all, nothing too crazy.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Follow the instructions everyday for 20 days and you&#x27;ll see AMAZING whitening results.  I just finished using the package and my teeth are beaming!  Be careful, however, not to leave the strips on for more than the time mentioned (30 minutes).  I was caught up in something one time and accidentally left them on for 10 minutes longer than they should have been.  I had the WORST teeth pain I have ever experienced!  Luckily, it went away in 1 day.</li>
    <li> These are AWESOME! I was so self conscious about the stains on my two front teeth. Now I get compliments about my white teeth. These are way worth using daily. I haven&#x27;t even used the whole box and I&#x27;m satisfied! I&#x27;ll be buying these every year!</li>
    <li> Crest advertised a rebate for the strips, and then said since Amazon was offering at a discount, the rebate was denied.  When I wrote Crest to complain, they offered me the rebate anyway as a goodwill gesture.  Customer service like this seems like a rarity, and would like to tip my hat to P&amp;G for it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I went in thinking/expecting that these were not going to work and that the improvement was going to be so minimal it was barely going to be worth it. I received it super fast and tried my first strip right away. They adhere to your teeth perfectly and don&#x27;t switch or move. Think of it as glue that actually stays put. It doesn&#x27;t taste bad either, though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend drinking anything (even though it says water is OK, I really don&#x27;t think you would want to). Taking them off was equally as easy, and although it does leave a strip of clear film behind, you can just rinse your mouth twice or three times and you&#x27;re done. Results were clearly visible in 3 days, and boy, what a difference! Things just keep getting better and better the more you use them. Just make sure you REALLY read the instructions and adhere to their guidelines. I left mine on for about two hours (fell asleep with them, figures) and my teeth were very sensitive for about a week. I didn&#x27;t use them for that week, and they were pretty much back to normal. The sensitivity isn&#x27;t dead painful either. You just cant drink very cold, very hot liquids unless you put your tongue behind your lower teeth (these were the ones to develop the most sensitivity). It may make more sense if you try them, but my point is, it wasnt ALL that bad at all. The product says to use them as fast as possible, but I still have about 8 strips left and I don&#x27;t see much harm in not being able to use them all in the least amount of time. 20 strips for sure are enough to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only (initially) bad thing was the price. But once you see the results, how easy and simple it is, you will think you just got a deal on a $500+ product. I can&#x27;t talk about the durability yet, but during the week I had them off, I didnt see any negative changes. Absolutely recommend these over all other brands I&#x27;ve seen girlfriends use, that are so thin and flimsy and move around in their mouth if they do as much as swallow or sneeze, let alone drink anything.ch as swallow or sneeze, let alone drink anything.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work . Painful feeling after taking the strips out.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product because after I had my braces removed, my teeth became yellow. I&#x27;ve used them for 2 weeks, and I have seen no results at all. I took pictures to see if maybe I had missed something, but my teeth look exactly the same in each one. What a total waste. I&#x27;m going to wait a while and try Love that Smile.</li>
    <li> I was meaning to try this product for ages and finally decided to go through with it as I have my first post-college career job starting soon. I smoke and also drink just about everything that dirties teeth, and while I take care of my teeth and have good hygiene, I&#x27;ve never been able to get anywhere near the shade of white I&#x27;d like. After completing my box of pro effects, I must say i&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I didn&#x27;t reach the reallllly nice shade of white, but they are leaps and bounds whiter. I actually saw some results after my FIRST application of pro effects...but here is a warning (that has been posted in many other reviews...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 minutes into my first application I got an incredibly sharp pain in the dead center of one of my top teeth. I&#x27;m talking like stabbing exposed nerve kinda pain. I&#x27;m one to get cavities drilled without novacane, and I have quite a high tolerance for pain but this was like the equivalent of sticking a fork in an outlet. It wasn&#x27;t bad enough that I felt the need to remove the strips, but I definitely wasn&#x27;t expecting that type of pain. It played out exactly like some other reviews state; pain fades quickly and then randomly returns now and then. Unlike some others though I had NO pain after removing the strips, and no pain in the following hours etc. This scenario played out almost my entire first week using the strips, but by the time I got towards the last 5 or so treatments I would just get a tingling sensations that felt as if the pain was approaching the &#x27;ouch!&#x27; tipping point but didn&#x27;t make it over the hill. For the comparatively small price tag i&#x27;m very pleased, these strips weren&#x27;t goopy and stayed on my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> I could see a difference after few treatments. made my teeth too sensitive to make this a routine.</li>
    <li> I drink of lot of black tea, so I need to whiten every so often. These did make a noticeable difference, fast.... I am not sure how often it would be safe to use them, but I am already thinking of getting a new set. My teeth were sensitive the first few days, but I spaced the treatments out, and it got better.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest White Strips for years.  The basic, original strength...works much better than this.  I&#x27;m going back to the  Premium  . This wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Maybe I had my expectations too high but I was hoping for \\&quot;professionaly whitened\\&quot; teeth.  The strips did whiten my teeth, however, they will only whiten your front teeth due to the size of the strip.  I do see a difference but not as big as I was hoping for.  I also cut out drinking dark liquids or drank from a straw and I followed the instructions exactly.  I will probably try a different product in 6 months and hope for better results.  Best price for this product is on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Causes some tooth sensitivy but I use a tooth paste for sensitivy which helps that problem. And my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t be stupid like I was and apply it for full 30 minutes till your dentin gets exposed to acids from food and you get a toothache. My teeth started hurting 20 minutes in (go the &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34;), but I decided to wait out full 30. My teeth bleached really well after just the first use, and I don&#x27;t see any reason to be using it for a set amount of time or every day. Not like the teeth are going to get stained overnight or something. Do yourself a favor and apply it only till you start feeling pain, and then if you do get pain, wait out several days till it&#x27;s completely gone and your enamel is more or less restored. Personally, I&#x27;d use it for 15 minutes at a time once a week. It&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker. My smile was yellow for quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the strips a week ago and i can tell the difference already.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt, itch, ache or bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I searched the internet for a whitening product that \\&quot;Really Works\\&quot;. I took a chance on the Crest 3D product and hit the jackpot !!!! This product Really Really works -- In my case - Better than described on the carton.</li>
    <li> For the 5 extra bucks you get a product that works, as far as I&#x27;m concerned everything else is just a knockoff.  I worked my way up the ladder &amp; finally got the good stuff &amp; had more results in 3 days than in the previous 3 months combined using various products, including the slightly cheaper whitestrips.  Save your pennies, get the best, you&#x27;ll be happy.  I use sensodyne &amp; no problem with sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> I started using them and noticed my teeth were much whiter in just 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;I have had a little sensitivity only first day of using.</li>
    <li> It really works. I didn&#x27;t see the difference in 3 days as it says on package but now I have one more to go and it already did a great job. After ten days you can see the difference and extra whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth was white but not shining shining white, and I had some usual black dots. It made my teeth whiter and shiny. Also helped on black dots.</li>
    <li> It truly keeps the yellow stain out of your teeth and your smile becomes brighter in pictures! Truly worth the money, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to buy it every month or so.</li>
    <li> I have been using crest white strips for years and I wanted to try these 3d ones instead. The only upside I guess is how they stay secure on your teeth. Although they only reach to your eye teeth on the top, so if you smile after the whitening process you can see where you didn&#x27;t use them. I prefer the Advanced white better and they are cheaper.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel pretty clean after using these strips and the white spots and marks on my teeth from the bleach go away after a few hours or so. My teeth are fairly sensitive and I&#x27;m prone to canker sores. So I don&#x27;t use the strips everyday, more like every other day or every 2 days because I&#x27;ve developed a few sores when I bleached everyday.</li>
    <li> After 10 days these have made my teeth significantly whiter and they look great. If your teeth start to get extra sensitive after a couple days of using them start doing them every other day and the sensitivity should go away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the strips for years and never had an issue.  I guess speeding up the process requires a much stronger formula.  The strips themselves are stronger and hold better than the other Crest strips I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that after a few minutes, I felt throbbing pain in my teeth.  I have had other strips irritate my gums before, but not my actual teeth!  I took the strips off with less than ten minutes of use and my teeth hurt and were sensitive for days after.  This has never happened before and I have really healthy teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it will happen to others, but I&#x27;m switching back to the older strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I used several boxes of these Crest strips of different kinds. First box was the Gentle Routine, which SUCKED, BIG TIME! It did not whiten my teeth AT ALL! Then I used the Advanced Vivid box (which was quite new back then) and I didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for. Then I used The Professional Effects, thats when I got what I was hoping for. Bright, Natural White teeth. I wasn&#x27;t looking after celebrity-white kind of teeth, and this gave me what I was looking for, a noticeably white teeth. To be fair to the previous boxes, my teeth were really yellow, not stained or anything, but they were YELLOW! My mom used this box as well and results were instantly visible on her teeth, and that was only after she used the 3 first strips! As far as sensitivity goes, I didn&#x27;t have any, only if I keep the strip longer than half an hour, then my teeth would hurt ever so slightly. But when mom was using it, she said she felt something like electricity shots going through her teeth while the strips were on. But it didn&#x27;t continue afterwards and her teeth are pretty normal now. So keep in mind that results may vary from one person to the other in both whitening results and sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product, it did a great deal in boosting my confidence and enhancing my life. I totally recommend it, but don&#x27;t waste your money, like I did, on less powerful packs, go straight for this one, that would be my only advice :)</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m not good at sticking with weeks-long programs, be it skin care, exercise routines or tooth whitening. However, I used this for several days and could definitely see a difference. I also experienced no increased sensitivity during this time. The strips are kind of gross, but you&#x27;re only wearing them for half an hour, so it&#x27;s not hard to suck it up and deal with it! They leave a little gummy stuff behind, but it doesn&#x27;t stick around long, especially if you brush your teeth afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At list price that&#x27;s two-seventy-five per day. That seems like a lot for a few shades of whitening, but obviously it&#x27;s less than a professional treatment, which would make it worth it if you&#x27;re set on whiter teeth. The Amazon price cuts that to a buck sixty. I actually didn&#x27;t treat my bottom teeth as frequently as my top teeth, so I was able to stretch the 20 treatments a bit by using the lower teeth strips on the top. I&#x27;d say these are worth the expense.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved these!!! keep using them daily and they work wonders!!!!</li>
    <li> This product definitely whitens teeth quickly. There are warning about increased sensitivity that may be caused when using the product. I ignored this concern because I&#x27;ve never had this problem before. Unfortunately, I did suffer cold sensitivity issues after using the product.</li>
    <li> Easier to use than I thought, did whiten somewhat</li>
    <li> works very well. just my teeth are kind of sensitive to it, so I have to use for one week, stop for one week and start again and stop again......</li>
    <li> Sort of kind of works, ish? It stopped working after about the 5th time. My teeth seem to be whitening resistant... I used the whole box with little result. I mean a tiiiiny bit whiter, yes. But noticeably? Nah. Too expensive</li>
    <li> It works so ooooo~~ well! It is awesome!</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use!</li>
    <li> this made my teeth too sensitive though i didnt use this so often</li>
    <li> To keep sensitivity to a minimum, take my advice and that of other reviewers -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Start using Original Sensodyne (not Sensodyne Whitening) or any \\&quot;for sensitive teeth\\&quot; toothpaste a week before you start the strips and continue for as long as you do the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Do a set of strips every *other* day.  This is what I did and I&#x27;m very pleased.  It takes 40 days instead of 20, but I don&#x27;t care because my teeth didn&#x27;t hurt and are whiter.  Had the sensitivity been too bad I would have quit using the strips and still have my coffee stained teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Be realistic.  This box contains peroxide gel, not porcelain veneers.</li>
    <li> Great price and the strips work amazing as I knew they would!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t open your mouth too much, otherwise you will expose the yellow teeth that this product didn&#x27;t whiten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though - the strips are too short and thin and you&#x27;ll end up with an uneven tooth color in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;For most purposes this won&#x27;t matter, but if you think about smirking exposing your lateral teeth or exhibiting broad smiles, this is simply the wrong strategy.</li>
    <li> they make my teeth hurt!  Not sure that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
    <li> The strips were dried up and old...should&#x27;ve returned them...but didn&#x27;t realize they weren&#x27;t suppose to like that till my friend showed me how they should be.  Will never order these from here again...not worth trying to save some money!</li>
    <li> They work great and as advertised, you do see a difference after just a few days.</li>
    <li> At first my teeth hurt but after using it for awhile they didn&#x27;t. Overall they whitened my teeth. Only thing is you have to wait 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have fairly white teeth but my recent obsession with hot green tea caused my teeth to look dull. So, I decided to give the Crest 3D white strips a try. In short, the product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I love the no slip seal strips.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I love the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Did not see improvement in 3 days. Began to see improvement in 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;Gum area (around 1 tooth) was very sensitive after 3rd use; but I eliminated the problem by pushing the strips off the gum while wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to my family and friends. My teeth are white again; not as white as before drinking the tea, but white enough for my family and friends to see a difference. I get positive comments all the time!</li>
    <li> Well, I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it until I tried it. I am a male (if that matters) and I have 2 teeth (eye tooth and the tooth next to my front tooth) which are porcelain. I read that this product would not brighten porcelains but they were just as yellow as my other teeth so I thought what do have to lose? Sooo... I gave it a shot regardless of what I read. Low and behold with the first use I could see a slight difference in my real teeth AND surprisingly my porcelains as well. After just 3 treatments my teeth were nearly as bright as I wanted them to be so I started using them every other day to make them last longer. Now I only use them twice a week and wow what a difference in both my real teeth and the 2 porcelains! I have no new sensitivities to my teeth and no gum irritation what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who is skeptical about this product, don&#x27;t be. These strips stick so well to your teeth during use that you can hardly get them off in the end. The taste is quite bearable, they stick VERY well, they work as advertised (even better in my case), Amazon had the lowest price and as I said, the best part is that they brightened my porcelains too!&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am totally satisfied and still using up the rest of the strips. I wish I would have taken some before and after pictures now. Both my sister and my mother have now purchased them so I would recommend this product to anyone without reservation. (Results may vary) LOL I just always wanted to say that!</li>
    <li> These work! They only go on your front say 5 or 6 teeth (top and bottom), I wish they wrapped more further on back teeth. I would brush my teeth, wipe them down with a washcloth (to dry them, it helps the strips stick better.) I would leave them on for about half and hour. I did not use them back to back days. Every couple of days a week till they ran out. My teeth got too sensitive if I used them everyday. Also wears down tooth enamel (even if they do say its &#x27;enamel safe&#x27;). Haven&#x27;t repurchased yet b/c they&#x27;re pricey but they do work.</li>
    <li> These strips work REALLY well on my teeth, but that might be because I think my stains are coffee stains and not anything too serious.&lt;br /&gt;But the taste is GOD awful, i&#x27;m glad i only have to use them once a year!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just get to the point... these strips work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Strips easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;  Only wear them for 30 minutes each day&lt;br /&gt;  Inexpensive compared to dental procedures&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;20 consecutive days to complete process&lt;br /&gt;  Can make teeth and gums raw or sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 days, you WILL see a slight change in your teeth.  It will be very, VERY subtle.  You might be the only one who can tell.  But a week after that, you start to shine!  And after the 20 days, your teeth are CLEARLY WHITER than when you started the treatment.  I grew tired of putting the strips on after a couple of weeks.  But I just kept going to get the complete treatment.  It&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth did get a little bit sensitive after about 10 days or so.  But it never caused me pain - just some tenderness.  I did develop a tiny raw spot above one of my teeth on the gum line just above the tooth.  It showed up at the very end in the last week.  It was red and sensitive, but not serious.  If the strips touch your gums, they will get red or maybe even bleed.  So try to make sure the entire strip touches teeth only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for application is this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Brush your teeth&lt;br /&gt;2.  Rinse well with water&lt;br /&gt;3.  Use tissue to dry upper row of teeth&lt;br /&gt;4.  Apply upper strip to dry teeth&lt;br /&gt;5.  Use tissue to dry lower row of teeth&lt;br /&gt;6.  Apply lower strip to dry teeth&lt;br /&gt;7.  Remove strips after 30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;8.  Brush teeth lightly and rinse thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it.  Do that for 20 days and you WILL have whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a little discomfort and teeth sensitivity you&#x27;re golden! After the first strip I did notice a difference. My teeth aren&#x27;t too yellow but they will be if I don&#x27;t take it easy with the coffee. I try to do it once every other day and I am loving my smile!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after the first time. My teeth are also usually so sensitive I can&#x27;t use whitening products, but I have used these twice so far without any sensitivity. I definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> Good product with results</li>
    <li> I am at least halfway through all the whitening strips and, frankly, I don&#x27;t see that much improvement.  I would say that my teeth have whitened MAYBE 1 to 3 shades, no more.  The box makes the claim that it gets rid of 14 years of stain.  I don&#x27;t think so.  This item isn&#x27;t worth the money I spent on it.  i&#x27;ll be looking for something else.</li>
    <li> I purchased a similar item from this seller, and though the box arrived a little smashed (I actually blame my mailman.  He drop-kicks my packages all the time), it was exactly what he&#x27;d claimed it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself...I have terrible teeth.  They stain incredibly easily, even though I brush faithfully, and they&#x27;re stupidly sensitive.  Even a regular cleaning from the dentist sends me through the roof, and it&#x27;s gotten to the point where the dentist makes me come half an hour early just so he can put on something to numb my teeth before the cleaning even starts.  I&#x27;m not exactly a wuss, but every time I&#x27;ve tried to bleach my teeth in the past, the gel made my teeth hurt so badly that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to talk or eat for a day or so afterwards.  I gave up on bleaching years ago, because I just couldn&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister--who has invincible, blindingly white teeth--told me to try this.  Now, I&#x27;d tried many other products over the years, and most of them didn&#x27;t produce results quickly enough to make the inevitable pain worthwhile.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from the Crest strips, but they really made all the difference.  My teeth became noticeably whiter after two uses, and each time I use them, they go a shade lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity is still an issue.  I can&#x27;t use the strips more than twice a week, if that, so whitening is still a major process for me.  Still, the sensitivity isn&#x27;t even remotely as bad with these strips as it has been with other products.  I can still speak and eat and function, which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have, however, heard that the Professional Effects is easier on sensitive teeth than even other Crest products.  I&#x27;ve never tested the others, but I went with these just to be on the safe side.</li>
    <li> i love this item and it is the best and it should be used by everyone who needs to whiten</li>
    <li> I regreat !!! Dont use this ppl !:( I have now demaged teeth:(</li>
    <li> Who wants yellow teeth? Use this for nice shiny white ones! Love this version, have used it 3 times now.</li>
    <li> Just pop a strip on while you&#x27;re watching TV or reading and you&#x27;ll notice a difference in a week or so.</li>
    <li> I started by using the first Crest Whitestrips that came out. I would say there was not much improvement, and the lower strip wouldn&#x27;t stay in place because saliva collects there. When Crest offered an &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; system I decided to give the newer line a try. By this time I happened to have a flexible lower teeth mold from my dentist from some work done there. The whitestrips made a big difference, and they stayed in place on lower teeth because I slipped the mold on over the lower strip. I always use these exactly as the package directs. Do not brush your teeth before applying the strips. I wait a bit until after I remove them to brush. Now my routine includes using the &amp;#34;Professional Effects&amp;#34; about every 6 months. My dentist and hygienist noticed right away that my teeth were whiter and brighter. Their whitening system is so much more expensive so I am thrilled that the Crest product works for me. By the end of the cycle of use I do have a little tenderness in my gums but I just skip a day if so.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have tried Listerine whitening strips and Rembrandt 2-Hour. My husband (age 57 and a coffee drinker), has tried products from our dentist with the tray and bleaching product called Nite White. Nite White only whitened his teeth about one shade. We were not happy with that result and ordered twice, thinking the first one was bad or near expiration. Second one didn&#x27;t do anything either. On Nite White, he went from the light brown stage to a very dark yellow stage - not much improvement at all...in fact barely noticeable. He seemed to want to give up on the process, but I convinced him to just try the strips and now he&#x27;s preferring them to the tray treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I happened to find a $10 coupon in the mailers and said what the heck, and picked these up at Target. They were $49.99 there, so kind of pricey, but we didn&#x27;t want to try Nite White any more and have another poor result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Crest 3D Professional Effects, and after 4 strips, he is now seeing very marked improvement. He is happy to finally be seeing a true result and wants to continue with his progress.  I tried them once and had improvement already. One box will certainly be enough for both of us.  They adhere well to the teeth, and when removing just start on one side at the back and pull around to the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use Sensodyne to help reduce the sensitivity that may occur. I did have some sensitivity even after one strip - but my husband hasn&#x27;t had any, but he uses Sensodyne daily.  Common sense prevails and always consult your dentist to make sure you can use this product safely. We always get regular cleanings and checkups. We both love the results we are seeing.</li>
    <li> The product works just as advertised. It&#x27;ll whiten and brighten your smile from the start. Personally I find it works better if you keep it on a bit longer as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause discomfort or sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I will admit that the strips aid in teeth whitening  but I do not believe that the sensitivity that comes with using these is worth it. I can not use these for more than two days at a time because it hurts so bad. I have tried numerous times but can not get past two days.  I even tried the sensitivity strip that crest makes (which is not worth the money).</li>
    <li> Wow... It really works + has an added \\&quot;BONUS\\&quot; - read below to know abt the added benefit. I brought this for my wife who has been a regular coffee drinker for the last 10-12 yrs. This resulted in stains on her teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On using the product - (This is day 3 when i am writing this review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1- No signficant change&lt;br /&gt;Day 2- Color of teeth looks lighter (very mild change)&lt;br /&gt;Day 3- Realized my wife does not speak when she puts these strips in her mouth for 30 mins-- \\&quot;Wow now that&#x27;s the added Bonus i was talking about\\&quot; :P- Let me know if you agree with it after your spouse uses it (But Day 3 you seriously strt noticing a change in the color of the teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s significantly reduced the stain&#x27;s by 60% and i am expecting to see whiter &amp; cleaner looking teeth in the days to come&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update this review after 2 more weeks..but as of day 3, i.e today it looks a lot different than before.</li>
    <li> Many times I will try this type of product with very little or no results.  But I was about to have my teeth whitened professionally when I thought I&#x27;d try these first.  These little strips actually work!  And you do notice a difference right away. Definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> These work really great and are easy to use. However, a warning: do NOT accidentally fall asleep with these on. It doesn&#x27;t feel very good..</li>
    <li> I was impressed at how quickly it worked and it was very easy to apply.  I def would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This made my teeth very sensitive for a full day after treatment.  I will try again after using Sensodyne toothpaste for a week.</li>
    <li> This product did as good a job whitening my teeth as the process I had done in the dentist&#x27;s office which cost hundreds of dollars. Customers should understand that your teeth can only get as white as they ever naturally were. For example, my teeth are not as white as my sister&#x27;s, never were, but they are now as white as when I was young.  These strips removed stains from many years of drinking tea.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. I find that it works very well, and the new formula sticks to your teeth much better. I buy this product every so often to keep up a nice white smile.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to go wrong with these professional effects white strips.  They are worth the extra $$ over the other Crest whitestrips. The lower strips are better and larger than the non Professional effect strips, and they stick better to your teeth.  What are you waiting for?</li>
    <li> These are by far the best over the counter white strips I have ever used. I literally started to see results not by day 3, but by day 2, and continue so see incremental improvements since. I have approx 5-6 days remaining. Unlike past products, these not only have superior whitening power, but they actually stay in place!! so much so that I sometimes need to peel them off my teeth with my fingernail. (previous products would slip and slide all the time). Of note, these have caused some sensitivity for me but not like previous products used. Furthermore, my experience is unusual in that I have fallen asleep with the strips on, for as long as 2 1/2 hrs. (shame on me!). I would expect that the sensitivity would be far less or none at all if I would use as directed (1/2 hr. only). Don&#x27;t let the price dissuade you, these are worth it if you want noticeable and fast results. I recommend using sensodyne toothpaste before, during and probably after use. I also started using arm and hammer age defying toothpaste, has liquid calcium to strengthen enamel, and seems to have helped with sensitivity so far. Thank you Crest for such an amazing product for my [previously yellow] teeth! A++++++++++++</li>
    <li> Does this product whiten your teeth? ABSOLUTELY. I have used Crest Whitening strips in the past (about 5 years ago) and did see a small difference, however my teeth were slightly sensitive to said product, but I pushed through the pain. However, after trying ONE set of strips (upper and lower) for one 30 minute session, I can NEVER try them again. Four hours later, I was in such intense pain that I could not unclench my face. The Crest Professional Strips are amazing for whitening, even after the single 30 minute session I saw a small difference, so I can imagine what using an entire set would do, but caution users, if you have sensitive teeth, this is NOT the product for you. The pain lasted for 12+ hours in my case and had strange effects on me. I could not touch cotton for example, clothes, couch, pillows, etc. Teeth sensitive have been related to skin sensitivity, and it became so bad that it felt like the \\&quot;nails-on-a-chalkboard\\&quot; feeling whenever I thought of or got near cotton. And no, this has never happened to me before. It took a lot of pain medication and Orajel to just relax at all. I finally had to contact an emergency doctor to make sure I wasn&#x27;t having an allergic reaction (I was not). So, as I said, if your teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive GO FOR IT! This product is amazing! But beware if you have experienced any sensitivity, it can lead to a horrible horrible experience! Good luck buyers ;-)</li>
    <li> I have been using them for about a week so far. My teeth were by no means yellow to begin with, but I did have a small section on my canine teeth that was slightly whiter than the rest of my teeth. My teeth are now evenly white, I can&#x27;t wait to use the rest and see how white my teeth will become!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I rate the strips 4 stars rather than 5 was regarding the sensitivity of my teeth. It didn&#x27;t really hurt very much at all and my teeth felt normal 24 hours afterward, but there was an uncomfortable feeling in my teeth for the next few hours. But totally worth it and I would recommend these to a friend!</li>
    <li> Received my package even earlier than expected. Love this product although I would recommend that people with sensitive teeth or those who find their teeth feeling sensitive from the bleaching process to use the bleaching strips ever other day or ever other 2 days. I did this due to a slight sensitive feeling happening the 3rd day I used the strips and took a 2 day break and started using them every other day and the sensitivity feeling went away and I now have beautiful white teeth. I am very happy with the results, received my first complement about my beautiful white teeth 2 days after using the first strip :)</li>
    <li> Brighter teeth quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days and have noticed some change. I&#x27;ve read other reviews and noticed people saying the sensitivity is insane! I have a suggestion for that though. I usually put the strips on while I&#x27;m taking a shower, why you ask? I noticed that when my mouth is filled with liquid, the pain increases greatly. Also if i breathe in with my mouth there is also slight pain. So what I recommend is to put the strips on while your taking your 15 mins shower and keep spitting and also breathe in with your nose. As a result, I now feel almost no pain. It makes leaving the strips on your teeth for 30 mins much much easier. My girlfriend has noticed my whiter smile, so I gotta say this product does work. ITS CHEAP TOO</li>
    <li> First the package stated that this was a 20 count package and there was only 19 in the package. second, I have been using this for14 days now and I really see no results.</li>
    <li> I just finished using a box of these, and have to say that these Crest Whitestrips are one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in the past year!  They are easy to use, and, most importantly, they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had dental trays in the past, but the hydrogen peroxide in those oozes out and is unpleasant to deal with.  These strips go on easily, and, while they do foam up a bit, the taste isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the advice of a previous user, and have been putting them on in the morning while I shower and get ready for work.  After a half-hour, they are ready to be peeled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that they don&#x27;t extend past to the back of your teeth, but those sections of your smile aren&#x27;t too noticeable anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t end up using these each and every day since some mornings I forgot to use them.  It probably took me a little over a month to use the 20 strips, and I still got great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using these!  They&#x27;re really fantastic!</li>
    <li> I was surprised not only by how easy these were to use (and I had no burning or other nasty side effects that some other reviewers experienced), but also by how effective they were.  For an over-the-counter whitening product, the results were quite good.  My teeth did get whiter when I used stuff the dentist gave me but that route was considerably more expensive.  So, you have to balance price with effectiveness.  These Whitestrips were a great deal and did the job.  But if you want substantially whiter teeth, you probably need to get something from your dentist.  I&#x27;m happy with this product, though, and will buy it again in a few months.</li>
    <li> Whitens but caused too much sensitivity to my lower teeth that I could not continue using after just 5 days, what a shame :(</li>
    <li> I used it for couple days then my teeth got pain a lot and I stopped using it. Depend on your teeth sensitivity, your teeth can get pain when using the whitestrips.</li>
    <li> I wish someone would have warned me. Be careful with Whitening strips. I started using crest whitening strips, once a day for 20 days, 30 minutes at a time as per the instructions. During my third use, I felt a sharp pain through one of my teeth. Finished the session, took the strip off. About 10 minutes later, felt a sharper pain, went to the mirror to see a crack going from top to bottom on one of my teeth. Went to the dentist this morning, he said it&#x27;s not uncommon because the Whitening Strips soften the teeth and can make them brittle. Be careful with Whitening Strips.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth, but I thought I might be able to suffer some light pain in the name of beauty.  I only made it through one treatment.  Though I noticed an IMMEDIATE difference in whiteness (really quite impressive), the sharp, stabbing pain that I experienced in my lower front teeth was enough to convince me that I should try another method (maybe the Crest gentle formula?)  Or maybe I&#x27;ll just live with my slightly tannin-stained teeth.  Either way, I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the middle but I can definitely say that there is a difference and it is working.&lt;br /&gt;Using it with the 3D toothpaste and a nice new oral b toothbrush. I do sometimes feels nerve pain&lt;br /&gt;when using them but I just ignore it.</li>
    <li> I did notice a change in the color of my teeth after only three days. After another two weeks of using them (occasionally forgetting to use them), I could tell a BIG difference in my teeth. They were so much whiter. I normally don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, but after the two weeks my teeth were very sensitive so I stopped using them for a while, but I probably would have anyway because my teeth were already so white. It has been 7 months since I first used the WhiteStrips and I am now down to the last few strips in the original box. I use them every once in a while to whiten my teeth again, but I can still tell my teeth are very white. One box does so much. I would HIGHLY recommend these, but caution those who already have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for more of an improvement, with the time I used the strips for whitening my teeth. They really stick to your teeth well.  Should I have used them twice a day instead of once a day?</li>
    <li> My teeth have been throbbing for hours. I didn&#x27;t know I had sensitive teeth, but apparently they weren&#x27;t ready for this. I haven&#x27;t been able to eat or drink and I&#x27;m in immense pain. Why did I have to be so vain?</li>
    <li> This strips adhere well to your teeth.  I noticed a difference in just a few days and by the end of my use, there was a significant difference.  Well worth the added cost. I searched everywhere for a long time and Amazon offers the best price.</li>
    <li> all I can say is that it works!! I&#x27;ve used 5 strips in about a 2 week span and wow..I  have my friends on it my mom and my girlfriend..It is AWSOME!!</li>
    <li> the crest strips work well for me. the only thing i noticed is the box did not have any coupons in it. normally when i purchase from a regular department store, there are special coupons inside you can use for future purchases.</li>
    <li> So I used this for 3 days.  Had minimal sensitivity.  I had used Crest white Strips in the past (different version), and knew what to expect.  I do not know it there&#x27;s something special in this, or extra concentrated or what, but the whole inside of my mouth broke out and was swollen.  I felt like I had chemical burns in my mouth...&lt;br /&gt;Crest offers a one time cash back offer, so I mailed that in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did look around for other reviews or anything people experienced like that.  All I found were sensitivity problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, my teeth were a bit whiter...</li>
    <li> Bought for my fiance, was a 1/2 pack smoker a day person, had very yellow teeth afer the first 4 days of use, I was impressesed that his teeth had changed color, but for about the rest of the treatment, the results stayed the same, now his teeth look better, but not really amazed with the end product.</li>
    <li> I use these strips about once per year and they make my teeth much, MUCH whiter. I like that they stay on my teeth well and that I can drink water while I use them. I am not sure why Crest is making the claim that you can see results by the third day - I can always see results after the first application. Maybe that&#x27;s when most people start seeing a more significant improvement (?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do make my teeth very sensitive. For some reason it doesn&#x27;t start right away, but by the morning after using them I feel \\&quot;on edge\\&quot;...it is a very annoying feeling that lasts for about 24 hours. I am going to try taking prescription strength Ibuprofen this time to see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink a lot of coffee (I am a graduate student) so for me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Whitened my teeth but they were miserably sore for a couple days</li>
    <li> Before buying this product, I was very hesitant. First, because I wanted to be sure that it worked, and Two, because some people where saying how they couldn&#x27;t use it because it was burning them, and third, because it is pretty pricy. After deciding that I would try it out, I decided to splurge on the Professional Effects, because I thought, if I was going to spend money, might as well pay $10 more dollars for the most advanced product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only a bit passed the 1/2 way marker, but I see huge improvements. My teeth before where a greyish-yellow color that I was very much embarrassed of. After using this product so far, they have definitely improved greatly in their whiteness. They aren&#x27;t sparkling paper white, but they are definitely many shades whiter than they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are very sticky, and at first I sort of paniked that they wouldn&#x27;t come off (they do, just tear them from the side; and DON&#x27;T PANIC). It is a HUGE improvement from previous whitestrips, like the Supreme, which is very gross tasting and slips all over the place. Although bulky at first, the strip really is manageable, and you dont need to worry about moving it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the product, and will be buying another series to do in about 1/2 a year (you should only use the strips up to 2x a year).</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed these quite a bit. They work well, and the new \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; actually does work quite well. I had used the old whitening strips, but would always get worried they were sliding off my teeth so I would check every few minutes. With Advanced Seal, there is no reason to worry. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> There are many better pastes that are not tested on animals. You know how they test it? They put on their teeth and leave it for a VERY while.</li>
    <li> Just take a moment to cosider this...you are putting BLEACH on your teeth. Some people have bad reactions, some people don&#x27;t. Sensitivy is NORMAL. For some it may be a little more extreme, but you can&#x27;t expect to put BLEACH on your teeth with no reaction whatsoever. Think about this...Clorox Bleach isn&#x27;t even supposed to come in contact with your HANDS without you washing them right after because it is an IRRITANT. Just because your teeth hurt doesn&#x27;t mean that it ate away all your enamel. It means the BLEACH penetrated through the layers of your teeth (exactly what it is supposed to do to whiten them) and your teeth got sore from it, because yes, teeth do have nerves, and BLEACH being an IRRITANT effected those nerves. The sensitivity goes away when you stop using the product because you are no longer putting this irritant, BLEACH, on your TEETH. Maybe you should have considered using an enamel strengthening toothpaste for a few weeks PRIOR to (and after) putting BLEACH on them...</li>
    <li> They whiten well but I find they irritate my teeth after application. The following day or the day of, there is a scratching sensation on my teeth. I read the instructions and didn&#x27;t brush before application but it continues to irritate.</li>
    <li> The whitestrips were easy to use and stayed on my teeth well. I definetely saw a difference in the color of my teeth. I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used crest strips several times and people have always complimented my smile. With this package I don&#x27;t really notice a difference. My teeth also aren&#x27;t as sensitive after 2 back-to-back strips as they&#x27;ve been with others. Yes this is good from a pain perspective but bad because your teeth don&#x27;t get whiter. I will have to do the Intensive strips next time. Product arrived on time so no problems with the seller.</li>
    <li> I have only ever used the professional effects and boy do they work!! The best teeth whitening product out there. You must use them daily for a minimum of 30 minutes. Some people will use them for 4 days straight and then skip a day and say \\&quot;my teeth don&#x27;t look white\\&quot;! Really! I love this product and hope to use them two to 3 times a year. Ha..one thing, DO NOT FALL ASLEEP WITH THE STRIPS ON YOUR TEETH!! O my gosh, your teeth will be feeling horrible all day long. Besides that error by me, this product rocks!!</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a difference in how white my teeth were after using these for the full length of the kit. The strips were very easy to apply, weren&#x27;t too much of a bother while they were on, and were easy to remove. I can&#x27;t wait until I can use them again. This was my first time using Crest White Strips, so I can&#x27;t compare them to any of the other variations, but the Professional Effects level was great, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> this product works as well as any, but i see nothing special about it, won&#x27;t spend the money on it again</li>
    <li> For the first 5 applications or so I was getting *horrible* sensitivity - though that was cured by using Sensodyne toothpaste. The strips worked well and whitened my teeth to my liking. It&#x27;s been about 9 months since I used these strips and I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use them again (yet). Recommended.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I like that they stick better than in previous years. There is definitely tooth sensitivity afterwards. My teeth aren&#x27;t too discolored because I don&#x27;t drink coffee and when I drink tea I use a stainless steel straw, but these work in making my teeth whiter.</li>
    <li> They work, but they really hurt my teeth. I can only use about 1 a week. It helps, but that rarely isn&#x27;t enough to get my teeth super white.</li>
    <li> I begin to see results after using these for two days. They work great.</li>
    <li> very pleased with results - do recommend to every one</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice even a mild change after using this product for 20 days. Professional grade is not strong enough for my coffee-stained chompers.</li>
    <li> These are really nice to use. I like how the bottom strip is long also to get better coverage on the bottom teeth.</li>
    <li> The second day i had to stop using them because it was hurting my teeth too much! I tried to ised them a 3rd time but the pain was so unbearable that i completely stop!</li>
    <li> These stay on soooooooo much better than the older ones. You CAN drink water and still wear these. And they whiten nicely too!</li>
    <li> Of all the Crest whitening strips, I like these best. They stick well, work well, and 30 minutes at-a-time is about as much as I&#x27;m willing to take!</li>
    <li> My teeth were definitely whiter by the end of use, but the sensitivity is no joke. Make sure you buy some special toothpaste and mouthwash to combat or at least lessen it like I did (I got sensodyne gentle whitening and rembrandt mouthwash and these guys helped a ton).</li>
    <li> I use these once a year, love them. Bought a box for my daughter for Xmas. She asked for them and was so pleased with results in just the first few days.</li>
    <li> Work as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are visibly whiter. I had calcium stains (bright white spots) on my teeth and during the 20 days the white spots became brighter, this is a TEMPORARY effect and after my white spots are virtually non existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have some fun sensitivity for the first few days but I will do another round in the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT brush your teeth BEFORE applying white strips.</li>
    <li> Seemed to work for a while but then I realized it could have just all been in my head (you know when you think something is happening because it&#x27;s supposed to...). I think if I had bought another pack and continued it would have been more beneficial.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  If you leave them on for too long, then there might be some slight gum sensitivity, but that should be foreseen.  Overall, I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Not certain is such a great product. Strips move around when placed on the teeth. Felt weak.</li>
    <li> I have used white strips before, but these were by far the best. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about them moving or sliding around, they just stay perfectly in place. I would buy these again 100 times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before and they always deliver great results. So much cheaper than going to the dentist.  Do leave my teeth a little sensitive, but mainly when the strips are on.  Other than that, these things are awesome.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected, whitens teeth in few weeks very well.</li>
    <li> These things hurt my teeth. Every time I use them it feels like I just got back from the dentist and my teeth are so sensitive to even just breathing. I don&#x27;t like these things.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected, I got significantly whiter teeth after half the pack. I usually have some sensitivity issues with white strips, but these have been OK. I use half a pack every year or so to keep my teeth looking good!</li>
    <li> I think it works,but the problem is on the third day I used it ,the teeth feel sour, the feeling dispeared when u stop to use the strips.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly as pictured and described</li>
    <li> Have used 6 strips over the last few days. Teeth are whiter but I have zapping pain in my teeth just as I did with professional whitening. They work. But major sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I am still using the product but after three applications I have seen improvement along with sensitivity. Using sensitive toothpaste has been helpful.</li>
    <li> Better than the other strips that don&#x27;t cover the entire bottom row of teeth.  These strips are bigger/longer.  Work great!</li>
    <li> My package just arrived today, it came a day before it was expected to, so pretty normal shipping I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these whitestrips a few times before and I can honestly say they work wonders. They&#x27;re amazing and so worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I was buying just the sample sizes of these that had 2 sets for $7 and I had bought a few of those and fell in love with them, but I&#x27;ve been wanting the full size for a long long time now so I saved up some extra money and ordered them on amazon because they were MUCH cheaper than at a store.&lt;br /&gt;The package these came in were in the original box but inside like an unpadded envelope so the box got a bit flattened but oh well I guess, I would just much rather have better packaging because I don&#x27;t want something this pricey to get damaged before I receive it.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I&#x27;ve used these before so I know about them a bit already, the taste they have on your mouth is horrible for awhile but I guess its tolerable. They hurt your teeth if you use them daily so I might do like every other day with these, but its alright.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love these and cant wait to have more pearly whites!</li>
    <li> not sure about this.  It whitens.  But it doesn&#x27;t whiten like you would expect something at this price.  Not sure if I will uses these again.  Its a hindrance to do for an outcome that really isn&#x27;t noticeable enough by anyone.  The spouse insisited it worked, but not noticeable enough that it was mentioned until I asked.</li>
    <li> They do work! Just a summary of what you should do to make this most effective with the least pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Follow the instructions!&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t brush before using the strips&lt;br /&gt;- Use Sensodyne Pro-Namel for at least 3-7 days before the strips&lt;br /&gt;- When using the strips, keep them on for AT MOST 30 mins&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t try to eat, drink, or talk too much when you are wearing these&lt;br /&gt;- Swish your mouth with water after use (the gel will be stuck to your teeth if used correctly, so rinse it off afterwards)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, beauty is pain. You might get some sharp sears of pain sometimes when using these strips (or randomly after use). I&#x27;m usually good at enduring pain, but there were a few times it really did hurt and I got caught by surprise. Anyhow, these do work, and I just wish they didn&#x27;t hurt so much. I don&#x27;t regret using them, and I don&#x27;t intend on using more than 10 strips every few months anyway. Just use the Sensodyne for sure if you have sensitive teeth ;)</li>
    <li> I have 7 strips left to use after todays use. I am SO thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID I noticed a change by day 3 YES indeed I did..... In fact I noticed the yellowish color breaking down on my teeth after the 2nd use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Do my teeth keep getting whiter with each application? yes they do at least one full shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I have any pain such as burning, sensitivity issues....yes I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the pain make me want to stop using them? No it does not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just how yellow were my teeth? They were a shade lighter than a banana LOL (not funny before but funny now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just how white are my teeth after only 13 applications? They look as white as an egg white!SERIOUSLY NO JOKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone noticed? YES everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product? What do you think???!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these strips if you cover you mouth when you laugh! Thanks!</li>
    <li> These work very well. The larger lower strip is a welcome improvement over the original small coverage lower teeth strip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular crest white strip user for years.  I usually by the level 3 product because of the higher price for the level 4.  I use the strips once a week or so, and they keep my teeth quite white.  This item is more that likely long since expired.  They have no whitening power at all.  Also they do not come in the box so you have no idea what level they are, or when they expired.  The individual strip packages also appear like they have been around for a while.  I order often from Amazon, this is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten screwed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand people saying these don&#x27;t do anything. I see results after the first strip. If you smoke or drink tea and soda, you&#x27;re probably just staining your teeth as fast as you&#x27;re cleaning them. They&#x27;re expensive, but so is the dentist.</li>
    <li> Much better price than I can find locally.</li>
    <li> Read in an article that our teeth is really supposed to be yellowish. This one didn&#x27;t turn my teeth instantly white but slowly. Take note that it&#x27;s really not &#x27;white&#x27; white.</li>
    <li> It made my teeth sensitive, but whiten my teeth beautifully. I brought it for a very cheap price on amazon compare to buying on sale at the drugstore. It was worth every penny. Next time I just try the ones for sensitive teeth called \\&quot;gentle routine\\&quot;. Thanks Crest xoxo</li>
    <li> An excellent product.  I&#x27;ve used this daily for years and have found it to be the best thing for removing day to day stains.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t salivate wearing these.  Big plus.  My teeth are definitely whiter.  Not as porceline as I&#x27;d expected, though.  There was a product at Sephora 4 years ago called Brite White (I think) that was much better.</li>
    <li> Your teeth are really getting whiter, but sometimes they hurt afterwards, at least that is what happens to my lower theet</li>
    <li> These whitestrips worked, but they made my teeth sensitive for at least a day after the first time I used them. Because of this, I didn&#x27;t use them every day and used them slowly over time instead. I probably will not buy this Professional Effects type again, but will go back to the Advanced Vivid kind which worked really well before our wedding.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay. The results are not as good as the one you get in a dentist&#x27;s office and the side-effects are the same. The main positive is the price.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Don&#x27;t need to use many to get desired effect.</li>
    <li> THESE THINGS REALLY WORK!</li>
    <li> These strips did not make my teeth noticeably whiter. They also caused a small amount pain while and after wearing them. I would not recommend this product. I will try another band next time!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in results of Crest Luxe White Strips.  Expected 14 years of improvement.  Teeth only became maybe one shade whiter.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest Supreme for several years which have 14% peroxide and work great. the only down side to them is that they slip off if you try to use upper and lower stripes at the same time. Solution, use them separately. These 3D White Strips stay on great and you can do top and bottom at the same time, but they do not get the whiteness that I had been use to. I feel I wasted my money and should have paid to higher price for the Crest Supreme. No where on the package or information did it ever say what the % of peroxide was for the 3D strips. Crest should make that information available so that the customer can do a better comparison to know what they are getting.</li>
    <li> It works good! And u will see a difference in smile:)&lt;br /&gt;The 3rd day will show you results, just give it tiiime</li>
    <li> The product works great. My only complaint is that 25% of the strips are dried out and not usable. This is no bargain even with the rebate.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Teeth looks great.</li>
    <li> Very good product and timely delivery</li>
    <li> I used the crest whitening strips for one week everyday leaving them on for about 4 hours a day. I saw a huge difference in the shade of my teeth after that first week. After that I would only use the strips before a big event to give my teeth an extra bright lift. The downside to the product is the stinging feeling of the strips on your teeth and gums. After you remove the strips your mouth will feel a little odd and some say that the strips are harmful for your teeth but I&#x27;m not a dentist so I am not sure about the effects. Overall good product for the cost.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest White strips for over 5 years. It keeps my teeth looking nice and white and they are easy to use.</li>
    <li> These Crest Whitestrips work about like you would think.  Not quite as good as a professional whitening. About a week after finishing them, I can kind of tell that the color is fading again (but still better than the original).  They did make my teeth very sensitive, but a bit of sensitive toothpaste seemed to solve that problem.</li>
    <li> First of all!! It was fast shipping!! And cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;It was my first time using this product, but it was worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;Much better than going to dentist!!&lt;br /&gt;I tired some other products before but this one is the best!!</li>
    <li> I had use Crest Whitestrips in the past, and I was always annoyed at how they slipped around on my teeth. No such problems with these! Once you put them on, they STAY on! Until you use some muscle and yank them off 30 minutes later, anyway. I&#x27;ve used them twice now, and my teeth are already brighter. Nothing bad to say about them, really.</li>
    <li> The best product I&#x27;ve ever used to whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> This product whitens teeth well.  My only gripe is the tooth/gum sensitivity associated with use.  30 minutes daily for 20 days, this is a convenient product to use to have some extra brightness in your smile.</li>
    <li> I bought this set of whitening strips because it said it had the highest level of whitening. I did everything the instructions required, and while my teeth are a little whiter, it&#x27;s not liek I had hoped for. I even had my teeth professionally cleaned just a couple days before I started the strips, which I heard would help the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips themselves are very easy to use, stick to your teeth very firmly, and do not have a very strong taste. I did feel some sensitivity, but was using Sensodyne Pro-Namel, (I read other reviewers had used it for this same reason) and I think that helped keep the sensitivity to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use these again, as the box says you can use them twice a year, but since the level of whitening was so low, I will be checking with my dentist and see what other options I have. My hygienist said it might be due to my coloring (I have red hair) that my teeth are not as white as other people&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, and getting it from Amazon at a great price was awesome.</li>
    <li> The first time I used these, before even 10 minutes had gone by I got extreme pain shooting through my teeth from this product! Not worth it!! I have never had sensitive teeth before, but OWWWW!!!</li>
    <li> My teeth have a natural yellow time but this product has truly helped whiten them with just one box.</li>
    <li> The price of getting this online was what pulled me into buying this. After using this radomnly over a few days i did see an improvement. However the initial taste does need a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product. This is my second time ordering this through Amazon. It&#x27;s priced right and cheaper compared to a brick and mortar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these strips about once a week now. Before, I used them every day. Because I drink a lot of coffee, my two front teeth would begin to turn yellow. So, instead of wasting an entire strip on just my two front teeth (my other teeth remain white), I came up with this cool idea. I take one pack and proceed to cut the upper in 4 equal sections. Then I cut the lower in 3 equal sections (The lower is shorter in length, and wider compared to the upper since there are two strips per pack). This way, I can just whiten my two front teeth and then this strip lasts me 1 week (daily use) before I have to open a new pack. Now that I&#x27;m whitening my front teeth once a week, one pack will last me 7 weeks. Make sense? ;o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy these and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> First time I have used these, and they did not disappoint.  Started to see results in 3-4 days.  Teeth now look much whiter.  I will be using them again.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I bought it. I know some people rate it low because they feel uncomfortable after using it. And the product also said there is no harm when your teeth ache. Your teeth is too sensitive. It also suggest you use it once every other day if your teeth feel bad. So I do have expected that.&lt;br /&gt;I always used it before I sleep but after brushing my teeth. The first time I used it&#x27;s OK and I felt sour. The next day my teeth feels OK. The second time I tried I felt ache. Maybe that feeling is like you drinking very cold icy water or hot water. You obviously feel something. And it lasts for another day. I tried to used it third time after two days because it claims that 3 times is the minimum to see the result. The third time is worse. The pain lasts longer and I don&#x27;t want to use it anymore. I am not sure my teeth are whitened or not. It may be whitened some sort of degree, but it&#x27;s not obvious to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to use it and I wanted to return it when my teeth hurt. I think this is just not for me.</li>
    <li> Received quickly.  Ordered these strips for myself to help whiten my teeth.  They work very well, and I am well pleased with this product.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am about 5 strips in and my teeth are already significantly whiter.  It says you can see results after 3 days but I honestly saw significant results after 1 use.  I also have sensitive teeth and this didn&#x27;t increase sensitivity (but I do use sensitivity toothpaste).  Great product overall!</li>
    <li> I noticed great results after just a week of use.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s when I started experiencing  tremendous amount of pain.  The pain would begin about 4 hours after use and last about 8 hours.  I tried using them every other day, but the pain persisted.  I still have 10 sets left and probably won&#x27;t use them.  My teeth are significantly whiter, though.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about using Crest White Strips. I used them when they first came out years ago and remembered them sliding off my teeth, tasting horrible, and making my teeth extremely sensitive. After 3 days of using the the 3D Whitestrips with Advanced Seal professional Effects, I have been pleasantly surprised. They stick to my teeth very well and have hardly any taste at all. After the first use, my teeth were a little sensitive but I haven&#x27;t had much sensitivity on days two or three. Instead of using the strips for the full 30 minutes, I have been keeping them on for about 20. And, the box doesn&#x27;t lie... after 3 days I have already noticed results!</li>
    <li> The crest white strips work well but, if you intend to continue drinking coffee and tea you&#x27;ll have to do a touch up once in a while. I found that I only had gum sensitivity if I left them on longer than suggested. You do get better results if you leave them on for a longer time though.</li>
    <li> I used two packets of this product which was 40 strips in all. My smile is beautiful!You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. professional results at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. My teeth are always noticeably whiter following its use and others can see the difference as well. Truly professional effects for a great price!</li>
    <li> It is not difficult to use (you can check youtube for instructions), it stays well on your teeth too. I used this product for a week and started seeing the difference. However, I had to stop because I could not tolerate the teeth pain and the weird taste of it.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve done 7 treatments and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. Keep in mind that I am only 21 so their claim to remove up to 14 years of stains is to my advantage..</li>
    <li> I have been using these for five days now and have nothing but praise for them! I swapped my Colgate whitening toothpaste for some Sensodyne the day before I started using them because I naturally have very sensitive teeth and was worried I would be miserable after using these. So far, I have had no issues with sensitivity and am already seeing a *gradually* whiter smile. I will update if any serious sensitivity issues arise, but so far it seems if you use as directed you should be fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the strips themselves, they&#x27;re easy to use, and stay on well without leaving any weird goop on my teeth afterwards. I&#x27;m also not left with any creepy taste in my mouth as I have been with other whitening systems in the past.</li>
    <li> Not seeing much of a difference. I already used half of the package. I will update this product review</li>
    <li> I had a dentist do my teeth like 4 years ago.  Kept them up with this product.  Maybe once a week.  I KNOW we are all different in terms of our body chemistry, but this product has kept my white up perfectly.  No return to dentist.....I am so heartbroken.</li>
    <li> I so wanted these to work for me. Unfortunately, they made my teeth so sensitive after one use that I couldn&#x27;t use them again. Luckily, I gave them to a friend, and she says she does not have this issue.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a change in my teeth at all. I used to whole box, as directed and did not see at change.</li>
    <li> All i want to say is ..... Great experience! Very fast delivery. After I older the product, I received it in next two days! Good condition! Willing to shop next time!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT! Guaranteed to whiten your teeth after the full 20 day routine!</li>
    <li> These things are awesome! They definitely have made my smile brighter and are very convenient to use. Would recommend to anybody.</li>
    <li> They work as expected as far as I can tell so far.</li>
    <li> After my first night of using this, I noticed a difference in whiteness. The strips are super tacky so they stick well to my teeth. I like to brush them with just my toothbrush and water, very lightly before applying the strips. Then I dry my teeth off and put the strips on. I make sure to push and kind of hold the strips onto my teeth to ensure they gel is in every crevice. I&#x27;m only able to use them every other day because I have some sensitivity, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. They work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is not our first package of these, it works great, and we love it! All our family members use it as well and are very pleased with the results. It does leave your teeth feeling sensitive, but then again, Crest has whitening strips for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;We highly recommend this product for anyone who wants whiter teeth and does not want to spend a fortune on pricey procedures.</li>
    <li> Solid product overall. Considering the price and results, I have no complaints. My teeth were noticeably whiter after using the product, I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter and have stayed white.  I will use it again.  I notice the white teeth each time I look in the mirror.</li>
    <li> this version is so much better than the original that slid all over the place.  It stays put and I can leave it on while im at work and actually chat with people.  Great product whitens really quick.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, already having had my teeth &amp;#34;whitened&amp;#34; through a dentist 10 years ago.  But the Whitestrips really worked!  Easy to apply, for me, the last hour before going to bed.  Within 3-4 days I could already see a difference in the mirror.  And by the end of 3 weeks, there was definitely a worthwhile improvement.  I&#x27;m going to get the &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; kit in about 6 months.</li>
    <li> after using these i always get complements on how white my teeth are. I tend to keep them on a little longer than suggested.</li>
    <li> Great price for teeth whitening</li>
    <li> I have sensitive gums and tried this specific product following the advice of my dentist. Since this is a gradual whitening process that takes 20 days I never felt any gum irritation. The strips are easy to apply and the results are as good as any professional treatment without spending $500+ and sitting in your dentist’s office for hours.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using whitestrips.  I was a bit skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on more white products that promised to work but didn&#x27;t (toothpaste, mouth rinses, etc.).  Since I found a good deal on these whitestrips, decided to give it a go and I am now on Day 5 and getting compliments from my kids who did not know I was using them.  My teeth were yellow, I didn&#x27;t like smiling, but now I&#x27;ve been doing the smiley dance in the mirror.  My teeth were already sensitive, and by the 7th hour after taking the strips off my teeth will throb for about 5 hours tops, then the pain goes away, but it&#x27;s not that unbearable toothache pain that has you reaching for the meds, at least not for me.  Yesterday (Day 4) my teeth didn&#x27;t throb like they usually do, just an ache here or there, so I&#x27;m hoping that is the end of it.  If not, I can bear it till I reach that level of whiteness.  The strips stay on and don&#x27;t slide off.  I can also talk with them on, but I prefer not to. I use Sensodyne toothpaste, and as always I stay away from very cold food.  Thanking the Lord I finally found something that works!</li>
    <li> I have used Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects whenever I noticed that my teeth were looking dull or slightly discolored from coffee or tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works as advertised and I would highly recommend it to someone looking to enhance the appearance of their smile. Other reviewers have mentioned they were not satisfied with their purchase; the results they received weren&#x27;t ideal for them. Procter &amp; Gamble will either refund your money or send you another complimentary box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it&#x27;s an excellent product if you follow the directions and avoid coffee,tea,etc. I used it around Christmas of last year and received compliments from many friends and family members. Trust me, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Give it a try and if you&#x27;re not totally satisfied, you&#x27;re covered.</li>
    <li> This morning was the second day. WoW! It&#x27;s deffinately Crest&#x27;s best whitening kit they have for retail as I&#x27;ve used thier lower priced kit,Rembrant and a $350 Dentist&#x27;s Kit which all of them took the entire package to do JUST an ok job. I will say that the $350 kit I used from the dentist has been the worst kit I&#x27;ve used. Dentist&#x27;s like to take a mold of your teeth and make you feel like this does some kind of magic making thier whitening product work better than Crest&#x27;s ... it doesn&#x27;t and I know plently of you have seen terrible results like this. Follow my direction below and I will save you $300! The only good part of the mold of your teeth and using the gels is that you get more coverage to your rear teeth but \\&quot;IF\\&quot; you do my routine below, you&#x27;ll have healthy back teeth that are white enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula Crest uses in this product doesn&#x27;t irratate my gums or make them feel that nerve type of tingle that&#x27;s annoying which I&#x27;ve experienced with all whitening kits. Because there hasn&#x27;t been irritation like I described, I&#x27;ve been waring them for 40 minutes instead of 30 minutes as I was afraid they were either too old or were not working. Nope! This product works better than the $350 kit and the others mentioned above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to add that I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in over 8 years and I&#x27;m 35 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line PEOPLE is that you can&#x27;t stick your toothbrsh in your mouth just for 30-60 seconds in the morning and 30-60 seconds at night and think that your teeth are going to to just be as white as a babys and you&#x27;re gums are going to be healthy as well!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had coffee stains in between my teeth about 5 years ago and I thought my teeth were rotting out. I brushed for about 2 minutes twice a day but I never worked the toothpaste into my teeth because I always applied the toothpaste to the toothbrush&#x27;s brissles. That&#x27;s the wrong way to do it and after I thought about the process of 30 years of brushing my teeth, I changed my way of doing the job as explained below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st ... apply a liberal amount of toothpaste to the tip of your tongue and allow your tongue to apply the toothpaste to every part of all of your teeth, front and back pushing the toothpaste in between your teeth. You can even let the toothpaste just sit on your teeth for 30-60 seconds before brushing. This is the only way to make use of all the toothpaste instead of having that toothpaste being pushed to the bottom of your brissles which difficult to wash out, if you wash it all out at all when done brushing.  How do you suppose your toothbrush can dry properly if you have toothpaste stuck to the bottom the brissles? It can&#x27;t and that in itself breed bacteria because it can&#x27;t dry. Do you really like sticking that toothbrush in your mouth seeing this mornings old toothpaste still on it?  Of course you don&#x27;t and if you do, then somethings wrong with you!  So apply the toothpaste to the tip of your tongue, not to the tooth brush&#x27;s brissles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then take your toothbrush (I use a medium Colgate) and slowly work those brissles in between each tooth feeling the brissles actually going in between each tooth and into your gum line. It&#x27;s not a race! I get sick of seeing ppl brush thier teeth like it&#x27;s a 50k Sprint! I do not understand how these people think that brushing your teeth at 100 MPH for 20 seconds does the job!?!?!  This is a major reason people have bad breath and teeth that look like the person is doing meth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you floss once a day after you brush your teeth and before you use your mouthwash and don&#x27;t make that a race either. You really got to work that floss (I use the waxed REACH Cinnamon brand) like you&#x27;re buffing the finish on your new paint job and don&#x27;t forget to get into the gumline. How can you buff a tooth with anything but the waxed floss?  The string type just removes debris and the tape floss just folds up. Either way use floss once a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse with a mouth wash twice a day (I use Listerine or generic and I like it HOT!!!). I don&#x27;t believe the non alcohol rinses do the same good job as the alcohol rinses. I look at the ingredients. Either way, use a mouthwash of some sort. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed about mouthwashes is that the dyes in them can leave your teeth slighlty stained so I recommend you switch your colors of mouth wash each time you buy a new bottle. One month I&#x27;ll use cool mint, the next cinnamon, the next the yellow one, etc. I wish they&#x27;d make a clear Listerine that had the alcohol in it like Crest&#x27;s Clear non-alcohol mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use your mouthwash, DON&#x27;T make that a 10 second race either. Use as directed which is usually for 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;IF\\&quot; and I SAY \\&quot;IF\\&quot; YOU use Crest&#x27;s 3D Toothpaste and do what I explain to you for 10 days, it&#x27;ll look like you have a new grill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN AND ONLY THEN ..... after the 1st ten days of your new brushing,flossing and rinsing routine have started then use these Crest WHite Strips and it&#x27;ll look like you went to a Hollywood Dentist and paid $1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:!!!! If you are not a regular floss user flossing daily like I explain above and you don&#x27;t brush your teeth properly like I explain how to above or use mouthwash twice a day like I explained above ..... then ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest waiting 30-45 days after doing the above proper way of brushing/flossing/rinsing routine BEFORE using the Crest White Strips because your gums need to get used to being flossed properly and brushed properly.  If your gums are not healthy, don&#x27;t expect to put any whitening strips on and not have your gums get irritated with the nerve tingling feeling which is very uncomfortable. If you can&#x27;t handle the the stips for 30 minutes as directed DON&#x27;T EXPECT THE PRODUCT TO WORK!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggest using this kit 2-3 times a year \\&quot;IF\\&quot; YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOUTH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them for 8 days in a row. I can&#x27;t see how my teeth can get any whiter so I&#x27;m using the rest as a touch-up which I&#x27;m doing by using one package once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2-5-2012&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying this product for a 2nd time. I have a months worth of Hawaii time coming and I will use half of the stips to make sure my smile is Hollywood perfect!wice a day (I use Listerine or generic and I like it HOT!!!).

    <li> Good and it actually works but causes teeth sensitivity! Overall, ppl noticed the difference and I&#x27;m happy with the results! But I&#x27;m looking for something that would improve my teeth sensitivity since I didn&#x27;t have it before!</li>
    <li> I have \\&quot;whitened\\&quot; my teeth with a couple of different brands over the last several years. There was a coupon on Amazon and so I decided to try this. AWESOME!! My teeth were much whiter than ever before, and they stay on so well compared to the other Crest stips I have used. I bought it for my daughter, it was her first time using strips and she loved them as well. I cant think of any negatives.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, i must say that i love this product. it&#x27;s suitable for me and i love it. Would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Works well for an over the counter product, but it is no substitute for professional whitening. I would only buy this again with a great coupon.</li>
    <li> I gave this product only 4 stars for the tooth sensitivity.  I can see my teeth getting whiter but takes longer than the 3 days because my teeth are so sensitive afterward that I can only use once every other day instead of the recommended twice a day for 30 minutes.  My dental assistant friend suggested using a sensitive toothpaste while whitening and I may give that a shot.  Overall, though, there is a difference and I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but makes teeth super sensitive for days</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as described. I have extremely sensitive teeth and find I can use this product only every other day to avoid pain associated with sensitivity. I hope noticed a slight difference in color even after 5 uses (every other day)</li>
    <li> Best whitening strips I have ever used, having been significantly self conscious about the shade of my teeth I decided to purchase some more expensive strips and bite the bullet on budget whitening.&lt;br /&gt;The results were clear after a full set of 14 strips.&lt;br /&gt;They stick well to the teeth and do not leave an unpleasant taste or leak extra goo on your teeth!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product, it was everything I expected it to be after reading many reviews. I have applied about 10 treatments and I am very satisfied with my improvement. At this time, I will discontinue use of the product as it makes my teeth VERY sensitive for about a day.</li>
    <li> Great product that whitens your teeth several shades teh first time you use it.  It lasts a long time also. The strips I find are easy to place and give you the kind of white you want your teeth to show.  I would purchase this product again as it is far less expensive than buying at retail or pharmaceutical stores.</li>
    <li> makes my bottom teeth sensitive. leave white spot on my teeth, other than that, my teeth are three shade lighter</li>
    <li> I was only able to use one out of the 14 applications due to the intense teeth sensitivity that this product caused.  If you are interested in teeth whitening, go the professional route.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel very sensitive after using this product. However, it does work. You can almost instantly see your teeth get brighter even after first use. Be patient and keep using it for some time and you will definitely see results. I personally use them once a week or so just because of the sensitivity. That is the only reason why I gave this product a 4 star review.</li>
    <li> They work but make my teeth hurt.  I had wait two days between each treatment.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after a few uses but my teeth were unbearably sensitive so I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the whole box</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations. My teeth are much whiter. The strips are easy to put on and take off and they are comfortable to wear. My teeth were slightly sensitive but after skipping a day and then resuming use of the whitening strips I didn&#x27;t have any more problems with sensitivity. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had noticed that over the years my smile wasn&#x27;t quite as bright, and at a recent dental cleaning appointment, my hygienist asked if I was interested in whitening (politely, but I decided to think about it).  After looking around and reading reviews I decided to give the Crest 3D Professional effects Whitestrips a try.  I picked up this package, the toothpaste and mouthwash and have been using them as directed for the last 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i had taken a set of before pictures, but after one day using the strips twice as directed, brushing, flossing and using the mouthwash there was a noticable difference.  I am on day three, and while I think I sense a slight amount of increased temperature sensitivity the effects have been pretty dramatic.  I am very pleased with the results so far. I&#x27;ll definitely recommend giving this product a try to friends and family before they go spending ten times as much for a professional whitening procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly! When it was delivered, the box looked like it had been run over by a train.  All the strips seemed fine.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. However, I believe that the results are variable. I&#x27;ll try another box before I really make up my mind</li>
    <li> I got a sample of Crest 3D White Whitestrips.  It came with one upper and one lower strip.  They&#x27;re pretty pricey, even with the $10 coupon included in my package.  They&#x27;re very easy to use.  Just brush your teeth, dry them off, peel off the strips and apply them tightly to your upper and lower teeth.  The directions state to leave them on for 30 minutes.  Since I have crooked teeth it was hard to be sure I got every tooth covered, but the strips are very sticky, so it wasn&#x27;t too difficult.  I wore them while I did some work online and found that they made my mouth more watery than usual.  They also taste like peroxide.  For anyone who&#x27;s used the tooth whitening gels you&#x27;ll know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took the strips off I was left with some product residue on my teeth, but I just rinsed my mouth and it came right off.  One tooth felt especially sensitive after using this product, which bugged me for a few hours.  What about the whitening?  My teeth did seem slightly whiter after one use, though the package clearly states that better results are seen after three uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they worth the price?  Well, they&#x27;re much cheaper than having the dentist do it and the strips are much less messy than the gels, they also work faster than the whitening toothpastes.  The website also states that they&#x27;re safe for teeth and won&#x27;t wear down the enamel.  If you really want white teeth I would highly recommend the Crest 3D White Whitestrips since they&#x27;re fast and convenient.  However, don&#x27;t expect super white teeth right away.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t terribly optimistic about how well these would work. I only bought them since they were on sale and decided to give them a shot. I recently quit smoking and was giving myself a kind of \\&quot;bodily makeover\\&quot;, but I don&#x27;t have infinite funds to spend and can&#x27;t afford a professional job. I&#x27;m only about halfway through the carton and I have better results already than I expected- which was little to none. But they aren&#x27;t without their pitfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upsides: you do see results fairly quickly and they aren&#x27;t a big problem in terms of time to use them or very difficult to use and comfortable enough to wear. I only had a couple of times where they folded in on themselves while I was applying and had to pull them apart a little wet, but they were still usable. I dry my teeth with a piece of cotton and brush/floss just before I apply to make sure there isn&#x27;t anything in the way of good adhesion. A word of warning, once they are stuck, they are stuck. It&#x27;s not easy to reposition them after they are pressed onto your teeth, so you have to do it right the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides: they can cause some sensitivity and gum irritation. I personally didn&#x27;t find it too troublesome and the tooth sensitivity faded after a few days even while continuing to use them. As I understand it, not everyone has the same experience and it is too bothersome for some people to continue use. My gums are a bit irritated in spots, but honestly I&#x27;ve lost track of time on a few occasions when wearing them and had them in a lot longer than recommended. So had I only worn them for the recommended 30 minutes, that might not be such a problem. On the other hand, that showed how comfortable they can be, if I could totally forget about them for well over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can be difficult to get in between the teeth. I usually use a fingernail to push them between my teeth a bit. I&#x27;ve noticed that where there isn&#x27;t good direct contact like between teeth and right at the gumline, it is less white. Also, I have flourodosis spots on my teeth. So my teeth naturally have a lot of white splotches and while these help to blend those in better, they will not go away- something I vaguely hoped for, but didn&#x27;t expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that when I have bad dry mouth, they are more uncomfortable to use. I initially thought I could wear them while on my treadmill and that didn&#x27;t fly. The exertion combined with these odd tasting plastic sheets on my teeth and needing to drink lots of water, just wasn&#x27;t going to work and was really uncomfortable. You can sip water during use, but I&#x27;ve found a good sized gulp will destroy the adhesion and taste terrible. Considering the cost, you don&#x27;t really want to waste any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, don&#x27;t expect perfectly bright white teeth like you would see in a commercial and I&#x27;m not confident it is truly \\&quot;professional level whitening\\&quot; in a box. In fact, those are usually either caps or veneers- in other words, they aren&#x27;t even real teeth. If you have any artificial dental work, these won&#x27;t change the color of it, you will need replacement for that. Also, it will depend on what you are starting with as to how white they will get. If you are starting with heavily stained teeth from years of smoking, coffee and soda drinking, etc., you might just want to pop for the professional job at the dentist&#x27;s office since this will only take them up a few shades. On that note, I was told by a dentist friend that post professional whitening, one should avoid the big teeth stainers- cigarettes, coffee, dark teas and sodas for 2 weeks. Otherwise, you tend to reverse all the work that was done. In order to try and get the best results I can, I&#x27;ve been avoiding all those during use, so that could be helping to get better results, I can&#x27;t be sure. I&#x27;d rather go overboard and get better results than risk not getting the most for my money because of something that could have been easily avoided. And it doesn&#x27;t cost a cent to avoid those things. Annoying perhaps, but monetarily speaking, that is something you can do at home without  spending a dime or second of your time and there are other obvious health benefits to cutting out those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also using the Crest 3D white toothpaste prior to using this product and will continue to do so. It has a minor effect, but takes a very long time for even slight results. That also might be increasing results somewhat, but again, I can&#x27;t be sure. I just figure it can&#x27;t hurt. You still have to brush anyway, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the product works, just don&#x27;t expect that a do-it-yourself carton is going to make your teeth look like a movie star&#x27;s. If that is truly what you&#x27;re after and any less is a disappointment, see a cosmetic dentist for an all over professional job and you&#x27;ll likely need some artificial work done since very few people have such perfect or white teeth naturally.o avoid those things.

    <li> I&#x27;m a white smile obsessive.  I&#x27;ve done Zoom! whitening twice in this decade (clearly, its results are not lasting, but it does get teeth really white).  I&#x27;ve always had great success with Crest Whitestrips and this version is as good if not better.  It gets my teeth just as white as Zoom whitening, although not as fast.  Because it works more gradually, ppl may not necessarily think they get their teeth as white as a professional whitening, but my personal opinion is that it is just as effective when used as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first complaint is that the effect of the Crest Whitestrips wore off more quickly on me (after a few months) than professional whitening (after a year and a half?).  My second complaint is that I have serious teeth sensitivity when using this product (i don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth), which makes it sometimes slightly painful to follow the whitening schedule as proscribed.  If you do have sensitive teeth, I would definitely caution against using this product; but if you do, I would do it very slowly.  I also had teeth sensitivity with Zoom Whitening, but it wasn&#x27;t as lasting.  However, on my second Zoom treatment, I got severe burns on my gums which were waaay more painful (and ugly) than the teeth sensitivity ever was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll trade the pain and the extra high cost for the affordable and effective Crest Whitestrips.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I think the strips worked pretty well. My teeth do seem to be whiter. My only complaint is the strips are too short, especially the lower one. They don&#x27;t cover enough of the teeth. You can identify people who have used these strips - their front teeth are white, but the others remain stained. Crest should make the strips longer.</li>
    <li> Works never had teeth whitening. Really brightened up my smile.</li>
    <li> I was really unsure about this but I finished product. Let me say this changed my life. You really have nothing to lose! I will definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> it was great but painful :(</li>
    <li> Item came as stated, nothing missing which was nice. Sealed brand new. This really works! If you go to the Crest website, you can sometimes find $10 rebate which will come in the form of a Visa gift card.</li>
    <li> omg my teeth hurt and i had to stop using it... i am not kidding.. don&#x27;t buy it.. just go to the dentist</li>
    <li> Didnt see any difference and my teeth got very sensitive .</li>
    <li> Everyone says my teeth look so white, you have a beautiful smile, what perfect teeth.  Thank you Crest.  They are easy to apply and sometimes I wear them to bed.  I am waiting for crest to make them longer to cover my back teeth.  I use two packs to make sure I get all my teeth white and white and clean is what I mean.</li>
    <li> Worked well even though I wasn&#x27;t consistent with it because I didn&#x27;t want my teeth to get too sensitive. I would recommend trying this if you want slightly whiter teeth!</li>
    <li> These strips are easy to use, gentle and effective. I am sure I would recommend these to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect, think I didn&#x27;t get the full effect because I am tea &amp; coffee addict. Generally it&#x27;s good product</li>
    <li> I used this product for 20 days and my teeth definitely came out more white than before.  They do though create some sensitive around the gum and the physical teeth.  They also leave a sticky residue on the teeth, it can be wiped or rinse pretty quickly.  I recommend brushing your teeth and then waiting 30 minutes before applying the stripes then after I would brush again to get rid of taste, stickiness and residue.  Here is my video review on youtube: [...]</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Only slight whitening with major sensitivity.  The cost is expensive.  I found it better to go to my dentist and get teeth trays made with a $40.00 bleaching product that DOES NOT create sensitivity.  It&#x27;s called Rock Star and it&#x27;s a dental bleach for teeth.</li>
    <li> ok took a few applications in order to see the effects.</li>
    <li> My teeth are very straight, so I get a good fit and therefore good results. Once they are on, they immediately begin to work (you can see them foaming if you smile at yourself).  That said, getting rid of all stains in between teeth may be an issue, if the strips cannot adhere well due to teeth not being straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used the first time, I recommend using them as indicated, although this will make your teeth sensitive. I do not typically have any trouble with sensitivity, and using these as directed made my teeth ache with sensitivity--so just be aware of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I keep a box in my bathroom and use a top/bottom set once or twice a month for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, everyone is different, so results will vary. I am very happy with these. Been using them for over 10 yrs, and the newer fit is a definite improvement. I can take a drink of water or read to my kids while using them, and they don&#x27;t slip at all. In fact, you have to tug to get them off when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Crest whitening toothpaste (unless my teeth are sensitive) in between treatments. Using these, along with obsessively good dental hygiene, keeps my teeth looking great! :)</li>
    <li> Not for even the not so sensitive teeth!  These strips make your teeth hurt down to the root.  Super painful, and the strips have so much adhesive, I feel like none of the gel actually works through your teeth.</li>
    <li> Since my teeth were a little white I did not see that much of a difference but I used them before events or pictures and it made my teeth look pearl white. My friends noticed too. I liked it (:</li>
    <li> The first night they were fine but the next night my teeth began to tingle, throughout the day. it was very annoying and a bit painful. If you think you have sensitive teeth, dont get them.</li>
    <li> Having previously purchased earlier versions of Crest White Strips, I found this version to be surprisingly much better than the ones I&#x27;ve previously purchased. It&#x27;s been the 4th day and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference. The strips are different sizes to create a better more snug fit for the upper and lower rows of teeth.  It is much more adhesive than the original versions.  It doesn&#x27;t slip or slide around after you have applied it.  It also doesn&#x27;t irritate the gum line as much.  It did make my teeth slightly sensitive after the first two days of using it. However I just switched to every other day and the sensitivity goes away.</li>
    <li> I gave two stars b/c my teeth started aching n became very sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using crest vivid white strips on and off for several years. I was glad to see all of the different types of them on amazon! For a little cheaper then in the stores. I wanted to try the professional effects whitestrips to see if they worked quicker or had better results then crest vivid whitestrips. I did see results after three days. Much quicker then vivid white. I can&#x27;t see a huge difference between the two types except for the better grip on the professional effects whitestrips. After you put them on you really have to pull them to remove. I&#x27;m just not sure that it&#x27;s worth an extra $10-$20. If they were cheaper I&#x27;d probably buy them more often. If your looking for quick results this may be it! Just be aware that using them too often can cause tooth sensitivity and pain. A good toothpaste for sensitive teeth couldn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> It really does make your teeth whiter after a few days. It does state in the instructions do not brush your teeth directly after!! And they are serious DO NOT!! The paste will feel weird on your teeth just swish water around and it will come off.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product three times and I am already starting to notice the whiteness of my teeth coming back. The whitening strips are really comfortable compared to any other teeth whitening product. You can even drink water while whitening your teeth! It&#x27;s worth the money especially if your teeth have been stained from drinking too much tea.</li>
    <li> Truly does wonder for my teeth. I have bought this product about 3 times before. Def keeps my pearly whites, whites! I get so many compliments on my smile :)</li>
    <li> I have used three treatments and my coffee-stained teeth have definitely had the most DRAMATIC change! I accidentally left mine on for about 45 minutes today and I did feel a little pain/soreness in my lower gums, but the sensitivity did not change and the pain has become almost unnoticeable after a few minutes. The best part about this product is that it reminds you to brush your teeth! I use my treatments at night or morning in the shower and it reminds me to brush my teeth after I take it off. Overall, great experience!</li>
    <li> I noticed slightly brighter teeth. BUT i am in so much pain right now while i write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the strip in early this morning and in the afternoon the sensitivity of my teeth kicks in and i am getting minor headaches from my teeth hurting so bad.....</li>
    <li> Just bought them off of amazon, first timer, looks good, was very easy to put on, only did one treatment, looks like maybe its better to put them on when its night time, so less food/beverages are consumed. Will update back after a full 20 treatments or so!</li>
    <li> Works very well! Easy to use! I didnt experience any sensitivity at all, i just followed the instructions. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I used these a few years back and it was time to clear up the stains on my teeth again.  It does it&#x27;s job.  Only wish the were a little longer, so the cover more of the side teeth, which show when I smile.</li>
    <li> I love these things. I think they work better then most also. The very slight discomfort is easily manageable. I will order these again.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought them for my son. He has been using them for 2-3 months. I see a big differents in his teeth and he loves them.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price work really great</li>
    <li> Product was as described.  Product was not old, (as is occasionally a concern when purchasing certain items).  These whitestrips work best for me as far as delivering the quickest whitening without the pain other then some minor tenderness but not enough to keep me from using the product or receiving the results they delivered.  Was delivered timely.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> They whiten my teeth fairly well! But i did have pretty bad sensitivity after using them 3 times in 5 days.</li>
    <li> I have yet to try the product but I felt impelled to write a review immediately upon receiving my package. The box was somewhat crushed and once I opened it I was appalled to see that the actual Crest package looked as though someone had beat it with a baseball bat. I am very disappointed in the company and it&#x27;s shipping choices, I will not be ordering this product again from them.</li>
    <li> I just received my 3d strips in the mail and after counting them over and over again I am very annoyed to see there are only 19 strips not 20 which is very strange since I payed for 20 strips and it also says on box that&#x27;s there is 20 strips inside</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOVE these. They work amazingly. My teeth were not horrible yellow, but definitely noticeable. Now my teeth are really white and I just love them. Will definitely  be using again in the future. Why pay a fortune getting professional teeth clean when these work just as well, it may take longer but well worth it, and definitely happy with the price!!!</li>
    <li> Having never used any type of teeth whitening products before, I had no idea what to expect, especially since other reviews I read were somewhat mixed. I was looking for something to reduce the yellow look of my teeth and by the end of my 20 strips, I have to say that I am impressed with the outcome. Of course, my kids thought I looked silly wearing the plastic strips around the house but that&#x27;s the price we pay for beauty! They stayed on well and I accidentally wore them all night a couple of times, which is when I could notice the biggest difference in whitening and in mouth pain. The pain for me was in my lip area and not so much in the gums or teeth. When I wore them for the 30 minute recommended time, I had no pain at all - and I have two teeth with deep worn spots at the gum line that the strips covered up. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have any pictures but my family noticed and that&#x27;s enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the dentist could probably do a little better with their stronger formulas, but I am cheap and $38 is better than 10 times that amount, once they upsell you on everything. From what I can tell, peroxide is peroxide, so the basic concept is the same. Besides, this also fits my schedule much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: For some reason, the instructions hide a little note saying that they should be used BEFORE brushing your teeth - something I didn&#x27;t see until about 2/3 of the way through. Why? I don&#x27;t know, but maybe I would have had even better results if I would have sone that from the beginning.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim a month and a half ago. Used it according to the instructions but I peeled them strips off a little faster because I felt some sensitivity. Eventually I built it up but the sensitivity did not decrease. I have bad teeth so probably thats why.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth whitened considerabely, not shiny white but clean white :) At a fraction of the cost, this is a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;What I didnt like is that the strips leave the back teeth unwhitened and caused some sensitivity (may differ for different people)</li>
    <li> I would make positive referral relating to the seller to other consumers as well as for a good product in the market (Crest 3D Professional Effects). Great service and a good price. Thumps up</li>
    <li> Prior to this product I used a 22% gel with trays that I bought on line and it worked great.. and gotta say these strips work almost as good and theres no major dripping of gel or foam and they are less expensive.  What i do, and it not conventional is that i sleep with the strips on.  These work great because the adhesive is strong. ( the earlier  generation of strips would come loose and lets just say i never found them )  I end up using these for 3 times a week for 3 weeks in a row.  Then just maybe once every three weeks to maintain the whiteness.  I consistently have people asking me how i get my teeth so white so they must work.  Using them this way  - one box of 20 lasts me about a year.  But when i do use them they are on at least 4- 5 hours while i sleep and i notice my teeth def look whiter when i get up in the morning.  I have had no side effects or gum trouble...im sure poeple with sensitve teeth may have a problem tho.. so for me spending about 35-40$ a year for white teeth is a no brainer....  I have only used the pro effects ones... so not sure if the less expensive regular strength would work as good..</li>
    <li> product came as described and on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be mindful this is professional grade whitening... the box says 30 min a day but the instructions inside say 1 hr for the whitest... just keep in mind the longer you keep it in, the more likely you are to experience tooth sensitivity.  I learned this the hard way.  but it works great</li>
    <li> I used these every day before my shower, so it works right into my daily routine and in no time my teeth were celebrity white. I love the compliments I get about my smile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to whiten/brighten my teeth and nothing has ever worked....until now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive - but worth it!!  And couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a difference in the whitening! But I have emi-sensative teeth &amp; I could only use half the package even using them every other day.. they made my teeth hurt too much to use them. I even waited two weeks after I had used half of them &amp; the next time I used them they still made them hurt. Granted one of the times I used them I fell asleep with them on for 3 hrs so that probably screwed everything up. But overall if my teeth weren&#x27;t so sensative I think my teeth would be a durastically whiter color.</li>
    <li> They really work! I definitely see a difference in my smile. The only &#x27;warning&#x27; I&#x27;ll give is to not wear them for more than a half hour at a time (the suggested time). I did that once by mistake and they made my teeth really sensitive for a day or two.</li>
    <li> Some crest strips were stuck in the packaging and hard to separate. Otherwise, same Crest results at a good price.</li>
    <li> Your teeth don&#x27;t become perfectly white overnight...but do the time, and you will see results!  There has been a significant difference in the 2 weeks that I have been using them.</li>
    <li> I know that teeth sensitiveness is to be expected, so I am not going to go over it and complain. There is no gain without some sacrifices. But in general, it&#x27;s very good product and works pretty well and fast. I like the fact that strips cling to your teeth and don&#x27;t slide off. The last version of the strips I had I literally had to hold with my lips. So this is a great improvement. I&#x27;ve noticed the visible results after about 2 sessions so it&#x27;s well worth the money and a bit of discomfort.</li>
    <li> product&#x27;s claim that you&#x27;ll notice difference in 3 days was spot on! And in 20 days achieved cleaner whiter teeth.  I was happy with the outcome.</li>
    <li> Absolutely did not work on me!  I was so disappointed :(  After reading so many great reviews.  I was hoping for at least a small change but nothing :(</li>
    <li> My daughter uses these and has pearly whites.  Strips do not make her teeth sensitive.  They are quick and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I had been debating using these strips for well over a year now, because I was concerned over teeth sensitivity.  Finally, I decided to give it a try.  I put the strip on shortly after I wake up and before brushing my teeth, since I have heard that they adhere better if you don&#x27;t brush before hand.  This may serve to reduce its effects, but I would rather be patient with it than suffer extreme sensitivity.  But, even despite not brushing before hand I was still able to see some results after 3 days.  On the fourth day I decided to switch to every other day treatment since after the third day I did notice some mild sensitivity.  Overall, very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try this sooner.  This product really works.  Sometimes, it was hard to see the difference, but I think that is because I was looking at my teeth every day.  Once I was done (I used 2 packages), the difference was remarkable.  It didn&#x27;t give me \\&quot;movie star\\&quot; white teeth, but the change is very noticeable.  I never used to smile with my mouth open, and now I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience some pain in one area of my gums after a few days of use, so I stopped for a day, and then started again.  A few times, I had sensitivity in my front 4 bottom teeth, so I stopped using the strips until the sensitivity subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was great.</li>
    <li> works, does it;s job,  i actually have white teeth already but does make it whiter. pleased with this product. worth a try!</li>
    <li> I definitely did not expect it to work this well. I read reviews on how this makes the teeth very sensitive. I already had sensitive teeth and from time to time it did make my TOOTH ache. but not all my teeth. only 1 or 2 of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I saw immediate results in a matter of a week!!! I CAN&#x27;T STOP SMILING OH MY GAH</li>
    <li> Affordable then buying locally. Works great and received product in a timely manner. Will be ordering again from the same Vendor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used three of my whitestrips so far, and already notice a difference in the color of my teeth. The product foams up while on your teeth, and it feels weird at first. I had a bit of difficulty securing the bottom strip on my teeth. I wish it had a touch of mint flavoring to cover the peroxide taste. All in all, I&#x27;d buy these again!</li>
    <li> The 3D whitstrips work great. They stay on your teeth. U canh drink with them in and they don&#x27;t slip.&lt;br /&gt;This is a creat product highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product showed up in a timely manner and these things work!!! Everyone is asking what I&#x27;m using to whiten my teeth. Try IT!!!</li>
    <li> These work. I never had an issue with sensitivity but during the 30 minutes i had the strips on i would have sporadic bursts of intense pain about the size of a needle head on my teeth. This would only happen maybe 3-4 times per strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are whiter though and that’s what i wanted.</li>
    <li> Noticed whiter teeth within a week...am continuing white strips to maintain and possibly further whitening of teeth...easy to use...good product.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have used an earlier version of the crest white strips and had problems with them slipping out of place.  These new white strips do not slip out of place, and fit quite comfortably on my teeth.  This is a great price for a great buy!</li>
    <li> This product worked OK for me. Did not notised any sign of professional effects on my teeth. Do not worth money I paid for. The cheeper whitestrips I used before worked the same way.</li>
    <li> My sister was visiting and using this system, so I got to see it in action before I committed myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within 3 days, I was surprised not so much by whitening as by a new \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; in my smile. I drink a lot of black tea and have been willing to put up with darker teeth, but I didn&#x27;t realize how dull and matte-looking my teeth had become until I saw the sparkle in the mirror a few days after starting the Whitestrips treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Sensodyne toothpaste to help with tooth sensitivity, and the Whitestrips didn&#x27;t bother me at all. The improvement has been noticeable. My teeth are much whiter now -- but not unnaturally so, as with some professional whitening -- at less than 10% of the cost of professional whitening. This form of treatment is within my budget and surprised me by how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The follow-up strips, [[ASIN:B00336EUTU Crest 3D White Whitestrips 5 Minute Touch-Ups With Stain Shield, 28-count Carton]], haven&#x27;t made a noticeable difference, but I&#x27;m inclined to keep using both, since I trust the product now. Be aware that the gel on the 5 Minute Touch-Ups is much less adhesive and needs to be applied more carefully to keep the strip from moving around.</li>
    <li> it does seem to whiten significantly, but i have yet to finish the whole box due to sensitivity on some days. i find it better to use it at night, so the sensitivity might wear off by morning.</li>
    <li> maybe i have sensitive teeth, so i feel hurt after using this, probably more than 5hours, but it actually whiten my teeth, I use this for 4 days only and then stop, because it hurts my teeth so bad!</li>
    <li> These seemed to work pretty well - definitely an improvement; maybe not quite as white as I had hoped for but better than they were.</li>
    <li> These worked great. Could definitely tell the difference after I finished the box. Don&#x27;t recommend if you have very sensitive teeth. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, and it was sort of intense when I was almost done with the treatment. Very happy and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> this is hands down the best whitening product i&#x27;ve come across, i saw result within the first three days, the strips were comfortable to wera and stood in place., i experienced minor sensitivity but nothing crazy or unbearable.  i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These white strips caused pain and mouth sores within days of using them.  I have never had problems with sensitivity before, but after using these less than a week the teeth covered by the strips feel overly sensitive, and I&#x27;ve even had blisters pop up on my gums above my upper front teeth.  I have never experienced anything like this, and am worried I may have damaged both the enamel on my teeth and my gums.  I can&#x27;t believe this product is described as \\&quot;Enamel Safe.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was very excited about whitening my teeth and thought I would try the crest 3d, so I bought the professional effects.  It was a mistake.  I never new I had sensitive teeth until I used this product. I could only use one whitestrip because as soon as I took it off my teeth were so sensitive and painful.  I did notice that my teeth were whiter though, wish I could have used the whole box.</li>
    <li> Great product, I had my doubts about its effectiveness but after finishing my box up I can safely say this stuff works, and well at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Whitens nicely, I had dull yellow teeth before, now they&#x27;re white. Not eye-blinding white, but white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t taste bad like some of them do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using these, my teeth hurt like hell. Every time I yawned it felt like needles were poking my gums. Thankfully that only lasted for two days and I only had a little bit of sensitivity near my gums later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packages are kind of dumb. I almost ripped one of the strips because the &#x27;tear line&#x27; is so close to them.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing i did a fair amount of research. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results of this product, and would definitely recommend trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips stayed on my teeth effortlessly, and I did not experience any problems with sensitivity.  I was already happy with the results after 10 strips...</li>
    <li> I would give this product 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t cause my teeth to become so sensitive! If you have teeth that are the tiniest bit sensitive, I don&#x27;t recommend this, only because it will cause your teeth to be 20x worse.  Even without eating or drinking, my teeth were feeling sore after 3 uses only.&lt;br /&gt;However, the whitening effects are extremely noticeable, even after only 3 uses.  You also don&#x27;t taste any chemicals, and they don&#x27;t slide around on your teeth,</li>
    <li> Best pricing on these I have found anywhere. They work as described. Teeth were whiter than ever when I was done with treatments!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually upset with my experience, I did have little discomfort some days, especially in the first few days. I used the strips every day and then every other day as my strips ran out. This product did not noticeably whiten my teeth. I feel as if they look the same as what I started with. I would like to see if maybe another box would do more of a job but it is kind of expensive when you&#x27;re not seeing the results you expected.</li>
    <li> its super strong and made my tooth super sensitive</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express how thrilled I am knowing of this product. I&#x27;m an uber insecure teenager who had yellow teeth for reasons my younger self regrets. Take note: HAD. Long story short, it made my banana colored teeth to a more decent color. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Whitestrips before, around 10 years ago, but had a couple of problems: They didn&#x27;t stick to my teeth reliably, and they gave me painful &amp;#34;zingers&amp;#34; in my teeth. This product is a big improvement. They do grip as advertised (with an exception; see below) and they don&#x27;t give me zingers. Disclosure: I started brushing with Sensodyne because I knew I&#x27;d be using them, so maybe that makes the difference. They do cause slight dull pain in my teeth. I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sticky enough that you will want to brush and rinse after taking them out to get the bleach gel off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whitening, yes, they&#x27;re working. They do require some patience, especially from those who have decades of stains to remove. They are not going to give you the obvious-the-same-day results you get from Zoom whitening in a dentist&#x27;s office. But it&#x27;s a 20-treatment package. If you keep using them for the entire 20 treatments you should see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to be aware of: The thinner parts of your teeth are likely to bleach faster than the thicker parts, so for a while you may have disconcertingly two-toned teeth, part white, part yellow. Just keep using them. The thicker parts will eventually whiten, too. And if like me you have decades of &amp;#34;insults&amp;#34; to bleach out of your teeth (lots and lots of black tea in my case) you need to take the label literally: &amp;#34;Removes 14 years of stains.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m turning 56...  figure my permanent teeth came in when I was 8, so these teeth are 48 years old... but I&#x27;ve used whitening products before... it might take three or four boxes of these things to remove 48 years of accumulated staining. I&#x27;m okay with that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off for manufacturing issues. These problems arose in my first week of treatment: One lower strip simply didn&#x27;t stick, period. Slippery, where all the rest have been sticky, as if it didn&#x27;t get a layer of something it was supposed to get. Another upper strip didn&#x27;t peel off the backing -- the backing came apart and stuck to it, as if the backing had been punched in the same shape. Took a few minutes of wrestling to get the strip off the stiff plastic. Annoying. So far, I&#x27;m getting a manufacturing defect like this about every third packet of strips. That&#x27;s kind of a lot.trip didn&#x27;t peel off the backing -- the backing came apart and stuck to it, as if the backing had been punched in the same shape. Took a few minutes of wrestling to get the strip off the stiff plastic. Annoying. So far, I&#x27;m getting a manufacturing defect like this about every third packet of strips. That&#x27;s kind of a lot.</li>
    <li> Caused me excruciating tooth pain 4 days into it. I stopped for a week and then tried again and the same thing happened. Would never recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> After 3 applications I&#x27;m noticing very little change. Maybe it&#x27;s early and it&#x27;ll take more time. But so far it&#x27;s much less effective than the old discontinued night effects (paint-on) product.I also don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s too short to cover more side teeth. Feels like I end up swallowing a bit of the foam that&#x27;s created from the strips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygiene student and my teacher suggested we all try white strips at least once so we could inform our patients more about them. My teeth were white to begin with so I just used them one time to see what they were like. The taste isn&#x27;t bad and these definitely will not slip out of place. Only bad part is that I have a pretty large smile and they do not cover all of my teeth that are exposed while smiling. I could see it being a problem of your teeth were stained a darker shade and the ones it covered were lightened dramatically. Overall I&#x27;d suggest these.</li>
    <li> I did the 20 day whitening directions and I think it worked.  I don&#x27;t think my teeth were that bad to begin with so it is a possibility I didn&#x27;t notice a big change.  The strips stuck on the teeth decently, you just have to make sure you dry them off a little bit before you stick them on.  After I took them off, they left a weird film on my teeth and a bad aftertaste, so I immediately brushed my teeth (maybe I wasn&#x27;t suppost to do that).  Either way, I don&#x27;t think I will whiten for about a year, and when I do, I think I will try a different brand.  All in all, I think it did what it was suppose to.  For the price, I think I was just expecting better results.</li>
    <li> I have been using these off and on over the years to get that bright, white smile.  I start noticing the results after about 7 treatments and by the time you finish all 20, your teeth are bright white.  I usually do the treatment once a year.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, i used this with good results. that&#x27;s easy and fast for using. users have to be careful in the time you left the strips over the teeth if the user doesn&#x27;t observe this can be harm and painfull</li>
    <li> Given as gift to 18 year old girl.  Her response:&lt;br /&gt;Wow mom. These strips you got me are perfection.  Oh yes. When they say no slip they mean no slip. How refreshing.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects WORKS. However, if you suffer from the littlest bit of tooth sensitive, be prepared for major tooth ache. My bottom teeth were hurting for 2 days straight after 1 strip, and even though the instructions said to use them for half an hour once a day, I found myself using the strips once a week due to tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other Crest whitening lines and did notice tooth sensitivity, so it was not a surprise that this was hurt as well. Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did gave me good results though.</li>
    <li> This product worked better than expected. At first I was a bit skeptical because after reading the reviews I was concerned about teeth sensitivity and white spots. But they are minut compared to the lasting results that I have received. It got rid of stains that I had between my teeth and whitened my teeth dramatically, as well as made my teeth look and feel more healthy. Highly recommended &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;  side notes&lt;br /&gt;  * my tooth sensitivity lasted for the first day of whitening. And rarely, if they got sensitive after using the strips again  it lasted for an hour tops&lt;br /&gt;  * I did get one white spot but honestly it doesn&#x27;t look bad and I def. prefer that than stains.&lt;br /&gt;  * I was also using Listerine whitening mouthwash with crest 3D white vivid toothpaste</li>
    <li> My teeth were in pretty good shape to begin with, i was just experimenting with these more than anything.  After just having finished a box of 20 of these, i can notice a slight difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  i paired up the strips with crests sensitivity toothpaste to cut down on the sensitivity that the strips can cause.  Sensitivity wise i would say i have average teeth, and the strips did give me a bit of sensitivity the first time i put them on, and now and then after i would take them off.  Its not a really unbearable pain, it just feels like your teeth have a headache for a little bit.  I had no problem sleeping this off.  My teeth are a little bit whiter, i would say its worth it.  Anything to make people smile more!</li>
    <li> These are great. They grip very well and are worth the price</li>
    <li> my teeth are sensitive, so i have to use these in the evening or my teeth will hurt all day. but the whitening is great! worth it if you can stand the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good noticable difference in color after 3 days. I do not recomemnd leaving in you mouth after 30 minutes. I also use sensadyne tooth paste to help fight tooth sensativity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Whitestrips for years.  They&#x27;ve come a long way since the original product - more powerful, less time required, and better adhesion.  I&#x27;m at a point now where I just use them for a few days every couple of months for upkeep.  Their effect is noticeable, both to me and to friends who comment on how my teeth look whiter.  Those with sensitive teeth do need to be careful - the first time I used them, I had pain in my teeth after about a week of daily use.  I also have some gum recession, and I need to be very careful to not place the strips on my exposed root.  But once they&#x27;re in place, they don&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy enough with Crest that I would not even consider trying another brand.</li>
    <li> I am a 32 year old male who drinks coffee every day and red wine pretty often. Did 20 applications (1 box) over about 14 days. Product is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t really taste like anything or make you drool. Well-designed. Felt nearly no sensitivity even using it twice a day sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got some results so far although nothing mind-blowing. It&#x27;s hard to show the difference in photos but I tried. The product does work, I can tell that much, and I plan to keep going. For something you can just buy and use at home, the results are about what I expected.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting to see much of a difference at all, but my fiance noticed after only a few days.  On the down side, I feel the effect faded over the next few months.  They were also quite painful if applied after I brushed my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on ordering them again and starting them three weeks before my wedding.  You&#x27;ll see a difference!</li>
    <li> I am lucky.  I was born with beautifully straight, nice-sized teeth that are a decent shade of white, but slightly stained because, well, I love coffee.  My mom (aged 72) is not so lucky.  Her teeth had years of coffee and tea stains on them and were almost light brown in color.  I decided to try this product along with the Crest 3D white toothpaste, and have gotten so many compliments on my teeth people have asked me if I had gotten veneers.  So I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom wanted to try this but did not want to spend the money.  I bought it for her for Mother&#x27;s Day and her results are just amazing.  While her teeth are not an artificial movie-star white, there is a marked difference in the color and she is thrilled with the results.  So much that I wish I took a before and after.  From light brown to off white.  Amazing.  She said she will buy them from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience slight sensitivity but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t deal with, my gumline being the worst so be careful in the placement of the strip if this happens to you.  I certainly do not have to give them up.  My mother has not experienced any sensitivity at all.  I wear them in the shower at night and while getting ready for bed, taking them off right before I go to sleep so I don&#x27;t drink or eat anything for 6-8 hours afterwards.  This has proven to work for me in terms of timing as well as no late night snacking! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other strips in the past, but these hands-down are the best.  My kids are using the 3D toothpaste and they like the results.  I won&#x27;t let them use the white strips yet as they are too young as pre-teens and young teen, their teeth do not have years of stains on them.</li>
    <li> I think that the 3D white strips do whiten my teeth but they also make my teeth very sensitive to cold, and they actually hurt after a treatment</li>
    <li> These are great.  My boyfriend has stained teeth from years of drinking coffee.  I bought these for him and he has used them only 3 times (3 days) and his teeth are much whiter already.  I can&#x27;t imagine how white they will be after 30 days of use.</li>
    <li> 20 bucks cheaper than the grocery store!  yay!  I have only used twice though because they make my teeth really sensitive.  I have to do it like once a week instead of every day and use sensodyn toothpaste twice a day.</li>
    <li> I pretty much figured that whitening strips were right up there with Rogaine an penis pills. Full of promises for the insecure and vain, but unable to deliver more than disappointment. I&#x27;m happy to report that I was wrong. I actually saw noticeable results. I was really starting to hate the yellowness of my teeth, which suffered from a lifelong chocolate obsession and ten years of smoking. I asked my dentist about whitening and they said they could do molds and bleach trays, which sounded like a giant hassle, or I could try these for a couple weeks and see where it got me. After just a few treatments I felt like I could see a difference, but I thought I might be imagining it. I kept with it and by the end there was no denying that it worked. I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed to smile big any more. I&#x27;m really grateful for what this product did, and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again in the future to touch up as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Does Crest make a product for thinning hair? :D</li>
    <li> I saw results right away but after use my teeth seems to go right back to their old color.  I already have very white teeth so maybe that was the issue.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think these would work and was worried they would irritate my gums so I put off trying for a couple of years. Now I&#x27;m a believer, buy these and use as directed. Do not pay the dentist to whiten your teeth.</li>
    <li> Hatted it! It did not work at all! It made my teeth so sensitive I could barely breathe! WORST product ever!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used these for a number of years.  Love the improvements.  They stick on your teeth much better than the original.  They are packaged with one upper and lower together so you don&#x27;t have to open two packets.  OH ....and THEY WORK!</li>
    <li> I been using these for about 3 days now and I can see my teeth getting whiter! I will be shopping for another set soon.</li>
    <li> I gotta say, these worked better than expected.  I could really tell the difference after two applications.  I haven&#x27;t finished all of the treatments yet, but I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping 100% satisfied! These are the best teeth whitening strips I have used and u can see a difference after the first use! I have done 3 treatments so far and I have gotten compliments on my smile quite a bit lately. I went ahead and ordered a second box cause you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Works great and was this product was recommended by dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> They do whiten and stay attached. Some can be loose but just be careful. I dry off my teeth first.</li>
    <li> Great for teeth whitening. But be careful not to leave it on past the 30minute mark. Teeth will get highly painfully sensitive.</li>
    <li> These work great ! I am an avid coffee drinker but noticed in pictures my teeth were awful. Now I show the teeth proudly !</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions you will have no problems. They have removed a lot of staining from my teeth in just about a week. couldn&#x27;t ask for more. I use them along With the other 3D whitening products like the mouth wash and toothpaste. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Causes MIGRAINE HEADACHES. Toxic. Ugh.</li>
    <li> The first time i used it, I saw a very noticeable difference, and from then on, my teeth got a little whiter everytime it used it. But for some reason, my teeth looked yellow in dim areas. Thats probably because this product doesn&#x27;t whiten the inner part of teeth, but rather on the top surface of your teeth. Other than that the produce does indeed work, my teeth are a lot whiter, my friends noticed as well.</li>
    <li> The BEST... Period.. End of Sentence..!!</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best whitening products on the market. It&#x27;s also completely safe to use unlike some other &amp;#34;bleaching&amp;#34; products that are available. However, I gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons you might want to look out for. First, be careful if you have sensitive teeth, it can be a little painful, but it is still safe to use! Also like my father, if you have any implants or crowns you wish to whiten, unfortunately, this product only whitens natural teeth. Other than that, I still recommend this product just be aware that it only works on natural teeth.</li>
    <li> Despite reading all the other negative reviews about how Crest Whitestrips causes pain in the teeth after a couple of uses, I decided to purchase this product anyway.  The first time I used it, everything worked great, the strips fit on my teeth nicely, they stayed on well, they didn&#x27;t leave any gel behind, they didn&#x27;t taste funny, nothing hurt, etc. so I figured my teeth must not be of the sensitive type.  Well the product says to use it every day for 20 days straight, but I waited about a week between my first and second uses (because I kept forgetting about them).  I put them on again today (for my second use) and about five minutes in, I felt this sharp pain in one of my lower teeth that lasted about a second.  I immediately took off the bottom strip, but left the top one on since it was still feeling fine.  About five minutes later, one of my top teeth also felt the same pain and I took the top strip off as well.  My teeth feel fine and I haven&#x27;t felt that pain again since taking off the strips, but it definitely scared me a lot, since I didn&#x27;t want them to crack or anything.  I think I might try using this product once a month and maybe that will whiten my teeth slightly without causing any sort of pain.  My teeth feel pretty normal at this point, maybe slightly more sensitive to ice than usual, but no more side effects at this point.</li>
    <li> I had the plastic molds from a previous whitening experience (FREE Whitening for New Patients - don&#x27;t get me started...) and I was sorely tempted to buy the stuff that you squeeze 1 drop onto each tooth and sleep with it.  It worked well last time, but it was a hassle. This way is better.  As others have said, they really do stick well.  In fact, if you leave them in there long enough, they will eventually turn into almost a total gel.  They actually weld on to your teeth which seems to me would be good for overall coverage and less spottage?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any-who, they&#x27;re great.  I have a high tolerance for everything, but still, for me, no painful gums and very modest sensitivity.  I am at the 1 week mark and an older fellow and it still works great.  Good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Very easy to use, stays secure and whitens dramatically! I saw a major improvement after the first use. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Best whitening product you can buy on the market, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely saw results only after 3 days of use, and no that&#x27;s not a placebo.&lt;br /&gt;Got it when they had some crazy coupons for it to really bring the price down.&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for that to happen again.</li>
    <li> Works great, good price. If used as directed this product really whitens well. It didnt cause any tooth sensitivity either.</li>
    <li> The product was defective. The strips were super-stuck to the glycerine &amp;#34;page&amp;#34; so in tearing it off the &amp;#34;page&amp;#34;, the whole outline of the strip came away, rendering it useless. Seemed like it might have become over-heated somewhere along the line. Box was crushed. After three tries, I tossed it.</li>
    <li> I bought a box of Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects thinking that it would improve the whiteness of my teeth somewhat.  A friend of mine had a dentist supervised whitening process done with a home treatment followed by a bleaching in the dentist office.  That process was $600.00.  We each did our own whitening process at about the same time and compared when we were finished.  I did the 20 day treatment with the whitestrips and as far as I can tell, my teeth looked as good as the more expensive treatment.  You can buy a lot of whitestrips for $600.00.  The strips were easy to apply and bend around the teeth.  They stayed on with no slippage and no leakage.  They contain hydrogen peroxide which is the bleaching agent.  You can taste the peroxide a little bit but is no bother at all.  I had zero problems with sensitivity but if you do, try using Sensodyne Pro Enamel toothpaste after removing the strips.  I had no burning of the gums either.  I kept the strips on for about 1 hour each day, removed them and brushed my teeth.  Day by day, the teeth kept getting whiter.  I bought a second box recently and will use them occasionally to keep my teeth white.  It is the easiest and the least expensive method I can think of.  If you want whiter teeth, go for it.  Buy a box and smile.</li>
    <li> Does just as advertised but is cheaper then in stores. Definitely would recommend this product, it honestly works wonders on your teeth.</li>
    <li> works great, although i have problem with saliva flowing. it&#x27;s not that big of an issue since its only 30 minutes a day. it does get very sensitive for my teeth and gums. for the price this whitening product is probably the best. i&#x27;ve tried the supreme and vivid, both suck compare to the professional series because the professional series has the most grip so it doesnt come off easily during application which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Okay, I totally loved the white teeth I got from these strips. And everyone else kept complimenting my whiter smile. For about a month. Yes ladies and gentleman, it only lasted a month. I was highly disappointed. I am NOT a smoker, do not drink tea or soda, and am not a red wine drinker. I brush my teeth twice a day and floss on average around 3 times a week. I&#x27;m dumbfounded that it faded after only a month. I followed the directions exactly. I dunno, but I think I will just get them professionally whitened like some of my colleagues. Their teeth have stayed bright white for over a year now. Darn.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the obvious teeth whitening at the end of the product. Strips were comfortable,stayed on securely and I didn&#x27;t have much teeth sensitivity while using them.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these by saying there was a good result and would save me the 500 bucks if he were to do the whitening. So, I thought I&#x27;d try them. I started to see a difference on the 3rd day and continued to see great results. I&#x27;m doing this in prep of having some crowns done, so I wanted to get my teeth as white as I could. I was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The strips were easy to apply and 30 minutes a day is very do-able. If you are hestitating, take the plunge, you will be happy you did.</li>
    <li> Although I think this product is expensive, it does seem to work and I like it very much.  I only use one per week since it is expensive.</li>
    <li> Never go to the dentist and spend a fortune on whitening your teeth, as Crest White Strips do the work very well.  Convenient, easy to use, and effective.</li>
    <li> Works even better than their 2hr express. There are a total of 20 treatments in the box. I have only used 4 treatments and already saw a remarkable difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Keep it Up!</li>
    <li> These things work. Don&#x27;t use more than one a day. I would wait at least 30 minutes after brushing before use to minimize sensitivity. Don&#x27;t have wet teeth when you apply, or they won&#x27;t stick as well. To get them off, peel from the back of the teeth first as they stick well.&lt;br /&gt; For once the directions are spot on with this product and it delivers, just be patient.&lt;br /&gt;Whiter teeth&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> The product effectively makes your teeth lighter than what you currently have. It doesn&#x27;t make it white as paper. It just lightens your teeth and it lightens it well. Just don&#x27;t expect to have Hollywood style white teeth.</li>
    <li> after 2 days I&#x27;ve seen a difference... I am giving it a break the 3rd day, and will resume the 4th day.</li>
    <li> They worked, BUT THE PAIN AFTER USING THEM WAS HORRIBLE.</li>
    <li> It works to whiten teeth, I&#x27;m on the second day, and my teeth are drastically whiter! Problem is, my teeth are in an insane amount of pain. It literally feels as if someone is ramming a knife through my whole bottom row of teeth! My upper teeth are fine, but I&#x27;ve used sensodine, orajel,asprin, and Tylenol and nothing helps the pain. I am going to stick to it though, because I think it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> These worked great. I don&#x27;t have a blindingly white smile, but it does look great. I don&#x27;t have straight teeth and have gaps, and they whitened just fine. My teeth rarely hurt while using them, however, they were slightly more sensitive to cold. I started off using them twice a day (morning and night) before brushing, then started using them once a day. I was using the whole Crest teeth whitening package (toothpaste, mouth rinse, oral-b toothbrush). This combo worked great. I would recommend not doing another routine immediately after going through this, wait a few months and go at it again to regain that nice white smile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying items on Amazon for 10 years and have never given a review. I was compelled to because of the great results. I just wish I would have used this item years ago. I smoked and drank coffee for years and the strips still worked for me.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the results of this tooth whitening!! I can smile now without embarrassment. Money well spend, and it&#x27;s so easy to applied, I am a smoker.</li>
    <li> Works great but usually gives me a toothache.  A friend suggested that I brush with sensodyne before using and it worked great, no tooth ache!</li>
    <li> Deals well with coffee stains. Adheres to teeth through the process, unlike &#x27;cheaper&#x27; whitener strips.  I keep a supply on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> I tried so many and this is the only one I really loved it is not perfect but it the best on the market for home use&lt;br /&gt;it whitened my teeth so dramatically and kept my tooth white  over a whole year</li>
    <li> I used it a few times and really saw no results. I understand that it probably takes a few tries to get your teeth white, but I tried for a week. They made my teeth hurt and now I have a sharp pain in my teeth when eating certain things. The bottom strip was way too small and didn&#x27;t cover my bottom set of teeth. I would not recommend this to someone with sensitive teeth. This is my first time using a teeth whitener and I was not satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how great these strips work!  Love them</li>
    <li> My teeth are back to their yellowish color</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my seconds purchase and it really works!!  Teeth are significantly whiter!!</li>
    <li> They whitened a little. My teeth aren&#x27;t straight up yellow, they&#x27;re like right in the middle of that white-almost light yellow stage. I paid for the luxe ones instead of the cheaper ones thinking they&#x27;d be more effective, but i feel like i could have gotten the same results with a cheaper one. They did whiten a little, but after using them 20 days i would have thought it&#x27;d be better</li>
    <li> Stick to my teeth well for the 30 minutes. I&#x27;ve noticed a change in the whiteness after only a week. They make my teeth super sensitive, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> Seems to work super well, and does indeed alter teeth&#x27;s appearance. I did notice however that my teeth were more sensitive in the days immediately following use.</li>
    <li> CREST  3D WHITE PROFESSIONAL EFFECTS TEETH WHITENING STRIPS 20 COUNT DOES  AN EXCELLENT&lt;br /&gt;WORK ON MY TEETH. MY TEETH ARE MADE SO MUCH WHITER LOOKING WITHOUT GOING TO THE DENTIST.</li>
    <li> better than I expected.</li>
    <li> Although not to the degree you&#x27;d like. As long as you follow the directions and stick to them, you will see results in a few days.</li>
    <li> The new version sticks so well that you can actually drink with them on without any problems. Of course, they whiten beautifully. No reason to every pay for whitening at the dentist when these are available. Definitely recommend. No sensitivity if used as directed and I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> These are amazing they worked really well. I am very satisfied with the results. I will definitly recomend them too a friend.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product; after just three uses my teeth were amazingly white. It doesn&#x27;t look fake; it just looks really clean. I am so happy. My teeth wasn&#x27;t really bad to start out with but you I did have stains and some yellow discoloring. I used the strips once a day for about 50 minutes, before I brushed my teeth each morning (which was recommended). I started using it on Wednesday and now it&#x27;s Sunday and my teeth look really clean. There is hardly a yellow tint or shade anymore. The only down side to this product is that it can cause pain to your teeth. I have had moments when I was just walking down the street and this striking pain just hit my tooth; the pain last for a couple of seconds. The product also leaves white dots on your teeth; I have one on one of my beaver teeth and its not cute. But my teeth is becoming whiter so I hardly notice the spot (either that or its fading away; so beware of that).&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, my smile is just more lovelier now; even my friends have noticed it. I would recommend this product and I will personally continue to buy this. Its worth the price for a happy smile.</li>
    <li> The product itself was perfect, even though the box was damaged when I received it (not the wrapping of the box, so it must has been damaged before packing), which I did not mind since the stripes themselves were almost in perfect condition for their use (some were a bit folded, but still did not hinder usage or coverage of teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, satisfied with the product and seller.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Crest White Strips and the Professional Effects are much better than the old ones that move no matter how much you try to keep your mouth still!</li>
    <li> These are awesome, they produce the result I was looking for.  The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars was because they did make my teeth super sensitive.  I would definitely recommend not using them longer than 30 minutes, and not using them every day.</li>
    <li> This works pretty good if you do it for a few weeks.  Though I warn those with sensitive teeth to take it easy as these will start making your teeth feel like you&#x27;ve been drinking limes for weeks.</li>
    <li> Just bought these. Received in mail. Used 5 packets and already see results. However, my teeth were sensitive after using the first 3 packets. Leaving these strips on your teeth for more than 30 mins may cause sensitivity issues, you may need to lower the time of use or wait a day before using again. I recommend this than buying the expensive trays your dentist offers (which causes sensitivity issues too, thus, no difference). Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It really does work wonders in very little time!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t regret buying this, i saw a difference by the first use!</li>
    <li> Worked as claimed! I eventually ran into sensitivity after using for a few days in a row, but that subsided over a few days and I continued with the whitening treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really easy to apply and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Whitened my teeth visibly within the first couple of treatments. Only once or twice (out of 20 times) did I get a shooting nerve pain in some of my teeth. It lasted momentarily, though, and didn&#x27;t have any lasting affects.</li>
    <li> work great, the cost effective, pain-free way to brighten your teeth</li>
    <li> The Shakira ad totally sold me on these whitestrips. I was mesmerized by her glowing smile and bought them in a trance-like state. Surprisingly, they actually work....really, really well. I noticed an effect immediately and really significant whitening within three days. After about six days I stopped using them regularly because my teeth seemed to have achieved maximum whiteness. Now I just use them as needed.&lt;br /&gt;My husband tried them too. He had some white spots appear temporarily but they were gone within 12 hours...so maybe apply them at night the first time you try them. I had some minor temporary sensitivity but it didn&#x27;t last more than a day and is worth it given the whitening effect.</li>
    <li> I just got done with a full treatment of these and my teeth noticeably whiter. Also there was absolutly no pain to my teeth when putting these in. I suggest brushing your teeth and using mouth was afterwards, the stripes leave a sicky substance at about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> These work and they work great! I saw a huge difference in about a week. The only gripe I have with these is I left them on too long one day while I was playing a game and my teeth hurt like hell for 6 or 7 hours! It was torture BUT if you use them as directed or even just a little over you will be fine.</li>
    <li> Solid performance from this product. My teeth are gleaming white!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I haven&#x27;t been diligent about using these multiple successive days, but I saw a difference after one day. And that is true every time I use them. They work so well it kind of makes me suspicious. Of what, I don&#x27;t know. I wanted these to whiten my teeth and they do. And yes, as other people have said, sensitivity is an issue. My teeth feel kind of weird after using them. Unpleasant, but far from intolerable. But that subsides pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things whiten teeth quickly. Period.</li>
    <li> My real teeth are restored to their original whiteness after I used this product.  They now again match the crowns that were made to match my teeth ten years ago!</li>
    <li> It works amazing as advertised. the result is pretty darn good considering the price. Saved a lot of money from doing dental whitening treatments which costs hundreds of dollars. My teeth used to be stained pretty badly, after using it for about two weeks, i had noticed a HUGE difference already. Of course, it didn&#x27;t become sparkling white right away, but It was enough for me to feel confident while smiling or showing my teeth. I cannot complain at all, after all, it was so easy to use, just 30 mins every night. I usually use it when i am reading before my bedtime.</li>
    <li> I think Crest plays games with the titles of their products. It is hard to re-order because some packages have no level of whitening, and some say level 4, and level 5. I think they like it to be confusing, so you just end up buying anything. I did not notice any whitening with these. Good luck trying to figure out which product to buy if you want to whiten your teeth. I feel like you are better off buying tray whitening from smilox or others.</li>
    <li> Tried other Crest Whitestrips, with so so resolutes.  3D Whitestrips stick to teeth very firmly, with optimal results.  Noticable whiting results.</li>
    <li> Why go to the dentist to get whiter teeth when you can easily buy this product and get the same treatment for less money??  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and am always receiving compliments about my smile :)</li>
    <li> I have used whitestrips a 1-2 times a year for close to a decade. These are by far the best and noticeably whiten my teeth. The new, \\&quot;grippy\\&quot; texture is huge improvement and I feel makes the strips even more effective. With the older whitestrips I would inevitably sneeze and the things would fly across the room, but these will stand up to the biggest sneeze fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend using sensodyne twice a day for two weeks before beginning whitestrips and continue through the treatment. My husband disregarded my advice the first time he tried whitestrips, but by the 4th day of pain he took a 2 week break to follow my advice. He experienced virtually no pain the second time around; it really makes a big difference!</li>
    <li> I have used this products for last several years. It&#x27;s easy to use. It&#x27;s very effective, almost as effective as professional whiting. I use it once a year. I have white smile all year long.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Teeth sometimes feel a little tingly but nothing more, although I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth/gums. So try something else or dish out a ton of money ($500+) for that maximum professional cleaning.</li>
    <li> I got these whitestrips and started using them about two weeks ago. I was worried about tooth sensitivity, as I had done whitestrips before and gotten those shooting tooth pains, so I read some other reviews and decided to use Sensodyne toothpaste. I started that about a week before I started the strips and I&#x27;ve been using it consistently this whole time. I am about half way through my strips (I have missed a couple of days) and I think it&#x27;s going really well. I can see results already and I feel confident that by the time they are gone, I will be happy with how my teeth look. I think the Sensodyne has really helped because so far (knock on wood), I have had NO horrible shooting pains in my teeth that we love so much. I&#x27;ve been using them once a day for the most part and I think that&#x27;s the best way to do it. I actually decided to do it twice today, since it says that you can do that, and I do notice increased sensitivity in my teeth tonight. Not pain, but definite hot and cold sensitivity. So I&#x27;m going to stick to just once a day. Anyway, they&#x27;re easy to position, stay in place very well, come off easily (with a bit of practice) and seem to be doing a good job. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Product worked as described.  After 20 day regimen noticed significant whitening of my teeth.  After the first few treatments my teeth and gums were sensitive, however, the sensitivity subsided as I continued usage.  Once you get the hang of placing the strips on your teeth, the strips stay in place very well.</li>
    <li> love this product, my teeth look nice and white. Only bad thing about them its they sting my gums, but hey beauty hurts, no?!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke, and my teeth were noticeably  white in 5 strips. No Lie. These strips are worth the price you pay. I bought them out of the store for $48.. on here the are about $35.. so get them!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, and I&#x27;m having trouble understanding how it worked for so much people, before I purchased these,I did some research and saw it had good reviews and I instantly bought it... It had no change on my teeth, I&#x27;ve used the whole package,some times for up to an hour or and hour and a half. I went to my dentist and asked him about it and he just laughed at me and told me it doesn&#x27;t work. I would save the 40 bucks and use that money to get the home treatment from the dentist, it&#x27;s a bit more pricy ($200), but 100% guarantied to work.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2STFKA92KPON7]]Super easy and it works!</li>
    <li> Hurts my teeth every time. My teeth went spotty now. I used it for tow weeks now it may work for you.</li>
    <li> Do not pay your dentist for professional teeth whitening.  This is the same thing that the dentists provide (that&#x27;s what my dentist told me) at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome product that really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for 3 days in a row and I can already see an amazing difference in my teeth coloring. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> gimmick, don&#x27;t really bother with this.  If you&#x27;re super vain like I was and want to make your teeth more sensitive, go for it.  But these things just damage enamel and leave a temporary whiter smile.</li>
    <li> These work surprising well—I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised.  No real gum sensitivity but I skipped a night here and there.</li>
    <li> Work well.  You dont have to use them all within a certain timeframe.  You can spread them out over a period of time and they still work well.&lt;br /&gt;Item was as described. Not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased these but first time online.  Price was as good as a deep discount at a store.</li>
    <li> I do love the Crest whitening strips but my teeth are becoming a little sensitive so I will not be buying this anymore</li>
    <li> I have not had any whitening done in 10 years.  I got this product and perhaps my teeth were as white as they were going to ever be because I did not notice any lasting difference.  So the product may work great, but I doubt it.  My teeth do show some staining from coffee.  Also, I had to get a replacement as a few days worth were unusable since the backing came off with the strip and it is impossible to separate them once they are off.</li>
    <li> This product caused intense sensitivity to my teeth.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after 5 applications but they really hurt your teeth.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Lightened my teeth a lot in a week!</li>
    <li> I buy these every 6 months.  I love, love, love the results and get so many compliments on how &#x27;white&#x27; my teeth are.  The dentist had told me he couldn&#x27;t effectively whiten my teeth.  I was hesitant but desperate to try these!  So thankful I did.  After years of yellow teeth, I was GRATEFUL.</li>
    <li> I love this product as it whitens your teeth FAST but it&#x27;s also pricey since it&#x27;s the top product of its category. Rembrandt is a cheap alternative and works effectively if you want a whitener that work as fast but will keep your teeth white in the long run.</li>
    <li> I wanted to go into the dental office to get my daughter&#x27;s teeth whiten for&lt;br /&gt;her big party. But the office recommended my to use these instead. It would&lt;br /&gt;be less cost effective and it would work just as well without the harsh&lt;br /&gt;chemicals. They were right!!</li>
    <li> I had been meaning to try out the Crest 3D whitestrips for a long while, and about a month ago I finally did. I use to use the Dile a Smile Whitening Kit (for about 6 months) and after the 3-4rd use, my teeth wouldn&#x27;t get any whiter. Their product I got for about $60-70? And was not pleased. So I decided to try out the strips and I love them! People have really noticed my white smile and have gotten a lot of compliments on it. I can finally wear bright colors on my lips and they still look amazingly white. The first time I used the strips, it hurt and it was my fault. The instructions said not to brush your teeth beforehand and please DO NOT. I brushed my teeth and applied the strips and it burned and made my gums feel sensitive but within that one time I did noticed a difference. I&#x27;m down to my last 8-10 strips and now I only use one once a week. At first,I used 6-7 in a row. I love them, and will repurchase. Probably the one with 40 strips. Enjoy your lovely smile and have a wonderful day!!!! :)))</li>
    <li> My young granddaughter had admired my &amp;#34;golden teeth&amp;#34; previously, but now they look amazingly white after just 2 weeks of easy treatments. You can talk, drink water, and more because they adhere so well. I wore them while walking the dogs in the mornings. I will definitely buy more as needed and highly recommend them for anyone, especially for those with young, painfully honest children in their life.</li>
    <li> Only one use i can see huge difference:)) so happy.i&#x27;ve never tried teeth whitening before.crest whitestrips was my first product.omg I&#x27;m so excited</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week. My teeth are obviously whiter. The little small white blemishes on your teeth will start to show up more, but if you keep whitening, the contrast doesn&#x27;t seem so bad. The only problem is they make my teeth super sensitive right afterwards. If you put it on your teeth, try to avoid playing with them by pushing on it or messing with it with your tongue or putting your teeth together. That helps, but it still is a problem. I&#x27;m going to have to take a break. Last night, after a week of doing this once per night, I had to take it off after only 10 minutes because my teeth began to hurt so badly. I&#x27;m going to take a break for a few days and then try again.</li>
    <li> This product i leave at my office for days when i want to use it. It takes about 30 minutes and you will notice a difference right away. Some cons is that theres sticky film that is still on my teeth right after taking this off.</li>
    <li> For YEARS I have felt self-conscious about my teeth and contemplated whitening. I am so glad I went for it because this really made a huge difference. Within the first couple days the tea stains on my front teeth were almost invisible. I have pretty sensitive teeth but found that this did not bother me - I experimented with brushing and not before putting the strips on and under both circumstances there was no unpleasant feeling. The strips do leave some pretty funky residue (the stick presumably) so you will want to do a full brushing after taking the strips off. I am very pleased with this product. Honestly, if I&#x27;d known what a difference it would make I would have done this years ago. I expect I will go through this regime periodically just to keep my much-cleaner-looking smile. It&#x27;s only a slight inconvenience but makes me feel a lot more confident.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fairly well.  Only had sensitivity issues once, after applying too soon after brushing teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I work at a Campground which deals with my smiling a lot. My teeth weren&#x27;t really all that yellow but I just wanted that pearly white to throw it over the top so I bought these! I don&#x27;t regret it one bit. My teeth are so white. I get compliments all the time. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying these again in the future.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton reviewed here is decent enough product to consider if you have a bit of tolerance to endure a slight discomfort (tooth sensitivity) during and after using the product as the results are noticeable in few days as the product marketing says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used any teeth whitening products before and I must confess I hate going to my dentist, after using this product for 3 days I do notice slight change in my teeth color, it is not sparkling white as most of the marketing blurb and pictures shows, but there is noticeable change when I look myself in the mirror, It does look noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my teeth are not evenly placed and couple of crooked ones here and there :-), but the Whitening strips did hold on to my teeth pretty well for the 30min period I used for last 3 days. I did notice that during the use of the product I had some discomfort and tooth sensitivity an... Read more</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s all that needs to be said.  One small criticism (which cost them a fifth star) would be that peeling them off of the backing isn&#x27;t the easiest thing in the world and I lost a strip, but other than that, if you stick with using these, they&#x27;re terrific.</li>
    <li> .....I was excited to try this product and get results!  Unfortunately this did not happen-- didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth at ALL-&lt;br /&gt;So dissapointed--  I used them exactly how it instructed me to do--  I got nothing-  Don&#x27;t waste your money-</li>
    <li> Saw results in about 3 to 4 days.</li>
    <li> Much much better than the old gooey strips they used to have. These really stick to your teeth and whiten as expected.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my teeth.</li>
    <li> I hate the taste of them in my mouth and it&#x27;s a pain to leave them on for 30 minutes, but I suppose that&#x27;s just something that comes with a whitening product.  But I keep using them because they&#x27;re working! I&#x27;ve only used them a few days and I can already tell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I was also nervous about sensitivity as my teeth can get pretty sensitive at times, but so far no problems whatsoever with sensitivity</li>
    <li> Great product and great price</li>
    <li> These hurt my teeth SOOO bad!  I can&#x27;t even eat because my teeth are in so much pain.  It wasn&#x27;t bad for the first few days, a little sensitive, but now after 10 days, I can&#x27;t stand it anymore.  I can&#x27;t finish the box because it is so painful.  I don&#x27;t even see a big difference in the color of my teeth, so its not worth it for me to finish the box.</li>
    <li> Husband and I used in preparation for our wedding.  They worked great.  Definitely noticeable changes.</li>
    <li> When i first tried it, it left my teeth looking uneven, and then i tried to use it a few days after that, and then a week after that and got the same results. Therefore,  I haven&#x27;t used it since then. I think I will stick to the crest toothpaste. I dont want to have some teeth lighter than others, so i guess I just lost out on 30$..</li>
    <li> I like to have white teeth but I don&#x27;t like to look like those reality TV stars who have teeth that glow in the dark!  This product works great.  The strips make a super secure fit around my teeth and I can keep them on while I run some quick errands.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item hoping that it would work for me, but unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t. I have used  the strips three times. The first day of use, I immediately felt the discomfort from the white strips. I did however, see that my teeth had white \\&quot;spots\\&quot; on it ( as per the instruction manual, that is normal and means that the whiting is working). For the second and third use, i had the same problem and decided to NOT continue using the strips. My teeth would hurt for one whole day, which was annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did see some change and improvement, but am not willing to take the pain.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use the VIVID whiting strips which works better for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Crest has a 100% Satisfaction and guarantee claim, I have called them and will be receiving a FULL REFUND***&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Crest, for standing behind your products :)</li>
    <li> I used this every other day because I have sensitive teeth and it worked! I didn&#x27;t get dramatic results like what I was hoping for but I am satisfied with the product. I think I may buy another and do it again in a couple of months because my dentist commented on my enamel depleting.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product and does what it promises. it did make my teeth one or two shades whiter. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I had been using a fluoride rinse to improve the enamel on my teeth, as the product was supposed to do, but after using it for a time, I had these horrible dark stains in all the little nooks and crannies between my teeth.  It looked awful.  I used the strips just twice and already I could see some improvement in the stains.  After using them for most of the series of 20 treatments, the stains are not really visible and are virtually gone.  The strips have also whitened my teeth and another series would probably whiten them enough to be the equivalent of a dental treatment, but it was the stain situation that really mattered and they did the job.</li>
    <li> I recommend this. Be careful if you have sensitive teeth. It might turn your gums a bit white, but that color will eventually go away.</li>
    <li> They work really well. Last time I used these was in high school and I always got compliments on how white my teeth were. So far I&#x27;ve used 5 strips and my teeth have gotten a few shades lighter (they were already pretty white). Can&#x27;t wait to see the results when I finish the box.</li>
    <li> I gotta tell ya, these things work like a charm! I drink coffee and LOTS of tea everyday, the perfect combination for tooth discoloration. I use these twice a year, sometimes three times a year, and they keep my teeth perfectly white. Can&#x27;t say enough for them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: They just work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Expensive; require discipline to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: If you&#x27;re looking to brighten your smile, then buy these.</li>
    <li> I received a box with only manual which is so helpful. I understand this product very well now and I will probably buy this item in a REAL store. And thank you for giving me a lesson so I won&#x27;t lose any more money on buying good bargains online.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these white strips! Although they&#x27;re pretty expensive, they work so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried...including an at home whitening kit that came with a light you had to shine on your teeth. These strips are so easy to use - they go on your teeth easily without getting bleach all over your fingers. &amp; once you have them on, they stick! I thought they&#x27;d slide around &amp; I&#x27;d swallow a bunch of the whitener but they stay in place perfectly. I was able to smoke, talk on the phone &amp; even drink water with them on without any problems. I noticed a difference after &amp; I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using them!</li>
    <li> These work well for the first few times, but never keeps my teeth white. They go back to their original color after the first few weeks.</li>
    <li> They hurt my teeth like hell and leave behind weird residue... Not worth it for me.. Might be for others though</li>
    <li> Since I had previous issues with my teeth getting sensitive with Crest Whitestrips I was looking forward to using the vivid white ones because it advertised the &#x27;enamel protection&#x27; I was needing. There were no problems until the last week when I noticed a little sensitivity but besides that they were perfect.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing ... I realized the difference from the first week ... My tooth are sensitive however the feeling is much better then dental clinics whitening method ,,,</li>
    <li> This does not really whiten my teeth but does make them very uncomfortable so I can only wear them every other day...I would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I am using whitening teeth brusher and tried even a 200$ treatment with no results. I come to this strips since of the reviews and I have to admit that they work very well. Actually my teeth are kinda sensitive so I had to use them no more than 2 days consecutive, pausing 1 day every two, but beside that, The result is more than evident, my teeth are visibly brighter and way better than before. I would rather do it one more time so to reach a perfect brightness, but this product reach my expectations.</li>
    <li> My teeth are naturally sensitive. So doing this, I knew from the start would make them even more sensitive. It did and it was terrible. BUT my teeth looked great. Didn&#x27;t last super long. About a couple months or so but my teeth were pretty white to begin with. So the original change wasn&#x27;t drastic. Good product for OTC whitening.</li>
    <li> When I opened the white strips, they were all dried up! Each package was the same.  I&#x27;ve used them before and I know what they are supposed to look like and this was not right.  All the strips looked like a piece of tape without the gel on them.  I have pictures to prove it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and am overall disappointed. It left some white spots on my teeth but no cohesive whitening at all. My teeth look the same as when I started the treatment. Product will work for some but might not work for you which in my case didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The strips definitely work. It&#x27;s easy, fast and convenient to use.  I&#x27;ve seen that my teeth has become noticeably white by the third day. However, like many other customers, it does cause some sensitivity to the teeth. I used it for the first three days, but after that I would sometimes do it every other day or even skipping at most two days.</li>
    <li> After reading a ton of reviews on this product, I was really worried about what effect the whitestrips would have on my mildly yellow teeth. I have used different Crest whitestrips products before, and liked them, but never had gone with the professional effects before. I had experienced terrible sensitivity from the 2 hr whitestrips, and was a little wary. My dentist quoted me around $400 for in-office whitening, and similar for take home trays, which wasn&#x27;t reasonable for me. After asking about the strips and being told they were safe and effective, I decided to try them out to whiten my teeth before my wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within two treatments I started to notice a difference. True, there is some sensitivity, but my dentist told me to brush a couple of times a day with Sensodyne so I did that, and the sensitivity was minor and sometimes non-existent. I was surprised that there wasn&#x27;t more pain, because I thought it would be amplified with my naturally sensitive teeth. It did hurt quite a bit sometimes, but the results were so worth the pain. By the end of the first week my teeth were quite white, and if I wasn&#x27;t so determined to see how white my teeth could get, I might&#x27;ve stopped there because I was so happy. I felt completely different about my smile - much more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Advanced Seal&amp;#34; part of these strips is really true, which I preferred over some of the other whitestrips I have used. They didn&#x27;t move at all, especially while drinking water, which is often needed because of all the saliva that builds up (or maybe its a chemical reaction? either way it is kind of gross). The taste isn&#x27;t great and sometimes there is a bit of irritation on the gums, but overall the seal and whitening was pretty effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After $50 (in Canada), I feel like I succeeded in whitening my teeth for a fraction of the cost. I know that I will feel confident on my wedding day! I will continue to use the whitestrips to maintain my white smile.</li>
    <li> I got these to use before my wedding and hadn&#x27;t used white strips in about 12 years. They&#x27;ve definitely improved white strips since the last time I used them! These sealed around my teeth very well and were very comfortable. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with sensitivity using these every day. I would put them on before brushing my teeth and then brush right after I took them off. My teeth are whiter and overall I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t finish the treatment because it was too strong for me. The pain stays for days and gave me headaches.&lt;br /&gt;At least, it worked because after 10 days, my teeths was whiter.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!  First time user and was very  happy with results after just 2 days ... though I used for 5 days total.  Very noticeable difference after 5 applications.  Would recommend to anyone interested in whitening their teeth!!</li>
    <li> Its an okay product.. Didnt see much of a difference to want to rave about it, maybe lifted 2-3 shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as sensitivity issues or any form of discomfort I didn&#x27;t have any even though Its reccomended you use it for 30 minutes a day, I was able to use it for an hour a day with out any problems even with the horrible condition my teeth are in.(I&#x27;ve had 3 root conals, fillings on every single tooth &amp; i was even put on prescription toothpaste)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that crest extend the length of the strips or even send the product or in roll form as you would get with tape so you can customize the length to reach some of the teeth farther back.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but unfortunately it hurt my gum after several uses, so maybe it works but I didn&#x27;t want to take the risk to continue using it</li>
    <li> gifted to my sister and she likes it.</li>
    <li> I wore these once a day for about a week but I was having a lot of trouble with aching in my teeth (usually my teeth are not very sensitive to anything) and I didn&#x27;t see much change in the first week.  I stopped because I was actually having trouble sleeping because of it but hopefully if I complete the package I will see a greater effect.</li>
    <li> I JUST TRIED ON MY FIRST STRIP AND FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS, MY TEETH ARE ACHING AND I&#x27;M EXPERIENCING UNCOMFORTABLE PAIN.  I AM GENERALLY NOT TEETH SENSITIVE BUT I GUESS THESE STRIPS DO CAUSE A REACTION ON ME!  WATCH OUT</li>
    <li> These are great. I whiten my teeth about once a year using crest white strips and everyone is always commenting on how nice and white my smile is. I get compliments all of the time!</li>
    <li> The product worked well for me and I loved it. It whitened my teeth really well. I wanted more strips in the package.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars! I&#x27;m halfway through the regimen and I can tell the strips are working. If you can&#x27;t afford professional whitening, I HIGHLY recommend getting this kit. The price is so worth the results you will get. I have not experienced sensitivity on my gums, but I&#x27;m careful to not stick the strip on my gum line. Note that it will only work on real teeth though. It at times can leave a weird taste in your mouth, but that&#x27;s short lived. Try it out!</li>
    <li> My go to teeth whitening strips.  I have tried a few others and none compare to Crest Professional Effects.  You see a difference the first time you use it.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of these strips.  I have had my teeth professionally whitened in the past and I use the strips as maintenance.  The one hour strips are intense but worth the result, IMHO. I will definitely continue to purchase these in the future.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! It whitened my teeth after 2 weeks use! I am a heavy smoker and I have yellow teeth. This is a miracle!</li>
    <li> I love this product and it does its job perfectly.  I really like how the strips mold to your teeth, I really feel like I am whitening the whole surface of my teeth and not missing any spots.  I like that this product isn&#x27;t TOO intense (I&#x27;ve used Intensive Professional Effects before, which work quite well but leave my teeth sensitive) but still makes a large enough difference for people to comment on my new smile!</li>
    <li> Love them, will keep using</li>
    <li> WOW. I highly recommended crest white strips # 4 I&#x27;ve bought them twice now and my teeth look whiter than ever. Amazon. Com.is the cheapest!!</li>
    <li> Excellent. It took a while, maybe halfway through the box, but now my husband can wear his white shirts again! Before using this product he could not wear a white shirt because of the contrast with his yellow teeth.</li>
    <li> I used this product as the instruction indicated. However, After used this product for the first time, my teeth hurt badly the rest of the evening. I thought 2 hour apply will give me a professional treatment, I was wrong, that killed my teeth. I felt so regret buying this product. And thinking of returning it. But my hubby said, he may give another try, and reduce the applying time from 2 hour to 30minutes, he hasn&#x27;t got the courage to try it though. Hope his teeth is not as sensitive as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope the company would do some further research to reduce the pain for customers on this product.</li>
    <li> worked ok I guess, but the cost is high.</li>
    <li> Whitened my teeth pretty good, but it went away after a month or so. I recommend using this product if you need to temporarily whiten your teeth in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It doesn&#x27;t whiten excessively but just enough to kick off the coffee stains. It will not change the color of any crowns or bonding which is nice!</li>
    <li> This really makes my teeth white-er than before.  It makes me want to brush my teeth very often, and use it, I used it everyday.</li>
    <li> There was no noticeable difference in the color of my teeth after completing the treatments.</li>
    <li> I am completely happy with my results and I must say crest is top on my list I love all the products made by crest. I have been using these products for over 5 years and I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Seems to work, only draw back is that it definitely caused me some tooth sensitivity. Switching to a sensitive teeth toothpaste while using this product helped, though</li>
    <li> The best white strips available.&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing, you can drink water while you have them on.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every so often to keep up my pearly whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth extremely sensitive. Whitens nicely but not sure it&#x27;s any better than using the whitening toothpaste twice a day. I used them in preparation for my wedding. Didn&#x27;t get any whiter after the first 3 to 5 days. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again. My teeth aren&#x27;t really stained either though</li>
    <li> Excellent whitener with very good price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is not the 3D White Strips that are being advertised on TV that cover individual teeth. Must be old stuff that they want to sell without reducing the price.</li>
    <li> I used these just before getting new crowns and wow, what a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best deal ever, so I am glad I can use them once a month, to keep them&lt;br /&gt;pearly white.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use them 2 days in a row, or you might get a burn on your lip.&lt;br /&gt;Every other day, if your stains are bad. I used them just once, and was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygenist said to continue once a month, and now I can~&lt;br /&gt;Good secure packaging, which gives one piece of mind.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips purchased through my dental office or Amazon.  These 3D ones REALLY stay on vs the previous ones!  I used to use my dental trays to hold my strips on but these adhere so much better!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic. Works better than I expected.</li>
    <li> It will only stick to your teeth if you brush them first, I used half 10 strips which is half of the treatment, it did whiten my teeth a little but I started to feel that my tooth was kind of peeling so I stopped using it for awhile, its back to normal now but I use them every once in awhile instead of everyday.</li>
    <li> product is satisfactory but many strips are unusable as they stick to the backing and cant be removed for use. this is not the first time this has happened. it occurred aprox one year ago and is likely a production defect. they do offer you a debit card as a result of a complaint.</li>
    <li> They were comfortable and didn&#x27;t cause sensitivity but didn&#x27;t whiten well for me.  My dentist said it works better on people with darker skin (I&#x27;m blonde with a very fair complexion) because the base color of their teeth is a different shade, as opposed to my yellow-ier base color.</li>
    <li> I am simply amazed by this product. I tend to be skeptical (and cynical) about just about everything, especially products that claim they&#x27;ll increase whiteness by \\&quot;three shades.\\&quot; (What the hell is a \\&quot;shade\\&quot; anyway?) Well, whatever a \\&quot;shade\\&quot; is, I got a zillion of them. My teeth are GLOWING after about four days of use. They even whitened my porcelain crown -- something I didn&#x27;t expect, since it wasn&#x27;t nearly as stained as my natural teeth and I figured it must still be the original color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is convenient, they STICK so I don&#x27;t have to mess with them, and they leave my teeth feeling slick and looking awesome. I AM SO PLEASED! I just put them on before I lift weights in the morning and take &#x27;em off before I brush and head to work. Easy breezy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink a lot of coffee and red wine (for the vitamins of course.) As a result my teeth really started to look terrible. I didn&#x27;t notice it in the mirror so much but in pictures they always looked like crap. I kept thinking I would go to the dentist and have them whitened but then you have to take time off work. What a hassle. These are easy and they work. I just can&#x27;t emphasize enough how happy I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do make my teeth hurt, but my teeth are naturally sensitive anyway so I brush with Colgate Sensidyne. I think it&#x27;s important to put the strips on before you brush, then brush with desensitizing toothpaste immediately afterward. I haven&#x27;t stopped using the strips yet but I suspect my teeth will slowly return to their typical level of sensitivity after I&#x27;m done with the box. I can easily do this once every few months if necessary. Totally worth it. Extra points to Crest if they decide to make whitening strips that already have fluoride in them so you don&#x27;t have to use desensitizing toothpaste afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another downside if you can call it that: The top strip is only wide enough to cover the smile of someone with a mouth the diameter of a broom handle. A lot of the yellow in my smile was on the front side of the rear molars which you can easily see whenever I open my gaping maw. The solution of course is to put the strip across the rear teeth on alternating days. You have to be especially careful not to get the rear side of the strips wet with saliva as you do this or they won&#x27;t stick. It takes a little practice but it&#x27;s worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this came as any surprise. I did my research before buying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, definitely five stars.y smile was on the front side of the rear molars which you can easily see whenever I open my gaping maw.

    <li> I used ii twice and I have noticed a huge difference. My teeth were already pretty white, but they look much brighter now. On that note, they do hurt like hell. If you already have sensitive teeth like I do, they will likely be pretty sore the next day. I also leave mine on for an hour for a greater effect, so a half hour might hurt a little less. That being said, it doesn&#x27;t hurt enough to not use them. It&#x27;s more painful than I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s worse with the weather being so cold out and breathing in the cold air. I find that if I skip a day in between treatments it&#x27;s a lot better. All in all, I think the product works as advertised. If you&#x27;re wanting a brighter smile for cheap, and don&#x27;t mind some pain, this product is worth it.</li>
    <li> Crest white strips are really easy to use and don&#x27;t interfere with my daily routine. I&#x27;ve used half the box, and I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct difference. i&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> My father is a dentist and used to offer professional grade whitening using UV lights in his office. This is a service he offered for nearly a decade with a cost of at least several hundred dollars depending on how many applications were needed for the desired results. I was never a fan because of how sensitive those treatments made my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Well, he has since stopped the professional whitening services because he has become a huge believer in the Crest 3D Whitening product line. You can get similar results at a huge fraction of the price with these. You can apply these for 30-60 minutes depending on if you want a touch up or more of a major whitening effect. I use them for 60 min at a time with little to no sensitivity following the application. I give these 5 stars and my Dentist also supports this review!&lt;br /&gt;Remember to brush and floss daily as part of your regiment for optimal results and to promote good oral hygiene!</li>
    <li> love it love it love it !!!!!!! I have been using it for a long time and you can really seen the result after two weeks ! amazing</li>
    <li> It does work - which is the only reason I am still using it despite the pain. But my teeth would be sensitive for the next 12 hours after using it. I only use it every other three to four days. If I use it in the evening I would not be able to sleep, because my teeth would keep waking me up.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this if I could afford going to the dentist for whitening.</li>
    <li> I did not get the whitening I expected. I was hoping to get my teeth a few shades whiter. I guess it does not work same on all teeth.</li>
    <li> After only two days my teeth were incredibly white! They were quite yellow and stained to begin with. Caused a little sensitivity but only because I left way beyond recommended time. Went away not even a day later</li>
    <li> they worked great!!  and I love the results!!!  I will be back!!!!  thank you for such a great product and service.</li>
    <li> I try to keep up on my teeth and brush twice a day, but to be honest, there are days where I&#x27;m lucky to have the time to brush once. Top that off with the fact I was a heavy smoker in the past (quit several years ago) and I still drink coffee to this day. So yes, my teeth aren&#x27;t the whitest they could be. I tried the Crest 3d White Professional Effects Whitening Strips exactly as directed, and I did notice a significant difference after use. I&#x27;d say my teeth are now a couple shades whiter than they were before. They are still yellow... but more of a \\&quot;pleasant\\&quot; light yellow instead of a dirty yellow. Is that a compliment to the product? Sure it is. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it&#x27;ll work to help lighten things up a bit. The key here is it&#x27;s up to you to maintain your oral health after using this product. If you continue mistreating your teeth, they&#x27;re just going to lose the \\&quot;luster\\&quot; that this product will help you get, and they&#x27;ll probably lose it fairly quickly as well. Overall, a decent product that, in combination with a good oral health regimen, can make a difference.</li>
    <li> I used this for 4th time so far and I have no changes.&lt;br /&gt;Instruction told me that I can use this once a day and I will see the result 3rd time i use it.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I will keep using it until i use them all but I doubt it..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitening Strips on and off over the years.  They definitely work, even after a few days.  I don&#x27;t like having them on for extended periods of time, so these 30 minute strips are the best fit for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I didn&#x27;t like about strips from years past was that they were slippery and I had a hard time keeping them on.  These are the exact opposite - they&#x27;re like duct tape.  The first time I tried to take them off, I was surprised at how much I had to pull.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got used to the strength or my teeth adjusted, but after a few days it wasn&#x27;t that much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive teeth but, I always get a little bit of sensitivity while I use them.  Still, a little pain is totally worth it for sparkling teeth.</li>
    <li> This whitener is very good, however it is very temporary. You have to use keep up your whitening regime even after you use this product, or else your teeth will go back to what they were before. Application and use are very easy though. Sometimes got sensitive teeth, but it went away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had previous experience with the older line of Crest whitestrips. They used to do a good job before but, man, this new line is ridiculous. The whitening power is off the charts and the strips actually stick well to your teeth. You have to literally rip the strips off with some force. Overall good product. May produce some sensitivity due to the strength of the whitening so buyer beware.</li>
    <li> didnt work at all. i used this every night untill it was gone and didnt make a difference in whitening my teeth. and as far a sensitivity it depends on person to person basis. i didnt feel any pain or discormat at all. with that being said my teeth also didint get whitened. maybe it will work better for you....</li>
    <li> I am a senior citizen and was told these strips would not whiten my teeth.  But they did!  They increased the whiteness just enough to make me look so much better.  Incidentally, Crest recommends that you use them only twice a year.</li>
    <li> I guess the strips whitened my teeth as much as possible. Would use them again, but hopefully won&#x27;t need them for a while.</li>
    <li> Love this product. (Except for the price tag!)&lt;br /&gt;It does what it claims to do: whitens your teeth - quite well, I must say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not exaggerating when I say that I achieved truly noticeable, very pleasing results after just 3 applications. I did experience very slight sensitivity after the first few days of using it, however it was by no means to the point where I needed to use toothpaste for sensitive teeth, nor did I have to give up eating and cold/hot foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and the advance seal technology really helps keep the strips in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, YES, I have in fact gotten compliments on my smile. Can&#x27;t lie; it feels good. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TIP: Before peeling them off, fold the strips in half (exactly), making a crease, and you&#x27;ve now taken the guesswork out of aligning the strips just right on your teeth!</li>
    <li> I have used maybe about half the package and I am already pleased with the results. The strips do make my teeth sensitive for a day after each use, so I use them about every other day. I have tried other bleaching methods and this by far beats them. I also love how the strips stick to your teeth, unlike the older versions which I have tried before. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I LOVE WHITESTRIPS. Exactly as expected. These turned my teeth from an ugly shade of yellow to a pearly white smile. I get compliments on my smile daily. I recommend these for EVERYONE. Although they make the teeth a little sensitive, they really do work, and quickly.</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of tea and noticed that my teeth were starting to get pretty stained.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money getting professional whitening done at the dentist so I tried the cheaper alternative and was surprised at how well it worked. I started noticing results within a week of using them.  After 20 applications my teeth, especially the very front teeth that weren&#x27;t stained that much to begin with, look great.  I&#x27;m on to my second box and hope to get them just a tad bit whiter.  I intend to use this maybe once or twice a year to maintain the whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the advanced seal, the strips are long enough and stick well to your teeth though I did notice that the bottom strip would get lose around the ends and curl up by the end of the 30 minutes.  As for teeth sensitivity, my teeth are a little sensitive while having the strips on and immediately after, but are fine afterwards.  I only use the strips every other day to decrease teeth sensitivity. You get the same whitening results though it will take longer to see them when doing the strips every other day.  I did make the mistake of using the strips on two consecutive days and my teeth hurt for days afterwards.  After going back to the every other day schedule they were fine.  I do notice that my teeth are a little more sensitive, but there is no constant tenderness or pain.  Before I could take bites out of ice cream without any problem and now after using the strips doing so is painful.  I think I&#x27;ll try using sensodyne toothpaste to help with the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> After all the fantastic reviews on this product, I had extremely high hopes of amazingly white teeth. I have to say, my teeth are noticeably whiter and the strips were easy and convenient to use. I had no problems getting the strips to fit and had no problems with gum discomfort, I did have slight tooth sensitivity while using this product but the sensitivity went away one day after finishing the set. I would use this product again, even though I  found it to be a bit costly for the results.</li>
    <li> I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist once in a while but this was my first whitening product. I smoke, I drink coffee and tea 1-2 times a day during the work week and I received lasting whitening after using these strips a handful of times. I would say that when others recommend this product over a $400 whitening at the dentist its because of the relative length of whitening over price. You can use them regularly, two times a day, and regulate that off and on until you&#x27;re satisfied with your degree of whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have reported that the downsides are:&lt;br /&gt;1. Increased tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;2. Temporary gum irritation.&lt;br /&gt;3. Committing to regular usage (vs one time high powered dental visit).&lt;br /&gt;I found that if you place the strip comfortably and use infrequently you can avoid these. Waiting the 30 minutes is a cinch. Sometimes reversing the order and using bottom strip for top teeth and top strip for bottom teeth does work. So does pushing the strip into the groves of your teeth. In order to whiten the full surface area of your teeth you will have to place the trips over a portion of your gums which will cause some temporary discomfort but it subsides within the thirty minute time period for me but your results may vary. Want whiter teeth? Buy these strips and the brightness of your smile is up to how well you follow the kit&#x27;s instructions.</li>
    <li> I am SO happy I learned of these!!  My teeth have looked yellow for years...most likely from drinking cokes and hot tea.  I could not believe the difference after one week...my teeth haven&#x27;t looked THIS white in years and years!  I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not messing around when they market this advanced seal. These strips really stick to your teeth and can be a little difficult to remove. If you&#x27;ve got very short nails like I do, good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come with 20 strips for both the top and bottom, so this is 40 strips in total. The larger strip goes on to the top and the smaller one on the bottom. You basically take out the strip, line it up to your teeth and press and hold for a few seconds until it settles. Then you wrap it around the back and press and hold for a few seconds again. Keep in mind the strips are about 3 inches long, roughly the size of your index finger, so you kind of have to learn how to align them to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product page says to do it once a day, but the manual says you can do it twice a day if you want faster results. I did it once to twice a day and I got some results, but it&#x27;s kind of hard to notice. Obviously you&#x27;re not going to go from yellow to glow in the dark white, but you&#x27;ll get a couple of shades lighter. Since you look at your teeth every day, it&#x27;ll be more difficult to notice the difference so try taking a picture of your teeth with the same camera under the same lighting before and after. I didn&#x27;t do this but kind of wish I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would still recommend this to anyone that wants to whiten their teeth. As I mentioned in my review, keep in mind these are really really sticky and they don&#x27;t cover your entire teeth.</li>
    <li> Experienced some sensitivity with my teeth when using this but I just reduced the frequency to every other day. It does work and the effects do last for a while. Avoid coffee.</li>
    <li> Have used these many times, first item ordering them on line.  Better price than in the store, will order again.</li>
    <li> Not even finished with my second week and my teeth have been much whiter! I only brush with a whitening toothpaste, don&#x27;t use the other Crest products to advance the whitening but will most definitely do so after I finish to maintain my great white smile! So happy. Will try to update in 6 months to see if they&#x27;re still white. Will be tough since I am a red wine drinker...</li>
    <li> The first 10 days that I used them, I didn&#x27;t have any problems. After that, my teeth started to get very sensitive, and it would last until the next day. I started to use them every other day like the instructions suggest, but my teeth still hurt every time I used them. I made it through 16 because I really wanted to whiten my teeth, but I just couldn&#x27;t make it through the last 4. The worst part was that after 16 strips and all the pain, I can barely tell the difference. I had such high hopes for this, but I ended up being disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I use a strip now and then to maintain the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
    <li> i really like the ease of these</li>
    <li> These are NOT the white strips of the past! I actually noticed that my teeth were whiter after wearing them one time.  To be fair my teeth are not yellow to begin with but I&#x27;m starting to show age because my teeth are not as white as they use to be.  They don&#x27;t slide around AT ALL and in fact you could forget you had them on if you were distracted.  They don&#x27;t have the terrible awful taste or sliding of the past strips.  My teeth are VERY sensitive on the bottoms and the first time I wore them I put them on the bottom and so I will never do that again.  You can&#x27;t really see my bottom teeth very well anyway so I only use these on the tops only.</li>
    <li> I highly suggest Crest 3D whitestrips. I was very hesitant at first, and even didn&#x27;t order them the first few times I looked. I was mistaken. While the first two days I did notice some sensitivity, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to prevent me from eating/drinking/brushing. By day 3 my teeth were noticeably whiter. Drinking tea and pop often did not do much to help my teeth, but as I&#x27;m nearly finished with these treatments, and I can only smile when I look into a mirror, as well as be much more confident about my teeth/smile, I would recommend these to anybody who wants to help improve the color of their teeth.</li>
    <li> Wow!  These work fantastic!  VERY white teeth from use!  Easy to use and they stay put!  We all have white TEETH here!</li>
    <li> I already use Crest&#x27;s 3-D toothpaste, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well these Whitestrips would perform.  What I found was that my teeth lightened a few more shades.  But the real bonus is that the stubborn yellowness near the gum line  is just about gone.  Overall, my teeth really look so much better; lighter, brighter, whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see why Crest suggests not only the toothpaste and the mouthwash should be used together, but that, the Whitestrips complete the job.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth, so I was initially worried about purchasing these strips because of people who said they experienced discomfort with these. Well, my experience was similar. After about 15 minutes, I will begin feeling shooting pains in my teeth that make me stop everything I am doing and resist the urge to scream. However, this is something that I expected after reading reviews, so I cannot take it out too much on the strips themselves. As for results, I do see results pretty quickly after using them. I don&#x27;t get fresh snow white teeth, but they definitely brighten up after using these for a few days. If you have sensitive teeth, be prepared to experience some pain/discomfort. Who knows, maybe you&#x27;ll luck out and not get either, but at least you were prepared!</li>
    <li> I have seriously sensitive teeth and gums, and this didn&#x27;t hurt one bit. Sure, it made my teeth a little sensitive that following night, but that only means that they were just more.. Present in the moment, that was the feeling, if that makes sense..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it was very simple and easy to use, super fast, sticks beautifully and stays put, and I think it has already made a difference, but it could definitely be the placebo effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very pleased. I highly recommend it, even to those with sensitivities. This one&#x27;s great for me, and I had 2-3 gum grafts, so.. Go for it, really.</li>
    <li> These strips are better than the ones that Crest offered about 5-10 years ago.  Stick better.  The change in whiteness is obvious after a week or two of use.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> These really work well! My teeth are noticeably brighter and whiter. I did one round without any sensitivity issues. (I do have sensitive teeth). I tried a second round about 2 weeks after completing the first and noticed slight sensitivity but nothing that prompted me to quit. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to have whiter/brighter teeth. I have tried white strips in the past without the results these particular ones offer. The strips themselves are a little more stiff/thicker and take a small amount of extra effort to wrap them around the back side of my teeth. Again nothing bothersome to me personally but something I wanted to share. You can also drink with these in which is nice because they stay on for an hour.</li>
    <li> It works and it requires consistency, but it does give some sensitivity - which is expected of such products - so I just use sensodyne.</li>
    <li> Thank You great Product and came fast and was as listed!  I would recommend this product to anyone, very glad i purchased.</li>
    <li> Causes canker sores after every use. Whiteness goes away in a day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it.. I haven&#x27;t gone to the dentist as much as I should.  Well I did when I was a kid, but insurance - bills are tight.. everyone is putting off going to the dentist (BAD)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, these strips work great but I also got the &amp;#34;shock&amp;#34; of not only the high price for these tiny strips but the stock you&#x27;ll get as your nerves get a JOLT from the chemicals working on the enamel of your teeth.  Sometimes I wonder about the safety of these things... so I use them very sparingly but overall I give this a positive review on a positive product.  I hope prices tumble in the future.</li>
    <li> HELP...........Everyone needs a little help with one&#x27;s teeth from time to time and THIS PRODUCT hits the SPOT! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time using the strips in about 4 months.  I asked my dentist about whitening my teeth for my son&#x27;s wedding and he recommended using the strips with Crest 3D toothpaste before spending over $500 for professional whitening.  I definitely see a difference, about a shade whiter.  The sensitivity that people complain about while using the strips was minimal, but I also brush with sensodyne toothpaste.  The price was great since the stores charge $50 for a box of 20.  I recommend this product and will buy them again.</li>
    <li> effective and convenient to use~&lt;br /&gt;But makes my gum painful&lt;br /&gt;still want to recommend it to my friends~&lt;br /&gt;lol&lt;br /&gt;lol</li>
    <li> Definitely makes my teeth hurt 2-3 days in, so I skip a day here and there. Most of the way through all 20, and my teeth show a bit of difference...maybe more if I could stand to use them every day. Overall, an affordable option for teeth whitening!</li>
    <li> In the ads you see a lady with already pretty white teeth putting on a pair of crest whitestrips. Afterward her teeth literally glow. Needless to say, the glowing doesn&#x27;t happen, but the few shades brighter does. They work, and that&#x27;s about all that I can say. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but if you need to give your smile a mini upgrade, or maintain some whitening you&#x27;ve already done, they&#x27;ll do. They didn&#x27;t do wonders for me, and they do have the potential to burn your gums. If that happens, just space out the application to once every other day, or every two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy enough with my results, no 5 stars because I wasn&#x27;t amazed. I will say, I would have given five stars regardless of color if my teeth had glowed as displayed in the ad. Buy them, they&#x27;ll probably work as you expect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been to the dentist twice in the last 30 years and amazingly my teeth are all still in my head. As a former smoker, though, they weren&#x27;t very white. I decided to take a chance with these. I saw someone mention cutting them in half, lengthwise, to get double the number, so I&#x27;m doing that. I&#x27;ve used my half-cut strips about 10 times so far and they&#x27;re really working well. I&#x27;ve had zero sensitivity. I don&#x27;t know how &amp;#34;shades&amp;#34; are defined, but my teeth have gone from &amp;#34;rather yellow&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;almost white&amp;#34;. Impressive. They stay put very well, too. They&#x27;ve already exceeded my expectations and I still have a lot of strips left.</li>
    <li> Just used it twice and saw the difference</li>
    <li> I have used for a week and my teeth really become white. How amazing! And I am going to buy two more boxes for myself and my boyfriend as well.</li>
    <li> Love this ! Best Product ive tried !!</li>
    <li> pros: it works really well. some of my teeth turned out whiter than i expected, but it would be better if i able to treat all my visible teeth..&lt;br /&gt;cons: for the lower strip its only able to cover 6 to 7 teeth of my teeth. lower strip should be a lil bit longer.</li>
    <li> They are practically impossible to take off, but that grip is preferable to the strips I&#x27;ve tried that fall off easily. Noticeably whitened my teeth and earned me some compliments even from the dentist. WORTH the price without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I have used many types of whitening products but this one is very painful on the teeth. Its a sharp sensation after 10 mins of use. Its not my teeth its the strips.</li>
    <li> Just as described they work great the strips come in handy before a big event and just to keep your teeth there whitest.</li>
    <li> This product does work. I have noticed whiter teeth. However, it has brought me the worst tooth pain I have ever experienced. I didn&#x27;t think I had teeth that would be ultra sensitive to the strips, but indeed I do. When I kept them on for thirty minutes, I would experience tooth pain for probably about 8-10 hours afterwards, which was very disruptive because it brought a lack of concentration with it (not conducive to grad school at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have strips that are labeled as &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; which may be the better choice if you have sensitive teeth. I only subjected myself to this discomfort for about 5-7 strips, then dropped the time to 10-15 minutes. It may take longer to achieve that bright white smile, but it can still get the job done, if you are willing to experience the tooth pain. One thing I would suggest is wearing the first strips for less time to make sure that you are able to go a certain period of time without the tooth pain. Otherwise, I envy those who can go the full 30 minutes!</li>
    <li> I love these whitestrips and that fact that I can get them for considerably less than Wal-Mart is a huge plus! Use as directed and you&#x27;ll see great results!</li>
    <li> It works and wont leave you disappointed. It whitened my teeth as I expected. Strips could get annoying but hey it works so deal with it.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were cheaper here. I will just say i&#x27;m not happy they do not work at all and left partial white spots on my daughters teeth. I wish I could get a refund or at least exchange but lesson learned. Will purchase from store next time.</li>
    <li> The Professional Effects strips work better than any others that I have tried.  They are easy to use.  Don&#x27;t taste bad or irritate my gums.  I typically only use about 7 packages of strips and find that I get maximum effect from those.  I save the others and use them 4-6 months later.  Since my bottom teeth don&#x27;t really show much when I smile, I sometimes use both the top and bottom strip in a package for the first 2 or 3 days, then just use the top strip in a package, save the bottom strip until the next day and use it on my top teeth.  That way, I use only 5 or 6 package for full whitening effect and can use a $40 box of the strips three times (4-6 months apart) before having to purchase more.  I find that using the strips for the full number of days indicated does not really produce better results than just using for 7 days.</li>
    <li> Amazon provides these at such a great price in comparison to the local CVS stores. I love them and they work like wonders!</li>
    <li> I have tried it a year ago and the results are amazing..&lt;br /&gt;The new kit i ordered it seems like it is much stronger although it is the same type..&lt;br /&gt;I am having a teeth pain after every use and it will continue for hours..  Im trying to find out the reason&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, thank you.</li>
    <li> Always wanted to try a whiting kit and after reading many reviews I picked Crest 3D.  Started working right away.  I still have a few days to go but I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> DEF. RECOMMENDED!!! my teeth got super white after using this. and thats rhat i didnt even finish the packet. i have like maybe 3 left. everyone tells me how nice my teeth are :)</li>
    <li> Very very happy with this purchase. Item arrived quickly and as described. If you want white teeth this is the item to purchase!!</li>
    <li> Started using it before my wedding - works fantastic. I started seeing the results after a week, but it&#x27;s getting better and better.</li>
    <li> These are very effective but cause my teeth to be very sensitive.</li>
    <li> Followed the instructions and I noticed a different change in the my teeth.  They were whitener and the product is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Amazing results, will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I took before, half way, and after pics, all in the same spot with the same lighting, same smile, etc., and there&#x27;s maybe, maybe, a slight difference between start to finish, but really that&#x27;s probably me still in denial that they didn&#x27;t work. I followed the directions to a T. On the bright side they were easy to apply and stayed in place. My teeth did get a little sensitive in the beginning as the package stated they might. I never experienced white spots.</li>
    <li> works great!!! teeth are looking good</li>
    <li> Worked well.  I&#x27;d imagine these strips are easier to use than other mouth treatments.  They&#x27;re not exactly comfortable but they certainly work.  My teeth were pearly white and have stayed that way from cutting out coffee and maintaining from brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the chemicals in this to make your teeth so white can&#x27;t be exactly healthy but it didn&#x27;t kill me so I&#x27;d say do it once.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and it works great.</li>
    <li> It made such a difference in using this product.  It whitened my teeth and my boyfriend noticed it right away.  I will continue to use .</li>
    <li> By far the best teeth whitening kit around. They are easy to apply easy-to-use and work like wonders.  You will notice a substantial difference and the color of your teeth within a few applications</li>
    <li> This is my second pack I&#x27;ve bought. Best whitening strips I&#x27;ve used and great price! The strips move around a little they&#x27;ve been in for ten minutes or more but that&#x27;s because the product foams up a little and it getting every aspect of the tooth. Can see huge differences, even when I just use once a week as a touch up!</li>
    <li> Used the product for 2 weeks everyday. I applied for an hour everyday after not seeing my teeth whitening but it had no effect, other than making my teeth sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend? Sure I do. Just because it didn&#x27;t work for doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for everybody else.</li>
    <li> these work great in just one use, but beware will make your teeth very sensitive for a couple of days after using, I have to use the Gentle routine which is a shame because these work instantly</li>
    <li> I am normally pretty sensitive to whitening products, and I found that these didn&#x27;t hurt my gums very badly. Within five or six days, I could see results. I only had tooth sensitivity a few times after using (I would use the strips for 30 minutes right before bed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that&#x27;s different about these strips is that they stick to your teeth - when you take them off, it&#x27;s like peeling bandaids from your teeth (I know that&#x27;s gross, sorry) but it definitely pulls so if you have any teeth that aren&#x27;t really secure, I&#x27;d go with a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 13 of the strips to get where I wanted to (my teeth weren&#x27;t that bad) and I&#x27;m going to use the other 7 for a touch-up in the fall when the dark lipsticks come out. My main goal was to whiten enough to where I could wear bright summer red and pink lipstick and not have it make my teeth look even more yellow, and this did the trick!</li>
    <li> These are the same as they are in the store, Target, Walmart, CVS, etc, only less expensive!  Only thing is that they can make your teeth sensitive for the day of/after you use one.  But, if you want brighter teeth, this is the product!</li>
    <li> Very noticeable that your teeth is whiter. I love it!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this product before I bought it, and noted that there were concerns about sensitive teeth, which I also have. I took the advice that was given to reduce use to every other day when tooth sensitivity happened, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the whitening still occurred. I am very happy with this product; it worked great!</li>
    <li> Had my teeth whitened with kor whitening from my dentist, which definitely works, but the effects don&#x27;t stay. This is much cheaper and does a great job for up keeping your white smile.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite product of the crest whitning strip line.  It has the fitting that it does not move around in your mouth, once you place it on, it stays in place until you take it off.  I have white teeth, and I usually use this once a year to keep it the same white, this time my teeth got whiter than usual and of course I was happy.  Your teeth do become very sensitive, but think of it as a good opportunity to lose weight because you don&#x27;t dare eat a hot pizza lol, but to me it&#x27;s worth it for the end results.</li>
    <li> My husband and I split a box usually and only use them once every third day to avoid sensitivity. We do it every three years or so and people ALWAYS tell me how white my teeth are. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> great product..works as described..my dentist compliment me on the whiteness of my teeth</li>
    <li> Hurt my teeth... only used it once</li>
    <li> My teeth were super white in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I even had some left over and just use them once every couple months just for touch up.</li>
    <li> My teeth are slightly darkened from Tetracycline, and while the strips didn&#x27;t help with that issue, they were very effective in removing surface stains from coffee. I had a slight sensitivity after about a week of use so I took a few days break and after that it wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> Not much to say accept very quick shipping and of course the product is the best I have used.</li>
    <li> Worked great as usual. Been using them for years.</li>
    <li> Did not make a difference for my teeth, huge waste of money!</li>
    <li> Like these noticeable difference in teeth.</li>
    <li> Great product! I wish it was the professional effects level 5 like they used too... but they&#x27;re discontinued nd this is the new one.  I used to buy them from costco and it was much cheaper and would come with the express 1 hour pack as well for 25 dollars but now theyre up to 40.  This is a better option economically!</li>
    <li> These are amazing. I was hesitant before buying them because I used trays before and had extreme tough sensitivity however this time id brush my teeth 10 minutes before with Sensodyne rapid relief and put the strip on for 30 mins and I can honestly say I did not experience any tooth sensitivity this time around. My teeth looked whiter after 3 days. I&#x27;m definitely purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This product did noticeably whiten my teeth, and it is reasonably priced. My only concern is that after using each strip it made my teeth sensitive to anything and everything. My teeth have never been the sensitive type, but after the first three applications I had to lay off using them for a couple days, and then for the rest of the box I applied one to my teeth once every three days. It has been two weeks since my last use of the strips and my teeth are just slightly sensitive.</li>
    <li> Crest whitestrips working really well on my teeth without negative side effects</li>
    <li> Many white strips make my teeth sensitive- these did not!  Got many compliments within the first week of use on how white my teeth were!</li>
    <li> Works great just stop using for a day or two if your teeth are sensitive. You&lt;br /&gt;can notice the whiteness after the first use</li>
    <li> just like buying from a store. perfectly sealed and worked beautifully.</li>
    <li> My friend had to stop using it because it was really hurting her, but it does absolutely nothing to me, so I guess it depends on each individual. I&#x27;ve seen a difference in 3 days, although I&#x27;m still waiting to get my teeth completely white.</li>
    <li> Ouch.  A few years back I tried the Crest White Strips, and they made my teeth so sensitive that I started using Sensodyne toothpaste.  After reading the reviews recently, it seemed that they had improved, and that sensitivity was less of an issue.  I&#x27;m not so sure that&#x27;s the case.  They definitely stick better than the older ones.  After having them on just twice for 30 minutes, and immediately brushing with Sensodyne afterwards, my teeth still hurt the next morning.  They look a little whiter after even those two sessions, but unless you&#x27;re a beauty queen or TV star, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s worth the pain if your teeth become sensitive.</li>
    <li> People have been commenting about how white my teeth look, I don&#x27;t tell them how easy it is. Really. I tried teeth whitening packages like this a while ago and gave up because they were so frustrating. This one is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One cellophane- strip adheres to your top teeth, the other goes on the bottom. They stick firmly which is key, and then they seal so they&#x27;re not sliding around. Make sure you apply the strips to teeth and not your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whiter teeth, relatively cheap. I don&#x27;t have any sensitivity because of them but your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> These barely whitened my teeth. Marginal improvement. One-fourth of the strips did not peel away from the plastic so I couldn&#x27;t use them. Very shoddy product even though it&#x27;s a name brand.</li>
    <li> These work great.  I use them once a year to keep my teeth nice and white.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> These work great! I would say I noticed the difference within about three or four applications. Having used strips a few years ago, I&#x27;m pleased to see they&#x27;ve improved these quite a bit. They are sticky like a sticker, so placing them can be a bit tricky, but one they&#x27;re on, there&#x27;s no ooze at all. And they stay until I take them off. There is little residue upon removal, and the taste of the gel is not offensive. I should mention that upon the first few uses, I did get some minor nerve pain in my teeth. It lasted for maybe an hour each time, but it was minimal and doesn&#x27;t happen any longer.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re expensive, but they get the job done, no ifs, ands or buts about it.</li>
    <li> Everything I sent for, I received in excellent condition and promptly.  I have absolutely no complaints.  Recommend it to anyone.  A. B.</li>
    <li> These really work-much better than the Crest regular whitening strips. I guess they have a higher amount of hydrogen peroxide, or whatever the whitening ingredient is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read they made other peoples&#x27; gums hurt but they didn&#x27;t really bother mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do stick really well to your teeth and make little mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: They do work great but they did make my gums hurt after using them 3-4 days in a row. Solution: skip a day or two, then continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the \\&quot;glue\\&quot; they put on these since they don&#x27;t slide around on your teeth.</li>
    <li> These are my go-to white strips. They work great and don&#x27;t make my sensitive teeth hurt too badly. I cut the strips in half lengthwise so they only cover the front of my teeth - they don&#x27;t go over the top and back, which seems to be the most sensitive areas for me. Plus if you do this, you get 2x as many!</li>
    <li> I cant believe i was discouraged to buy this product after reading these reviews. In the end I&#x27;m so glad I did. This product has AMAZING effects for an at-home whitener hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a lot of the grievances in these reviews come with inexperience in teeth care and teeth whiteners in general. For example, DO NOT use toothpaste before applying the white strips, for it effects with the whitening process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things i&#x27;d like to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) To the people saying &amp;#34;This product doesn&#x27;t whiten all of my teeth&amp;#34; You do realize, that you cannot just put the white strip OVER the teeth? Teeth aren&#x27;t bricks. You have to fold the strip into the teeth. For example, I start in the middle of the whitestip, put my finger on it, and smooth it out over my teeth towards the ends MAKING SURE it forms to my teeth. Besides, Even if it does not touch every part of your teeth, the gooey whitening agent, once reacted, will cover all of those spots and form to your teeth. (especially if the strip is able to cover the backside of your teeth too, if not it&#x27;s sstill fine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) To the people saying &amp;#34;It hurts my gums/teeth/&amp;#34; Well, with the gum thing, do not under ANY circumstance put this on your gums!! You&#x27;re supposed to get it close, but not actually have the strip cover the gums! I did this one time and my gums HURT. From then on I didn&#x27;t have it touch my gums and discomfort disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) To the people saying &amp;#34;not good for sensitive teeth&amp;#34; This one was a big deal breaker for me at first. My teeth are incredibly sensitive; eating ice cream hurts. I find it odd that I found no sensitivity as all with this product. Food for thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I achieved great results, my teeth are shades whiter, but not that nasty florescent white. It looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone interested in my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. 30 min after eating dinner I quickly run my wet toothbrush across my teeth (No toothpaste! This is important! The toothpaste can react with the whitening process)&lt;br /&gt;2. I apply the whitestrip bottom first, starting in the center of my teeth and smoothing it out as far many teeth it reaches and fold it over the back of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;3. Same with the top&lt;br /&gt;4. Press the strips in again, making sure they are activating and are on correctly (sometimes on the bottom teeth, saliva can make them move around, gotta go fast!)&lt;br /&gt;5. Set an alarm for 30min since I am forgetful&lt;br /&gt;6. After 30min, remove bottom, then top and brush teeth as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 20 day regimen, I now use Activated Charcoal to keep my teeth this shade of white. It&#x27;s inexpensive and is a natural teeth cleaner/whitener. Look into it!portant! The toothpaste can react with the whitening process)&lt;br /&gt;2.

    <li> Junk! My wife has been using the Crest &amp;#34;Supreme&amp;#34; Whitening Strips for years with great results. I had started using them right before she got pregnant. And they were awesome. Well when she found out she was pregnant she chose to stop using them just incase. Well I used up the last bit in the box and then we stopped buying them until after my son was born. Well I thought the &amp;#34;Supreme&amp;#34; was what I was ordering. I didn&#x27;t know there was a difference. I have to say, these are junk. I&#x27;ve been using them for almost 30 days now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. I will say, however they do hold in place way better then any other I&#x27;ve tried. But still worthless if you don&#x27;t get results. WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> These have no indication of advanced seal. It is not written on the box or on any items. False advertisement. These are going back now. Not to mention the box was completely destroyed when I received it. They better accept my return, I have photos. it was not me who ruined the box- I received it complete with torn edges and it looks like it has been shipped back and forth quite a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/26 FYI I returned my previous order and let them know they sent me the wrong ones. I re-ordered and got my  package today... i received the SAME THING as my previous order!! these will be going back and I WILL NOT be ordering again. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years. Being able to pre-order it on line for regularly scheduled delivery is awesome. Would not use any other teeth whitener - this one is the best.</li>
    <li> Only half of the strips actually stuck to my teeth.  It could be that that company sold me old or defective strips.  Other than that, they, *kind of work, but only momentarily.  I don&#x27;t see this as any kind if long term product.</li>
    <li> i just quit smoking and went to this to try to whiten my teeth. i haven&#x27;t used all the strips yet but after using like 4 strips i noticed a big difference my only problem is that the strips are not enough to cover the surface area of all your teeth. its like your only whiting a few certain teeth. i wish this was big enough to cover the front and back of all my upper and lower teeth.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time!&lt;br /&gt;It works!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s affordable!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using consistently and as instructed being only a week and a half in so far, and have noticed the difference. I have received comments on my whiter smile already.</li>
    <li> The Crest 3D white strips work very well and even my dentist was impressed with the outcome and told me to continue using them as I have been.  I put them on and leave them on for approximately 30 minutes.  When done, I have no sensitivity as I have with other brands.  Follow up with Crest Luxe toothpaste and your teeth will be pearly white and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of products like this, but always shied away because of the price.  Well, this is worth every penny - works very well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product worked fantastic at getting my teeth their whitest ever ....Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these every 3-4 months for a couple of years now and noticed very little change. Just tried brushing with plain baking soda and voila! Save your money. Use regular baking soda on your brush a few times a week. BIG difference. Stains all gone with first use.</li>
    <li> LOVE the results I get from these strips! It&#x27;s much cheaper to purchase from Amazon than any local retailer.</li>
    <li> What to make an impression? If the answer to that question is yes, Yes, and YES,,,,, then you will purchase this product even if you have never used a whitening product in your entire life! I am a person who is big on personal hygiene and I&#x27;m an all around VAIN woman. After skipping my annual dental appointments for years... I was faced w a series of dental appointments after I discovered I had an abscess. I will spar you the details on the $2500+ price tag that came with my discovery.... Welp since then I have been on top of my oral health! As I have come to love flossing! To me there is nothing prettier than a nice set of WHITE teeth. I am constantly complimented on how white mine are... and I owe it all to these STRIPS.... I use other whitening products granted but nothing clears up stains better than these strips.. Now they can get costly over time.... so I will substitute with alil baking soda mixed in with my toothpaste but when I start noticing any signs of discoloration I turn right back to these... I am a heavy coffee drinker so I have to do what I must to keep my smile pretty. I was very pleased to see how affordable these strips were here so I snatched up a box.. Now I know what the directions say,,, but I have been know to keep on the strips for atleast 30mins or more at one time... and I use them sparingly like 2x a week... Again if you are like me these can add up! This package was sent wrapped as it would if you purchased it in the store... and it came faster than excepted, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for that extra kick to their interview, first date, or just because they want to feel alil more confident when speaking and/smiling..</li>
    <li> Amazing results! Family out of the blue asked me if I went to get my teeth whitened ! Definitley a noticable difference.</li>
    <li> I am 3/4 of the way through and have noticed a pretty good improvement.  I usually wipe my teeth off with a towel or cloth before I put them on and they stick really well.  My teeth are definitely whiter.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I notice sensitivity on certain teeth but it usually goes away pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Teeth look great right after use, although it seems that you must use them for fourteen days straight.</li>
    <li> I tried these strips several hours ago&lt;br /&gt;and really pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I have Sjogrens with dry mouth&lt;br /&gt;and also in the past used the mouth insert with whitening&lt;br /&gt;from the dentist.  That burned my mouth lately.&lt;br /&gt;This morning no sensitivity and my always white teeth&lt;br /&gt;are just a little brighter&lt;br /&gt;I will use a couple of times a month&lt;br /&gt;which is fine for this 3 score 10 lady...</li>
    <li> Yes, this product does work. But not very well. Using baking soda and hydrogen peroxide made my teeth whiter than these strips did. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on these again. Also makes teeth extremely sensitive.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and nice results.</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed that this product works. Without even using it consistently I noticed a difference in my teeth. I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for one thing... IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE&#x27;S KICKING IN YOUR TEETH. I have never thought I had sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ve never had any reason too, because my teeth have never shown any sign at all of being sensitive so I don&#x27;t know what to make of this. It may just be me, or it&#x27;s this product. Before it my teeth never hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall elaborate: The first 30 minutes I feel nothing at all, but then out of nowhere, WHAM!! It&#x27;s like someone took a hammer to my teeth! A jolt of pain shoots down from my mouth. At that point I can&#x27;t do it and take the strips off. Unfortunately, random waves of pain keep reoccurring up until the next day!!! It is a huge trade off for having a pearly smile.</li>
    <li> Very effectinve - only used twice for great results!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it and will be sure to use it in the future.</li>
    <li> everything as advertised</li>
    <li> This is working well for me.&lt;br /&gt;The claim is that it takes away 14 years of discoloration. This is good for someone who is 28 but not quite as good for me. I&#x27;m 75 !However my teeth do look a lot better and maybe in 6 months I&#x27;ll try it again.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended the product, probably being realistic about his $300 in office treatment,.in that it might be a disappointment.</li>
    <li> In reading older reviews, I suppose at one time this product may have been good but not anymore.  I experienced no burning and the product stayed on my teeth but did very little whitening...certainly not enough to warrant the price tag connected to it.  Not recommended.  Waste of my money and my time.</li>
    <li> They work great. They are easy to apply and after 30 minutes, my teeth look significantly whiter. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter than the December snow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest white strips for years, but this was the first pack I got that was a 20 day treatment.  It was so effective that I only used the first 10 days, since I didn&#x27;t feel like continued use would lead to anymore whitening.  This is great because now I can save those 10 strips for later in the year when I need a top up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as with all whitening strips, this did cause incredible tooth sensitivity.  Keep in mind it is temporary, but could last for a week or so after you finish the treatment. Here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) Never apply to freshly brushed teeth - do it at the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;2) If you have any signs of receding gums, buy Sensodine toothpaste (or something with at least 5% Potassium), and dab a little of this on to the gum area - you&#x27;ll thank me later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone has teeth that are as conducive to whitening as mine - if you have years of dark yellow stains from smoking, coffee and wine, you may not see the same success.</li>
    <li> The strips get the job done thats for sure. My teeth weren&#x27;t as white as i wanted them to be, and after i used the strips I&#x27;m much happier with my smile.&lt;br /&gt;However, a few days into the treatment my gums started hurting while i had the strips on. Also i noticed some overly white spots on my teeth that the box attributes to &amp;#34;natural defects&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love crest 3D white strips. I get compliments all the time on how white my teeth are. I recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after just the first treatment strip. After 4 treatments I could tell a bigger difference. Just remember to get a knife or toothpick to push the strips in the crevices of your teeth when your putting the strips on. It says on the back of the package which is for top and bottom teeth and it&#x27;s pretty easy to put them on. Don&#x27;t rush putting them on, take your time so you can get your gum line better since some teeth &amp;#34;show&amp;#34; further up on the gum line than others. Just peel them off the back and put them on and that&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> If the instructions are followed, and one modifies the strips so that the strips don&#x27;t cover one&#x27;s gums, these whitening strips are well worth it.</li>
    <li> definitely recommend this one in particular.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the 2 hour one and although it does work quicker - it&#x27;s also painful - and this isn&#x27;t coming from someone who has sensitive teeth or gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removed stains as early as day 3 and on day 14 you already have a BRAND new smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I whiten my teeth pretty often at least once a year, maybe twice.  I usually buy the classic crest white strips because they are cheaper and often have a coupon.  I got these ones to try thinking they would work better at staying in place.  They do stay in place much better than the classic version, you could even drink with them in without them moving.  However, for the additional cost I don&#x27;t think they whiten any better (maybe worse).  I rather save a few bucks and use the classic one, to me they worked better as long as you can keep them on your teeth.</li>
    <li> They really work!!! You can tell the difference in just a few days! But they are strong so they do make your teeth hurt occasionally. Not sure if it was wearing away enamel or what, but I started getting pain in my teeth so I quit for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend them especially if your teeth are not sensitive at all.</li>
    <li> Used as directed, teeth are now noticeably whiter, even in crevices between front teeth. I am very pleased and would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> good whitening.&lt;br /&gt;only issue is the gum ache for a day or two, just like anyother whitening product</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use any whitener products because of sensitive gums and teeth, but these don&#x27;t bother me at all.  I&#x27;m a coffee and wine drinker and these really worked.  I noticed after about 11 days that my teeth were whiter.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips work like a dream, I can&#x27;t believe how white my teeth are and there was not that much discomfort</li>
    <li> My teeth only got a alittle bit of&lt;br /&gt;sensitivity but my gums really took a beating.  They started to burn&lt;br /&gt;and blister from this product.  It&#x27;s kind of impossible to apply them to&lt;br /&gt;the teeth only without touching the gum line.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved using crest white strips but these? Oh! Don&#x27;t even compare to the earlier whitening stripes crest has really outdone themselves I love these strips my teeth are pearly white!!! Thanks crest!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all!  I noticed right away that I had ZERO tooth sensitivity, which seemed odd.  I just finished 10 treatments and there has been no noticeable whitening.  I also noticed the negative reviews seem to be dated May 2015-August 2015.  I am wondering if maybe there was a bad batch of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Crest and am happy with the good customer service I received.  I would not recommend getting this product on Amazon.  It has worked amazingly when I have purchased it through the drug store, but this time I saw no results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not invisible like they want you to think on the commercials. It&#x27;s pretty obvious that you&#x27;re wearing them. The hydrogen peroxide leaves a weird taste in your mouth while you&#x27;re using them and water doesn&#x27;t  help get rid of it. But they work great. Occasionally there is some pain, but that is normal for teeth whitening. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> The product worked well but the price was the same as the supermarket.</li>
    <li> Pros  Cons&lt;br /&gt;* Whitens Teeth  * If you use the white strips everyday, it can cause sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;* Quick  * Bad Taste&lt;br /&gt;* Cheaper than professional bleaching&lt;br /&gt;* Forms to Teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a consumer who wants white teeth without paying ridiculous prices - this is the product for you! I have been using these strips for over a year (not all at one time of course) I re-whiten about every 6 months. This stuff works! I especially love how conforming they are to your teeth and the fact that it&#x27;s something you can do on the go. I&#x27;m able to whiten my teeth while also working around the house and getting little jobs done while I&#x27;m waiting. I was always self-conscious about my teeth because no matter how much I brushed them - I still couldn&#x27;t get them white! That&#x27;s when I started using Crest 3D white strips and it changed my life - it made me feel way more secure and self-confident. If you&#x27;re someone who suffers from yellow or discolored teeth - this product will work wonders. I promise you.</li>
    <li> Definitely made a difference.  Was please with the fact that there was no sensitivity issues or anything associated with some products.</li>
    <li> I am giving this two stars only because it&#x27;s easy to use and not messy. I did not see my teeth stains get any lighter.</li>
    <li> the best , my teeth are pure white, i just love this product! i do refer this  to ll my friends</li>
    <li> Super effective. If you miss a couple days in between, don&#x27;t freak out- you don&#x27;t have to start all over. It works the same whether used every day or skip a few. Use your whitening tooth paste as an adjunct. Keep up on the brushing 2-3x/day and your teeth won&#x27;t ever revert back to how they used to look.</li>
    <li> This product whitened my teeth painlessly and effortlessly in very little time. However, like three months later I went to go get my teeth cleaned at the dentist, and he found four cavities! I hadn&#x27;t been to the dentist in 13 years, so this was very inconvenient news. After all was said and done, I&#x27;d spent close to $1,000. It would be absurd to blame this on the strips, so instead I will adamantly proclaim this is somehow Obama&#x27;s fault. My teeth are still very white, so this product gets four stars. It would have gotten five - but Obama.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, but I&#x27;m sold! The first time I used them, the difference was profound. The second and third strips, done on consecutive days, turned my teeth from yellow to almost white. Much easier to use than those expensive plastic tube things you have to boil to get into the right shape.</li>
    <li> Wow! I used  a professional whitening system back in the late 90s and once in a while a generic whitener since. The first time using this, I left the strips on for an hour. Wow!! So white now!! They are great. The only drawback is they are so sticky and trying to place them correctly will take some getting used to because if they even barely touch your teeth, it is hard to pull them off to reposition.&lt;br /&gt;They are so thin and flimsy feeling, yet strong. I think if they were to make the strips just a tad bit more rigid, that it might help, but just a tad more. I have used Rite Aid brand and they are like collar stays, they&#x27;re so rigid. Too much so. They are made of wax. So heating them up a little helps, but it&#x27;s a lot of work and they don&#x27;t whiten near as well as the Crest 3D.</li>
    <li> These are the best whites trips out there. Everyone comments on my pearly whites. It only takes a short amount of time to really see noticeable results.</li>
    <li> Love crest white strips.  They definitely whiten my teeth.  I actually just use one strip every other week and my teeth stay white.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, it cause Sensitive Teeth. You could eat nothing after use it. Never waste your money. Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> They work great and the results last a long time. Also they strips have lasted me around 6 months since you dont have to use all of them at once after you get the results you want keep some for touch ups every 2 or 3 months.</li>
    <li> It got to my house super fast and it was exactly what I wanted. They work GREAT! I would recommend thes.</li>
    <li> I used these and after the first night i didn&#x27;t see much difference but i remained optimistic that they would work, so the next night i decided to leave them on for more than half an hour, well i laid down and i accidentally fell asleep because i was very tired, i woke up 8 hours later and felt how sensitive my teeth were, i took off the strips and threw them away and when i looked in the mirror to check out my teeth, to my shock i found that they were brighter than the sun, the whiteness was almost blinding and everyone at work asked me what was up with my teeth, im now self conscience to smile because im afraid of blinding others. Unfortunately im very careful with how i smile and make sure to cover up my teeth with my lips but my teeth are amazingly white and these sure do what they are advertised to do.</li>
    <li> tried few of them, after using, feel my gum is hurting. and didn&#x27;t see result , like whiter than before using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these white strips once a year for two years now. They do what you expect: they whiten your teeth noticeably. I wouldn&#x27;t say your teeth gleam perfectly white immediately, but I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my white teeth and people have asked what brand of whitener I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a coffee drinker who employs these yearly to take some of the stain off. You&#x27;ll see results in a couple of days. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, however I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that someone with sensitive teeth uses these white strips (I can&#x27;t speak for others). After the first year of using them I noticed my teeth were slightly more sensitive, and during the second year of using them I had to stop using them for a couple of days due to cold sensitivity and slight discomfort (nothing too nuts).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with this product, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in going a couple of shades whiter. Just use caution, and keep in mind that you are degrading the enamel of your teeth, which can lead to increased sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I feel like I saw a difference about 4 days in and then my teeth pretty much stayed the same. I don&#x27;t have very yellow teeth in the first place but they could use some whitening and these strips just kinda brightened them a little, I wouldn&#x27;t say they changed shades. I am a little disappointed because of the price... would have expected them to work more.</li>
    <li> Yes it works but you pay dearly. It hurts so bad after like 20 min. You will regret using it.</li>
    <li> This product can make my teeth a little sensitive, so when this happens I use it every two to three days.  But this stuff really works.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed!</li>
    <li> Wore the strips twice, started to notice a difference in whiteness however the subsequent teeth pain became excessive. I tried for a shorter amount of time the second time around didn&#x27;t make it better. Product seems to work, appears my teeth just can&#x27;t handle it.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have custom made trays this is the best out there. Simple and effective. I noticed my teeth got much whiter after a couple weeks of daily use. It will not change overnight but over a couple weeks my teeth got very white and all at a good price.</li>
    <li> OMG THESE HURT ME SO BAD!! I WISH THEY DIDNT CUZ I NO THEY WORK BUT DEFFINITLY NOT WORTH THE PAIN..ITS NOT GOING AWAY</li>
    <li> Made my teeth really sensitive.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase! Feeling much more confident about my smile. This product really does work .</li>
    <li> These definitely work - teeth get lighter. I don&#x27;t have the problem others have reported with pain unless I leave them on for over an hour.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to see my teeth whiter after three days of use, but I started seeing noticeable results after the first use! I&#x27;m only a quarter way done with my strips and am very pleased with results. I also love that these strips don&#x27;t slip! I&#x27;ve had really tough stains that settled for years, but so far after a few days of using these strips, those stains are slowly going away! I highly recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s trying to whiten their teeth-even if those stains are tough to remove!</li>
    <li> It was with some trepidation that I ordered this product thinking it would be like all the others, despite the fantastic reviews I was reading overall.&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I surprised when within three days I was seeing a lighter shade emerge from my coffee and smokers stained teeth! Whilst they were not overly yellow, they were certainly not white. On top of that I had a more porous tooth at the front (aagghh!) which was affecting my smiling confidently for at least the last 7 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this was going to require a more strategic approach to bring it up to the shade/s that my other teeth were starting to exhibit. So, I measured the tooth and used one &#x27;top teeth&#x27; strip, cutting the required amount from the top strip and sticking it to this tooth every other day.&lt;br /&gt;I have been absolutely amazed at the results and will definitely purchase this product again when needed. I am in my second week of every second day usage so literally, within 5 days I have noticed an exceptionally significant improvement!!&lt;br /&gt;Reporting on sensitivities - though I have a very high pain threshold, I will admit to some sensitivity but nothing very painful. Just be conscious not to gulp hot and cold drinks!  And, as advised in other reviews, do not brush your teeth beforehand as this will certainly increase sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product highly enough! Go for it!!! You&#x27;ll be smiling like a Cheshire cat before you know it!! :)</li>
    <li> Not interested in ordering again. I can get cheaper at our drugstore.</li>
    <li> I am almost done with this whole treatment and my teeth look amazing! Very happy with it and would recommend :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. It does all that it promises. I whiten my teeth with this twice a year. I even bought some for my husband.</li>
    <li> These have made my teeth a lot whiter. I noticed the difference after just three uses. I&#x27;ve ordered another box to use as touch ups in the future.</li>
    <li> Convenient and works very well!</li>
    <li> it works the front teeth. The strips aren&#x27;t wide enough to cover past the canines, so for those of you with wide, toothy smiles: tough.</li>
    <li> It definitely removed 90% of the yellowness from my teeth  . I was hoping for whiter results though. I did experience sensitivity in my teeth and gums on the second day but was fine after. I would repurchase to quickly whiten before some event but I am going to try another whitening method.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and item exactly as described. I noticed a whiter smile after about 5 days and have used sparingly since then. Great product</li>
    <li> These are the gentlest of the strips I have used and they work amazingly well!!!&lt;br /&gt;Get your teeth the white you want and then maintain 1X per week. I get compliments on my white teeth all the time.</li>
    <li> Works well ... like it alot</li>
    <li> They did whiten my teeth but I am in so much pain the next day. I don&#x27;t believe that I can continue to use the box. My teeth are so sensitive and I&#x27;m in so much pain. I really want a whiter smile and my dentist recommended that I try some type of over the counter whitening treatment, but I have never had sensitivity issues and right now I can&#x27;t even sit in class without almost crying from pain. This is absolutely terrible.</li>
    <li> These work well but I find that they make my teeth sensitive after using for only 2 days at 15 minute treatments. I started just treating every 4 to 5 days and still get whitening with less sensitivity.</li>
    <li> These Crest White strips are perfect for maintenance. I usually use the intensive version of these strips, however these are really good to use on an everyday basis for only a half an hour!  The stronger ones burn my guns and you&#x27;re supposed to wear them for 2 hours so it was always difficult for me to find the perfect time to wear them.  These Crest white strips are perfect.  I wake up in the morning, brush my teeth, and pop these little strips on and do the whole shower routine and get ready for work.  By the time I&#x27;m about to walk out the door, it&#x27;s time to take of these strips.  They also don&#x27;t leave any nasty residue on my teeth.  Overall, I am happy with the convenience and also they are good for maintaining the whitening effects of the stronger more intense strips.</li>
    <li> Works great! I saw results within a week and I barely felt any sensitivity except on really cold days. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t finish all of them I think I have maybe 5 strips left but I was happy with the result.. Not a big difference but yet it makes my teeth a bit brighter specially on the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I look at my teeth in the mirror I don&#x27;t noticed a so much difference from before I used them,  but when I look at myself in the pictures taken with someone else next to me my teeth is noticeably brighter.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping, Would recommend. A+</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of tea, so thought I&#x27;d use this to try and combat staining my teeth too much. Although it wasn&#x27;t quite as white as I&#x27;d hope (albeit my expectations were probably a little too high), I definitely saw results after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Works well and fast. U can break it up in two treatments.</li>
    <li> I am almost through the first box, the strips are doing a good job of whiting my Coffey stained teeth.  It will most likely take another box to bring them to the degree of whiteness I want, but for the price compared to a what dentist charges, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> These strips did the trick.  Brightened up my teeth and I noticed they were whiter right away.  My teeth did get sensitive after so many uses so beware if u have sensitive teeth.  I just took breaks in between uses and that helped.</li>
    <li> I did not use it consecutively because my teeth were very sensitive after each use. I do not recommend if you have sensitive teeth. Not instant results - if you are impatient this is not for you.</li>
    <li> My order came quickly, and the item was just as I expected it would be. I&#x27;ve never used white strips before, but they were easy to use and definitely whitened my smile - which is great! I would definitely order these again when I need to.</li>
    <li> exactly what it says it does its job to lighten your teeth.  may cause sensitivity. I would recommend using it every other day to lessen that sensation.</li>
    <li> This product works well; in my opinion, all the Crest whitners work well.  I drink at least two cups of coffee daily and also occasionally drink red wine. My teeth do become yellow over time, and these products keep the yellow away and my smile fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips stay on very well. The first time I used them, they were quite difficult to remove. The next day, I rinsed my mouth with warm water and then gently peeled. I repeated that process until they came off.  After they&#x27;re off, I used my toothbrush without any product to remove the reside. My teeth felt very clean after the brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are usually sensitive with all these products. I kept these strips on for 30 minutes the first time, but had sensitivity issues the next morning. The subsequent uses were for 20 minutes, and that was better.  My bottom teeth are more sensitive than the top, and aren&#x27;t seen as much when I smile. I use the bottom strips every other day to minimize the sensitivity, but use the top strips daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I find that using the box over a years&#x27; time works best for me. So, with the 20 strips, I will use 5 strips every three months. In that way, my teeth stay relatively stain-free and the sensitivity is kept to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that you tailor your own program to meet your needs and sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, I feel that this is a good product, I&#x27;m pleased with the on-going product enhancements and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Hassle-free, quick and easy to use and they work. Great buy I will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to lighten their teeth. It&#x27;s not as good as going to a professional but close enough!</li>
    <li> To those who want a bright, white smile, this is the product for you! It is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> These Whitestrips are the best on the market in my estimation.  Amazon is the least expensive of any place I&#x27;ve seen to date.  They are easy to use, easy to order, and are delivered promptly.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I had been vaguely interested in tooth whitening in the past, but not enough to pay my dentist to do it. I was skeptical that the various &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; type products on the market would work, so I was eager to try the Crest 3D Whitestrips. I had never used such a product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how well they stuck to my teeth. The first couple of times, being unfamiliar with the process, I didn&#x27;t get things lined up properly, but eventually I figured it out. I never had an issue with the strip loosening before its time was up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertising says that you will see results after three days, and indeed I did. I took photographs to compare and there was a definite difference. The longer I used them, the whiter my teeth were. I was not aiming for blinding, just a reduction of the yellow, and I got that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside was that I noticed some irritation of the gumline after using the strips for a few days. This was minor and disappeared after I finished the package.</li>
    <li> I purchased the strips to keep the teeth looking nice for in-between dental visits. They work great, very easy to use not nearly as messy as gels and more accuracte placement on the teeth. I actually saw a very noticeable difference after about 10 days. Dental visit next week, so I will buy another 20-count in about 3 months.</li>
    <li> Still doesnt grip onto my teeth and instead of getting it white it hurts. Thinking of returning it thank you</li>
    <li> My teeth have never been whiter and I have only used 6 of them so far. They don&#x27;t make my sensitive teeth hurt like other whiteners either.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery of my product. I havent tried the whitestrips yet but do use the toothpaste and mouthwash. I am looking forward to amplifying my existing results.</li>
    <li> I have used 8 pieces so far, The results are not that noticeable.i use it very 3 days, however, my teeth still get sensitive after every use, sometimes it can last 8-12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everybody</li>
    <li> The product works great! Along with some whitening toothpast I bought my teeth look 3 times better than they did before.</li>
    <li> I used it every day for 1/2 hour for 8 days and saw great results.  There was no pain or sensitivity. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple of days, and I already see a nice improvement. I&#x27;m looking forward with anticipation to the changes after 10 days of use.  No sensitivity issues at this point in time. The strips stay in place once they&#x27;ve been positioned.</li>
    <li> 14-year-old daughter used this after having braces removed (dentist confirmed this product was safe for her age). Easy to use and results were fantastic.</li>
    <li> this product is 100% to my satisfaction .couldn&#x27;t be better .</li>
    <li> Sorry i don&#x27;t found good results after used in 3D White Crest.&lt;br /&gt;I will go to Dental clinic for good results</li>
    <li> Excellent, very white teeth and always get lots of compliments on hiow white  my teeth are. And no sensitivity. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I noticed a HUGE difference. I followed all the directions to the T and I have used about 6 strips so far and I&#x27;m already a good 2-3 shades whiter. They are individually packaged and although at first I thought the strips looked flimsy they do in fact stay in place and do not slip or slide any where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may experience a slight sensitivity when using these but for me it was only momentarily. It could be all in my head but my teeth felt cleaner after using these. Happy with the results and I will continue to use them. The box came with 20 treatments for top and bottom.</li>
    <li> These strips are pricey for the results you get. I have nice teeth and I wanted a pick me up. I was surprised by the results I got, I have some surface stains and I did see a difference but maybe only a couple shades. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is looking for dramatic results because your not going to get them.</li>
    <li> My matron of honor suggested that I use the white strips a few weeks before my wedding. I&#x27;m not usually into whitening products, but you only get married once, right? I was happy with the whiteness of my teeth in my pictures. They looked natural, but much brighter than before I used the strips.</li>
    <li> Honestly, those who complain about the little bit of burning or pain with these just need to get over it. The price of vanity; deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;Had whitening effect after the very first use. Very highly recommended product. Easy to use, good results.</li>
    <li> I bought these a while ago and not only did it work really well, the results are lasting a long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about 2/3 of the way done with the pack, and my teeth are noticeably whiter. A word of caution, you probably WILL experience tooth sensitivity. I did. I woke up in the morning with them feeling VERY sensitive, and sore, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a white smile for my wedding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, if you can deal with the tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> These really do work in case anyone is skeptical, but they may have less effects if your teeth are already pretty white.  We all know people with some kind of yellow shade on their teeth.  This would be great for those people!</li>
    <li> Very effortless and painless.  The half hour was much beeter than a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;It cleaned well but not so well where the teeth were crowed and hard to reach  (I have some slightly overlapping teech).&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent product an dprobably the best of its kind on the market</li>
    <li> great buy &amp; they work!  my teeth are a little sensitive, so i use them every other day for a week and then use them whenever i feel it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend, teeth become very sensitive after first use. Tried it for three days and the sensitivity worsened teeth ached all day long. I didnt have sensitive teeth prior to this. 2 month have gone by and the sensitivity did go away after I stoped using them.</li>
    <li> They make my teeth so sensitive I can&#x27;t even eat! I used as instructed and didn&#x27;t see a difference  never will I purchase this again</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what else to say other than this product does what it says it does. Whitens your teeth and does it well.</li>
    <li> I will be the first to say that this product is not for everyone.  For those who have the right type of enamel that is strong and not overly porous you should notice a dramatic whitening effect.  I have given this product though to my family members and they have very mixed results.  For my sister-in-law they actually highlighted the discolorations of her teeth which was really disappointing.  She drinks a ton of coffee and has soft enamel.  So while this whitened some parts of her teeth it did nothing to others.  She tried this product twice with the same results.  My dentist literally cannot believe how reactive my teeth are to this product.  I actually have professional whitening trays and this product works better for my teeth than doing professional whitening.  I do have severe sensitivity and gum irritation when using the professional whitening gel and trays.  So that is why I consulted with my dentist as to what he recommended for me.  Do not get me wrong, the professional trays got my teeth white, but I did not want the side effects that came with it.  With that said, I strongly recommend consulting your dentist before trying this product especially if you have a good dentist patient relationship.  I believe they can definitely tell you if over the counter treatments will be effective based upon your teeth and dentition.  If this product is recommended for you then definitely try this whitening kit.  Since my teeth are already white, I use this kit as a touch up twice a year.  I always get a good expiration date with a lot of longevity when I buy this product on Amazon.  You definitely want to always make sure you have a fresh product whether you buy this on Amazon or locally.  So check the expiration when you receive or before buying.  I personally could not beat the Amazon pricing locally for this product.  I also love that Amazon offered me a coupon when I put it in my car so I saved even more than I first expected.  This arrived quickly to my condo.  These strips stay securely on your teeth until you pull them off.  I always use a paper towel or tissue when I pull these off.  If not the tips of my fingers will get white from the whitening gel. This usually goes away after a day or so.  But if you use a paper towel or tissue you should not experience this.  I do not have pain in my teeth or gums after using these.  I do experience dry mouth and tongue though the day after.  So I really try to stay well hydrated when using these.  Sometimes I also get chapped lips but that side effect goes away 48 hours after I am done using these.  I also like that this product does not have any after taste or chemical taste when there are in your mouth.  This product definitely works better if you do not brush your teeth before using.  Of course make sure your teeth are clean so swish some water before placing these on your teeth, but this product works better for me personally if I do not use them immediately after brushing.  For those who say they experience side effects or do not get a level of whitening they expect then I recommend making sure you are following the directions to the letter and if you are then contact Crest for a refund.  Just make sure you have proof of purchase.  Good luck if you decide to try these.  I hope they work for you as well as they do for me and that you get a super Amazon price too!se strips stay securely on your teeth until you pull them off.

    <li> it took me a couple of times to get used to applying them and having them in my mouth for 30 minutes, but once i got the hang of it, easy and effective.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to whiten your teeth magically.  It&#x27;s for great to get your teeth to get whiter and to maintain that way.  You&#x27;ll need to see a dentist every 6 months.</li>
    <li> These are the only white strips from Crest that my husband and I use, because they really stick to your teeth! You also only use them once a day instead of twice like some of the other strips. Costly, but worth it!</li>
    <li> These strips really work, but with my sensitive teeth, even with Sensodyne it&#x27;s too painful for me to use as prescribed. I am usually OK for the first couple of days, but then the pain starts to increase. I don&#x27;t do the 2 weeks in a row thing, but I use them once every couple month or so to keep my smile brighter.</li>
    <li> I noticed my teeth were starting to look a little yellow, so I bought a pack of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one every other day 3 times and it got me to where I was happy. Now I just use them whenever I notice some yellowing... about 6 times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any sensitivity since I started using these, though that could be because I use them so infrequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stick to your teeth perfectly, though I do try to dry off my teeth a bit before applying. After using them, you&#x27;ll noticed a residue left on your teeth, but it comes off easily with brushing.</li>
    <li> I like the product.Will buy again in the future. Works great but the sender didn&#x27;t send it to me in original package.</li>
    <li> Whitening very noticeable after 20 days. Have received many compliments on the whiteness of my teeth. Be wary of sensitivity - I definitely had some sensitivity to the strips.</li>
    <li> I used Crest White Strips to whiten my teeth years ago and now I just do a touch-up of a few treatments once a month.</li>
    <li> There crest 3 d white professional effects teeth whitening strips work very well. and only 30 min a day. you should try</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really, really happy with this product!  The price is excellent, they are easy to use and they do a wonderful job of whitening your teeth.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this for maybe a few weeks now and i&#x27;ve used the entire box. kinda disappointed because there were no results, so maybe i need to get the stronger whitening strips.</li>
    <li> first of all when i received it i was really mad that it didn&#x27;t come in the original packaging and box because how am i supposed to know if they are still in date. second i would like to have the box for storage but now they are in a plastic bag... ya its great they were half the price than they are in the store but how can i trust them when they aren&#x27;t in the box with plastic wrap... wont be buying these again off here, ill pay more for the actual box....&lt;br /&gt;the only good thing i can say is that they came in way before the time online said which is great....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Did a swell job. A little surprised that it didn&#x27;t whiten a bit more. For &amp;#34;professional effects&amp;#34; I just expected more. We will see how long it lasts. Just finished the 20 days today and it was worth the $34 (BF sale). A little annoying on your teeth, but worth the wait!!</li>
    <li> These strips did the trick. I was looking for a brighter smile and I got it however, with slight discomfort nothing extreme. Overall I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have definitely seen the difference. My wife loves the results. I would surely recommend this product to anyone...........</li>
    <li> I find the best pricing for Crest whitening strips at Amazon.  WalMart and others are way over priced.  These are the only strips I have found that actually whiten and stay securely on your teeth.  I sometimes leave them on too long they are so comfortable.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> They really work but do make your teeth sensitive if used two nights or days in a row once ever third or fourth day work for me till I see a improvement.</li>
    <li> I use the white strips for maintenance and they seem to be doing a fine job so far. I really like the way the strips adhere to my teeth. Earlier versions did not adhere very well.</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments on my smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the fitting isn&#x27;t perfect and you get a mouthful of gunk that you just have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do adhere to your teeth however, make sure that you wipe down your teeth while</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical but they actually worked. I was leaving them on for a half hour, once a day for five days in a row.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth, so when starting them I would use one set at night about every 3-4 days.  I have noticed my teeth can handle more frequent applications now.  I don&#x27;t use them daily, I do maybe 2 times per week, but can go two days in a row.  I have dental work so I have to be careful not to whiten my real teeth beyond the color of my crowns.  These do VERY well removing coffee stains (I love coffee) and giving a brighter smile, while still letting me control the amount of color change.</li>
    <li> works well and arrived on time. Thanks</li>
    <li> Worked surprisingly well. Pro- the strips actually stay in place. Con-20 days is kind of a lot. All in all, I would recommend these to a friend.</li>
    <li> This works cause my moms teeth were extremely yellow and stained due to drinking a lot of tea and coffee and her teeth are amazing now. They are really clean and white! She loves it and i love it!!</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Makes my teeth white and I get a lot of compliments from people asking what I use on my teeth</li>
    <li> Apparently some kind of push advertising has allowed this page to appear on my browser several times a week for months. I know it&#x27;s easily deleted and ignored, but I am really beginning to resent this kind of intrusion. The people from Crest who push this kind of marketing should know they&#x27;ve lost me as a customer. If you are reading this and have gotten this annoying form of spam, please let Crest know through Amazon&#x27;s comments forum</li>
    <li> I got these strips hoping they would be like the original whitestrips that I used some years back. However the strips are made of thicker plastic that really sticks to your teeth and so far the results are somewhat disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and a great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> You can cut them in half the long way, just stick them to the front of you teeth, and there you go! You have 80 stripes!!! totally worth the price. I only used them every other day for a month before the wedding , my teeth are still white after 3 months!</li>
    <li> Great product, ready to order again.  It really works.</li>
    <li> The product does whiten your teeth however the strips do not mold into the crevasse of your teeth :(</li>
    <li> These white strips work wonderful ! I was completly satisfied with my results. I could of finished when I was halfway through the box I was so satisfied with the outcome, but finished just to make them even more pearly white! Love them :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the old tooth whiting application trays and all the other methods to get my tea drinking teeth whiter, but these strips surprised me.  They are quite easy to apply and the first time I removed the strips, I was surprised by how well the strips had adhered to my less than straight teeth  Although \\&quot;see results in three days\\&quot; is hyperbole, my wife did see the difference after a week of twice a day applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, visible results, what&#x27;s not to like?  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product but still not as good as going to a dentist and getting a professional whitening job done.  But then who wants to pay that kind of price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I question whether results are really that obvious after 3 days.  However, longer use does bring about a noticeable improvement.  It&#x27;s relatively easy to use, claims to be safe for teeth (something I&#x27;m not qualified to comment on) and a good alternative to going to the dentist.  That plus Crest is a recognizable name in the field.  Worth a try but don&#x27;t expect truly professional results.</li>
    <li> I rarely bother to write reviews but this product delivers as promised. After only 3 days my teeth are noticeably whiter and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what they look like after 20 treatments!&lt;br /&gt;I had one of the zoom whitening treatments several years ago and was disappointed in the results and how long the whitening lasted. I can honestly say the Crest whitening strips have whitened as much or more as the zoom treatment and the best part is I&#x27;ve saved hundreds of dollars AND I can easily touch up whenever needed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no gum discomfort so far. The strips have really come a long way. These really bond with your teeth and once the strips are on the product foams up under the strips so even if your teeth are not perfectly even (like mine) the whitening stuff is still getting in there. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> It works ok, but did not whiten my teeth as good as I thought it would do.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Was very pleased at how fast this product worked.  Saw results in only 3 days.  After about 10 days use desired results were achieved.  Experienced no irritation or side effects.  Product adheres to teeth extremely well.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working.  The non-slip strips are great!  I have previously tried whitening trays and was not at all happy about the taste or the results (lack of!).  Will definitely purchase these Crest strips again.</li>
    <li> I really like the Whitestrips. My teeth are noticeably whiter now. The strips also stick to your teeth much better than the old strips. My teeth are a bit sensitive and so sometimes I skipped a day here and there. They weren&#x27;t as sensitive as these as they were to the old Crest strips, though. Overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I was skeptical because my gums are receding just a bit...not noticibly to others, but I know they are. I was a little afraid to try this product for that reason, but the product was gentle and I could really tell the difference in the color of my teeth. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I had tried Whitestrips when they were first introduced about 8 years ago.  They were slimy, hard to put on and did not stay on.  They were somewhat effective but not nearly as strong as an in-office dentist treatment.  This product improves upon the originals in several ways but still does not compare to a true professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;1) Easy to put on (once you get the pouch open!)&lt;br /&gt;2) These actually stay on as opposed to the originals that constantly slid off&lt;br /&gt;3) Relatively non-invasive and non-slimy while on&lt;br /&gt;4) Produce noticeable, although not dramatic results&lt;br /&gt;5) Relatively inexpensive at about $35 for 20 sets of strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;Really the only one is that they just don&#x27;t work as well as advertised.  Granted, as I said they do work.  However, if you&#x27;ve ever had any type of professional whitening treatment you know that there are more powerful options out there.  That being said, they come at a price tag far above the Whitestrips cost of $35.</li>
    <li> I did not notice a difference after three days (what the packages advertises) but after five days I did notice brighter, not whiter teeth. My teeth did become sensitive but that was expected from my experiences using tooth whitening products before. Around day 8 my teeth were a few shades whiter but my gums began to ache. I continued to use the product not really associating the gum pain with Crest 3d (silly me) and the pain got worse.  On day 11, I stopped using Crest 3d and after two more days the pain went away.&lt;br /&gt;The product works, but with painful side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my last review I finished using Crest 3d white strips every other day or every three days. The result was amazing!I recently went to my dentist and he asked me who did my whitening treatment because they did a really good job.  He actually thought that my teeth were whitened professionally!  Since then I have had many people comment on how white my teeth are.  By skipping days between strips I avoided the tooth sensitivity and gum pain and achieved unbelievable results. I do recommend this product and change my review to 4 stars. But be careful.</li>
    <li> The white strips work great.  With the new advance seal the strips stays put so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it it slipping off.  Overall it did make my teeth noticeably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall was after each day of putting them on you might get that tooth sensitivity that everyone was talking about.  All i do is just give a day or two for that feeling to go away and just put it on again.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife who was using regular Whitestrips a few months earlier. She said the sensitivity attacks are decidedly higher with these, although they do whiten noticeably faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what is that tradeoff worth to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final analysis, she isn&#x27;t particularly fond of pain but still loved these. Take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Worked as promised.  Pretty amazing considering the price.  Teeth were very stained with coffee and dark yellow -- by the 17th day -- there was a big change.  The teeth aren&#x27;t blaring white, but look a normal shade and shiny clean. Whiteness depends where you&#x27;re starting on the teeth stain scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use -- 30 minutes each night watching TV and no mess.  Highly recommend!  Using with crest 3D white toothpaste and that seems to help a lot.</li>
    <li> i totally recommend this product it is certainly cheaper than going to a dentist , a really economical way to have a brighter whiter teeth , you should keep the strips for 30 mins instead of 20 mins the results are cool !</li>
    <li> Hello everyone,&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product (my first box). I was following the directions...with no results at all.&lt;br /&gt;Got frustrated, couldn&#x27;t believe it, ended up buying my second box after reading a lot of great reviews. Started using it different way on my stubborn teeth.&lt;br /&gt;So let me share how it works for me.... I use it one time a day for one hour. Seal one tooth at a time with my finger nail very carefully not to damage the strip. After one hour I take it off and brush my teeth with kids toothpaste. I have 6 strips to go, my teeth are not sensitive at all (the brushing after with kids toothpaste is very important to get all the residue off and make it stop working). My teeth are finally totally white!!&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I would share it with you...thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy the strips after reading the great reviews they received, although I was a bit skeptic since I did not see an ADA Approved stamp. I used the strips twice a day, by the third day (after using a total of six strips), My family noticed the difference and told me my teeth looked whiter and cleaner. I used a total of 10 strips and now I use one strip every three days. I brush my teeth with the Crest 3D White Vivid toothpaste right after taking the strips off, and then again before bed. I never felt any pain or discomfort while wearing them.  I noticed how much better my teeth looked when i wore my red lipstick, when before all I could see was the yellowish stains along my lower gum line. The only Con to it would how gross it feels when the strips are being removed,  they have a very strong grip and all the bubbles and saliva mixture get stuck to it, then to your finger... But hey, for noticeably whiter teeth it&#x27;s a small price to pay!  I have already recomended this product to my family. I bought it for $33 no tax and free shipping! Great buy since the exact same box cost $[...] at Target.  Now im always smiling!</li>
    <li> Worked much better than expected. My teeth have always been stained but this product did whiten them significantly.. Very pleased...</li>
    <li> My teeth were not yellow by any means, but I wanted to see if I could get my smile a little brighter.  I had used white strips before, but not in about 10 years or so.  I am on my last day of this 20 day kit.  The first day I used it, while the strips were on my teeth my gums became irritated.  They turned white and burned a little bit, and I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them anymore.  Despite this, I kept them on and used them again the next day, and I&#x27;ve had no problems ever since.  I could tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth within just a few days of using this.  It is not dramatic, but I didn&#x27;t feel that I really needed it to be.  If my teeth were very discolored, I think I would use a stronger product or get my teeth professionally whitened.  But I am very pleased with this product for the extra bit of whiteness I was looking for and received.</li>
    <li> Worked for me, but became a little too sensitive when it came to the cold.</li>
    <li> I read reviews so I bought this product and tried it.  I am satisfied with the results and would recommend this to others also.</li>
    <li> these worked great and feel way better than the classic strips since they don&#x27;t have that gel on them. these are dry strips that stick on easy and don&#x27;t slide all around</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago with a coupon for a great price. Crest Whitestrips are my go to product when I want to whiten my teeth (seriously, people can&#x27;t stop telling me how white my teeth are after using them.)</li>
    <li> Teeth were noticeably whiter after just a couple applications.</li>
    <li> I tried it for three days and found there seemed to be some effect!!! Sometimes my teeth could be sensitive due to those chemical reactions, but you should know that&#x27;s how whitening things work! So overall it&#x27;s a good product. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice that much difference considering the price.I only purchased it because my daughter recommended.it.Would not buy again.Too difficult to remove</li>
    <li> I used these strips exactly as prescribed and I did not notice any difference in whiteness. Maybe you have to do a few sessions but then it becomes expensive.</li>
    <li> I used a box of the original Pro strips. They were fine, but really challenging to apply and keep in place. These correct that issue completely. In fact, these can be a tiny bit challenging to remove. The downside is there&#x27;s a lot less product in the new box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Whitestrips for years and just keep improving.. I&#x27;ve had dental whitening, and I&#x27;ve used Luster as well as other brands but nothings seems to do the trick like these do. :) Thanks Crest!!</li>
    <li> Worked better than I expected and very quick.  I could actually save like half the box for later.  One happy girl.</li>
    <li> Worked Great...Some Sensitivity but I spread out the treatments...At first I was  appalled at the price but after the results these were less expensive than the dentist whitening treatments.</li>
    <li> This product always work so well!!!!! I wish it&#x27;s a little cheaper, but it really delivers result so I guess I will have to stick with it :)</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, but can cause gum line to recede a bit. These work okay but I preferred Rembrandt whitening strips more.</li>
    <li> Works ok but its not amazing magic results.  It does what it says it does but its not stellar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a smoker, coffee drinker, and soda lover...and this product definitely helped whiten.  However, the edges of my teeth are not completely whitened. I use baking soda to get in the crevasses. Pretty good product though.</li>
    <li> Worked for me, teeth look whiter</li>
    <li> I was really happy with these strips which were very easy to apply, and you don&#x27;t have to wear them for very long each time - far better than using a tray. It&#x27;s been the most effective product I&#x27;ve tried so far, and they&#x27;re a great price!</li>
    <li> Truth be told, I received a sample pack from my girlfriend to test out this product. To get straight to the point, this product does exactly what it advertises. The instructions suggest leaving the film on for about 30 mins. However, Depending on the sensitivity of your teeth, you can leave the product on anywhere between 15-30 mins. I was definitely impressed after trying out the product. After consulting with my friend and seeing it featured on a popular men&#x27;s grooming site (ManPossible.com), I went ahead and made the commitment to purchase the full kit. I am very satisfied with this product, after a few days of usage the improvement was definitely noticeable. The only downside to this product is the uncomfortable feel of the film in your mouth. The longer it stays in your mouth, the softer and slimier it get. I guess 30 mins of uncomfortable is worth it in order to have a great smile. Beats paying hundreds to visit a dentist, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
    <li> Better than most I have used.</li>
    <li> Seem to work Ok, the teeth are whited, but there are still minor stains.</li>
    <li> It whitened my teeth but don&#x27;t expect miracles. It also made my teeth sensitive and had to take breaks like a few days in between</li>
    <li> works just like i expected</li>
    <li> I rarely want white teeth but if I do, I want them to look natural and for it to be safe. These did not irritate my mouth or cause a problem and after two days I noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> more work then its worth</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t finished using all the strips yet, started a couple months ago but my teeth ache so bad after using them that I dread it. I even waited a day or two in between. Also, I have noticed a difference, stains are lightening but in between my teeth are yellowish :( I need professional whitening at the dentist. I think this product is best for light stains and nonsensitive teeth. I had no problems applying the strips or keeping them on. Just takes a gentle touch when removing them from the package, and helps to dry your teeth &amp; gums with a towel first.</li>
    <li> Love these crest whitestrips! Better than whitening at the dentist!</li>
    <li> I really like this item, and it cleans the stain on my teeth, it is so good! and I used it once a week, otherwise my teeth will become very sensitive and it hurts.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found any OTC product that works better, but these aren&#x27;t magical like they claim to be, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference.  However, I do see a difference, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying them for the fourth time.</li>
    <li> These 30 minute strips are great. I saw results from the first set I used but they left my teeth a little sensitive about 3 hours after using them but the sensitivity went away after the first night. I still use these I just make sure to use Sensodyne toothpaste only to avoid the sensitivity. They work though, my teeth are whiter after every set…</li>
    <li> I use these strips daily and can really notice the difference. I drink coffee daily and these are a great product to turn those yellow stains back to white. Upon using them for a short period of time every day, I noticed how sensitive it made my teeth. However, I switched my toothpaste to Sensodyne and haven&#x27;t had a problem since. If you want a product that works, stays on your teeth well, and can really make a difference, buy these..</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t whiten fully, still some yellowing but has lightened my teeth enough to where I&#x27;m satisfied.  Not too keen about the taste but I suppose most of the whitening products are like that.  I would use it again.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product and service.</li>
    <li> I used for the first time and it works like a wonder. I bought 4 boxes and with the first strips im seeing results.</li>
    <li> These strips are alright, they don&#x27;t do quite all that they promise. Most of the poor reviews I&#x27;ve read seem to, having been through the process, not fully understood the way in which you were supposed to do this. And for the people for whom it worked phenomenal, I&#x27;m happy for them. I followed all the instructions, including the restrictions on certain liquids (like coffee or red wine that can stain), and they did an ok job, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use these again.</li>
    <li> only used it once, too painful for my teeth. maybe someday when i don&#x27;t need to work i&#x27;ll use it again</li>
    <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened about 15 yrs ago but they have restained with normal eating/drinking.  I use these whitestrips as a touchup when needed.  I don&#x27;t do it every day or my teeth hurt, so instead I opt to just use them as a brightener for a special event (e.g one strip before a big night out on the town) or 2-3 strips if I want a more noticeable difference for a vacation or something else.  Great product.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly and as advertised</li>
    <li> If you have Dental fluorosis this is not a product you should use, it will leave your teeth sensible to air. But you can see results as early as 2 uses. I just can&#x27;t deal with the pain it brings.</li>
    <li> It made my teeth hurt so badly that I just wanted to rip my teeth out by the end of the first week. I tried using sensitive tooth paste like someone had suggested, but after a few hours my teeth hurt again it was unbearable. I tried it again a couple weeks later and just doing it once killed me. I could tell a difference on my teeth and how they were becoming whiter, but it hurts so bad that I couldn&#x27;t finish.</li>
    <li> whitens and that&#x27;s the point!</li>
    <li> Was very surprised how this did at whitening my teeth...I am a coffee and tea user and this product worked better the I expected.</li>
    <li> These do work but I guess I have extra sensitive teeth because there&#x27;s no way I can use these more than a couple times a week</li>
    <li> these did a great job of whitening my teeth.  Had to do them every other day because it made my teeth too sensitive.  Great strips though.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it didnt make my teeth perfectly white but they are much brighter and feel clean. I will definitely use these again.</li>
    <li> For being dental strength they didn&#x27;t get as white as they could have. I&#x27;ve seen better from the standard white strips.</li>
    <li> works great! cant go wrong with these</li>
    <li> I like these Crest Strips!  Lightens teeth much more than I anticipated.  I will buy these Crest 3d white professional Effects teeth whitening strips again!.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get Crest white strips 3D.  So I did them for a week straight. After doing them for 7 straight days in row 30 minutes each day, I noticed my teeth had gotten sensitive (which they do say on the box in they do get sensitive then stop for a couple days, I did. I stopped for 1 week) Did my teeth get white but I have to say I was a little disappointed. I thought they would get my teeth whiter. Maybe because I couldn&#x27;t do it for 2 straight weeks. I do have to say that when I do the white strips, I brush my teeth afterward, then use the 3D mouthwash as well &amp; my teeth &amp; mouth feel real clean.  All in all I would purchase these again as previously stated they did whiten my teeth but not like I thought they would &amp; its much cheaper than getting them whiten professionally.</li>
    <li> I keep buying these.Fast shipping and great results.</li>
    <li> I cant get enough from this product . it;s my fourth time now am using this product . what ever is described is true . i saved lot of money for dentist visit and got my teeth whitened at home .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no sensitivity with great sexy smile that you&#x27;&#x27;ll ever dream for</li>
    <li> The product works. If you leave it on for more than the recommended time, you&#x27;ll experience some pain and sensitivity, but it goes away. This product is potent. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but causes my teeth to be extremely sensitive- to the point of pain.  I just leave them in for around 10mins so that I get results without as much pain.</li>
    <li> NOT recommended, delivered marginal-at best-results. Save your $.</li>
    <li> I drink coffee multiple times daily, which has wreaked a minor amount of havoc on the color my teeth. I don&#x27;t really know anyone who uses these white strips and was skeptical that they could make much of a difference, particularly at the modest price point that you typically find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter, I pulled the trigger and started applying them. As Crest says, the difference is noticeable within just a few sessions, and after weeks, your teeth will be many shades brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a mildly unpleasant bleach-y taste when you&#x27;re wearing them, and the adhesive gel (which works well) is a bit gummy and gross, but all said it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knock a star off here because, even though my teeth are not particularly sensitive, they&#x27;re beginning to feel that way. I&#x27;ve actually had to take days off here and there between applications, as there is a residual/lingering sensitivity to warm and cold, and even a very vaguely painful sensation now, but I&#x27;m optimistic it will subside with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seconds to apply, to great effect.</li>
    <li> I use these strips from time to time and was happy to get it at a lower price than I would pay at the drug store.  They do work.</li>
    <li> I researched white strips carefully before buying them. I used the strips exactly as the directions called for. I had no problems getting them to attach to my teeth. After 21 days, my teeth are much whiter and I am very happy with the product. They were worth the money.</li>
    <li> I had tried the whitestrips in 2010 or so and they kept sliding off of my teeth, even when I dried them first. The advance seal technology is not just a marketing thing, they stay on for the full 30 minutes without having to worry about them at all. And also 3 days was when I noticed my teeth really getting whiter, I expected it to take longer.</li>
    <li> These are great if you want to casually get brighter, whiter teeth without going to a professional and shelling out tons of cash. There are different ways you can apply (pretty much how long you leave them on) and they definitely work as advertised. Be aware you may have some teeth sensitivity after wearing, but it doesn&#x27;t last longer than a day or so.</li>
    <li> So far it like it works as they sad ,</li>
    <li> So far using 2 strips and I see a slight difference. I will have to updated this review as I use the strips over time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t thought that whiting strips help me in whitening my teeth but these whitening works excellent. I am very happy with their result and might try same product again in future.</li>
    <li> These work. I don&#x27;t drink coffee, or smoke and my teeth where moderately yellow. These removed the stains almost completely, and after finishing all the strips, I moved to the crest peroxide/backing soda tooth paste to keep them white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the stripes every other day, my teeth would get very sensitive/sore if I did it any sooner.</li>
    <li> Make my teeth score over 8 hours after I applied as the instruction described...</li>
    <li> Works great! I even use a blue LED light with it which I think makes it work better!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it promises to do.  Whitened my teeth fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting married next week and I was scared that my teeth were going to match my ivory dress. Fear not, they look great now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few strips before. Once before I only used three for three days in a row and stopped. I decided to try using them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the first strips on and left them there for half an hour, exactly as directed. When I took them off, I could already see a slight difference. I doubt I&#x27;ll even need all 20 strips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do exactly as advertised. I actually have very sensitive teeth but didn&#x27;t notice any discomfort after using it besides cold water feeling a lot colder on my teeth, but that was expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product. I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Got these Crest 3D White Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips for my granddaughter for Christmas, since she had them on her Christmas list.  I had used these before and found them to be very effective.  She has used them and likes the results very much.  Would definitely purchase them again.</li>
    <li> First off let me tell you that this product was recommended to me by a friend who’s teeth were already pretty white. It sounds like a weird distinction, but I think it matters a lot if you’re trying to figure out if your teeth are really going to get whiter or not. The product itself was one of the easy to use, simply open the strips and put them around your teeth. There was some slight sensitivity in using it, but the convenience factor made me pretty happy with for the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I noticed after a few times using the whitestrips that there were parts of my teeth that the strip did not cover, when I smiled you could still see yellow in the crevices of your teeth. Its funny other reviews mentioned the same thing, but I didn’t listen because the product was so popular. I think this is the main difference from using a strip-type whitening product, and actually going to the dentist to have it done: the whitestrips do not form to your teeth 100%, so they can not whiten 100% of the teeth’s surface!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked into getting my own dentist to whiten my teeth, but it ended up that it was going to cost a couple hundred bucks, so I researched a little more on it. Turns out there’s a few different products out there that you can buy for home use, that have the same strength as the ones dentists use and also use molded-trays that cover the parts of your teeth that strips can not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00HJDIAGC This teeth whitening kit]] worked a lot better. The good thing about this product is it has heat-molded trays that literally wrap around your teeth 100%, and if you use a q-tip to apply the solution to your teeth, there is no sensitivity when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this because that gel can sting your gums if you get it on them, so the heat-molded trays and qtip technique are really the most important part of buying a whitening kit - and this is something you can&#x27;t control with whitest rips. I prefer this type of system way more than the strips, because it really does whiten your teeth more than the crest strips would ever do. The bad thing about trays is it takes a few minutes in the beginning to get the right fit around your teeth, but it’s well worth that setup time for perfect fitting mouth pieces, and is something crest can’t offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I’d give Crest White Strips a 3 out of 5. It’s convenient enough to use daily, but it really did not cover my teeth as well as products with heat trays.han the strips, because it really does whiten your teeth more than the crest strips would ever do.

It’s convenient enough to use daily, but it really did not cover my teeth as well as products with heat trays.</li>
    <li> I bought these strips to whiten my teeth before my sisters wedding. I will say that they did work, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away, they only lightened my teeth a few &amp;#34;shades&amp;#34; whiter. Maybe a few treatments would get it done, but I would recommend a professional treatment before I&#x27;d do that. The strips are somewhat difficult to apply to the teeth, and if done improperly and contact the gums they can cause hypersensitivity to both hot and cold. Great for the money and did as advertised, but a professional whitening might be my first choice next time.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t make my teeth as sensitive as  other treatments, but for 20 treatments, I felt like my teeth should&#x27;ve been a lot whiter. In the end, there wasn&#x27;t much difference. I remember years ago Crest has a basic teeth whitening kit you could buy for $20. This was before the professional line. I wish they&#x27;d bring that back, because that actually worked. I feel like I wasted my money on this one. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Real talk these strips will give your teeth that Michael Jackson disease quick. LIGHT UP SQUARES LIKE BILLY JEAN SON!!!</li>
    <li> These whitestrips worked so-so for me.  I think I&#x27;ve had better experience with these in the past.  Maybe, these are not as strong/intense as other Crest ones I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> I really liked the whitestripes and I have noticed the difference within the first week, my sister got the same after seeing the results&lt;br /&gt;Worth it.</li>
    <li> I  use other whitening  products on a regular basis but wanted more intensive whitening treatment for once or twice a year so tried this. I read some people said they had some sensitivity issues w/  it, so I used some Sensodyne toothpaste each am &amp; pm week prior to using and while using this kit and also used Act mouthwash  which  has  flouride in it to help and it worked for me because I had no sensitivity or pain issues at all while using  this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the strips stick to your teeth VERY securely. I could even drink water with them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; could not really see a very visible whitening difference myself (remember I do use other whitening products regularly ) but I had a handful of people compliment me on my bright smile and was even told I have movie star white teeth and people wanted to know how did I get my teeth like that so they could do the same thing. : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this again.</li>
    <li> I am 11 treatments into my 20 strip box, and so far, the results have been OK, at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used crest strips YEARS ago (10+ years) with similar results.  At that time, my dentist told me that some people just don&#x27;t have white teeth, after I asked him about an in-office treatment attempt due to the lackluster results from the white strips.  It&#x27;s not a matter of stains or wear, but just the natural color of some teeth is not brilliant white.  He said those people would benefit for from bleaching as opposed to the peroxide treatments, as that&#x27;s the only way the teeth would get &#x27;white,&#x27; but bleaching can cause other issues.  I had that in mind when going into this recent use, but figured I&#x27;d see if the results would be the same with the stronger, improved product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the eleven treatments over 11 days, I am seeing SOME change.  More of just a homogenization of the color as opposed to a super-whitening (which tells me the product is helping with some stains).  There is some lightening as well, but it&#x27;s not an &#x27;expected&#x27; result based on the product claims (not even sure if qualifies as a one-shade whitening).  I am starting to get some sensitivity now, but plan to continue the treatments until the end.  I&#x27;ll just use toothpaste for sensitive teeth to mitigate the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not expecting a miracle by the end of the cycle, but I&#x27;ll see if the results improve at all.  Just heed my story about what my dentist had told me, and temper your expectations for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I used the product down to the last strip (OK, OK...my wife used 1 of them before a vacation trip), and I can say my results above never improved.  &#x27;Whitening&#x27; was minimal.  That&#x27;s not to say the product didn&#x27;t work, but as I pointed out above, I just don&#x27;t have teeth that are going to get that luminescent whiteness.  I think this will be the last time I give these a try, at least for another 10 years.</li>
    <li> Can tell a difference within the first few uses. I would recommend using every other day to avoid getting sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh these are so much better than any I&#x27;ve used!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have soft enamel and these don&#x27;t make my teeth super sensitive or anything. (I&#x27;m also using sensodyne while doing these and haven&#x27;t had problems)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only done these for 3 nights and that&#x27;s all I need... But if I wanna go more white I still have 17 days..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing I saw a difference on the first night&lt;br /&gt;people complimented my teeth before so AFTER these amazing strips, lets see how much more people compliment them!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line. Highly recommend and the price is a lot better&lt;br /&gt;I subscribed and saved a few pennies.. You can always cancel later on! ;)</li>
    <li> I have used my strips everyday for a week and have noticed minimal results. Others cannot tell any difference. I will be looking for a new product.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased to see this product worked in just two days...I expected to wait 30 days for results! The first day I noticed a negative result...I knocked out my front tooth as a child so it was replaced with a &amp;#34;fake tooth&amp;#34; (called implant). The first application of Crest 3D White Whitestrips Professional Effects made the implant tooth as white as a brand new tooth while my other teeth still had years of stains/ Awkward and embarrassing...for just one day. The second day when I applied Crest 3D White Whitestrips Professional Effects again, all my teeth matched the dental implant and I was smiling again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The information label warns that if you have sensitive teeth you&#x27;ll notice discomfort. Yep, I have the discomfort... when I drink ice water or eat foods that trigger sensitivity. I&#x27;m willing to tolerate the temporary discomfort knowing my teeth will look better than the have in 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids are also using the Crest 3D White Whitestrips Professional Effects and in just two days they too had brighter teeth. Although they had dental visits one month ago for cleaning, they still had yellow teeth before using this product. Now their teeth look healthy again.</li>
    <li> Works as usual. I use these once every few years. Packaging was good and came fast. I received the ones that are as pictured.</li>
    <li> After only 3 days i noticed a improvement. My teeth weren&#x27;t bad, but they could be whiter.(coffee and years of smoking till i quit this year. These are relatively simple to use and after a few times, becomes second nature to put them on, sit for a half hour and then pull them off. I&#x27;m a fan. Some people have sensitive teeth, so far i have not noticed anything. Also, don&#x27;t brush your teeth right before using, just swish your mouth out with a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#####Update. After halfway through the treatment, my teeth are MUCH whiter. I&#x27;ve uploaded before and after photos as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of cold liquid sensitivity. Not too bad. I brush morning and night, and after each meal, flossing each time. I use the crest 3d white toothpaste and also the 3d white mouthwash. It is all making a huge difference. I got these based on a recommendation from my dentist, she said if i wanted whiter teeth, try the strips, they work. I concur.</li>
    <li> If there&#x27;s any doubt about this product, rest assured......it works.  The biggest &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; is simply setting aside the necessary time to get it done.  The best part is that you get to choose when that can happen, so you shouldn&#x27;t have too much trouble finding that time.  It&#x27;s up to you, but you&#x27;ll be pleased once you&#x27;re through with the process.</li>
    <li> These strips work really well and are a great price. The only downside is that my teeth became supersensitive. Just be aware of this and do not leave them on for too long or the sensitivity increases!</li>
    <li> Always use these &amp; they really do whiten your teeth. We use them for when we attend special occasion events because everyone should have sparkling whites.</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t fit bottom teeth..I have straight teeth. The tops are good to go.Theres no cut for bottom.over priced bigtime!</li>
    <li> Not terrible, but not what I would consider close to professional results. I&#x27;m 31, pretty healthy, drink lots of coffee and take care of my teeth, but I&#x27;ve always fought against yellowing and staining. I wasn&#x27;t impressed, but they definitely do brighten your teeth up noticeably, just not to the pearly white I so wish I could get! :(</li>
    <li> I used to have teeth that were pretty blah and I took 2 round of these and now I have teeth that everybody comments positively on.</li>
    <li> Have some stains on your teeth try these. After three days you start to notice results. I would recommend getting two boxes. Becaus after you use the first box, I use the second box as a maintenance using 1 strip a week.</li>
    <li> Used it once a day x 2 wks and very happy with results. I don&#x27;t have to go to dentist and pay $350-$400.00 for whitening. Yipee!</li>
    <li> I recommend people buying these to firt take a photo of their teeth before, during, and after the treatment. From just days of using it you can notice the difference, teeth just go whiter, its not radical like people from TV that look unnatural, but it looks pretty white and make you look healthy and young too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest Whitestrips Professional Effects for seven days and I must admit that my teeth have become significantly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of my whiter teeth is a horrible tooth sensibility. I am writing this review right after using my seventh set of Whitestrips and my teeth feel like I was chewing on ice! My teeth are healthy and I have never had sensible teeth - until now. I would rather spend $500 on a professional whitening treatment than use one more of these whitening strips!</li>
    <li> These strips are really great.  I have used Crest strips for a while (maybe once every couple years) and always am happy with the results.  A couple months ago I tried the cheaper Target brand version and did NOT have good results.  My teeth didn&#x27;t get any whiter.  I usually try to get the cheaper version of things since a lot of the time it doesn&#x27;t matter but with these it definitely does.  I am only on my third day of using these and I can already tell my teeth are whiter, not the kind of \\&quot;it&#x27;s in your head\\&quot; whiter but actually whiter.  They stick on well and do not move.  They are a bit hard to get off but I think that is a good thing personally.  Just as a side note I have always had decently white teeth so it&#x27;s not like I have a lot of coffee/wine or whatever kind of stains BUT I would definitely recommend these strips no matter what state your teeth are in!</li>
    <li> . . . because of all the negative reviews regarding tooth sensitivity.  I do have somewhat sensitive teeth and was leery of spending the money and risking having to throw it away.  This product DOES NOT BOTHER my teeth.  Can easily wear it with no problem.  It has, in four days, already lightened and gotten rid of some really nasty stains.  I will use it again.</li>
    <li> After using [[ASIN:B000067E30 Crest Whitestrips Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips]] and [[ASIN:B00336EUUE Crest 3D White Whitestrips Vivid Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 10-count Carton]], I thought that Crest cannot make the strips which actually stay at their place. But I was wrong. This one actually stays at their place and are lot more effective in whitening the teeth than the other ones. They claim that the effects are visible in 3 days and it did happened on my teeth. However, it may vary with other individuals depending on the level of whiteness (or rather I should say yellowness) to begin with. My dentist said that these strips do not work for all types of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity: They do induce some sensitivity and you may reduce by limiting the use of strips or using a toothpaste to address the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy to find the strips which stay at their place instead os moving around all over in the mouth and whitens the teeth too :).</li>
    <li> I paid $640 to a professional dentist to get even a portion of the whitening that I found with this product.  I did in office visits and home trays and my teeth were still noticeably yellow.  That was 3 years ago.  I had tried other over-the-counter products with little success.  They were awkward to use, strips didn&#x27;t stay on, trays didn&#x27;t stay in place and no noticeable whitening after using up the whole container.  Having said all that, I went on line and asked what was the best product out there and was directed to this one.  I looked it up here on Amazon and saw all the wonderful reviews.  Thought for the price (less than in drugstores) I would give it a try.  Wow!  I do the extreme 2 hours, once a day, but I could tell after one treatment that my teeth were already getting white.  Also, I had my dentist check my enamel and there was no deterioration.  Don&#x27;t expect to get the white of veneers, but do expect to have wonderful white teeth shining back at you in future photos.  I am cock-a-hoop as they say in Great Britain!</li>
    <li> I really like these white strips and I would definitely use them again. The are easy to put on, compared to other strips, and they actually stay in place! I notice a different in my teeth already and I&#x27;m about half way through the box. I&#x27;ve had some slight sensitivity in my teeth, but not nearly as bad as with other white strips. I think the price is very reasonable too.</li>
    <li> This is my second time using this product.  I am almost through the second round and my teeth are really white.  A friend of mine said my teeth sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the second round of using them, I had some sensitivity and pain the first two days, so I took a break and used lots of Sensodyne toothpaste for a few days before starting over again on the regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I make sure I really dry my teeth with tissue before I put them on, they will stay longer and adhere better.  While they are on I keep some tissue in my  mouth so I don&#x27;t shallow my the chemical saliva.  You look funny,  but it is worth it so you don&#x27;t have that stuff down your throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem getting them off.  I just use my nail to push up from the gum area to get them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t drink any too cold/hot water after you take them off.  I did and got a sharp pain in one of my teeth which hurt the rest of the day.  So, just wipe your teeth off with tissue etc.  Wait a while before drinking/eating anything that is extreme in temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  Use Sensodyne toothpaste throughout the process.  It was help keep the sensitivity at a manageable level.  I also would take a little Sensodyne Toothpaste and rub it on my teeth with my finger, let it sit a while, then rinse, dry teeth with tissue then put the strips on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus:  As with all of their strips, I really wished that they would make the bottom seal longer to accommodate  the more of the bottom teeth  The bottom strip only covers 4-5 of my bottom teeth.  Soooo, I ended up using the top strip on the bottom teeth.  I also alternative and&lt;br /&gt;then combine two  bottom ones (with a little overlap in the middle) to cover my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  You really don&#x27;t see much difference in 3 days as the ad. says (the is misleading for sure), you really have to get through at least 10 days to notice.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first box of this product and thought I&#x27;d share my results.  To begin with, I&#x27;m a former smoker and have had a yellow tint to my teeth for years.  I have used other whitening strips in the past, including those manufactured by Crest, but the 3D Professional Effects definitely take the cake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*COST: At a SRP of $54.99 these white strips are nearly $20 more than their predecessor.  I purchased these on sale and with a coupon otherwise I more than likely would have opted for something else.  The price on Amazon is a steal compared to stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*USE: A major improvement is the Advanced Seal technology.  When they say that these strips don&#x27;t move they mean it.  They bonded to my teeth instantly but were easily removed after 30 minutes.  The seal also prevents the whitening agents from seeping into your mouth during use, hallelujah!  30 minutes once a day compared to the previous twice a day was a welcomed change as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SENSITIVITY: I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth to begin with and the only time that I&#x27;ve experienced it in the past has been with whitening strips.  Aside from a slight discomfort with my bottom teeth the morning after first use, I didn&#x27;t experience any with 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*RESULTS: Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled with the outcome.  I wouldn&#x27;t go so far to say that the results are comparable to professional whitening but they definitely whitened better than any other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.  On a scale of 1-10, I&#x27;d rate my results as a 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say it time and time again: BUY THESE!  And buy them on Amazon to save nearly $25, too!  Crest hit it out of the ballpark with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to whiten my teeth before a special event.  Although I was skeptical, based on previous Crest Whitestrips that I bought and used a few years ago, these new ones seemed to work quicker.  Within about a week, I could see results.  They are easy to use and didn&#x27;t bother me when I had them in my mouth, although a friend of mine said she couldn&#x27;t tolerate it and gave up.  I&#x27;m guessing some people may be more sensitive than others. I put them in and could talk with them on my teeth.  Eat a snack or take a drink before using them, though, because it takes 30 minutes and there is no eating or drinking with them in place.  They come with coupons in the box, and I&#x27;m planning on buying more to use occasionally to keep my teeth as white as possible.</li>
    <li> Not effective after 20 days. Some improvement but no where near as white as I expected compared to other users I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and it hurt their teeth. I think the fix to this is to make sure you get a lesser strength.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whittening strips before, but none have given me the reaction these Crest strips did. After the fourth time wearing them, I have terrible tooth sensitivity and pain. Perhaps I kept it on longer this time because I didn&#x27;t use my timer, but I&#x27;ve never dealt with tooth sensitivity. I will discontinue use for now and probably give the remaining strips to someone else since it says not all people experience tooth/gum sensitivity. I love Crest products, but this one has disappointed me greatly. After the third day, it did seem like it was working, but the pain I&#x27;m in right now overshadows the positives. I can&#x27;t even tell if my teeth are whiter now because it hurts to even expose my teeth to the air. I&#x27;m just hoping this gets better before my dentist appointment in a week.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I fully expect it to work since it was dentist recommended and I&#x27;ve heard very little bad about these typical peroxide products.  One thing I didn&#x27;t like is that slickdeals had it as a good deal and Crest did not honor my rebate because I used an Amazon &#x27;coupon&#x27; code I used....if I could do it over again I would consider another brand because rebate games annoy me.</li>
    <li> This is a big improvement from the White Strips I&#x27;ve used in the past. My teeth weren&#x27;t terribly stained or discolored to begin with, but I noticed an improvement after just a few applications. I would say the \\&quot;professional effects\\&quot; version of CWS whitens better and faster. What&#x27;s more, they are easier to apply and they stay put. Finally, I had zero sensitivity problem, which I&#x27;ve encountered before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, Crest has hit a home run with this product. And by ordering on Amazon, it costs about 40% less than at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of stray points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s hard to tell from the directions what schedule you&#x27;re supposed to follow. Once a day for 20 days? Twice a day for 10 days? Once a day for ten days... and then again in a couple of months?  It&#x27;s unclear. In fact, in the comparison chart on the box, it specifies that it&#x27;s a \\&quot;once-a-day treatment.\\&quot;  But elsewhere (in the little flier inside the box, I think) it refers to using the product twice a day. A little clarity would be appreciated. (You listening P&amp;G?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Also, I ordered the product twice, once from Amazon LLC and once from Potential Dynamics LLC (for another family member). The Amazon order cost a dollar more, but it came on time. The Potential Dynamics order somehow got messed up and I&#x27;m still not sure it has shipped yet, 3 days later.</li>
    <li> Well my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as the commercial so minus 1 star.. but reasonably whiter</li>
    <li> I lost one of the bleaching trays/molds my dentist made for me so I decided to give these a try instead.&lt;br /&gt;Used them for 10 days, twice a day, thankfully didn&#x27;t cause any tooth sensitivity. A definite improvement on my smile, but not as good  as product my dentist had given me. I paid $34.95 (Amazon currently have them listed @ $31)  a good price as I seen them in Rite Aid &amp; @ Duane Reade&#x27;s for $54.99</li>
    <li> I seen results the first day I used the product.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the sensitivity it caused but I got past that with the results I received.</li>
    <li> I have sad, yellow teeth. didn&#x27;t really notice a huge change, but maybe my teeth are just too far gone for this product. Who knows?</li>
    <li> I tried it and after using all 20 strips I did not notice any difference. I used it for the full 30 minutes each time. Crest will give you your money back if your don&#x27;t see results, but you must do it within 60 days of purchase.</li>
    <li> How lucky we are how convenient these stripes are!  Works and is extremely easy to accomplish nice white teeth. In the past I had a special kit and boy was that a boring event.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... Works great!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every now n then for a top up and it really does wonders 😊 I do leave it on for 60min tho...</li>
    <li> OUCH! Go with the less intense ones! These do stay on better, but if you buy the original ones you can just dry off your teeth on a towel first and have no problem with them staying in place.  I haven&#x27;t been able to use many of them because I have to take so many breaks because of extreme tooth sensitivity. I definitely prefer the original crest white strips.</li>
    <li> crest whitestrips always always works well for me</li>
    <li> They work but don&#x27;t believe everything you read.  My wife wants something easy, does not taste like bleach and takes 1/2 the advertised time.  Read the directions and expect 1/2 the results and you will be ok.</li>
    <li> I give 4 out of five points because it works but not as good as expected. I think I need a second pack to get a better result.</li>
    <li> exactly what I ordered, easier to find on Amazon than in a big box store, competitively priced &amp; they are working!!whiter teeth already &amp; I haven&#x27;0t even totally finished the kit yet, will definitely reorder, when necessary, as this was the kit my dentist&amp; hygienist recommended.</li>
    <li> Does make a difference within just one hour :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. Was able to use a coupon for a slight discount! I will definitely purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Would definitely buy again! I was a bit hesitant to buy something like this but I am glad I took the risk.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t seem to work very well.</li>
    <li> Great product! This was a exactly what was expected! Will definitely recommend to others. Also shipped and delivered fast! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  My teeth look much better.  As some mention, the strips did cause a bit of soreness while in use, but the soreness was minor and went away within minutes of removing the strips.</li>
    <li> Noticeably whiter in just a few days.  Several shades whiter at the completion.  They did make my teeth a bit sensitive to hot and cold foods and beverages about half way through so I skipped a day every now and then, but the sensitivity disappeared shortly after I finished using the strips.  The strips are also much higher quality then some of the bargain brands.  They stuck to my teeth even quite well.  I always had problems with the bargain brands falling off or shifting and getting the whitening gel everywhere.</li>
    <li> These work awesome!!! Have used for years and much cheaper than having it done professional. You can use a few days in a row or when you feel needed.</li>
    <li> Delighted with my purchase.  The Crest whitestrips arrived as described by the Seller and it arrived ahead of schedule.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference after using.</li>
    <li> Teeth are now sparkly and white!</li>
    <li> My teeth were noticeably white after using these strips on 5 occasions.  I started out with using it 4 days in a row but then after the 4th day my teeth/gums were incredibly sensitive.  So I skipped a few days and then used it again but my teeth were still too sensitive.  Regardless my teeth were whiter and I will continue with these strips in a couple of weeks again.</li>
    <li> worked quickly to whiten my teeth</li>
    <li> Made my teeth significantly whiter with little to no sensitivity. Have used these multiple times and always had good results.</li>
    <li> Great produce that actually works</li>
    <li> They do ok. No miricale. They stay on well and they doesn&#x27;t have a nasty taste or anything.</li>
    <li> Works well.  No sensitivity problems with this product.</li>
    <li> These strip really do work! This was the first time I&#x27;ve ever used these so I was really surprised. I have noticed my teeth have gotten whiter and so have other people! I would definitely order these again.</li>
    <li> causes extreme sensitivity</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s between 2 - 3; sorry - but my teeth began hurting, all over, terribly - and the bleaching compound was causing growth streaks to appear on my teeth. I am not a wimp and have used a similar - if not about the same - product several years ago. Then there was some slight pain - nothing unbearable. But with this &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34; - the pain is more 3-D than the promised whiteness. Sadly - I had to stop using them - I was concerned I may start to damage my enamel - I have excellent teeth, over 55 - enamel as well, and can walk miles without a cigar.I&#x27;ll use the remaining strips like a kind of dental cologne from time to time - just for a little quick glint. 2xs a day for 10 days in a row? No way, Mei-Mei !</li>
    <li> Love Crest 3D white strips. My teeth are always noticeably whiter and brighter after I use it.</li>
    <li> I used about 10 strips, and it indeed whitens my teeth. But after that my teeth became very sensitive. I am so scared to use it again. Recommend it but use caution.</li>
    <li> Love these! Definitely brightens my smile. I just have to space them apart, or my teeth KILL me.</li>
    <li> As promised, my teeth were whiter at the end of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Do not leave these on for longer than the recommend time or may cause teeth sensitivity</li>
    <li> I love these whitestrips! I bought these because i have alot of stains from coffee so i decided to try these strips and they do lighten my teeth &amp; got rid of stains but also make sure you also brush your teeth at least 2-3 times a day along with using the strips for the best results. Would buy again! but my teeth are white so I just gotta make sure i brush regularly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t see a whitening or brightening effect on my teeth at all.  I&#x27;ve used the whole box and my teeth were not too stained to begin with, but these just did nothing.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 days now and I&#x27;m already seeing results. Easy to put on and easily removable. My teeth were a bit sensitive after removing the strips but it was very minor. If you have sensitive teeth I would advise you to use the strips every other day.&lt;br /&gt;All and all great product!</li>
    <li> Trouble sticking tape to teeth. Especially the bottom teeth.</li>
    <li> what happened to the old school Crest white strips?  These are like glue strips and they make my teeth ache for a day.</li>
    <li> Definitely noticed a difference right away. I drink lots of coffee and noticed my teeth were discoloring. This actually made a difference. I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should and I still think its pretty good. Just don&#x27;t leave it on a second longer than indicated because it might irritate the gums, as it did in my case. Nothing crazy but I was a little concerned the first time it happened. All is well. I like it.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and works great! They really have been whitening my teeth. Great product! Definitely will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of whitening teeth but causes sensitivity if used too frequently. I use them every 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best whitening products I&#x27;ve used. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to take years of stains off their teeth.</li>
    <li> All right...I used it twice,as directed,before bed..... and in couple of hours I woke up from pain in my teeth and gums...&lt;br /&gt;I have to be objective though, this s*** works...!!!&lt;br /&gt;even after 2 applications I can see the result! less yellow,more white.for sure!&lt;br /&gt; it&#x27;s very encouraging to bare the pain,but there is one big &#x27;BUT\\&quot;.....&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned and I&#x27;d like to know if there will be any negative consequences later,or this is just the pain,which is just hurting,but not damaging anything...I&#x27;ll try to contact them and ask them,though I know what they&#x27;re going to say in advance...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,for myself,I&#x27;d say,ok,go ahead,bare the pain do it every other day for 4-5 more times and that&#x27;s it...then stop...&lt;br /&gt;I believe in results...though,honestly,on the scale from 1 to 10,for me it hurts 6....&lt;br /&gt;but the pain is not all...there is this discomfort caused by high sensitivity,which doesn&#x27;t allow you to drink cold water or hot tea...in my case,this pain+discomfort lasted for good 20-24 hours....</li>
    <li> I found the strips to be comfortable to wear. I could tolerate about 45min to an hour of wear at a time. My teeth were just a hint of yellow and after a couple of weeks, I noticed a difference. I did have tooth/gum sensitivity as a result, but by then, I was good with the level of whitening. Note: I rarely drink coffee, sodas, and I don&#x27;t smoke or drink much red wine - so my review may not be as helpful for people who do as I wasn&#x27;t lifting any hard stains</li>
    <li> I used to hate whitening my teeth at home because of sensitivity.  A dentist told me to use Sensitive toothpaste for a month and then try the strips.  It worked, I have no sensitivity now and these strips have whitened my teeth considerably.  Would highly recommend, a little more expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> it really really  works...your teeth get a lil sensitive but  they have a toothpaste for that....you should really try it..,it has great results...i would purchase it again!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference after this whitening treatment. I completed the entire treatment and I did not notice a difference. It was enter on my gums which I appreciated though.</li>
    <li> After my questioning about the in-office whitening my dentist (bless her heart) suggested that I first try the OTC products first. So, I go to Wegman&#x27;s store and find the most expensive &amp;#34;professional grade&amp;#34; strips. Then I go home and find them online, on Amazon, cheaper. They arrive with a $10 rebate inclosed. And they WORK! The secret (according to my beloved dentist) is CONSISTENSY. You have to use them EVERY day, the effect is accumulative. Having pretty sensitive teeth (cold, hot, icidic- you name it), I am impressed that I had no pain or discomfort whatsoever throughout the treatment. Bottom line: highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> Waste of money! This product did not whiten my teeth one bit! Stick with whitening toothpaste, that does a much better job.</li>
    <li> No sensitive feeling. It works. My teeth is very white after 10 uses ( 10 strips ). I have 10 left for the summer. I would repurchase it definitely. Cheap way to have a nice smile without going to the dentist</li>
    <li> The product does work! I can see my teeth are obvious whiter only after 3 times of use! I will definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Use these every 6 months and definitely notice a difference.  Easy to use and non-troublesome to apply.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  Really works and this price is unbeatable!!</li>
    <li> The effectiveness of this product is pretty decent. I would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a small boost. I would rather have the longest trip on the bottom because as of now it is very short.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS. I was skeptical at first. Finally decided to purchase and my teeth are significantly whiter especially in pictures. I didn&#x27;t have to use these as frequently as it suggested, in fact it burnt my gum on the 10th day or so. I discontinued immediately and the irritation stopped. I still have 8 strips left and i&#x27;ve been without it for over 3 months. THE WHITENESS IS STILL THERE.</li>
    <li> I have used Whitestrips for years and have them to be very effective in my case with ne problems.  The thing people have to realize is that this a maintenance product.  If you don&#x27;t maintain your oral hygiene, it is going to take longer to get white teeth.  I drink coffee every morning and it works great for me, but I go to the dentist regularly to have my teeth cleaned and brush regularly.  My Dental Hygienist even commented on how white my teeth were.  I use the strips a couple time a year for maintenance.  If you teeth are dingy, stained and yellow, it may take a couple of boxes to bet a great effect, but then after that, you can use them twice a year to keep the great effects.  You have to do your part too though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really convenient to spend only 30 minutes a day. I never had problems about sensitive teeth, but I noticed some after 4 days, so what I did is just to stop for a day and then continued again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I&#x27;ve tried the Intensive Professional Effects and the results are faster, but two hours is a long time. And the problem with sensitive teeth was after the second use.</li>
    <li> I still have 5 left and my teeth are so white and i didnt feel any pain after or during but my dentist did give me synsodyne toothpaste just incase lol thank you ooh and my shipping came in on time</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth, so using these daily as recommended is not possible, but they work just as well to use them every other day or every third day.  You still see a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s good if you bought will not regret</li>
    <li> OH, come on- everyone wants their teeth to be white and shiny!  This stuff works great. Follow the directions and you will have a beautiful smile very soon and for much less than professional whitening.  The strips stick  like they&#x27;ve been glued to your teeth. I don&#x27;t know if it is safe to sleep with them but boy, they sure stick like it would be!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Well packaged, Product as described. 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> The Whitestrips work really well if you are diligent about using them every other day. I found that using them every day actually hurt my teeth to the point where sensitivity became a problem and no, I don&#x27;t have bad gums or weak teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack removed years of drinking coffee and the whitening lasts a few months. After 10 minutes, the strips do feel funny and gross but don&#x27;t take them out or there will be little effect.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t read too much about the potential health detriments of using this product. It certainly does whiten your teeth, although not all of them mind you, but rather the front-most teeth. A few times I wore them for around an hour and my teeth were sensitive and hurting for a few days after, so now I never wear them for more than half an hour.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in August 2013 and used them as instructed to. My teeth were exceptionally whiter, my friends and family noticed by the 4th strip, but the sudden sharp pains soon followed. I had to stop by the sixth strip because the pain would be coming and going every 10-20 minutes. I continued to use this product once a week from then on. Maybe this is why my whitened teeth didn&#x27;t last long, but the results were as promised. As of this moment my teeth are reverting back to their dull color so I&#x27;m back to purchase some more.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and provide good results in a short amount of time.  Less intense than some other products and as a result you experience less tooth/gum sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Your teeth are too white what do you do?  I get asked this almost every day and I smoke pot every day. these work great.  After using three or four in a row as directed I now use about one a month to keep my teeth extremely white this is a great product and you can drink while you have them on</li>
    <li> it works!  I do not know how much white it will get teeth after first use, but you will see a difference in 30-min</li>
    <li> This actually works better than the ones I&#x27;ve tried before, but if you have sensitive teeth be aware that you will feel so sensitivity with this product.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s effective and gentle. Had the same result as  spent  $500 in the dental office, but leave less sensitive in my gum.</li>
    <li> These worked well enough, but results don&#x27;t last.  Can&#x27;t expect too much from a whitening strip but it was definitely the best I&#x27;ve used (have tried a few other Crest strips in the past).  As other reviews stated, the best part is they stay on better than they used to and they didn&#x27;t hurt my gums as others have in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even half way through the box and have already noticed great whitening</li>
    <li> Just have to watch if you&#x27;re like me, sensitive.... I will use only like 5 days in a row... since some teeth are sensitive. Noticed a couple teeth I knew were discolored from my coffee/ and blueberries, looked better and not so stained.</li>
    <li> I have noticed the whitening affects of Crest 3D. This is the first time I have used any whitening products after using this product, I have noticed the difference. Thanks for the good product!</li>
    <li> I thought this product whitened my teeth pretty well. They weren&#x27;t totally extremely white like I&#x27;ve seen professionally through dentists, but they were definitely much whiter and I&#x27;m glad I used it.</li>
    <li> These things really work. They work even better than the stuff I got from my dentist. The new design allows them to stay in place much better than the old ones. I think they say you can drink water with them in, but I didn&#x27;t. They&#x27;re only on for 1/2 hour...I can stop eating and drinking that long! The only challenge I have is one tooth is a little sensitive and the gel hurt a bit after being on for about 20 minutes. It&#x27;s a back tooth, so I just make sure I don&#x27;t cover that tooth with the gel.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product and delivers exactly as advertised. I have been using this and earlier versions for the past couple of years and very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using crest white strips for a long time. But this is the first time I have used them since they changed the way they manufacture the strips. They have been much improved! They stick to your teeth well, you just have to hold the strip there for 2 or 3 seconds until it adheres to the tooth, no more worrying about them slipping off every time I move my mouth. There is also a noticeable difference in whiteness, even after just one use. I cant however use these daily. This didn&#x27;t use to happen to me, but a few hours after they are off, these cause some considerable pain in my bottom front teeth. The pain lasts maybe a day and then goes away leaving me with the white teeth I want. So its a trade off, a little pain for a whiter smile. Overall I am satisfied and the price on amazon makes it a great value.</li>
    <li> Compared to the price one would pay at a real dentist for whitening, this is a great deal! I have been using them so far for 5 days and have noticed my teeth are significantly whiter than last week! I smoke and drink coffee, so my teeth were yellowed. I can&#x27;t wait to see after 10 days, I might not need to do the full round of 20. Very pleased for the money, couldnt have got whitening near this cheap from a dentist!</li>
    <li> Great deal! Much much cheaper than in stores. I used Crest white strips a couple of years ago and they have definitely improved! These stick on a lot so they&#x27;re not slipping everywhere when you talk if you have them on. That took me by surprise. I have see some improvement in the &amp;#34;whiteness&amp;#34; of my teeth.</li>
    <li> It seems like the biggest complaint with these strips is sensitivity, so I&#x27;m going to use the first part of this review to give some recommendations on alleviating the sensitivity.  You can markedly decrease the sensitivity by using Sensodyne (or a similar product) as your regular toothpaste while using the strips.  This is my third time (in about 7+ years) using crest whitestrips and I am always thrilled with the results. I have experienced more sensitivity with this kind than others previously, but I found that using maximum strength sensodyne eliminates the sensitivity enough that I don&#x27;t have to take day(s) off in order for the sensitivity to go away.  I&#x27;ve also heard that using a fluoride rinse can help, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.  I was really surprised that this product had anything less than 5 star reviews, and hopefully this helps some users because the results are really phenomenal. Also, do not use these after brushing, as the instructions say.  If you have sensitivity, wait to resume using them until it goes away or you will just make it worse. But I promise these are worth sticking with because they really do deliver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drink a LOT of coffee, tea, soda, and wine and I don&#x27;t want anything less than a bright white, celebrity-esque blinding smile.  These strips do the trick.  I used my first set about 7 years ago and while chatting with a girl I had never met before, with my Starbucks in hand, she remarked that my teeth were really white and asked how I managed to keep them that way even as a coffee drinker. I divulged that the Crest Whitestrips were responsible for my pearly whites.  I was thrilled that my teeth were so white that a complete stranger wanted to know my secret, and I hadn&#x27;t even finished the box yet!  Since then, every couple of years I will get the urge to touch up my results so they stay really white despite my consumption of staining beverages. I&#x27;m almost half way through the box and I&#x27;m thrilled that my teeth are on their way to being bright white again!  I did notice that I had a hard time gauging my own results, I guess partially because lighting affects it and I see myself every day.  Pictures can be misleading, but I find it really hard to believe that you could use this entire box and not notice significant whitening.  I noticed the biggest difference when standing in front of a window (or outside) so I would recommend using that to gauge your level of whitening.being bright white again!

    <li> Superior whitening power. Excellent fit of strips. Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT WORKED WONDERS ON MY TEETH BEFORE THE ALLOTTED TIME FRAME. I WILL PURCHASE IT AS NEEDED! MORE THAN LIKELY ANNUALLY.</li>
    <li> These did a remarkable job in whitening my teeth.  The process was easy, and they went on, and came off easily.</li>
    <li> The first time I used them, the difference was significant. The second and third strips, done on consecutive days, turned my teeth from yellow to almost white. Much much better than those cheap whitening toothpaste. Much easier to use than those expensive plastic tube things you have to boil to get into the right shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is a little expensive. For a cheaper option, I tried the following paste gel for whitening and it works wonders too. Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RH1TRE/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000RH1TRE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;hocivfd-20</li>
    <li> Yes, these strips keep that dull look away. I use three times a month consistently and 30 minutes is doable.</li>
    <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Lower teeth strip is too small.&lt;br /&gt;Will get some results.</li>
    <li> Sketchy , the boxing and packaging did not match any of the products in the store</li>
    <li> I USED THESE STRIPS AS DIRECTED 2X/DAY. FOR ME THAT WAS 40 APPLICATIONS BECAUSE ONLY MY&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM TEETH NEEDED WHITENING.  I PHOTOED BEFORE AND AFTER AND CAN SEE NADA CHANGE.</li>
    <li> These work great for me. I get compliments on my teeth all the time. I swear by the professional strength.</li>
    <li> True to their word, my teeth were definitely whiter at the end of treatments.  I still drink coffee and tea, so I will likely treat again.</li>
    <li> It had whitened my teeth in a natural way but it made them sensitive though i couldnt finish my whole course in a row it took me abt two month for 17 uses and saving the rest three for maintaing my new smile 👍</li>
    <li> Shortly after my teen had her braces removed, she asked me if she could try an over-the-counter teeth whitening product. My brother is an endodontist, so I asked him for a recommendation. He suggested Crest 3D Whitestrips. I read through the Amazon product reviews and decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only my daughter used the Whitestrips, so I am reviewing them based on my observations and her feedback. I monitored her use of the product and can confirm that it was used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her teeth had minimal and consistent discoloration/yellowing. She had no stains. Her braces left no marks or outlines. Her goal was to gradually brighten her teeth a few shades in a way that didn&#x27;t scream, &amp;#34;Look! I&#x27;m whitening my teeth!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She wore them for 30 minutes five evenings in a row, brushing with Crest toothpaste after removing the strips. After noticing some slight sensitivity to hot/cold, she took two days off and switched to sensitive toothpaste per customer recommendations in the product reviews. This was incredibly helpful. She maintained a five days on, two days off routine for one month and did not&lt;br /&gt;experience any further sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are both very pleased with the results. The 3D Whitestrips worked gradually so the improvement appeared very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips caused her to have really bad breath so she was diligent about keeping breath mints or gum handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the strips were touching any part of her gums, it would begin to burn. After adjusting that part of the strip, the discomfort would subside after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It always preform well.&lt;br /&gt;Jim Weikart</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about these, I have never tried whiteners, but it seemed worth a try. I have been very pleased with the results, my teethy are much whiter, I can smile now.</li>
    <li> Kinda hurt but I gave myself a 3 day break, and I find its best to do it right before going to bed, this science will whiten your teeth, but before I started I had no clue how much pain like this could hurt, (I started 2 weeks after getting my wisdom teeth pulled), but I make it sound worse than it is.</li>
    <li> These strips work very well and adhere FAR better than some of the others. In fact, I have a bit of trouble getting them off after 30 minutes, but they do the trick of whitening well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest 3D White strips for awhile now, I use them once a year and they do the job. Everyone comments my super white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are just great.&lt;br /&gt;I do get sensitivity on the frist days of using, but that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great. As I thought</li>
    <li> it works but makes my teeth sensitive seriously.</li>
    <li> Definitely lightened my teeth,  but still not white</li>
    <li> Okay so I am 16 and have always had yellow teeth. I was pretty skeptical about crest whitestrips but thought what the heck. By day 7 or 8 I saw a VERY noticeable difference. This product is a marvel and just flat out amazing. If you are not sure whether or not to get it. GET IT!!!!! And it didnt even make my teeth sensitive, at all. TERRIFIC purchase, you will not regret buying crest 3d whitestrips professional effects. It whitens and brightens and makes you want to show your teeth more often.</li>
    <li> These things are great, they don&#x27;t fall off, they stay stuck to your teeth, got them at a great price too....</li>
    <li> Teeth got a little whiter, but left uneven spots, I&#x27;m not sure if I just wasn&#x27;t using them correctly or what.</li>
    <li> Mom asked me to get Crest 3D White Luxe strips for her.  While they were easy to use, she did not notice any improvement in tooth color.</li>
    <li> I am a coffee drinker, and not even J-Lo could entice me to give up my morning cups of \\&quot;joe.\\&quot; This has impacted what should be \\&quot;pearly whites,\\&quot; leaving a perpetual slightly darker look. I just had my teeth professionally cleaned again, and the technician told me to get in gear and get these teeth WHITE. These Whitestrips come highly recommended, so I decided to give it a shot, but expecting totally nothing. I started three days ago, keeping in mind how much PAIN I had when trying the tray/whitener purchased from the dentist some years ago. I mean, that HURT! That pain also caused me to give up the treatment after only one day. I applied the initial set of Whitestrips and awaited the top of my head to pop off ... nothing. There was absolutely no pain, no tingles, and ... unfortunately ...  no J-Lo. I figured the things weren&#x27;t working. I kept them on for the half-hour with no problems. I decided, with no pain, to try twice each day, and have been doing just that for these three days. All I can (truthfully) say is: WOW! THESE THINGS WORK! My teeth are positively gleaming! I know everyone is different and, keeping in mind that severe pain I had from the tray/whitener previously, I can sympathize with some folks not being able to handle these on a daily schedule. I echo the suggestion that perhaps those people can apply these every-other-day. I also feel that keeping them off your gums will probably go a long way in tolerating the strips. In the end, I am a super satisfied customer and absolutely will go back to these strips whenever the need arises.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying these work, and I will buy these strips again the very next time I see them on sale (I&#x27;m cheap, and Amazon has great sales on these).  I went on travel for work for 4 weeks, leaving my fiance at home.  I used these over the course of the 4 weeks I was away, and when I got back and my fiance met me at the airport, she said my teeth looked whiter and asked if I&#x27;d been using anything!  I was wondering if she&#x27;d notice, and she said she noticed as soon as I first smiled, but didn&#x27;t want to greet me with \\&quot;Hi, your teeth look white!\\&quot;  If there&#x27;s any proof that these work, I&#x27;d say this is it. :D&lt;br /&gt;These are easy to apply, stick extremely well and are comfortable to wear for the 30 minutes per application Crest recommends, and might only be a little difficult to talk during that time. I actually wore them longer during times I didn&#x27;t want to stop what I was doing to take them off.  I had previously used the ones for sensitive teeth, and I&#x27;ll never use them again.  The \\&quot;sensitive teeth\\&quot; ones are thin, don&#x27;t stick very well, and are difficult to wear without moving them out of position with my tongue (probably why they recommend only 3 minutes per application). My teeth don&#x27;t feel sensitive after using these \\&quot;professional effects\\&quot; strips at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to whiten their teeth at home.</li>
    <li> These definitely work, but I think the more powerful ones that you leave on for 2 hours, for seven days, might be stronger.  I used them years ago and was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I got these instead and they worked, but it didn&#x27;t seem as good as the other ones.  Crest sent me a second box and after using them too, I felt like that brought me to where the other ones did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say you can use these twice a day, for half as many days, which is what I did.</li>
    <li> The strips did seem to work but they burn horribly if placed anywhere that is not your tooth. They burn fast and will heal overnight but still not worth it to me.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I have white teeth.  I drink dark soda and the occasional coffee, but have never smoked a day in my life and do not drink wine.  So, that being said, I wanted to try these because they were on sale big time and I thought I could get a little whiter...I noticed a difference after ONE application.  Amazing results.  My teeth are never sensitive normally, but these make them super sensitive, almost to the point of painful sometimes.  If it gets that way, I will skip a day and go every other day.  Awesome results and worth the sensitivity...because it does go away after use.  If you want a cheap makeover, get some of these and some rub on tanning cream...you&#x27;ll look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Got for my daughter and she noticed a difference in a couple days! Of course she doesn&#x27;t like the taste but the results are great!</li>
    <li> I used Crest&#x27;s older whitening strips years ago and never really had great results, but I read about these new ones in a magazine article and decided to give them a shot. After a single treatment, I noticed a big difference! I&#x27;ve been a coffee/tea drinker for years, and those will yellow your teeth after a while, so I definitely needed something to help whiten. I&#x27;d been considering my dentist office&#x27;s whitening system ($300), but am so glad I tried these first! I&#x27;ve been using them twice a day for quicker results, and have been SO IMPRESSED! After 3 days, I definitely saw a HUGE difference. My back teeth now look incredibly yellow, so I&#x27;ve been alternating the top strips from one side of my mouth to the other (still covering the front teeth, just getting diff sides of back teeth each time) and that seems to be helping, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO HAPPY with this product! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I hope this one sticks around for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: A tiny bit of sensitivity, but I&#x27;m also using them twice a day, so that wasn&#x27;t unexpected. Not unbearable, and worth the hassle for the results.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to use for a wedding I was attending.  It worked  well and their was a difference in the color of my teeth.  Not much, but my teeth are older so that maybe the reason.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been skeptical of this product for years, until i saw a recent writeup in consumer reports recommending it as the best whitening product. i&#x27;m more than halfway finished with the box, and after the first few days, i could see the improvement in the whiteness of my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i expected a bad taste, but i could hardly taste the strips, especially after the first few days. also, i have very sensitive teeth, and sometimes after about 20-25 minutes of wearing them, the sensitivity became an issue, but overall i&#x27;ve been very pleased! i&#x27;d highly recommend this product. great price, noticeable whitening! can&#x27;t go wrong with crest&#x27;s satisfaction guarantee (full refund)!</li>
    <li> I bought two boxes because I was skeptical that one box wouldn&#x27;t work..&lt;br /&gt;I was right.. it didn&#x27;t go white like the people on tv or my friends who got them done professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also the strips are pathetic. the top one is ok, but the bottom strip is a JOKE! LOL&lt;br /&gt;it only covers 4 teeth hahahahahaha..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mouth guard and liquid home kits are way better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but my opinion..&lt;br /&gt;it will probably take 4 packs to see real results.&lt;br /&gt;why not save your money up and get professional whiting.&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s what I am going to do next year.. screw this money maklng BS rip off...&lt;br /&gt;and I hate it how, on these websites like amazon or such, or who ever is plugging  product,  flood the sites with positive reviews to just sell products which aren&#x27;t even that good...</li>
    <li> It took a few days to show any effects but I definitely did notice a difference. They are very easy to use - just 30 mins per day. I would purchase them again</li>
    <li> I tried a whitestrip one time when they first came out and it seemed to work but increased my teeth&#x27;s sensitivity and I thought I just could not or should not use them.  I took a chance again with this particular product - 3D with Advanced Seal Professional Effects - and after using them every day for 2 weeks, I am seeing increasing whitening AND no pain or sensitivity!  I have also tried the ones without the advanced seal, and they feel like a slippery piece of plastic wrap that are awkward and hard to work with.  I love the advanced seal - they do not slide around at all; they stay put until ready to be removed.  I am an ex-smoker and this is really helping to get my bright white smile back!</li>
    <li> I hate going to the dentist, and my Mom has used the bleaching trays before and it just makes your teeth all sensitive and bare. These strips worked great. I haven&#x27;t even used all 25 yet and my teeth are significantly whiter. I was complimented on them! I decided to whiten 2 weeks before my graduation and I didn&#x27;t even use them every day (every other day is recommended if you have sensitive teeth). Noticeably whiter and nicer to look at :D</li>
    <li> This product did NOTHING to whiten my teeth. Not even a little bit! A total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D white pro effects with advanced seal are one of the best whitening strips out there. They were recommended to me by my dentist and they really do work as well as any professional whitening. These are a *must* upgrade from the less expensive whitening strips which just don&#x27;t stay on your teeth for the full 30 min and therefore don&#x27;t whiten as well. The advanced seal really makes them stay on and whiten as well as any professional whitening treatments. However, they were a bit painful. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth/gums, but even the first time I used them I experienced some mildly serious pain. It was a bit like a pop rock x10 exploding against my gum/teeth (this happened a few times for about 30 seconds each). But hey, it hurts to be beautiful, right?</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the previous versions of Crest Whitestrips, and the 3D Professional Effects strips are even better. They really do stay in place while you are wearing both the top and bottom strip, and I was able to use them for more than one hour per day (which exceeds the maximum amount recommended by the instructions). There was obvious whitening within the first few applications, and by the time I used all 20 strips I had a gorgeous, bright white smile. I will definitely use this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week and it does a pretty good job. It doesn&#x27;t remove as much stain if you use the strip once but if you use it for days straight, you&#x27;re teeth will be really white I&#x27;m guessing. If you&#x27;re going to use this right after brushing your teeth, I suggest putting it on at least 30 minutes after brushing because I had some sensitivity in my teeth when using it after brushing my teeth. But overall, it&#x27;s pretty good since it did get rid of a couple layers of yellow. P.S., You might get small white stains on your teeth like I did, but it&#x27;s not as noticeable and it&#x27;ll go away within 1-2 days.</li>
    <li> I used the Crest whitening strips a year ago and my dental hygienist noticed that my teeth are much brighter. This year I see even more improvement. My teeth will never be white as  have been constrained to take doxycycline a few times, but I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My teeth were visually whiter after using the very first strip . I have now used 15 of the twenty strips and I am very pleased. I have suffered none of the sensitivity problems that others have reported. I have followed the advice not to brush my teeth before I apply the strips. Therefore, I apply the strips when I get up in the morning and set a timer for thirty minutes. When it goes off I remove the strips, rinse my mouth with water, eat breakfast,  then brush my teeth. It works for me. When I apply the strips I put them loosely in position. Then, starting in the middle, I use my fingernail to press the strip into the joint between two teeth. Then I hold that spot in place while I use a fingernail from my other hand to press the strip into the next joint and so on down the line. The excess width I fold in toward the back of my teeth but I do not press it against my teeth since, when it is time to remove it, I reach in and flip it back up with my finger and use it to pull the strip off. The strips are so wide that I believe that it would be possible to cut each one into two pieces lengthways and use them but I have not tried this.</li>
    <li> They helped just a little, did not see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> This little guy is doing magic. It&#x27;s like having a wall repainted. People are asking about my teeth like crazy. It really works even if it&#x27;s only two days of using it.</li>
    <li> I like them once I get them on.  I have a hard time putting them on.  Maybe it is just me .  They are good.</li>
    <li> It is really amazing...</li>
    <li> I thought they were great. Easy to use,</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the teeth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> So I got these to try them out and lets just say these work 100%. I found out that I have sensitive teeth so I used these for two days straight then took a day off. From that point on I use them on and off because i definitely feel something. Its not pain but its a small feeling that if I continue on using them then I would be in pain. Im on the 4th one today and my teeth are white.&lt;br /&gt;I dont drink coffee and have not been to the dentist in 4 years. My teeth were yellow and I clearly see a difference and others do as  well.</li>
    <li> Great Product; great price, item came as expected; will recommend to a friend. These work wonders, I will order again!</li>
    <li> These work and are worth the money if you are looking to whiten your teeth.  We started using them in the early 2000s and they haven&#x27;t let us down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for kids who have recently had braces taken off.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery- Awesome Product!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly whitens quickly</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use these things for weeks straight (and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re supposed to either....), but after a few days, my teeth become super sensitive to heat and cold. But they did get a lot whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re really easy to put on, and I love that they stay on so you can put it on, go back to whatever your doing, and take them off to brush your teeth after.</li>
    <li> I truly enjoy this product this is something that will buy again. It whiten my teeth didn&#x27;t take long it was easy to apply I definitely will buy more</li>
    <li> This thing really works!&lt;br /&gt;Love it.The difference is clear.&lt;br /&gt;I receive loads of complements about my now white teeth!</li>
    <li> It worked wonderfully. I started to see my teeth to whiten around the 5-6th time. I&#x27;ll admit I did feel a bit of tingling/sensitivity. If that happens, take a break from them for about a day or two and start again. I really didn&#x27;t mind the sensitivity since it didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> Has whitened my teeth after three treatments however, if you leave them on longer than the recommended 30 minutes, you teeth will ache like hell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set a timer!</li>
    <li> LOVE these whitening strips! They have definitely helped in getting my teeth white and now I use them occasionally to keep my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced sensitivity as some people have complained about. I used these in April and will probably use them again in another month or so.</li>
    <li> Great product and easy to use.  I noticed a brighter smile after using 3 applications during a one week time period.  I recommend using a tissue to dab teeth (and gum area) so these areas are dry before applying the strips.  This way, the strips will stay on securely and comfortably for the recommended 30 minute time period.</li>
    <li> Use everyday &amp; you&#x27;ll see a difference in the whiteness.</li>
    <li> Like the originals, won&#x27;t stay in place!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me as my i had developed a lot of gum pain after the first couple of days. My friend recommended for me to use sensodyne but I wasn&#x27;t sure if that would work. I may try it again in the future, but for now it&#x27;s going back on the shelf.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought..</li>
    <li> These are the best whitestrips out of Crest&#x27;s entire line, in my opinion. I use them about once a year to keep my teeth nice and white. Note, I do not smoke, drink coffee or wine, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of staining to deal with. These are the exact same strips sold in drugstores/big-box stores, but far cheaper through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have never had my teeth whitened. I visited dentists regularly when I had dental coverage; no longer. My teeth fortunately are presentable and straight, but discolored from age and coffee, etc. I ordered these only because of the Christmas-time rebate. They not only work, they WORK FAST. They do however make teeth sensitive. I have handled this by skipping days between applications. There is no way I will use these year-round (couldn&#x27;t afford to). However, if you are looking for a product that does what it claims, this is it.</li>
    <li> i did not have to use all the whitening strips too achieve my pearly whites! I have left over ones i use randomly! Great for the price for at home whitening!</li>
    <li> Several didn&#x27;t stick to my teeth! There is no address to direct this problem to.</li>
    <li> The Luxe strips are much stronger and stay much better than the original strips.  They&#x27;re a little tougher to remove, which I appreciate, knowing that the strip is keeping the gel from being swished away from my teeth during wear.</li>
    <li> I logged onto the computer today JUST to come to Amazon to submit this review. I have had professional teeth whitening in a dentist office and not the low quality temporary &amp;#34;zoom&amp;#34; whitening that most advertise. These strips worked just as well if not better. Toward the gum line on my bottom teeth is where the yellowing is the most prominent. The whitening improvement is substantial enough for me to notice without having to be reminded by a photo of their prior shade. I began using daily and experienced sensitivity on the backside of my teeth so I switched to every other day. If you already have sensitive teeth, this product may be a little strong for you so you may need to space out their use to how many days in between work for you. These strips won&#x27;t move even if you want them to; they really stick to the teeth with no chance of letting saliva in or of the gel leaking out into your mouth &amp; tongue - a real plus in my book. The strips cover the gums but do not irritate them at all. Well worth the cost and I am so glad I found something I know will work. I will buy this again and again and again.</li>
    <li> I have used this before and am using it again and it has always done a great job!!  This is probably the best version of the strips that they have in my opinion.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  Been using for years.  Now only down to once or twice a week at most to keep the bright smile.  What I like most is I don&#x27;t feel like it has not created that &#x27;fake&#x27; look some people have when they over do with the whitening product.  It&#x27;s a nice natural white.  These strips do not make my teeth too sensitive.  I suppose if you have sensitive to begin with, it may do a little.  Just be sure and not leave on longer than the recommended 30 minutes, and you should be okay.  Even hubby is hooked on them now.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> So the spouse says to me I need this item because I drink coffee for the last 40 years..I used it twice a day or a week and ya know..it does make my teeth look whiter...I like it</li>
    <li> Whitestrips work fairly well. I do notice a difference, however it&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing to have gunk wrapped around your teeth for an hour. They advise against using Whitestrips right after brushing your teeth. That is good advice as they don&#x27;t work well at all if used that way. Strange. I have not tried Power Swabs so I can&#x27;t compare the two. That will be my next venture into teeth whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not buy these again, especially if Power Swabs work better. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> A favorite for a reason- quick, easy, awesome results, minimal irritation. (Take their advice and DON&#x27;T brush your teeth right before using them) Within 3 days you&#x27;ll have people asking you about your smile.</li>
    <li> My teeth looked terrible till i got this.  Very easy to use, there is no mess, and they dont have a nasty taste.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used these exactly as instructed and noticed a huge difference!  I have had multiple people in my life tell me how white my teeth were since then!  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> They work great.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Quick and easy to use and the whitening gel doesn&#x27;t sluff off your teeth or the strip and get all in your mouth. The strips stay put too the whole time too!</li>
    <li> I ordered these second time as i loved using these on my teeth... they work well and i noticed whitening in 4-5 times of using these strips... very effective and affordable way of whitening your smile... I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I used to have yellow/faded teeth, and these strips in conjunction with the whitening toothpaste really whitened my teeth. However, they also make my mouth really sore for hours after using them, even when I only have a strip in for 15 or 20 of the 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I do these once or twice per year to keep my teeth at their whitest and this product does deliver.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat the price here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;i keep the strips on longer than the recommended time and in my case i feel like i get better whitening for even less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the 7 day strips and they burned my gums.  I don&#x27;t get increased sensitivity with the professional effect strips.&lt;br /&gt;it also helps to switch to Sensodyne while whitening.</li>
    <li> This made my teeth extremely sensitive so I had to stop it. Tylenol did help with that though. But I think I am going to switch to using this every other day or buy the gentle routine version instead. Save your money and don&#x27;t subject yourself to this pain!</li>
    <li> Work well enough for what you are paying for.</li>
    <li> Teeth look noticeably whiter!!  The strips stick to your teeth, and teeth are not as sensitive as with other whitening products.</li>
    <li> I have a whiten teeth experience in the dentist, and the doctor said it&#x27;s not so healthy to the teeth, so I stop doing more. This product is good, and after using, it is not difficult to see the changes.</li>
    <li> These Crest 3D Whitestrips (Professional Effects) worked surprisingly well. This was my first time trying the product, and found this treatment significantly whitened my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Crest to inquire of the differences in their teeth whitening products, and was advised the professional effects treatment would do what it is advertised to do.  They also advised to limit this treatment to no more than two times per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have noticed and complimented on how white my teeth are. Some reviewers have commented on the &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; not being adequate; I&#x27;ve found the grip is great because it really holds onto your teeth for the 30 minute treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied and intend to keep using Crest Whitestrips for years to come.</li>
    <li> These are great whiteners.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve purchased them twice already once in February and the other in December of last year.  I&#x27;ve honestly loved the results and am thinking to purchase another in September.  This is a great investment honestly.  It is on the expensive side but it does its job.  As for what other reviewers before me have posted there is a bit of tooth sensitivity after you&#x27;ve used the product but you can skip a day or two and then continue with your treatments. If you use them too often you will feel it trust me lol.  So every other day should be fine.  The results are phenomenal.  I definitely don&#x27;t mind the price for the product...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard of the Crest White Strips, but just put off buying them because of the expense or because I wasn&#x27;t sure they&#x27;d even work.  I received a gift card for Amazon through my work and thought this would be a no risk way to try these out.  Man, am i glad i did!!  I actually purchased 2 boxes, one for my teenagers who&#x27;ve been bugging me to buy for them and one for myself.  The results were noticeable after about 2-3 uses and for me, only about 10 applications were necessary.  I will save the other 10 strips for touch ups down the road.  Overall, a great value, effective product, easy to use, takes only 30 minutes and definitely gets off those stubborn coffee/wine stains!  Everyone in my household loves these!</li>
    <li> Amazing the way they work</li>
    <li> Very noticeable, quick results.  I used them every day for a half hour for a week, and my teeth ate several shades whiter - even after years of drinking coffee and smoking. The only bad thing is that it made my teeth and gums fairly sensitive, but that quickly dissipated upon terminating the treatment.</li>
    <li> Works at its perfection!</li>
    <li> Fades away if you do not use treatment for one day</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth sore.  But it does work.</li>
    <li> These strips are faulty. The gel is dry and not the same product that I&#x27;ve bought on numerous occasions before. They don&#x27;t work. Buy from another seller.</li>
    <li> Really works, makes my teeth white and also VERY SORE!! Lol, so I did try to do it every other night, and my teeth still hurt. Just breathing makes you want to cry 😢😢 so I tried  every 2 days, but ehhhh still hurt. I do have sensitive teeth in general  and use sensodine every day but it didn&#x27;t really help. But if you&#x27;d like to try it just be prepared for pain.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well. I bought this, not expecting too much, but my teeth have definitely grown a lot whiter since I&#x27;ve been applying this and people around me have pointed it out. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This tooth whitener WORKS! Go with this one you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Showing great results after one week</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. FAST SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> I bought these when I noticed my teeth were significantly yellow. I used the product for three days in a row, then skipped a day to avoid sensitivity issues. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. My teeth aren&#x27;t movie star white, but the yellow is definitely gone. I&#x27;ll be using these again as needed.</li>
    <li> I do 2x applications per day to speed up the process. Note there will be some tooth sensitivity. Any color unevenness will disappear after a few days to a week. My father who is a dentist recommends this over wasting money for a professional whitening.</li>
    <li> This product works so well people were asking me if I went to a dentist to have my teeth done.</li>
    <li> Within a few minutes after applying them, an awful taste was in my mouth. After about 5 more minutes I gave up and removed them.  An hour later my lips are still burning. Perhaps I&#x27;m allergic.  In any case, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love whitening products. I reorder these every six months or so. They whiten very well and as an avid whitener myself, I believe these to be the best I&#x27;ve tried. They don&#x27;t leave hardly any residue on the teeth and they do have staying power and grip. Just 30 minutes a day is all it takes. Be sure to rinse a few times to wash out the product or you could have some sesativity if you don&#x27;t get it all out. My teeth are white so I use once or twice a week just to maintain.</li>
    <li> Great product! Visibly whiter teeth after just a few uses. Doesn&#x27;t leave any gross residue and the strips stay on great. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> my teeth got so whiiiite after I used this one. They might be a bit sensitive while using them but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I had been vaguely interested in tooth whitening in the past, but not enough to pay my dentist to do it. I was skeptical that the various &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; type products on the market would work, so I was eager to try the Crest 3D Whitestrips. I had never used such a product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how well they stuck to my teeth. The first couple of times, being unfamiliar with the process, I didn&#x27;t get things lined up properly, but eventually I figured it out. I never had an issue with the strip loosening before its time was up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advertising says that you will see results after three days, and indeed I did. I took photographs to compare and there was a definite difference. The longer I used them, the whiter my teeth were. I was not aiming for blinding, just a reduction of the yellow, and I got that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside was that I noticed some irritation of the gumline after using the strips for a few days. This was minor and disappeared after I finished the package.</li>
    <li> These really have come a long way from a few years ago. They made my teeth a lot whiter from about day 10 to about a month after I used them. Only downside is they really make your teeth hurt if you&#x27;re sensitive to that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> Is there a reason I&#x27;m not seeing improvement? Majorly disappointed because these had such great reviews, even people saying that you don&#x27;t need to use the full treatment and can whiten in a minimal three days. After 6 days, I don&#x27;t see any difference except on my upper front two teeth there are white spots.  The packaging says these are normal and will go away in a few hours, but they&#x27;ve been there since the first day.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I don&#x27;t think it has a bad taste. They did stay on well but for me weren&#x27;t too hard to get off at all. I&#x27;ve had 2 random bursts of sensitivity/pain on two different teeth (bottom teeth), but it was like a 5 second thing.</li>
    <li> I want a refund on the item that I bought. I seen no improvements at all and my teeth has been feeling sensitive for for almost two weeks and I had  stop using the strips since the 3rd of August. And their still feeling sensitive !</li>
    <li> My 8 yr old granddaughter pointed out my teeth were yellow. Dentist recommend these. Wow! What a difference.  I have been complimented over and over.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well and saves lots of money compared to going to the dentist for this service.</li>
    <li> Worked great. In just a couple weeks of daily use, my teeth were a few shades whiter.</li>
    <li> They really do work. As easy to put on as it gets. Makes teeth very white.</li>
    <li> These worked just ok. There was a slight difference, but not too noticeable. Unlike others, I didn&#x27;t experience sensitivity and they were easy to use. I think in the future it&#x27;ll probably worth the time and money to invest in whitening trays instead of buying more strips.</li>
    <li> I have gone the route of molded dental trays for whitening.....very expensive.  After reading many reviews, I purchased Whitestrips and noticed improvement in just a couple of days.  The product is very easy to use, just as effective as the dentist&#x27;s product and much less expensive.  I really could not figure out just how long to use the product the first time or there after.  More detailed instructions would be helpful for me.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth white, but incredibly sensitive. Not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> Never could afford orthadonture, and while I&#x27;ve got some crooked teeth, I get one pack of 20 treatments a year, use 6 for a couple weeks, and then save the rest and use one a month for the rest of the year to maintain nice white teeth. I get lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;beautiful smile&amp;#34; and still enjoy cigarettes, and coffee every day, and dark sodas on occasion. They don&#x27;t hurt your enamel, and even my dentist says &amp;#34;you have such healthy beautiful while teeth!&amp;#34; I tried off brand ones, and found they were a waste of money and time. They don&#x27;t stick well, hurt my gums, or whiten the fronts of my teeth, but don&#x27;t get in between my crooked teeth. Amazon is definitely the place to buy them. Cheaper than anywhere, and talk about a bargain of a confidence booster compared to the almost $600 I was quoted for whitening trays from the dentist that insurance won&#x27;t cover. I even said, &amp;#34;no thanks. I&#x27;ll stick with my crest whitestrips.&amp;#34; And the dentist couldn&#x27;t even argue with it.</li>
    <li> Whitened teeth as promise.</li>
    <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> my co-worker notice my teeth getting whiter</li>
    <li> Works great! Very effectively lightened my teeth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the hate with this product.  I see a difference after only 3 applications and use it just as suggested on the box.  My teeth went from slightly yellowish as I have never done this before, to WHITE.  It works!! It is uncomfortable while you wear it but the stinging goes away and I feel great and my teeth are great.</li>
    <li> Best invention ever!  I have been using Crest Whitestips for about 10 years now and I love them!  I use them regularly to keep my teeth looking great!  Decent price!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price. These strips go for $40-60 in some grocery stores. I quit smoking and bringing my pearly whites back!</li>
    <li> the strips hurt my teeth really bad. I had to remove them 15 minutes after they were put on. I&#x27;m in agony right now and I will never wear them again. 38 bucks down the drain. Thank you Crest for this experience.</li>
    <li> These are kind of a chore to put on but they stick to your teeth well. I noticed my teeth seemed whiter after about 3 uses and after I used the whole box, there was a significant difference. It works, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product with fast results. I&#x27;m on day 4 with these things and I haven&#x27;t seen my teeth this white before (and I used pure baking soda and whitening paste everyday). I also have very sensitive teeth. I ignore most of the negative reviews here. I just bought a WHEY protein powder and on there are people who are lactose-intolerant giving 1-star reviews because of the lactose-intolerant symptoms they get when they use the product! I&#x27;m tired of negative reviews that do not fairly judge the product and push naive people away from products that can significantly help most other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers claim they don&#x27;t work. That&#x27;s BS. The only way these don&#x27;t work is if you already have brilliant white teeth or you are putting them in wrong. As for the people claiming these hurt them so badly they need to &amp;#34;take pain medication to sleep&amp;#34; - they are degrading a product based on their own dental issue that has nothing to do with the product. The only whitening ingredient is hydrogen-peroxide. It&#x27;s used to lift stains. So if that&#x27;s hurting you - you might have an infection. I would bet that if every reviewer who claims these strips are hurting them swished some hydrogen peroxide in their mouths - they would be in pain because they have an infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: These work for me under the criteria that should be used to review this product.  Keep in mind that sometimes it is not the product - it&#x27;s you.</li>
    <li> This product is only good is you have perfect straight teeth. I would recommend the &amp;#34;5 Minute Bleach Whitening Gel&amp;#34;. You get a lot more for a lot less money and it works on crooked teeth.</li>
    <li> These start to work after the 10th strip. My teeth are so white and never got sensitive. I will be ordering a third box when I am done with this one.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 boxes, one for me and one for my girlfriend, and we were pleased with our results. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I got this as soon as I got my braces off. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work I was very close to paying my dentist $350 for Bright Smile when my orthodontist recommended I get this first. When I used it for couple of days my teeth started to ache and then I read in the instructions that it may cause tooth sensitivity. I continued using it bc eventually it stopped. Also in few days I was able to see the difference. It doesn&#x27;t slip off your teeth, It easy to take off and easy to wear for 30 min. I sometimes wore it for 45 min bc I forgot it was on. I would recommend this over expensive products.</li>
    <li> long time you love. me be there. white teeth for love for me to make for you. crest white stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days and I havent seen any results yet, but I have heard about good results from friends</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any diff in whiteness and&lt;br /&gt;Ive used this product ten times and i dont  see any change</li>
    <li> I always get so many compliments and people ask me how I get my teeth so white. I&#x27;d like to say Crest3D is my little secret, but I always let them know. &#x3D;) I use them twice a year. Once every 6 months.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle! I love science. My teeth are SIGNIFICANTLY whiter now then they were before I started using these strips. I&#x27;m only on #13 and my teeth look incredible! So far I&#x27;ve had zero pain/sensitivity. I honestly don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are referring to. I recommend this product 110%!</li>
    <li> I tried Zoom Whitening a few years ago and was surprised by how painful it was. I don&#x27;t generally have sensitive teeth, but I found the &amp;#34;afterpain&amp;#34; of these strips to be comparable to the dentist&#x27;s treatment. That being said, given the recommended time these work really well too, but I&#x27;m not going to bother trying them again. The temporary whitening is not worth the nerve pain and potential enamel damage.</li>
    <li> These worked wonders! I saw a huge difference after using just half the box. My roommate even suggested I stop using them so my teeth didn&#x27;t get \\&quot;too white.\\&quot; No such thing - they look amazing now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these are a vast improvement over the old White Strips; they stick to your teeth (if anything it&#x27;s difficult to get them off) and don&#x27;t deposit icky bleach around the rest of your mouth.</li>
    <li> VERY HAPPY with results easy to use fast delivery Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Works amazing and just like it claims!!</li>
    <li> My teeth are apparently really hard to get white. I have to admit I have not used the product everyday like you are supposed to. I get around to it maybe 2 times on the weekend. I know people who&#x27;ve used it w/ excellent results.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. I bought this with high hopes. My teeth are in good shape but where a bit stained from drinking tea. I stopped drinking tea and used this product for a month. There was no difference in color. Looking around I&#x27;ve found a lot of people who have said the same. Apparently Crest changed the product in the past year and it doesn&#x27;t work like it used to.</li>
    <li> Mixed feelings about these whitestrips. They for sure do work because I get a lot of compliments on how white my teeth are and questions about what product I use. However, occasionally my teeth feels really sensitive, like a sting from my teeth that shoots all the way up to my brain. Sometimes I notice that it will even happen even when I&#x27;m not wearing the whitestrips. This did not happen at all before I started whitening. This does not always happen p, but when it does I usually wait a couple days before starting again.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re going to hear a lot of reviews on how great this product is. Believe it!</li>
    <li> After over 5 years of no dental cleanings due to lack of insurance (and no indigent dental programs in my area), my teeth were noticeably stained. I had been a Coke drinker for several years, as well, and the stains were so compounded that my teeth were a nasty yellow. They never looked clean, even after brushing my teeth. I recently went back to the dentist and got a professional cleaning and the dentist recommended the take-home whitening trays for $200. Although I wanted whiter teeth, I wasn&#x27;t willing to shell out $200 for results. I did my research on the best at-home whitening treatments that can be bought over-the-counter and this one came out on top nearly every time. I saw pictures from before and after and was impressed so I decided to give it a try. I noticed results after the first or second day and it&#x27;s only gotten better from there. I like that there is no disgusting taste - the taste isn&#x27;t minty but it&#x27;s not horrible, either. The one thing I was worried about was sensi... Read more</li>
    <li> I typically have used cheaper whiteners, but this time I wanted to make sure that I used a product that whitened well as I recently got a crown that was a shade lighter than my non-whitened teeth.  I used this Professional Effects and it worked great to lighten my natural teeth to match the crown.</li>
    <li> They worked great... I&#x27;ll be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> I actually ordered for Crest 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal Technology, but I got this product(Professional Effects) last week. Used 2 times for consecutive days. My teeth started to feel really sensitive. So I stopped using it for couple of days as some said in their reviews that using this on alternate days might avoid sensitivity. I used it for the 3rd time and my teeth felt so sensitive the whole day and even the next day! About whitening the teeth, I didn&#x27;t had a noticeable change. They might have changed their color little bit but definitely not worth the pain!! Very disappointed for getting this product!</li>
    <li> People tell me I have politician movie star teeth and they hate standing next to me in pictures; that&#x27;s how great this stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, I&#x27;ve been using whitestrips by Crest ever since they came out 10 years ago or so and they&#x27;ve gotten SO much better. These I can drink water with on at night without worrying about swallowing the stuff. After about five days of nightly use, I usually see significant change.</li>
    <li> Meh, Maybe I was expecting too much, but these didnt seen to do much.  My teeth were already pretty white, but I was expecting to light up a room after using these</li>
    <li> The whitining these strips provide is fantastic, however I experienced very severe shooting pain in my bottom teeth every once in a while. This pain was very short so it isn&#x27;t too unbearable. Would reccomend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Really see the difference! Lots of comments from people about how white my teeth are.</li>
    <li> At the time when I received my package and saw the product I was disappointed and think that I received a different item  from what I ordered. But after using it for one week I saw difference. For sure I will order CREST 3D again. Recommended</li>
    <li> within a few days I noticed a change did not have any pain I wish they came in bigger packs</li>
    <li> Did notice my teeth get whiter but not as expected!</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical that these would work but they do! My teeth weren&#x27;t too bad; they weren&#x27;t stained, just a little drab. I&#x27;m fifty. They were just... drab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After five sessions/days, my wife noticed a difference. I got a little carried away and did two treatments in one day and my teeth felt sensitive for a day or so afterwards. Other than that, it wasn&#x27;t noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone else recommended Sensodyne toothpaste. I think that helps. My wife, however, tried them and she was bothered by sensitive teeth. Once she used the Sensodyne, she was fine, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty cool having white white white teeth.</li>
    <li> This product completely works and my teeth are extremely whiter after the 20 day use. Its better priced then the stores. This is the second time I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Got just what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I Love these teeth whitening strips. I have used them every couple of months and my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many types of Crest White Strips over the years with great results.  People regularly comment that my teeth are white - in spite of how much tea and red wine I drink!  I find that the cheapest most basic White Strips work the best for me because they don&#x27;t bother my gums as much as the stronger kind.  I used these every few days and had good results, but I didn&#x27;t use them as directed - more as a refresher.  The only thing to keep in mind is that I&#x27;ve heard while your using the strips your teeth become more porous and susceptible to staining - so it&#x27;s best to use these quickly and take a break (or cut back on) the coffee, tea, red wine, or whatever other teeth-staining vices you may have during this process.  I find these work better than the generic brands, but maybe I&#x27;ve just used some bad generic ones.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more Crest White Strips in the future.</li>
    <li> I gave it the highest rating because I was skeptical going in and was amazed at the results. I&#x27;m 65 yesars old and my teeth had achieved the coffee and tea drinkers yellowish cast. While they aren&#x27;t pearly, movie star white, they are vastly whiter. My wife had the same results and is of the same opinion. We each plan to continue on the maintenance schedule suggested by the manufacturer. The only negative for me is that the half hour the strips are on isn&#x27;t particularly pleasant. This didnt bother my wife as much.</li>
    <li> I was having little luck with the $300 custom trays and &amp;#34;professional strength&amp;#34; whitening gel my dentist sold me.  Months and months with very little improvement.  I decided to call a local dentist regarding Zoom.  The receptionist explained the process and I quickly said &amp;#34;screw that.&amp;#34;  She said they recommend the Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects and have begun selling them in their office.  I figured it was a small price to pay for something that could potentially whiten my teeth.  Two treatments in and my teeth are ridiculously whiter.  I am beyond impressed.  Pretty bummed I have spent over $500 in trays and gels to have no improvement and dropped $30 on these drugstore strips and they are fantastic.  Definitely going to continue with these.</li>
    <li> All what i want to say is. THANKS CREST FOR THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;REALLY.. IT changed my life&lt;br /&gt;Im so obsesses with white teeth.. Oh my god the result is damn awesome&lt;br /&gt;Every part of my family asked me about my teeth after i used it. Lol then i bought it agn for them also for my husband and he loved the result alooot&lt;br /&gt;5 staaaaaarsss</li>
    <li> Easy to use, I saw a little change after a couple of days but after that really no change , my teeth are brighter but not sparkly white like in the commercials , but for the price it a ok product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a coffee drinker but I did drink a lot of soda - Coke - in my younger years and believe this caused most of the stains on my teeth.  Even though I followed the directions on the box, I really didn&#x27;t see much improvement. Thought the Rembrandt White Strips worked much better and will probably go back to using them since they are much cheaper.</li>
    <li> this is great because it does stay on and it&#x27;s way much cheaper than our local stores where i live.</li>
    <li> Noticed results right away:)</li>
    <li> First thing is first. They hurt. They hurt me at least. I had great pain from these. I used them every night and woke up in the morning with super sensitive teeth which killed me. But it was worth it. What a different the strips make. My teeth were never white and have never been as white as they are now. I now get compliments all the time about how white my teeth are. Bottom line, expect some pain if you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing, but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> This product works well and had very quick delivery.  I do wish it had a chart to compare progress to and it will, like all others, cause a bit of sensitivity to your teeth in the beginning.  Overall it does what it is supposed to do and at a very good cost.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful and am still that with the last few strips I&#x27;ll achieve complete bleaching....including some stubborn stains at the bottoms of some front lower teeth.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I rarely take the time to review a product, but I felt I really needed to write something. I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker, and I had bought a tray system from my dentist  a few years ago.  It was difficult, it was a commitment of an hour+ a day, and after a week, I barely noticed a difference.  I gave up because I had so much sensitivity and zero results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews here and thought I&#x27;d give Crest 3D a try.  I started brushing with Sensodyne two weeks before I began with the strips.  I&#x27;m on day 10, and honestly, I could stop right now because my teeth look great!  My teeth are about 3 shades lighter than when I began, and I&#x27;ve had no sensitivity issues--remarkable considering that I brush my teeth after dinner--which is about an hour before I apply the strips, and then again, once the treatment is over.</li>
    <li> i am on my 5TH day of using these white strips and i HAVE NOT seen a change in the color of my teeth at all. i wouldnt suggest using this product i will be returning them no doubt about it.</li>
    <li> Being someone with sensitive teeth, I was a bit leery of using these whitening strips, especially since I&#x27;ve never used a teeth whitening product before, and wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect outside of all of the negatives that I&#x27;ve heard and read online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Crest&#x27;s 3D White Whitestrips are really quite gentle, and, happily, they actually work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odd foaming sensation took a bit of getting used to, but I appreciated that the white strips stayed in place once applied to my teeth. Simply open up the small foil pouch, remove one strip at a time, and apply them to the upper and lower teeth, pressing them in place. Crest actually advises against brushing your teeth prior to application, which I was initially surprised about. I&#x27;m guessing that these adhere better to teeth that aren&#x27;t freshly brushed, and that recent brushing may actually abrade your teeth more than you might want just prior to a whitening treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the bleaching agent doesn&#x27;t taste that great, I found myself making a restroom trip to get rid of the extra moisture that these produce, about once every ten minutes or so. But the simple fact that they&#x27;re so portable would make it quite easy for one to take them to work with them, and whiten there (being a school teacher, I think my little ones might find it a bit odd that I seemed to be foaming at the mouth, so not so much in my case! ; D  ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I have no doubt that these strips are just as effective as a whitening session with my dentist would be, especially since my dental hygienist pretty much said that these would do just as good a job for 10% (at full retail price) of what I&#x27;d pay my dentist, when I asked her about them. That, alone, convinces me that I&#x27;ll be using these again in the future, once my now significantly brighter smile starts to dim again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job, Crest! I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest whitening strips for years before they used to be messy and didn&#x27;t stay on well. Now they couldn&#x27;t be any better! They are so effective, you can see a difference after the third day. I used to buy them from Wal-Mart but now I buy them from Amazon because they are so much cheaper on here. Wal-Mart sells them for $52 and on here its only $32.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down fall for the whitening strips is the same as the rest of them is that it wears down the enamel on your teeth and makes your teeth extremely sensitive to hot and cold. I suggest not using them everyday, I would limit it to 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> Results are a bit slower than anticipated, very sensitive teeth as of right now.  I have not been able to find any info on how frequently these should be worn, once a day? once a week?</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!! Read a ton of great reviews, and although I was hesitant to spend the $40, it was well worth it! No pain at all and I saw a visible difference in just the first use. This is my 3rd day now and it&#x27;s crazy how much whiter it keeps getting. Definitely a fan, and I&#x27;m glad I caved in and bought this, because your smile says a great deal about your personal hygiene! Invest in making a good first impression :)</li>
    <li> The product works as described on the box. I noticed the difference with the first use and just a week of use was enough to get full whitened teeths.</li>
    <li> 3 hours a day&lt;br /&gt;It makes my teeth hurt!!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my Teeth Really sensitive!!&lt;br /&gt;They do whiten my teeth&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using them every day.  I still have some,</li>
    <li> I tried these and they didn&#x27;t really do very much for my teeth that reg toothpaste could do. I went to the dentist and got a cleaning- If you have stains- the dentist is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Amazon has these for a great price, and they are very easy &amp; comfortable.  However, the results were not great for me.  I was very regular w/ them each night for 20 days... and found that the strips made spots on my teeth that are SUPER white, instead of the entire tooth.  Overall, they&#x27;re just OKAY.</li>
    <li> This really works.&lt;br /&gt;It had been about 8 years since my last professional whitening with dentist-made bleaching trays.  My trays no longer fit because of intervening dental work.  When I asked my dentist how much it would cost to do it over again I was told $900.  And I said something like ouch.  Maybe more colorful.  But I love my dentist although I know that my dentist is a bit pricey but I would not switch.  So I grumbled something like well maybe I will try something over the counter before I do that.  Then I somewhat uncomfortably asked if my dentist could recommend an over the counter product and this is the product my dentist mentioned.  In ten applications I got my teeth back to where they were last time I used trays 8 years ago.  For me, this was fantastic because I hated the trays and I hated sleeping in them.  You leave the strips on for only thirty minutes.  Amazing and it works.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist told me that there are more amazing things you can do now that are even better than trays.  But they cost about $1,500 per session and you can go for up to three sessions.&lt;br /&gt;But my advice is that this product is reasonably priced.  Not too unbearably unpleasant to use.  Why not try it and if you like the results you might have saved yourself a bunch of money.  I did.  And if you don&#x27;t like the results you will always have other options.&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought this I checked the Crest website and this particular product seems to the the strongest of the ones Crest makes.</li>
    <li> I had fillings done on both front teeth after an accident 14 years ago. The fillings looked much whiter than my teeth and there was a dark yellow line on the seam. One of the teeth has started to discolour because it needed a root canal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given these whitestrips by a friend who knew I was considering having my teeth professionally whitened. Although I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, I followed the advice of a dentist to start using sensodyne (or some other sensitive toothpaste) a few weeks before the whitening. He also recommended not using a whitening toothpaste during the process. I don&#x27;t like the coating the sensodyne toothpaste leaves in my mouth but it was so effective I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity while using the whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Crest whitestrips easy to use. My mom who was visiting when I started using them and she noticed a small difference after 2 days. I saw a difference after 4 days. I followed the process to the letter and applied the strips every night for 30min for 15 days. The last five strips I have been applying every other day. There is a tingling sensation on the gums but no pain. I also had a small white spot appear on one of my teeth but as it says on the web, it disappears after a couple of hours. It is the drying out of the enamel and that&#x27;s why it is important not to use whitening toothpaste while using crest whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 days, my friends noticed (unsollicited) that I had whiter teeth and after 15 days it is now hard to see the the fillings on the front teeth. The rootcanal tooth is still a minuscule bit darker but the other teeth are all white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say they are as white as they were 12 years ago, and I think that is the natural colour of my teeth. I was not looking for a Hollywood smile, I wanted a bright smile and healthy looking teeth. Mission accomplished!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Crest Whitestrips but this time decided to spring for the Professional Effects kit. I highly recommend paying a little more and getting this kit, as opposed to the lower-priced ones. The strips are so much better--they stick better and don&#x27;t slide around, and they&#x27;re much less annoying than strips from other Crest kits. These also didn&#x27;t inhibit my ability to talk like the other strips did. I noticed an effect quickly! Love these. I will only buy the Professional Effects strips from now on.</li>
    <li> Bought this at my local Walmart for $50 after my dentist recommended it. After using all 20 treatments (two per day), there&#x27;s definitely an improvement but not a major one. It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like a $500 whitening as advertised on the box. I&#x27;m only 22 so my staining isn&#x27;t extreme (brown/grey), which is all the more disappointing that this product couldn&#x27;t make the color of my teeth match my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the strips stuck very well to my teeth - I could talk and laugh without any slippage. I followed the instructions precisely so there was never any sensitivity and my gums never turned white. However the peroxide does leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth whenever your tongue brushes against your teeth. I&#x27;m assuming it will go away after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I don&#x27;t think I will buy another box unless I can get it at the $30 price point I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon. If your teeth have minor staining, I recommend it. For moderate cases, expect to buy a couple or more boxes. For extreme cases, see your dentist.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product! It did cause sensitivity to my teeth, so I used it every other day. But it still worked and I could tell the difference even before I finished using all of the strips.</li>
    <li> Strips are easy to apply and remove. They are odorless and do not leave a bad taste after use. I was concerned about the duration of each application as I could not find the information until I bought the strips and read the fine print instructions inside. I am an old guy who rarely visits a dentist. My teeth had paled over the years and I was reluctant to visit the dentist. I read a lot of good reviews about the strip and decided to give a try. The only hindrance was the seemingly steep price. But, every now and than, Amazon comes up with deals too good to pass. I am glad that I decided to give it a try. In just four applications, 30 minutes each day, I began to see a drastic change in my teeth. After the first application, I realized that I could cut the strips in two along the length and get more for the money. It worked just fine. I also have a tooth that was a bit back and not in line with the rest of the teeth. I cut a very small piece of strip to apply on this tooth. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend to all. I have sensitive teeth and had no problems using the strips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old, was a two to three pack a day smoker for nearly 30 years, have consumed a lot of red wine, coffee, and tea in my day, and have been feeling embarrassed lately about my yellow-stained teeth. I had never had my teeth whitened, and I&#x27;m no longer able to afford the dental office whitening.  After checking with my dentist (again) about the cost of having him whiten my teeth ($300 minimum), he also recommended that I try these. I was told that these strips work more effectively on teeth with a yellowish stain than those with more of a grayish color.  And of course, not everyone will get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had sensitive teeth, so unlike a lot of the reviewers here, that hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me. I&#x27;ve been applying the upper and lower strips twice a day for 30-40 minutes for three days so far. The difference I see already is pretty exciting.  My only comments --mainly for mature folks whose teeth have naturally lengthened with age-- is that the strips are a little bit narrow for covering the full height of your teeth.  Also (for everyone) if your teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly straight, you&#x27;ll want to take care to place the strips so they make the fullest possible contact with the entire surface of each tooth --which can be tricky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, however, so far I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have tried that advanced vivid before and it worked really well so I tried the professional effects kind. The seal is great and there&#x27;s almost no taste. I had a bit of sensitivity the first few times, but it stoped happening. I would recomend this product. It&#x27;s really worth the price!</li>
    <li> I bought these White Strips on Amazon before my wedding so I could have whiter-looking teeth for photos.  I don&#x27;t consider my teeth incredibly sensitive, and they&#x27;re not really yellow, just a little darker than they used to be from my coffee and diet coke habit.  I would not recommend these if you have sensitive teeth, but I think they worked a little bit for the maybe 4-5 applications I did the week before the wedding.  Plus I have lots left over in case I want to do one or two applications before the next event I go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some pointers:&lt;br /&gt;-The box says you can use them twice daily--do not do this!  I used them the first night I got them, and then again the next morning while I got ready.  My teeth HURT for maybe 12 hours--sharp, shooting, aching pain, even when I wasn&#x27;t eating/drinking.&lt;br /&gt;-Do not leave them on too long!  I accidentally fell asleep with the strips on and woke up after they&#x27;d been on for 45+ mins.  Again, my teeth ached for hours the next day and felt very sensitive afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m not 100% sure these made my teeth significantly whiter, but at least I felt like I did something.  They hurt pretty bad if you leave them on too long or use them too frequently, but if you can take the pain, you may see some results.</li>
    <li> I was shocked when I tore open the first package of strips to find they were totally unusable.  The gel was completely dried out and, therefore, unable to adhere to my teeth.  I have used Crest whitestrips for years and have always been more than pleased with the product and its whitening results.  I of course am returning the strips, but have asked for a refund instead of a replacement because I was afraid of receiving another defective box.</li>
    <li> Love these..super fast whitening system. Definitely worth it to have white teeth. No complaints, best out of all the whitestrips. Great price too compared to Walmart and Target.</li>
    <li> I noticed whiter teeth after just two treatments.  My teeth are not yet an evenly whiter yet, but based on my experience with a similar Crest product a few years ago, I expect I&#x27;ll see more consistent whitening as I complete the whitening regimen.  Slight down side, is for full on whitening treatment, the directions recommend leaving the white strips on for two hours.  This version of the white strips is easier to apply than those that Crest made a few years ago and they stick to your teeth much better.  After two hours it is slightly more effort to peel the white strips off versus the old version, but I like it  ...no more loose strips and such.  Overall I do like the Crest 3D White Pro.  I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied...my teeth have returned to their original color!  Easy to use; the strips apply easily and don&#x27;t come off until you are ready to remove them.</li>
    <li> This definitely made my teeth several shades lighter. My teeth are not white, but they&#x27;re absolutely lighter. They went from a yellow-tone to an almost-white yellow. I&#x27;m hoping in the next dose (which according to the box is once every 6 months) I&#x27;ll be able to get to white. I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with the product - no issues with gum bleeding or anything, and my gums are very sensitive. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few years ago, but discontinued it after I received a sudden SHOCK of pain. It was never a gradual pain, it was always a sudden and very sharp SHOCK as if someone were drilling holes into my teeth. It was so bad to the point where I&#x27;d gasp and have to run to the bathroom to rip them off my teeth and use water to rinse it out. Afterward my teeth became extra sensitive to cold, sweets, etc. and would remain extra sensitive for weeks. Mind you, I take very good care of my teeth (brush them twice a day, floss every day, use Listerine, etc.) so it wasn&#x27;t anything I was doing to make them so sensitive. It was the whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was in the Dollar Tree the other day and saw a product called \\&quot;5 minute tooth whitening\\&quot; for just $1. I figured, what the hey I&#x27;ll give that a try just to see. I was not expecting it to work, but amazingly it did! And I received NO PAIN while using it. It&#x27;s been 4 days and still NO PAIN from this 5 minute tooth whitening product, while at the same time getting whiter teeth. I am very surprised that an item that cost me $1 works better than something that costs $40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested, they have the product I use right here on Amazon: Just type into Amazon&#x27;s search bar - \\&quot;5 MINUTE NATURAL WHITE TOOTH WHITENING SYSTEM\\&quot; ... Trust me, it works.</li>
    <li> It did brighten them up ​a bit, however, afterward, I brushed my teeth, and all of a sudden I feel this immense pain from within my tooth and had to stop brushing them. Afterward there was mild pain that was bothersome, but not unbearable. It&#x27;s best if you don&#x27;t use this particular product if you have sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;​For the service though, it was spot on! Shipping was fast and everything came as it should.</li>
    <li> Strips arrived promptly as promised.  The strips are very dry and stick like glue to your teeth.  My teeth are already pretty white but after only two days use I can see a difference.  I would recommend using toothpaste for sensitive teeth a few weeks before treatment as it helps cut down on sensitivity which can be painful for some people causing them to stop before the 21 days are up.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about these at first, because after reading reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure how much mileage I would get out of these.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used about half of the treatments now, and I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per the recommendation of another reviewer, I used two treatments per day for the first few days. While I did see great results more quickly, after three days my teeth became very sensitive to the strips. Using the strips is no problem, but if I use them in the morning, by the evening my teeth are very sensitive and hurt constantly. The pain isn&#x27;t too bad, but it is fairly uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;After doubling on treatments for the first few days, I switched to one treatment per day, and the results are still noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend these, but if you want to save yourself some toothache, try using just one treatment per day.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I would suggest using Crest Sensitivity toothpaste. Regular brushing with this seems to take the edge off of any toothache that may result from using the strips.</li>
    <li> i already have fairly white teeth and that being said not much change with strips.  usually with other brands i seem to get a brighter whiter smile</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d bought the generic brand from Walgreens, seeing that the ingredients are the same. The difference is the strips. The generic brand do not cover the teeth, so you are getting barely any whitening. These strips cover perfectly, and do not slip off. Additionally there are different options for the lengths of time you can keep them on. I am halfway through the box and my teeth look fantastic. I will save the rest for another time. Yes, they can make them sensitive, but this will go away.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, stays in place, and definitely see results!</li>
    <li> as expected&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Worked very well. My teeth got somewhat sensitive, but brushing with Sensodyne daily seemed to help that problem. Sensitivity has gone away since the  strips ran out, but the white teeth remain.</li>
    <li> not good for sensitive teeth.  Teeth are more sensitive since first use.  Discontinued use, waist of money.  Going to my dentist.</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughter. She has been using them 6 days now. 15 minutes ago, she texted me from school telling me how badly her teeth hurt. So, not real happy with these.</li>
    <li> Worked in about a week &amp; saw a difference</li>
    <li> I like the product and this is my 2nd purchase after trying it for the first time many years ago. My teeth did remain white for about a year, like description. Remember to press the strips into your gaps (if any) in between your teeth so that the whitening process is even out. I noticed areas that I missed and are not whitened.</li>
    <li> I decided to upgrade to these and try something new. These made my teeth incredibly sensitive and painful to eat or drink anything after a few days use. I had to eventually stop and use them once a week to prevent sensitivity. I think they are better options on the market.</li>
    <li> Do recommend buying 2 boxes to see the real results. One ox you may start to see depending upon how discolored your teeth are.</li>
    <li> For what these cost in the stores this is an excellent deal and you won&#x27;t find them cheaper anywhere else. The overall performance of these whitestrips was good/ok I did see a difference and got a few compliments. I like the way they fit they are very comfortable (not like the dissolving ones yuck) they are also easy to take off. only thing is that i expected them to be awesome for the price/brand/and the professionl effects ones but there just okay. Not a drastic difference. But i do reccomend that you try them and see how they work for yourself! :)</li>
    <li> These are the best type of Crest White Strips because it doesn&#x27;t slide around on your teeth or taste nasty like some of the other types. As long as you put them on before brushing your teeth and don&#x27;t eat or brush 30 minutes after you&#x27;ve taken them off, it works perfectly. I bleach my top teeth but not my bottom, and you can tell a big difference because my tops are very white and bottoms are yellowish. I get compliments all the time on how white my teeth are! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Extremely underwhelmed by 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects. I only have slight yellow staining, and after using 17 of the 20 strips included, I can categorically say that this product will not turn mildly stained teeth white. It will make your teeth less yellow, but even then - from my perspective - the difference in shade was scarcely evident after almost a full course. What makes the whole thing even more disappointing is that the results you get stand in stark contrast to the ridiculous claims on the front of the box. Whitens as well as $500 treatments? Not a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; design of the strips: I&#x27;m not sure what Crest&#x27;s definition of \\&quot;Advanced\\&quot; is, but we disagree. These things were very, very irritating. Firstly, the moment the strips come into contact with your teeth, they cannot be moved unless you yank them off. This means that if you apply them incorrectly, you can&#x27;t slide them along and readjust like you can with other Crest whitestrips. That&#x27;s problematic if the strip isn&#x27;t touching some of your teeth. Secondly, for whatever reason, I personally had an unusual amount of saliva and air build up between my teeth and the strips. I haven&#x27;t experienced that with any other type of whitening strip, and while I don&#x27;t know whether or not it reduced their efficacy, it meant that I was constantly fiddling around trying to flatten out air bubbles. Just awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, do not buy this product. Instead, pay a little bit extra for Crest Supreme Professional Whitening. I&#x27;m half way through a batch of these right now and the results are significantly more noticeable. Why is that? Well, for one thing, they contain 14% hydrogen peroxide bleaching gel (4% more than 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects). Secondly, you will be applying the upper and lower strips twice a day, as opposed to once a day. This will always result in BETTER, FASTER results. Thirdly, the design of the strips is significantly better. They hold tight to your teeth, but barely any air bubbles form, and you can readjust them if necessary. Fourthly, you get 84 strips in total, as opposed to the measly 40 strips you get in Professional Effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, as someone who has used both products, I can guarantee more impressive results with Crest Supreme Professional Whitening. Always opt for them instead.our teeth, but barely any air bubbles form, and you can readjust them if necessary.

    <li> The instructions say you can wear the strips for up to two hours. I would not recommend this. After an hour my teeth are sensitive to breathing lol. Stick to wearing them for 30 minutes every other day. Otherwise, my teeth look fantastic! No one who doesn&#x27;t already know me thinks that I smoke or drink red wine on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This product works great for me. The only negative thing I have to say is that it makes my teeth extremely sensitive.</li>
    <li> They do work but it varies from person to person. 100% money back through crest if you don&#x27;t like the results, but you&#x27;ll notice the difference. Recommendation is two packs back to back.</li>
    <li> I think these were counterfeit or had a manufacturing defect. Adhesive stuck to the teeth but their wasn&#x27;t any whitening agent on the strips. I&#x27;ve used the product before so know how they should work. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I&#x27;m only on day 2 and I can already see significant results.  Also, the adhesive that these strips come with is STRONG.  I&#x27;ve used the lowest tier crest white strips before and usually before the 30 minutes is up the strips become lose because of saliva build up.  NOT THESE BABIES.  It&#x27;s like super-glue.  I&#x27;ve left them on for 40 minutes by accident and it actually hurt peeling them off but I&#x27;d rather have it that way than loose strips flopping around in my mouth.  Great whitening and I&#x27;m only on day 2.  Great adhesive.  Will be my go to whitening kit.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and thanks to the nicest people of amazon resolving customer problems!! :)</li>
    <li> I noticed a huge difference in my teeth after the first use, which I was not expecting. I used a different brand of white strips about 5 years ago and have not used any since then due to extreme pain after using them. I experience no pain or sensitivity at all with these Crest Whitestrips! I am very pleased with the product, price, and shipping.</li>
    <li> I had tried a whitening tray from a dentist&#x27;s office, but having to clean out the tray was really gross to me. I tried the lowest level of the Crest 3D White strips, and they didn&#x27;t really do anything. About halfway through the box of Professional Effects, I could tell that my teeth were whiter. The strips really do stick on hard though, which is good, but my only complaint is that they were kind of hard to get off. But at least they don&#x27;t move around while you are using them. I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity to them, but I did to the dentist&#x27;s whitening. I will definitely buy these again,</li>
    <li> I used it for four days and my teeth got slightly whiter. Only slightly though and only noticeable by me because I observed how much change there was. However, after using for a couple days, I had to start using it every other day because it caused my teeth to hurt a lot. Then I had to stop completely because the pain was unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth but these caused my teeth to become really sensitive. The pain goes away after stop of use for a couple days though.</li>
    <li> These strips work great. They really helped to brighten up my teeth. For some reason my top row of teeth was whiter then my bottom row, which is a little weird since I was able to wrap the strip around the bottom of my teeth all the way, so the chemical could work from both sides, but from the front they just barely wrapped around the bottom of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use some desensitizing toothpaste for about a week or two before you start using these strips to prevent or lessen the discomfort you will get from tooth sensitivity until you finish up all the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whiteness does wear off between 6 months to about a year or two, depending on how well you maintain your teeth brushing schedule. This is my second time using them, and they work like a charm as usual.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product.They are very simple to apply,actually WORK and have a noticable whitening effect straight away....definantly an excellent purchase and much cheaper than professional treatments that can harm teeth.I would recommend this product to anyone who wants fast,white teeth without any effort!</li>
    <li> Great product, have been seeing some results, nothing life changing but all in due time.</li>
    <li> My teeth have gradually grown stained from drinking coffee and not flossing as much as I should over the years so I decided to try Crest Whitestrips (not wanting to hassle with more extensive / professional treatment options). I used the strips and the accompanying whitening toothpaste for about two weeks, using the strips every other day. I noticed a difference after the first 5 times of use, and before the box was up my teeth were movie-star white. I received a number of compliments on them and firmly believe in the product. They work quickly and effectively, and I now use them for maintenance every once in awhile to make sure my teeth stay white. Very easy to use, I did not experience any pain beyond some teeth sensitivity every once in awhile. If you want an easy way to whiten your teeth that fits your schedule, these are perfect!</li>
    <li> Ordered these because I was tired of my red lipstick making my teeth look slightly yellowed -- and let&#x27;s face it: I drink a ton of coffee and tea....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend mentioned that she used whitening strips and shared her method: Alternate the days that you use the strips and once you get to a shade you like, maintain by using 1-2 strips a month to &#x27;freshen&#x27; your smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And. it. works. After just 2 strips I noticed a difference and after 6, I was happy with the results. Alternating days is a must because there will be some sensitivity and skipping a day really does reduce that. This product will be a staple in my routine -- try it!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to weigh in because I&#x27;ve attempted to use some other whitening products to no avail.  The whitening toothpaste didn&#x27;t really do anything.  The whitening gum was a joke.  The whitening mouthwash (Crest) probably would have worked, but made my teeth super-sensitive after just a couple days. This product however, works as advertised.  My teeth were stained from coffee drinking.  With a regimen of two of these kits and cutting back on coffee, my teeth are now pleasantly white. They hit the sweet spot for me because they did not cause sensitivity, IF I used them as directed.  If I left them on one minutes past the 30 minute duration, my teeth got sensitive.  I really had to watch the clock.  With all that said, I&#x27;m going to be a regular user (1 regimen every 6 months) now.  These things just work, and they can be easily incorporated into your daily routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my teeth whitened with an in-office procedure before, and this did every bit as well, for a whole lot cheaper! My teeth are not brilliantly white now, but when I see my smile in the mirror it makes me smile even more :D I plan to get another set to see if they will get even whiter.</li>
    <li> I have a couple bad habits that over the years have done their damage on the coloring of my teeth. After feeling a little self conscious for awhile I decided to try these. I&#x27;ve tried Crest Whitestrips in the past without noticing any difference so I was hesitant at first (especially after seeing the price tag!). However, I decided to give it one more shot. These are absolutely amazing! Within the first 3 days I noticed brighter, whiter teeth! One of the issues I&#x27;ve had with whitening strips in the past is actually keeping them in place. Not sure about everyone else but anytime I put one of them on, my mouth went into saliva production overload causing them to shift or just leave a very disgusting taste. These strips are nothing like that. The Advanced Seal works wonders, they really stick to your teeth! If you&#x27;ve been looking for a whitening strip definitely check these out. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love these whitestrips.  They work very well.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and just as described. Easy to use and apply. They stay on and I was able to have business phone calls and drink with a straw without anyone even knowing. They are practically invisible, so I was able to be out in the store shopping if I needed to be. The problem was that these Crest 3D White LUXE strips didn&#x27;t have much effect on the color of my teeth, even though I wore them for at least an hour each time! I tried the entire bos, but just didn&#x27;t see much, if any difference in the whiteness of my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Luckily CREST has a 100%  satisfaction guarantee, so I called to have the purchase refunded by CREST. I am confident Amazon would have done honored the purchase as well, but the fault was in the manufacturer; CREST. Not with AMAZON, who always provides excellent shipping and prompty easy ordering and delivery. The recording at the CREST Customer SERVICE says that many times more than ONE box is needed to get the desired whiteness result. I would have done that, if I had seen any result. Will try another Crest 3D that might have stronger ingredients.</li>
    <li> My teeth are definitely a shade lighter. I used it every 12 hours for 10 days straight. The downside is while using it, my 2 front teeth became sensitive. Then they returned to normal after the 19 days were up. I am pleased with the results. When you put them on, be careful to put them on once because if you mess up, it is not easy to reapply the strips.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of the claims of whitening your teeth at home. I have to say, Crest 3D White Luxe Whitestripe exceed my expectations. With a few days and to my amazement my teeth were getting whiter. I used the whole box as directed and kept the strips on for the full 1/2 hour.</li>
    <li> Happy with this order. I use these strips every day, and have noticed the results within one hour. Great product for a cheaper price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and she really saw the difference before/after using this product.  And she was happy with the price tag vs. paying $$$ for dentist whitening services.  The only thing is that she felt that bottom strip could&#x27;ve been as big as the top one, that way  whitening would be more even top/bottom.  Overall it was a great product...now she really got pearly whites!!</li>
    <li> Good price. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love these whitening strips! Easy to use and great results after one use. A few shades lighter! My teeth were a little sensitive the day of whitening but back to normal the next day. It was worth it. Maybe brush with a sensitive toothpaste and it would be no problem.</li>
    <li> I convinced my hubby to use these &amp; you can see a very noticeable difference. His teeth look sooooo much whiter. I used it too, but i drink coffee every morning so mine aren&#x27;t as bright white but they are noticeably whiter. We love how we only have to keep the strips on for half hour to see results.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and as described.</li>
    <li> My teeth do hurt every time I apply this strip and they do go whiter.</li>
    <li> I never have a lot of sensitivity when using crest white strips, but these are a different story. I used about half the box before I decided to take a break for a few weeks before finishing the treatment so my teeth aren&#x27;t too affected. I definitely have whiter teeth though!</li>
    <li> I rather use the 1 hour one. we can see the results much faster than this one, but its still a good product!</li>
    <li> These whitening strips are the best ones that I have used in the past few years by far.  The cling to the teeth, don&#x27;t slide off and provide a beautiful white smile top and lower teeth.  The only downside is removing them.  due to the fact that they stick very well to the teeth, you may need a little help removing them ( occasionally I have to grab the corner with a pair of tweezers and gently pull them off). I have no complaints at all with this product and have been very pleased with the outcome each and every time.  My fianc&amp;eacute; even uses them (and he is a true hunter, camper, hardworking guy.  Surprised me,and he doesn&#x27;t even complain about their removal.</li>
    <li> Great teeth whitening. Easy to apply &amp; easy to wear.</li>
    <li> Has anyone notice how weird it tastes? Tastes so bad that makes me not want to wait until 30min!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about half of them so far. I can see a difference already. I do not like the tooth sensitivity though.</li>
    <li> worked great and very easy to apply</li>
    <li> Easy to use on my morning drive.</li>
    <li> They worked great and made my teeth really white. The only problem i had was that they made my teeth really sensitive after using them for a while</li>
    <li> This product works! It leaves my teeth white. I don&#x27;t know what is inside it but sometime my teeth hurt. I don&#x27;t really care because now they&#x27;re shining!</li>
    <li> They work well ... not like the pictures or commercials show but they help. They do make you teeth feel weird though when using.</li>
    <li> The strips are definitely not for people with highly sensitive teeth, but they work extremely well. I used them every other day to keep my teeth from hurting, and they still did a great job at getting my teeth noticeably whiter. Also, there&#x27;s great deals in add-on items for the white strips, so definitely take the time to check them out before completing your purchase. I got the Crest 3d White toothpaste with the strips, and it works with them to make your teeth whiter even faster. Alright, I sound like an infomercial so I&#x27;m gonna get outta this review but yeah, totally worth the price. Bye.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, so when I do, I mean it!  This stuff works great! I have only done one strip so far, and it works very, very well.  No discomfort whatsoever.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 7 or 10 days.  The first time is a bit strange to put on the teeth, but you&#x27;ll get use to it. Good luck</li>
    <li> I was in doubt when I decided to purchase this product.  However, after 3 treatments (the package comes with 10), there is a noticeable difference.  Not bright white as stated, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.  It is hard to pull off after it has been on for 30 minutes.  And it does irritate my tongue.  But overall I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My teeth become so sensitive and i did not get any result&lt;br /&gt;Sooo sad and i have to deal with senstive teeth right now</li>
    <li> I had previously used this product about two years ago and it worked great. Last week I ordered it again to find the product was improved in that the adhesive used now is so much stronger. It sticks to your teeth and wont come off like it used to just by talking or breathing heavily. Great improvement.</li>
    <li> This product had no effect on my teeth whatsoever. I will try to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Yes my teeth are whiter but this product is not advertised well. It does not get your teeth that white. Your teeth will stop being yellow but no one will say, &amp;#34;Wow! You&#x27;re teeth are so white.&amp;#34; People who advertise this get such results from buying this kit more than once.</li>
    <li> My teeth became whiter!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am only using this as a touch up kit and will only use 3-7 days at a time.  It works a LOT faster than regular strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use more than once a day and maybe even skip a day or two every few days because I made the mistake of using 3 times in one day and my teeth were killing me.  Regular strips you can use 2-3 times a day and you sort of have to so you can get things going but trust me these work real fast.</li>
    <li> Irritated gums. No brighter teeth. Pricy. Increased sensitivity.</li>
    <li> First time to order them online. When I opened these up they were dry, very disappointing , I love them from the store .</li>
    <li> These 3D White Whitestrips are the bomb! I had lost hope on whitestripes, but they worked really good! It would have been better if they didn&#x27;t irritate my teeth afterwards. But, I would still recommend them.</li>
    <li> I choose this particular brand and selection because it was a &amp;#34;best seller&amp;#34; and is such, I&#x27;m happy to say,&lt;br /&gt;for good reason. The strips are easy to use and do the job. I&#x27;m delighted with the result on my 70+&lt;br /&gt;year-old teeth.</li>
    <li> after about five minutes they started hurting my teeth I guess my teeth are too sensitive for this product</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying these.  My family notice how nice my teeth look after I used them. Plus they are easy to apply.  I find this a good price and will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Results are good but does cause some sensitivity! Just need to use every other day instead of daily to lessen the sensitivity. But, its worth the white teeth.</li>
    <li> Worked great for me. 55 year old male, occasional coffee and soft drinker. I will most definitely be reordering. Give it a full week of use but before you start, use something to compare the current shade of your teeth. I tried using my iphone but the picture doesn&#x27;t really show the difference. My dentist recommended this over his own $200 treatment. He said it is about the best he&#x27;s seen for home use and will get the same results in just a little more time.</li>
    <li> After using the strips I immediately want to go out &amp; say Hi to&lt;br /&gt;Friends. ( See my gleaming, clean and white teeth)</li>
    <li> Not too harsh on gums...I could easily use these three to four days in a row without too much sensitivity. And I&#x27;m already seeing results with not even half the package gone!</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, but I&#x27;m convinced! The first time I used them, the difference was significant. The second and third strips, done on consecutive days, turned my teeth from yellow to almost white. Much much better than those cheap whitening toothpaste. Much easier to use than those expensive plastic tube things you have to boil to get into the right shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is a little expensive. For a cheaper option, I tried the following paste gel for whitening and it works wonders too. Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RH1TRE/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000RH1TRE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;hocivfd-20</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it works, but it made my teeth (especially the inner/back surface) a bit too sensitive for my liking, so I stopped using it after 3-4 treatments.</li>
    <li> best product i&#x27;ve ever used to teeth whitening i used it for two days and the resealt start show thank you</li>
    <li> Product is great, and the transaction was smooth.  Will definitely purchase this item again in the future.  I am very happy with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with the discoloration of my teeth, and I decided to try these out because I read good/great reviews on this whitening product. I noticed a difference in my teeth after the 7th or 8th treatment. I did not feel any pain and discomfort. I was worried about that initially after reading other reviews, and fortunately that was not an issue. They really work!!! :)</li>
    <li> Prefer the 2 Hour strips.  They offer faster whitening.  These do stick to your teeth and don&#x27;t slide like the original strips did.</li>
    <li> I am not a coffee drinker, nor do I do anything that really stains my teeth. So, my teeth were decently clean before using this product, I was just going for the extra shine. These strips did make my teeth a shade or two whiter, which I like. However, for the price, I would say I was hoping for a more noticeable change. They did work, but not sure if they worked enough.</li>
    <li> Great price, cheaper than in a drug store.  Work great.  I&#x27;ll buy them again in six months when I want to whiten my teeth again.</li>
    <li> I quit smoking and still drink a lot of coffee. These removed all of the stains. Even the dentist complimented them.</li>
    <li> I have used other whitening trays and strips, but this one makes my teeth really sensitive, so i was only able to wear them 2 nights in a row.</li>
    <li> Great strips for a great price! I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how white and bright my teeth are. I will always get them here!</li>
    <li> Actually worked quite well as people noticed my whiter teeth</li>
    <li> They suck!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> After three or four treatments I noticed a big difference. My teeth are a little sensitive but it&#x27;s tolerable. I guess that&#x27;s the price we pay to look beautiful.</li>
    <li> More than half packet done, not much effect noticed yet :(</li>
    <li> product was as expected and on time. I had never tried this type of white strip before and I must say it is my favorite. Normally the strips make my teeth hurt, but these ones are awesome and they really stick to your teeth and don&#x27;t get all foamy. Love them!!</li>
    <li> its awesome , u can see the results after 2 treatments .</li>
    <li> very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all and I saw a dramatic difference after just using two strips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used half a box (all I plan on using....don&#x27;t want &#x27;Ross&#x27;-white teeth), and it whitened them up fine.  Can NOT believe how well these stick to your teeth!  I&#x27;d used the old style years ago that slide all around - these stay put!  You really have to pull to get them off your teeth when the 1/2 hour is up.</li>
    <li> BUY IT! haha well-it depends who you are.&lt;br /&gt;I always get complimented on my smile, I have very naturally straight teeth and I always make sure my teeth stay looking white by using this product. Its AMAZING. It whitens really fast and its really easy to use. Whenever I use them I put them on and it only takes a few seconds, and while the time goes by I do my hair or makeup and then remove my strips.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried those gel whiteners before but they&#x27;re gross and messy and you can&#x27;t drink anything if you get thirsty and i always end up slobbering all over the place haha. SO i really like the white strips, theres no gross taste, its clean, its easy to use, and your allowed to swallow or drink water with these on. I know some peoples teeth become sensitive to this but personally, my teeth felt fine.&lt;br /&gt;I know these can be a little pricey-but they really are worth the try, and if your worried about sensitivity, you should try and buy a smaller pack and test them out because I am not kidding-these really are worth the try!&lt;br /&gt;My mother asked her dentist about having her teeth whitened, but even he recommended that she use the Crest white strips over the dental whitening procedure. These white strips are worth the money.</li>
    <li> The simple truth is that these work. They are great products, and while they don&#x27;t work miracles, they whiten moderately stained teeth very well. I have used them every 2-4 years for a while now, and keep any extra in case I have an event that I want to spruce up my smile for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips before and I was pleased with the results. I decided to try the new Luxe line. I just received them and have only used them twice. They do not sting my gums and they hold well. Here&#x27;s hoping for a whiter, brighter smile :)</li>
    <li> Used these once about a year ago. They do leave super bright results. Some may complain of tooth sensitivity, but it states on the box that this it is only a mild, temporary side effect, and it is. Very convenient because you only have to brighten about once a year or once every 8 months but leaves bright results every time.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> These strips got rid of some pretty old coffee stains on my teeth. Easy to apply and only need to leave them on for 30 minutes, Give them a shot!</li>
    <li> Made mine teeth sensitive for a long time. I will never buy this product again. Crest Stripes cause very sensitive teeth DONT BUY</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well these things actually worked. Will do again for sure.</li>
    <li> Work great! Especially if you use with the toothpaste. Value was good and I would recommend them to anyone, especially if you are a coffee drinker. I have tried lots of other whitening brands with no success. This one gave me amazing results.</li>
    <li> Ordered my Whitestrips after switching up my brushing routine to two-times daily in the hopes of whitening my teeth further. After a few months of doing this with minimal results I felt I might need to try some at home whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was most impressed by with this product is the speed of the results. After my first 30min treatment I noticed that parts of all the teeth applied to had received an extreme bright white luster. After a few days of use, most parts of the teeth applied to had gotten noticeably whiter. 10 days in the entirety of the teeth applied to had gotten whiter. By the end of the regimen my smile had gotten extremely white and I was very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitivity every body speaks of... very unpleasant. Yes. I notice nothing while treatment is being applied. I notice nothing for several hours, not affected by heat, or cold, or volatile foods of any kind. But sooner or later during the day, the tips of my front teeth get VERY sensitive and ache quite bad. Goes away after an hour or two and is completely fine in the morning when I wake up. Not a good thing, but entirely manageable in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the strips is an adventure to line them up inside the mouth with the lip in the way. For a minute after applied it takes some tinkering to get everything sealed and 10 to 20 minutes in the edges can come a little loose but all together a hassle free experience. Very good results, a few very minor issues can be had, but for the results the price and these issues aren&#x27;t all together that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, does exactly what it says it will. Dramatic results within a week. Easy to use, stays in place &amp; very convenient.</li>
    <li> Very much it was pleasant to me. The bleaching system came to time. I and further wanted to work with you.</li>
    <li> This order was received quickly.  The price was great, best I found anywhere.  It was a gift for my daughter and she was thrilled with the result.</li>
    <li> I wanted whiter results... it did work. they are super comfortable. I can live my life with them on.  but the results are maybe like 2 shades of a difference.  It worked. but I wish it worked better. And my teeth weren&#x27;t that yellow to begin with</li>
    <li> Like the rating of 3 stars say&#x27;s its OK, but don&#x27;t think this is like going to a Dentist. I hate paying the high prices that Dentists charge so tried these. They work OK, but not sure they last as long or whiten to the same level as a real professional job. They were easy to use and no irritation.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but these do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 15 days into the 20 days of strips.  I use them as directed (30 minutes a day, once a day).  I took a 4-day break after a week because I was on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:  Teeth are far whiter and I still have nearly a week to go.  I had very minimal sensitivity, but no pain.  The sensitivity wears away by the end of the day, and does not linger.  My teeth had yellowed due to excessive coffee drinking, and this is bringing them back to how white they were about 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> This is the first day using the whitening strips and when they say \\&quot;beauty is pain\\&quot;.. That TOTALLY applies to this. This is one of the most painful things ever. After wearing the strips for 2 hours I felt sharp pains in my tooth for the rest of the night. Pain so bad that my nose bled. But the product did work very well. My teeth are already a shade whiter (note, this is the FIRST day of use). I&#x27;m a soldier so I will continue to use the strips until either I die from the pain or I finish the box. Im not wasting 40 something dollars. BEWARE: THE PAIN.</li>
    <li> we all have much whiter teeth now.  I got 4 kits for Christmas for my 3 kids and myself, and just after the first time we used them, we all had whiter teeth.  My kids are thrilled.</li>
    <li> Does adhere to teeth better than other versions.</li>
    <li> Ok, so my teeth aren&#x27;t THAT blindingly white, but these did make a noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve used Crest&#x27;s whitening strips years ago with limited success and the slipping of the strips was always a pain to deal with. These worked like a champ though and stayed in place. I actually had to remove them from the underside of my teeth first because these REALLY stick on. Of course I still notice some yellowing near my gum line, but I&#x27;m happy with the results and will probably give these another go in 6 months. Take my advice - take a couple steps back from the mirror when you&#x27;re trying to tell if your teeth are any whiter, or better yet, compare the teeth the strips touched to those teeth further back that the strips didn&#x27;t reach - huge difference.</li>
    <li> good it is works&lt;br /&gt;but some stickers is not perfect packed</li>
    <li> Great price.  Product exceeds claims.</li>
    <li> Almost done with the package and I love it!! You can definitely see a difference after a week or two.</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect, but as the package stated, within 3 days you will see whiter teeth and you do. Using a mirror to put them on makes it much easier and more accurate placement. Keep in mind that you need to have both the teeth and some of the gums covered so that it will work on the entire tooth surface. I plan to purchase again in year to keep my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;The taste takes a little getting used to (wish they could add a little mint flavor os something, but it does nit take long to get used to.</li>
    <li> Work well. Bottom piece has trouble sticking  sometimes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. Leaving them on for more than 30 mins caused severe sensitivity.</li>
    <li> very professional effects</li>
    <li> These worked like a charm! I would buy another round too! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Whitening is instant after using it 5 days continuously.</li>
    <li> Using the trays seems to work faster and is cheaper, but these definitely worked and are more comfortable</li>
    <li> I do see some improvement after six applications.  Hoping to see more as I continue the process.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for something that will definitely clean your teeth I recommend this. The deep cleansing polish is better than any toothpaste I have ever used and my teeth feel clean like I just left the dentist. As far as whitening goes this is okay. I followed the instructions used the system twice a day and did it lighten my teeth yes slightly but not the professional results I was hoping for. I am a heavy coffee and tea drinker so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help. I probably had my teeth lighten maybe one or two shades.</li>
    <li> These WORK! After 1 week of using these, there is a dramatic difference. I actually can&#x27;t remember my teeth ever being this white. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the visual effects it has on my teeth. Only thing is, the sensitivity. It&#x27;s not too bad and they do tell you that your teeth may be sensitive. If you know your teeth are sensitive, get the Crest Whitestrips that are specifically for sensitive teeth! They have em. Overall, I love this product and the sensitivity only lasts for a few hours so it&#x27;s 100% worth it for me :)</li>
    <li> I recently have my teeth clean professionally and want to keep them looking fresh.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Does literally nothing.</li>
    <li> This product in comparison with smile sciences works better. Smile sciences does whiten my teeth but it feels temporary. However 3D white crest whitening strips leaves my teeth as white as a pearl as long as I keep up with the routine. I see a difference after about 2-3 uses.</li>
    <li> I used these on my top teeth only to see if they made any significant difference. I did notice a change in whiteness, but only a little, Will look for a different product next time.</li>
    <li> Let me just start out by saying my teeth WERE NOT BAD to begin with, so I definitely had high expectations since I didn&#x27;t have that much damage to reverse. I started out with teeth that definitely were not yellow, but also were not white. They were more of a faded white. I wanted to use these strips to whiten them a few shades to make my smile more noticeable . (Also i have been using the Crest 3D glamorous white toothpaste) I have noticed slightly more white teeth over the last few weeks, but not nearly as much as I had hoped. I was expecting at least a noticeable difference , but I wouldn&#x27;t say these gave me any \\&quot;professional\\&quot; whitening that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Great seller good quality</li>
    <li> Causes tooth sensitivity after one use.  You will need a desensitizer, but it works.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a product. I don&#x27;t know what the other people are complaining about, I had no gum irritation at all, they stayed in place easily and are comfortable and they whitened my teeth by several shades in only 8 applications. I am a coffee drinker and that is the source of my stains and I have a tooth implant in the front so I need to keep my natural teeth a similar shade as the implant. These strips are fast acting and effective and with no discomfort at all I was able to bring my natural teeth to the same shade as my implant and now i have the remaining strips for occasional maintenance whitening. Great product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It works while you&#x27;re using it, but doesn&#x27;t last long after. Eh, not bad for the price. I saw a difference for sure. Good for specific events if you time it right, which is what I used it for. Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Did not work. No visible improvement. I have regular yellow teeth and after using these whitening strips everyday for an hour each day, no noticed no improvements.</li>
    <li> I only had these strips on my teeth for a few minutes when I started having pains. It was intolerable and I had to remove the strip.</li>
    <li> I actually started seeing a change within 2-3 days. They work GREAT!</li>
    <li> Let me just preface:  My retainer makes me gag, mouth guards make me gag, and any whitestrip will make me gag.  So in spite of the gag reflex, these strips do a pretty good job.  Be careful, though...your teeth will become sensitive after using.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective! Quick turnaround.</li>
    <li> Love these, they work really good. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Took about 3 weeks to arrive.  Very annoying!  But they work great!  Took off 2 stars for the aggravation.</li>
    <li> I used these everytime before I have a big event to go to.  These work and noticeably right away.  Just be careful not to leave it longer than its intended to, otherwise you might feel numbing or slight pain.</li>
    <li> Good product I think if you don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth. I didn&#x27;t think my teeth even were that sensitive, but I can only use these two days a week since my teeth will hurt too much.</li>
    <li> What happened to the original strips? They worked. These are impossible to peel off the foil without twisting them up. Yet they are also impossible to place correctly on the teeth. Finally did it, placed them. They stuck well. Did NOTHING.</li>
    <li> Good price, use them once or twice a year, which my dentist says is fine for me.</li>
    <li> Difinitly worth it. Saw big difference</li>
    <li> These strips don&#x27;t whiten much for me, so it was not even worth the pain or money. My teeth are not even sensitive but these cause sooo much pain, I literally couldn&#x27;t sleep at night. I bought a gel at the drugstore to relieve it but that didn&#x27;t even help. It not only hurts your teeth, but also your gums. I noticed that mine were inflamed in some areas, which obviously hurt. The first day, I freaked out because it completely bleached part of my gums. It was totally white where its supposed to be pink, and it didn&#x27;t get better for two days. I really recommend using alternative whitening methods.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really love the results I get. It does make my teeth sensitive if I use it 2 days in a row</li>
    <li> These did a great job and it was a first time for me to buy them.  After 30 years of coffee and cigarettes, they made an incredible difference.  I was very impressed.</li>
    <li> Not as easy to talk with them as the commercials show. Hard to get off after.</li>
    <li> I used Crest Whitestrips (and only Crest Whitestrips) 2 or 3 years ago and still receive compliments about how white my teeth are. I never drink coffee, but I do drink chai about 3-5 times a week, so I have been pretty impressed with how well the Whitestrips worked originally and how long the effects lasted. They do cause some sensitivity, and very rarely sting while they are on, but the discomfort is temporary. (It&#x27;s probably worth noting that I had braces for 4 years so I have become pretty patient with tooth discomfort and am able to overlook it when I know that the long term results will be worth it.)</li>
    <li> bottom strips will not stay on...........a waste of your money</li>
    <li> Made my teeth a little whiter, but not much.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter and more sensitive. That is just the way of the white strips.</li>
    <li> These work great.  I recommend these for people that don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money or time to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the change,just feel disappointed with this product!waste my money!!!!I ll never buy it again!And I won&#x27;t recommend it tO my friends!</li>
    <li> My favorite white strips</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to pay such a price for ANY teeth whitening products, let alone the Whitening strips, but I am so glad I did!  My teeth were not very white, as a matter of fact, even after brushing them, they seemed better, but due to the coffee, tea and wine I drink, it took havoc on my teeth, as far as being white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are very self explanatory.  Just 30 minutes a day, or ever other day if you become sensitive to the product, will give you whiter and brighter teeth in a few days.  I noticed my teeth were whiter by the 3rd day and I kept using them, hoping to see even whiter results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very very pleased and happy that I took the time to purchase these Crest 3D White Luxe Whitestrips as my teeth have never looked better!  It beats paying a higher expense to the dentists, when you get close to or the same results at home.</li>
    <li> Awful! The strips don&#x27;t adhere to your teeth and they come out. They are too thin</li>
    <li> This is the best whitening we,ve found!</li>
    <li> Teeth are white they did a great job</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time, but was not in the Original Crest packaging... I guess that was just to make the shipping easier, but I don&#x27;t like to receive things outside of there original packaging! Anyways, I tried them two days in a row and yes I could see some improvement to the whiteness of my teeth. However, the third day in a row I tried them I applied the produce to my teeth and left it for half an hour as directed and then about two hours after my teeth started hurting and acing like the feeling you get when you have something hot then something really cold and then you get that sharp pain in your teeth! This lasted the rest of the night and partially into the next day! So I figured maybe that I had just used them too many time in a row, so I took a couple days off and tried it again and the same thing happened again!! I threw the rest out!! I&#x27;d rather have yellowish teeth then to be in pain or worse! I have no idea what this stuff is doing to my teeth but I don&#x27;t want to find out the long term affects! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone! Horrible stuff!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product hopeing to whiten my teeth a few shades, and being I never used white strips before I didn&#x27;t know if they actually worked or not. My teeth after using all the strips are whiter than they have been in previous years! they are pretty easy to use for the most part only thing is when you first use them you might notice a you build up a lot of salvia in you&#x27;re mouth I read that this is normal if not used to these and does no harm if sallowing the gel.</li>
    <li> This item is good and very clean indeed. Only thing is that it wasn&#x27;t the one that showed in the picture, I got a purple one but it was 3D strips. I honestly see change I recommend. Only thing is that people... It hurts ur teeth if u use it at night. In the morning your teeth and guns hurt. Use it during day like 6-8 no later becuase when u take it off and you sleep, in the morning it will hurt. So I do it between thoes and do it 30 min. There&#x27;s other times u can but I don&#x27;t go past 30min. It&#x27;s good .</li>
    <li> do not slide all over the lace like the old ones. those used to make me feel like i was eating peroxide.</li>
    <li> it is always good, only one was stuck to the plastic and the plastic broke off in exactly the same size as the whitening strip...one wasted</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  As a dental hygienist I have been using whitening products for over 20 years.  This is BY FAR my favorite whitening system!!!  They are super easy to use and do an excellent job. I recommend this product all the time to my patients.  I tell everyone the main criteria I have for choosing which whitestrip to use is that it MUST have the \\&quot;advanced seal technology\\&quot;.  It makes a HUGE difference in the comfort of the strip (they don&#x27;t move around on your teeth where you end up practically eating them!)  The fact that they stay where you place them also allows them to give a better, quicker end result.  If you haven&#x27;t tried them yet, you don&#x27;t know how white your teeth can be!!!</li>
    <li> The other reviewers are right on the money. These strips are great, they are easy to use and work really good I drink coffee and these really help to make my teeth white.</li>
    <li> I have used these before.  I have to say, I remembered better whitening results in the past, but, I was not drinking coffee then either.  So, I attribute the less whitening to that, not any problem with the product.  The best thing about these ones compared to the originals is the Advance Seal which is that the strips cling to teeth extremely well.  In fact, they don&#x27;t move around at all for me, they are even hard to take off which is a good trade off for them slipping around while in.  The reason I gave a four is that I would like more improvement in there whitening ability.  Next time I may buy the fives in terms of whitening effect, but I couldn&#x27;t find them on Amazon or they were substantially more in cost.</li>
    <li> Even though these are more expensive than their older version, they&#x27;re worth it. Not messy, stay on teeth so you don&#x27;t have to taste the whitening chemicals, works right away even after 1 application.</li>
    <li> I tried these this past summer and followed all of the directions, but they didn&#x27;t really work. I was very disappointed as I just wasted money on this product. In fact, I feel as though my teeth have more yellow since. You can try these if you want, but be aware that they may not work.</li>
    <li> This is a very simple and easy to use product.&lt;br /&gt;Once apply, I can do my housework and watch tv at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Once the timer is up, just remove the strip and rinse my mouth, that&#x27;s all1&lt;br /&gt;Another good product from crest :)</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  I could see results on the third day.  I will, definitely, buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I use this 2-3 times per year to whiten and it does not cause me any sensitivity issues.  It also works very well and my teeth look fabulous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for years, and they work great.  I drink a lot of coffee, and using these strips keeps my teeth white.  My teeth do get pretty sensitive when they use them, so I usually switch to an anti-sensitivity toothpaste about a week before I start whitening, and that helps quite a bit.  I also don&#x27;t do the whole treatment at once.  I use half and then do the other half about 6 months later.  It helps with the sensitivity, and also prevents big fluctuations in the color of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Wow- Crest has REALLY stepped up their game with their Whitestrips adhesive. I usually use the 5 Minute Touch Up strips, but twice a year I do a re-whitening and this time around I was shocked at how STICKY the 3D strips are. They are like duct-tape for your teeth- once you adhere them, they are STUCK. And they won&#x27;t shift or move after you adhere them (unlike the 5 Minute strips, which pretty much sit in the *vicinity* of your teeth while they are on and literally fall out of your mouth if you aren&#x27;t still.) This is good because it&#x27;s easy to keep them on for 30 minutes without having to be careful about not sucking the strips off your teeth, but it&#x27;s kind of a pain because you can&#x27;t adjust the strip once it&#x27;s on your teeth. So apply carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as whitening, I have to be honest- they didn&#x27;t get my teeth as bright at the last time I did the Professional Effects two hour strips, but clearly the two are different products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as tooth sensitivity- I gotta be honest, my teeth hurt a bit after my first use of these. The night after I used these for the first time, I was starting to worry I might need a root canal in one of my teeth until I remembered I was using the Whitestrips (total relief!) After that first application, there wasn&#x27;t much of an issue with sensitivity- a tiny bit as far as hot/cold, but nothing excruciating. However, I have gotten tiny cavities drilled without novocaine before (the shots hurt more than the drilling for me!) so your mileage may vary on the pain factor. Just be aware you might feel some sensitivity after you use them but it does let up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, good product.</li>
    <li> I like them but I dont at the same time. I havent felt any sensitivity or pain. However I also havent noticed that much of a difference. I have white spots on my teeth where the strips are only whitening certain points (maybe because some were whiter than others though). The top of my teeth is wear the yellow is accumulated. And I never received the 1 hour strips mentioned by other reviewers. Mine were also luxe strips not advanced seal. The seller specifies in the title that packaging may vary but its not the same product so thats completely different. Love crest products though! Overall I like them but just know everyones getting something different.</li>
    <li> This product works and I rely on it to help me keep a nice smile. Years ago, I paid twice for professional whitening treatments. I consider this product a bargain.</li>
    <li> Love them!  Easy to use, no problems with sensitivity, my teeth look great!  I&#x27;ve been using Crest strips for years.  Still the best.</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well. It did whiten my teeth. Not drastic differance but definitly noticable. I used it everyday for a week then on the second week only used it twice. It did make my teeth a little sensitive, but nothing to terrible. I am now using the strips once a month as maintnance. Overall I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Saw results in as little as 3 days...wud purchase again.</li>
    <li> Worked great and good for maintaining white teeth.</li>
    <li> The BEST teeth whiteners I have used yet!  Dentist assistant asked what I used!  No problems with my crowns either.</li>
    <li> My total experience with the crest 3-D white strips has been impeccable. They were promptly delivered, and all whitening strips were present. I even counted to doublecheck, it just seemed too good to be true.  Not only was she timely, she was also cheap. I&#x27;ve never seen whitening strips so cheap and my life. And buy cheap I mean affordable as in a quality steak dinner at a price it doesn&#x27;t break the bank. And it&#x27;s a classy steak dinner not a cheap one from a chain restaurant. And don&#x27;t hold back on the red wine at this fancy steak restaurant, Because you have crest 3-D white strips that will resolve them in no time</li>
    <li> Easy to use and effective in whitening my teeth by several shades.</li>
    <li> Yup, gets the job done. It makes a noticeable difference. It&#x27;s worth the price--and yes, it does cause teeth sensitivity after a while, but I think that it reasonable and not unbearable. I&#x27;ll probably buy another box after a while to upkeep the whiteness. I&#x27;m an avid coffee drinker so the struggle is real :/</li>
    <li> The Crest strips work well.  My only problem is that I have to use four of them, two up and two down, because I have a big smile and there are teeth near the back of my mouth that do not get whitened with the recommended &amp;#34;two&amp;#34; strips.  Other than that I like the product.</li>
    <li> As the fine print says tooth sensitivity is expected. I am unable to use it every day because the pain is annoying. Every other day works for me and the results after one month are wonderful.</li>
    <li> Add shows 20 treatments but box reads 40.</li>
    <li> Not experiencing the sensitivity I expected and noticing a difference after about 5-7 treatments.</li>
    <li> These are the best whitening strips anywhere. Best price too.</li>
    <li> loved em.  Used 6-7 times with noticeable results. I prefer to use them for an hour since they are so easy to keep in,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost finished with the kit, and the difference in the brightness of my teeth is noticeable. You can use these only twice a year, but I think I&#x27;ll look into the weaker-strength kit for maintenance. I have used the gel cups in the past, and they feel klutzy and uncomfortable for me. These are great because I can just press them on my teeth, forget about them for 30 minutes, then gently peel them off until the next day.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job. strips are easy to put on and stay put really well. it works better to not brush your teeth before using the strips. after using 14 strips my teeth are noticeable whiter, but not super white.definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> These strips are by far the best on the market. Stay in place and a noticeable whiter smile in days!</li>
    <li> I definitely recommend this product! I am using it for a while and the results are visible not only to me, but to others as well, receiving compliments about the whiteness the strips provide and questions about the product. The effects are noticeable after the first use and get better with time. I usually use them for a round of 7 days which provides a beautiful enough result and prevents eventual teeth sensitivity, allowing me to keep the rest for two other rounds.&lt;br /&gt;It is most certainly a good buy as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how anyone could not give this product 5 stars!  It works exactly as advertised.  Very painless process.  I noticed a difference within 4-5 applications.  I am getting many compliments about my smile, which hardly happened before using this product.  My only question will be how long the whitening will last.  That remains to be seen.  But of course, cut out your cokes, coffees, etc.</li>
    <li> these are one of the best on the market. one tip that i have to anyone who suffers from sensitive teeth after usage is just cut your strips dont the middle horizontally then use one for your top and one for your bottom and save the extra one in the package. when i used to use them as they were instructed i would get the most awful pain and sensitivity  my teeth would hurt for about 24-48 hours after each use ever since i stopped using them that way and cut my strips i have absolutely NO PAIN at all. plus if you are worried about the results don&#x27;t be because you CAN NOT tell a difference no one can even see the inside of your teeth. plus on top of that you double your money and have lots of left over product. if you are wondering about purchasing this i would definitely go for it. i use about one box per year and lasts for months before you need another application.</li>
    <li> I just got this from the mail today and I&#x27;m trying it now.... :)&lt;br /&gt;I feel very weird cause I am producing lots of saliva when i put this on. Haha!</li>
    <li> I decided to whiten my teeth before my wedding and after a bunch of research decided on this Crest product (to be fair, I&#x27;m still not fully sure of all the difference between some of their various products).  I was nervous about using it because of the sensitivity issue, but found where someone suggested using Sensodine toothpaste, which has helped. To be fair, my sensitivity is mild and I use it every other day to keep it that way. There was no pain, despite some of the reviews I read. After one session I noticed white dots, but they wouldn&#x27;t have been noticable to anyone else and by the next day they were gone. The strips are longer then I thought they would be, and the top is longer than the bottom. They state after 3 days you should begin to notice a difference. I believe I&#x27;m at day 14 and it still looks the same. I&#x27;m going to finish it out but am likely going to take advantage of their money back policy, as they were about $35.</li>
    <li> I gave it 2 stars because although it didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth at all I got a full refund after using the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! I bought a few at a go and it&#x27;s really worth it.  The stripes stick to the teeth very well and comfortable. The whitening effect is also quite good.</li>
    <li> This product works great! I have been using Crest whitestrips for years and I always get compliments on how white my teeth are and how great they look. This is all after I smoked for 10yrs and got my teeth pretty yellow. These whitestrips made my teeth white again! I tried the trays before and my gums would get irritated, the whitestrips stick to your teeth really well and don&#x27;t irritate the gums at all. I would recomend this product for sure!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product&lt;br /&gt;After many cigarettes and many cups of coffee my teeth were pretty stained. The very first treatment was amazing, with each additional a bit better</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, because I really didn&#x27;t expect these strips to be effective, but I am truly pleased with them. I wanted to hold off writing a comment, and I can honestly say that I wore them for about 2 1/2 weeks and six months later, my teeth are still white. I will definitely use them again if I ever need to and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM! :)</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was just what I expected. White Strips worked very well! I was very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> it works well if you use regularly!</li>
    <li> My teeth are killing me after the first use. I do not recommend these to anybody with sensitive teeth. If I do use them again, it won&#x27;t be for another week.</li>
    <li> I used this product a year ago, and received a number of comments about my teeth.  That doesn&#x27;t usually happen.  The strips go on easily and stay on for the time they need to.  I plan on using these once a year to counter the effects of coffee.</li>
    <li> it works, but it does make your teeth sensitive the second day.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, expensive but great nevertheless. You start seeing results within a week. It may feel weird in your mouth at first but you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product and price.</li>
    <li> Work pretty well, my teeth get sensitive so I just use a couple a week and have noticed my teeth getting whiter.  I have a lot of coffee/tea staining.  Pretty easy to use, pretty quick, pretty solid product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening strips several times with the same result. They just don&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;ve also had professional whitening, which I don&#x27;t think works that well either. Maybe my teeth just don&#x27;t &amp;#34;accept&amp;#34; the treatment?</li>
    <li> These do just as good of a job that you get from the dentist.  They don&#x27;t tell you about it because people would not go to them and spend a lot of $$$.</li>
    <li> These make my teeth very white and VERY sensitive. 10/10 would buy again!!! Love the product.</li>
    <li> Another fine product from the folks at Proctor and Gamble! These whitestrips work exceptional well.</li>
    <li> Used only 3 times and people already noticed. Seems to work. Folding it in the middle helps to apply it. Try to have a dry mouth while applying it. Once wet it nearly is impossible to get it on the right spot. Seems to be a little thin to fold it over my teeth (like explained on youtube).</li>
    <li> They work, for how long not sure. Didin&#x27;t see an immense difference. Seller was great product, eh.....</li>
    <li> Works amazing but you have to continue use</li>
    <li> Got it for a family member, and within a week, you can see the difference!  Now I am tempted to try it!</li>
    <li> awesome product. awesome some more. really awesome. like so damn awesome its that awesome. i like to smile. awesome. yeah.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an excellent teeth whitener. My teeth were in pretty bad shape with the energy drinks and coffee I drink so frequently but within a couple weeks I noticed results. So did my friends and family!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other companies gels, trays etc.  They pale in comparison to the crest strips.  And the advanced strips, although more costly, are SO much easier to use.  For the extra money buy the professional ones listed here, their results are definitely better than the less priced 3d white strips and the larger lower strip helps is stay in place better as well.  Crest every now and then offers thru amazon an instant coupon for often $10 off so wait if you can and the price offered here is great for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty straightforward but be careful. Gauge your sensitivity by trying these out a few times. Not everyone can handle all 30 minutes of the whitening. I&#x27;ve cut my time down to about 20 minutes and it seems to work well for me.</li>
    <li> I belive that this product works; however, it leaves me a lot of pain. My teeth are extremely numbed after a few hours applying the strips. And this condition lasts almost the whole day. I am pretty sure I use them in the right way, and I use them before I brush my teeth. I dont think i can stand this pain to continue using those strips.I can even sleep at night because of my numbed teeth...</li>
    <li> pro:&lt;br /&gt;it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;it is very easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;it hearts very bad if your teeth a little bit broken from any side.</li>
    <li> overall love the whitestrip technology.  Definitely whitens your teeth, and if you are like me and dont have any major hard stains, then really doing only 3-4 day rounds of this product will work. I am on the fence of the new no slip technology. I find the product almost too hard to remove. I really have to give it a yank to get it off. In general I prefer the old ones better for me. I just found them more easy to remove, and I could be more discreet about wearing and removing them. Plus, using this product too many days in a row hurts my teeth. I prefer every other day or for shorter periods of time. In general great product that really improves the look of your teeth.</li>
    <li> Firstly, this product does an incredible job! Your teeth are definitely noticeable whiter I would say even after the first few strips, and it just keeps getting better! However, and not everyone may experience this, I definitely noticed an increase in sensitivity after using these. The sensitivity would actually last all day, and after 3 days of using the strips, I had to use them every other day instead of every day. Still, it was worth it for the price and time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done two rounds of this stuff, and it really works. People have been complimenting on my white teeth. It&#x27;s been about 5 months since I&#x27;ve last used it, results are still there!</li>
    <li> If you are looking to whiten your teeth without going to the dentist and spending a lot of money this is what you need. A bit pricey but it&#x27;s worth every dollar for the results you get.</li>
    <li> Ive used cheaper white strips from crest in the past without any problems. But these 3D strips caused my teeth to be very sensitive for 2 days after each use. So I can only use the strips about 1 time a week. I will say that after 8 treatments my teeth are noticeably whiter. I will probably continue using them at a lower frequency.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t drink much coffee or tea and I don&#x27;t smoke, so my teeth weren&#x27;t very stained to begin with. But they were a bit dingy, and yellowish around the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These whitestrips worked really well... better than I expected considering that I was starting from mostly-white teeth. The results are clearly noticeable, and I imagine they would be even more dramatic for those starting with darker-stained teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what some other reviewers found so difficult about using them. You just peel the sticky strip off the plastic backing, press the strip onto your unbrushed teeth (toothpaste can prevent the gel from penetrating, I guess) wait a half hour, then pull them off and throw them away. Maybe if you don&#x27;t have the patience or dexterity to peel the strip off carefully and apply it properly, you won&#x27;t be satisfied with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the uploaded picture captions says they don&#x27;t work between teeth. I was a bit concerned about having that problem as well since my teeth are not perfectly straight. So I made a point to press them onto my teeth one at a time starting in the front and working toward the back, rather than across all of my teeth at once. This way I could press the strip with my fingernail onto each tooth following its contours from one side to the other. That got the gel onto all of the visible areas, and all of the teeth were whitened (including in between teeth and around the gumline). I could see how your results between teeth would be worse if you don&#x27;t take the time to press the strips against each tooth and squeeze the gel between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the fact that the gel tastes kind of gross, and they do leave some little white blotches that take a few days to fade away, I have no complaints about these strips. My teeth ended up looking naturally white in just 3 weeks and I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity from it. I would highly recommend them, especially for the price and convenience. I&#x27;ll definitely be using them again the next time I want to whiten.g them again the next time I want to whiten.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in the color of my teeth in 3days, but the sensitivity was pretty bad. I do the strips once a week, the sensitivity lasts 2 days max. I just dont like the feeling. Other than that they work great!</li>
    <li> After reading he reviews I thought I try the whitestrips for myself. here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Did not burn my gums/teeth&lt;br /&gt;2) fit really nicely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The product did not whiten my teeth. (I compared the teeth which I used the whitestrips on to my teeth that the strips could not cover). I drink almost no coffee and keep my teeth clean. Overall my teeth are not too yellow they are average from normal wear.&lt;br /&gt;2) The strips only covered the first six teeth on my bottom teeth. I felt that was cheap that the strips were small and did not cover my full bottom smile. How much more expensive could it be to add a few centimeters?&lt;br /&gt;3) My rebate was rejected for the offer being &amp;#34;expired&amp;#34; even tho clearly it says until 2014 on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;the product did not work for me plus I feel that Crest cheated me on the rebate so I&#x27;ll never be buying from Crest again.&lt;br /&gt;also my money back mail warranty offer just got plain out ignored.</li>
    <li> The package arrived sooner than expected. The credt whitestrips worked prefectly. I saw slight results same day and BAM! results after 5 days. No sensitivity and the strips clung well. Great!</li>
    <li> This product whitened very well and I saw results in only 3 days. It is not that bad on sensitivity (I only had a tingling sensation in my gums) but for some people with really sensitive teeth might find it a little painful.</li>
    <li> This item does not whitening my teeth.  I would not recommend it.  It may work for some but not for me.</li>
    <li> It really works! I strongly recommend. For best results, do not drink coke, fanta, coffe, wine or eat chocolate and some other \\&quot;colorish\\&quot; food during the use of the product.</li>
    <li> I have had a long obsession with white teeth but am a little worried with some of the options available.  Being these Whitestrips claim to be Enamel Safe I thought I would give them a try.  They are as advertised as you will start to see results after a couple days and very noticeable after you go through the twenty strips included without any pain.  They are also very easy to apply and take off though the package says no sticky mess is a bit misleading as it is a little sticky.  The biggest drawback is the taste: image having the envelope glue taste in your mouth but ten times stronger for a half an hour.  It took me about a week before the taste even became tolerable.  But the pain-free results  are worth a little bad taste in my mouth.</li>
    <li> As someone who drinks a lot of coffee and does a lot of public speaking/video work, it&#x27;s important to have great looking teeth.  These strips work extremely well. I&#x27;d tried toothpastes claiming to whiten, and they don&#x27;t work at all.  These Crest strips though started whitening my teeth noticeably after just a few applications. Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You basically put what&#x27;s like scotch tape 2 small strips, one on upper and one on lower, on your teeth and wait 30 minutes, then remove, daily for a few weeks.  I do that while watching a tv show at night.  There&#x27;s no taste or hassle, they&#x27;ve very easy to use and effective. Finally - a product that whitens without costly hassle dental tray treatment.  I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer of using these for years.  Thanks Crest for getting it right.  A++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-ken</li>
    <li> Solid product. Makes my teeth a bit sensitive so I have to takes breaks for a few nights in between, but it does whiten, no doubt.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  This is my second time purchase these strips but the first time in this quantity.  The only problem I have with this package is that it did not include the instructions on how often to use the strips.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed to use them daily for number of days until they were all gone of just use them up to 7 days like their other strips.</li>
    <li> I am in grad school, so I drink a lot of coffee and tea, and eat a lot of chocolate. I need these to prevent my teeth from looking like Halloween costume. Thy work alright, but I found them to hurt my teeth a bit too much. i read that the pain is normal, but I&#x27;m not too sure. So I try to use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> However, if you have sensitive teeth, proceed with caution. I saw results within 3 days, but had to stop for a while because I have slightly sensitive teeth and these strips aggravated my condition. So using them everyday isn&#x27;t recommended. But if you can use them every 2 days in conjunction with the 3D white toothpaste (on days when you don&#x27;t use the strips), you can get your results without too much pain. I found that the toothpaste alone also works well if you brush twice a day, everyday. You won&#x27;t get quite the same results as the strips, but I think vast improvement will be seen if you stick with it regularly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My family is very pleased with it. Whitening effect is seen after the first application. Of the cons-bit expensive, a little discomfort in the mouth (sting). Despite these minor shortcomings, I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have always crest white strips and always get compliments after 3 days. These suck. I wish I could find the first ones that came out years ago.</li>
    <li> My 17 year old daughter has been using this product for about 1 year with amazing results. From the first application you could notice a significant whitening. One of her friends is using this product too and she is very satisfied. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love these things!  They make my smile MUCH whiter and they give me more confidence to smile!  Recommended for all.</li>
    <li> Contrary to most of the bad reviews that experienced tooth pain, I did not have any. I did however have some sort of allergic reaction that led to itchy hives and a swollen upper lip. Perusing the Internet, I found a few other that had the same issue, though it appears to be far, far less frequent than tooth and gum irritations. I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the whitening as I had to quit after three treatments. Guess it now time to see if there is some sort of money back guarantee.</li>
    <li> I think these work very well. I have had minimal sensitivity but I also use the other Crest products. I noticed a noticed a whiter smile in just a few days. It beats paying a fortune at the dentist for me.</li>
    <li> They didnt work like magic, the price was too high for how they worked. Possibly an old box???? Besides, they hurt my teeth a little. Not good for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;d heard Crest White Strips were the best thing for whitening teeth, I was still skeptical. I started to see results within the first week and it just got better from there. And I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are unnaturally white, which I was also afraid might happen. I&#x27;ll definitely use these again in the future when I need a touch up.</li>
    <li> I am 50 plus yrs old and my teeth have gotten duller over the years.  I just did not want to pay a dentist to get them whightened. So I tried the strips not really expecting very much.  Well ...after just 3 days I noticed a difference ...not superwhite but lighter.  Haven&#x27;t finished the complete pack but am very, very encouraged.  Have not had any sensitivity either.&lt;br /&gt;For 30 minutes a day...Crest was well worth it.!</li>
    <li> works amazingly , i started seeing results in the 3rd day , i used it twice a day for 7 days and used the extra 6 to refresh things once a month , everyone complimented how white my teeth looked :) &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> My teeth are white.  However, I don&#x27;t like that it takes so long to whiten.  I mean, for two hours I can&#x27;t really talk.  Or drink water.  And these strips make me very thirsty.</li>
    <li> The system: Wear the whitening strips for 30 minutes a day, 20 days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience: After 6 days of strips, my smile *is* getting whiter. But I&#x27;m also feeling random twinges in my teeth. The kind that make you yelp, \\&quot;ah!\\&quot; for a moment...and then it fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive teeth (no problems with hot or cold), but this system is irritating my teeth. Will probably stagger the remaining strips over several weeks, instead of on consecutive days. If I had it to do over, I would choose a gentler version (Crest makes a few different levels of whitestrips).</li>
    <li> Nothing much to say. It works, I think some people find it sensitive because of their gums. People with strong gums and teeth won&#x27;t face irritation.</li>
    <li> This product worked as advertised. I will repurchase when needed. I used them a month ago and they still look okay. I&#x27;m thinking that I will use them two or three times a year.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to finally having a whiter smile. I was realistic about my expectations and my teeth aren&#x27;t in terrible condition, just not as white as I&#x27;d prefer them to be. I had heard great things about the Crest 3d White Professional Effects Whitening Strips and saw that they had fantastic reviews here. I ordered them and after going through the 20-day process, I do not see any difference. I took before and after photos in the same lighting and compared the two. My teeth were no white nor brighter, but I did have one outcome for this product: incredibly sore and sensitive teeth. If you have experienced sensitivity before, even to a slight extent (as I have), I do not recommend this product. The Advance Seal on the strips actually does a great job, too great as they can be difficult to take off, but the true pain comes from the hours and days after wearing the product. I finished the 20-day session two days ago and am still reeling in pain from any cold or hot drinks as well as a strong gust of wind. The sensitivity is excruciating and the result is futile. I hate leaving one-star reviews for products because perhaps this product would work for some, however, for me, I had no improvement whatsoever, incredible amounts of pain (even after I had finished the course), and was out $40. I&#x27;m going to attempt to exercise their \\&quot;Money back guarantee\\&quot; because I am certainly not satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I NEVER review items, but this is seriously one of the best investments one can make. This is GUARANTEED to whiten your teeth so well that you will receive compliments. Thinking about buying it again, though having my teeth too white is an issue I never thought I&#x27;d deal with!</li>
    <li> I decided to finally buy these because there was a $5 off coupon. I was skeptical they would actually whiten my teeth but have been pleasantly surprised. I used the whole box (20 treatments for the top and 20 treatments for the bottom) in 23 days (I forgot a few days) and noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. They have removed some stains on my front teeth which I felt were very noticeable. However, my teeth did not get as white as I would like them. I could just have naturally more yellow-tinted teeth, I don&#x27;t know. One of my complains with these is the sensitivity it cause on my gums. I made sure not to have the strip on my gums but on one part of my gums in particular, they were extremely red, sore and bled when I brushed my teeth after applying these strips (my gums never bleed when I brush my teeth so this was new). The three days I forgot to use the strips I noticed that red, sore and bleeding I had with my gums went away so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a last side effect. I would recommend these if you want to whiten your teeth, just don&#x27;t expect to have an extremely extremely white smile after using them. I may purchase another box of these in a month or two and see if I can get my teeth a few shades whiter.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to apply &amp; stay in place&lt;br /&gt;2. Whitened my teeth&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. A bit expensive, but considerably cheaper than going to the dentist for whitening&lt;br /&gt;2. Left my gums extremely red, sore and bleeding (bleeding after brushing)&lt;br /&gt;3. Leave a weird sticky-ish film on your teeth after removal</li>
    <li> Its overpriced but dont get me wrong. it does work. If you use it to frequently it will make you teeth very sensitive to heat or cold. I sugguest just using the baking soda mix and saving your money. Shipping took a week longer than expected which was slightly frusterating. I was wondering if i was going to even get my package.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use.  I had only minor sensitivity.  The results are a little disappointing.  I was really hoping for more of a whitening effect after the three weeks but I&#x27;m sure individual results will vary.</li>
    <li> I use these strips at least once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist has told me that I don&#x27;t need to whiten my teeth in his office because my teeth were already white enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have people complimenting my smile all the time (my teeth are not \\&quot;celebrity\\&quot; straight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the pain and $.</li>
    <li> I used this pack as directed and it worked wonders! I started to get some coffee stains and I really don&#x27;t like those rough tooth pastes. This was so easy to use, the difference is very noticeable.</li>
    <li> They work. They do from time to time make my teeth hurt but it tbe same whith any whitening products</li>
    <li> Worth it!!!!!!!! Had absolutely no sensitive gums like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I wanted whiter teeth ahead of my wedding, so I asked my dentist for her recommendation. I&#x27;ve used crest white strips and dealt with painful sensitivity from them before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my teeth are straight, she recommended I start with Crest White Strips before spending hundreds of dollars to have her whiten my teeth (I appreciate my honest dentist...), especially since treatments in the dentists office cause the same level of pain--if not more pain she said! My dentist did give me VERY good directions though. First, she said to only pay attention to the &amp;#34;maximum&amp;#34; directions. So since the box says no more than 2 boxes a year, and 1x a day for 30 min, not to exceed those guidelines. But I should otherwise &amp;#34;play it by ear&amp;#34; based on sensitivity--the effects are the same even if the strips are spaced out more. Also, I should start whitening 8-9 months in advance of my wedding, with the 2nd round of strips 2-3 months ahead of the wedding to avoid sensitive teeth on my wedding day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to avoid tooth sensitivity, I started using the strips for 3 days, 1x a day. After this my teeth felt a little sensitive, so I took 4-5 days off, and then used them 2 days in a row. Then I took another 4-5 days off, and used them again for 1-2 days. This meant the package took me about 2 months to go through, but I avoided the intense sensitivity and pain I had previously felt. My teeth were still a little sensitive for a few days after use, but not to the point I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink. And... MY TEETH GOT WHITER! Like, ALOT whiter. I had coworkers complimenting me on them suddenly. I was really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips also attach really well to teeth, which was an improvement over the ones crest had out a few years ago which barely stayed on. They can actually be a little difficult to remove, but I was always able to get them off...eventually. Based on reviews here I also made sure to push the strips into the ridges around my teeth when I put them on, which helped get all of the visible areas white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip--pay attention to the directions when they said not to use them right after brushing. I forgot once, and put them on right after I brushed my teeth. It HURT. I&#x27;m guessing my toothbrush roughed up my gums, since the white strip stung and burned them. It healed overnight, but they were white and swollen for a few hours. The strips otherwise never bothered my gums which was good.e ridges around my teeth when I put them on, which helped get all of the visible areas white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip--pay attention to the directions when they said not to use them right after brushing.

    <li> If you would like to whiten your teeth at an affordable price, this is the product for you. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product as the whitening effect could be seen right away. I didn&#x27;t quite follow the instructions and use it only occasionally (once every 2 months or so) and people already can notice the effect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 12 days so far and have noticed a difference, not a huge difference but good enough I already feel more confident in my smile! I think I might try the step up after this box! I do like how easy they are to use I noticed a little sensetivity in my teeth (as the box instructions do mention while using the product wich is normal) but not unbearable just annoying worth the small annoyance however!</li>
    <li> I bought this product with the illusion of have a very white teeth... I followed the instructions and I got my teeth a little bit whiter, but it doesn&#x27;t last too much. I think you need to keep using it very often to keep your teeth white. Another thing is the straps are a little short, so you don&#x27;t whited all your teeth just part of them and I was afraid about how they look.. I mean this straps are made just for the front part, so probably the teeth in the back are still the same color. I have to say too that after use these straps I have pain in my teeth but nothing terrible, I have used sensodyne for long time, so I don&#x27;t think that I have very sensitive teeth. If you can afford have a professional whitening I recommend that better.</li>
    <li> WOW! My teeth are looking so much better after using this product. I feel like a celebrity when I smile now!</li>
    <li> It works well, but makes my teeth really hurt.  I had to cut down to 20 minutes every other day.</li>
    <li> I think this product works pretty effectively. Granted, I didn&#x27;t see a big dramatic change in the color of my teeth, but you can&#x27;t go into the process with too high of expectations, because you will most likely be disappointed. I did see my teeth gradually get whiter throughout the treatment, but it was a little too spendy for me just because it wasn&#x27;t that amazing of results.</li>
    <li> Tha best of the best! I love it!</li>
    <li> I totally recommend anyone to buy this because it WORKS and it works so well. My teacher asked me how come my teeth were so white the other day lol. I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years (I use two boxed per year ) and let me tell you, my teeth are flashing white. I get SO many compliments. Trust me, It&#x27;s worth every penny. Oh and it works fast. You start seeing results within the first 3 days and within 2 weeks the results are dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;However, this might cause minimal discomfort. So if you feet that your teeth are getting sensitive give them a break for two days or so and then get back to it. You might also want to use this every other day to prevent discomfort (If it bothers you).&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT! I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product as described.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for 4 days now but I can already see an extreme difference.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity as of yet but like I said it is only day 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update at a later time.</li>
    <li> Although these will not make your teeth as white as paper, they definitely do make your teeth a few shades whiter in a short period of time.  I have tried Remembrandt strips and those were absolutely horrible- stick with the Crest 3D white!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on day four, and I can&#x27;t use them anymore. My teeth are normal sensitivity and I just went to the dentist. They said to use these white strips. My teeth hurt SO BAD. 15/10 pain. The pain was so bad it shot up my jaw and in my entire head throbbing. These whitened a little bit but the pain was to incredibly bad it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Works REALLY well. It amazes me how much people notice the difference. My teeth aren&#x27;t really yellow, but they could stand to be whitened. After using the entire treatment it was crazy how much of a difference there was. I received a ton of compliments. It was definitely much whiter &amp; I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that my teeth felt weird when I had the strips on. It was somewhat of an uncomfortable feeling. Not a dealbreaker, but something to be mindful of.</li>
    <li> Great value, these are about $15 cheaper than in the store!</li>
    <li> Have used this product many times before and it works very well.  My teeth are very white after using product.</li>
    <li> thank you fast shipping loved it very happy I will buy alot more I&#x27;m very happy with this thank you again</li>
    <li> Great product. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, quick and easy!</li>
    <li> I love the original Crest White strips so I got the 3D and they are awesome too. I think they work faster so you see whitening after just the first use. I leave mine on the max 30 min and I brush after with Crest Pro-Health sensitive + enamel shield. If I do not use sensitive tooth paste after I get painful sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Easy to follow directions -I saw results in about a week -  have finished all 20 days now, very satisfied - my smile is much brighter !! thanks !</li>
    <li> Noticed a huge difference by the 2nd application. I have had to be careful to use sensitive toothpaste to help with the soreness but it has improved with use.</li>
    <li> I ordered the strips from Amazon. When they were delivered to my house I put the strips on my teeth and started feeling pain in my lower teeth. What kind of brand tells you that the strips are safe for enamel, while they damage your teeth. I wouldn&#x27;t trust any whitening strip products because they have the potential to cause damage. Take my advice and send this package back or give it to someone else if you experience any pain. But the whitening does work and I was able to see after 60 minutes the first day I put them on.</li>
    <li> Very effective with lasting effects. Does cause a bit of sensitivity but not to a painful point.</li>
    <li> This is a solid product that performs as expected. The strips can move a bit, which is annoying when it happens because you can&#x27;t re-adhere them. A little pricey, but lots cheaper than a dental appointment! I will continue to purchase them.</li>
    <li> I saw results in just a week! This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone who needs to brighten their smile and don&#x27;t want to pay&lt;br /&gt;outrageous costs of a dentist whitening program. You get the same results.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well.</li>
    <li> They have really improved white strips from just a few years ago. They actually stick to my teeth now! I must say they use WAY too much packaging for this product, though -- the package could be about the size of a cigarette pack but instead it is ginormous and a real waste of materials. The strips themselves are awesome, though.</li>
    <li> As described. Great price as these were a gift for my daughter for Christmas. Not much more I can say.</li>
    <li> great. it really whitens my teeth in a week.</li>
    <li> They work great but they will make your teeth/gums sensative</li>
    <li> These strips did not counteract all the coffee I drink. I wanted crazy white, and I got landlord white. meh.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much , pleased with everything</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth yet the Gentle Routine Strips leaving notable whiter smile without any aching or sensitivity. I am really impressed and can already see results after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried others but these work the best.  Really adhere to the teeth while whitening.</li>
    <li> Being the coffee drinker that I am, I am a habitual user of Crest Whitestrips, and I get frequent compliments on how white my teeth are. Still, this &amp;#34;Professional Effects&amp;#34; version of the product didn&#x27;t quite meet my expections to the level of whitening I thought I might get out of it...which is why it only gets 4 stars...but it still removes stains quite effectively and doesn&#x27;t leave your teeth feeling overly sensitive like one might expect from a product like this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, visible results.</li>
    <li> These work quite well for teeth whitening. I&#x27;ve even had my dentist comment on my teeth and how good they look. It does take some time (30 mins/day for a few weeks) but there is a payoff.  I used these a few years ago and am just using a few now for touch-ups so the effect is definitely lasting. These strips can cause gum sensitivity so if you already have sensitive gums, they may make that a little worse.</li>
    <li> After 2-3 times use, my teech started aching, It must contain something harmful and weeken the teech, I suggest anyone who wants to use it to be carefully, I don&#x27;t think it is worth to white the teech by harming them.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Did make my gums sensitive after 5 days so had to stop for awhile but did feel my teeth were brighter.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t recommend these for people with sensitive teeth.  mine are usually fine but after using these they stayed sensitive for about a week.  they did make my teeth whiter, but i&#x27;ve only used them about 3 times because they hurt so much.</li>
    <li> love the after affects. There is obvious irritation and sensitivity for about a day, but once the sensitivity is gone the result is awesome!</li>
    <li> My teeth do look a lot whiter and better, but I did have some trouble getting it a few times. It does not hurt your teeth at all and they are worth the price.</li>
    <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t that yellow and I used all the strips exacly how your supposed to and it BARELY did anything at all</li>
    <li> My teeth were yellow but I couldn&#x27;t afford the price to have a dentist whiten them so tired these. Now my teeth are a natural white (not the glaring white that dentists do... looks fake to me). It&#x27;s little bother to put the strips on for half an hour at a time while I&#x27;m doing something else. A very worthwhile investment.</li>
    <li> so far this product has not been so great.&lt;br /&gt;hard to put on at times.&lt;br /&gt;makes your teeth VERY sensitive in my opinion. i also don&#x27;t have very sensitive teeth. i used these two days in a row and had sensitive teeth for an entire week.&lt;br /&gt;i have not noticed any change from my teeth. i know that the package says noticeable difference in three days but i do not know if i can handle anymore teeth sensitivity. it is that bad.&lt;br /&gt;i do not brush before putting the strips on. i do brush right after.</li>
    <li> I use these strips once a year to keep my teeth white.  I don&#x27;t have any negative side effects from them.</li>
    <li> Does the job of whitening but difficult to remove from one&#x27;s teeth. The strips stick on so well that they are really difficult to remove. I&#x27;m looking for some easier tooth whitener</li>
    <li> Works better than a $300 treatment at the dentist so I&#x27;ll keep on using the product. Convenient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will do. Better quality adhesion than the standard strips.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It whitens my teeth and keep them nice and white between 6 month dental cleanings.</li>
    <li> I order Crest white strips about once per year.  I drink coffee, so over that time I feel my teeth do yellow.  Within just a few days of using these white  strips, I believe my teeth are whiter.</li>
    <li> I usually experience sensitivity with professional whitening systems. Crest 3D White Strips get the job done without any of the sensitivity side effects.</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re like me and just want crazy white teeth, here&#x27;s what you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first, do a box of whitestrips. then&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) get crest whitening toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;2) get crest whitening mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;3) get flossies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use those 3 for 3-4 months. your teeth at this point should be pretty white from both the first box and maintaining with the 3 things above. your teeth have recovered from the first box of strips at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, use another box of whitestrips...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and your teeth will be shining. continue to use the 3 items above to maintain. easy as that.</li>
    <li> I got a sale price and a $10 rebate so I&#x27;m topping out at around $18 and for that price, nice product. It helped at least approx 2 shades. They have absolutely changed the adhesives. These things now have to be forcibly removed from your teeth. That&#x27;s a good thing. They absolutely stay locked! $20 or less, dont even question it...$25 or more, I&#x27;d wait for a deal.</li>
    <li> AWESOME product and very satisfied</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, you can see the result from 3rd day.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use. It&#x27;s comfortable when you using.&lt;br /&gt;You can eat after one hour</li>
    <li> These do a great job of whitening, only complaint would be that they make my teeth SO sensitive. Almost unbearable. Gets the job done, though. Just be wary.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used the professional effects strips and I love them! They worked really fast, I definitely saw improvement after only two days! I drink coffee regularly, so these are a life saver!</li>
    <li> I have some bottom teeth that have several areas without enamel that always get dark from coffee etc.  This cleans them up nicely.</li>
    <li> I used it before a couple of years ago and it worked wonderfully.  I bought another set because as time goes on, some stains have appeared and I know these strips will get out the stains.  Its a great product with no problem with sensitive teeth (which I have).  And at Amazon&#x27;s prices, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Was so easy to apply the strips; have not used them consistetly, however, my teeth are definetly whiter. Because I am older they&lt;br /&gt;probably won&#x27;t be the pearly white one would like. My dentist told me your teeth &#x27;color&#x27; complements your complexion. Am very happy with the results so far.</li>
    <li> I bought these because my teeth were looking a bit yellow and drab, and after just one application they brightened up perfectly.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for anyone with more serious staining, except as follow up to an expensive dental treatment, or perhaps, if you are one of those hardcore folks who can use straight hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash (letting it sit in your mouth for a while)-- though that way brought a LOT of sensitivity to my gums.  I plan on using the strips only on my upper teeth, and about once a week to keep them bright.  Four starts instead of five, as Crest doesn&#x27;t bother to tell the consumer ANYWHERE that the sticky part of the strip is the side you want to apply to the surface of the teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never been perfectly white, but I decided to try out these whitening strips to improve them. So far they seem to be working, I have had a few comments from people that my teeth are looking better than before (of course, I&#x27;m brushing/using mouth wash twice a day in addition to using these strips). As other reviews have said, they do make your teeth a bit sensitive when you apply them. However it has not been severe enough for me to stop using them.</li>
    <li> The professional effects work much better than the entry level versions as they have a better seal; I HATE the taste of the gel, and these keep it in better.&lt;br /&gt;They do a great job the first few times, and to keep your teeth the same level of white, but will not take you up to the super bright white color, even if you keep them on longer than recommended (shhh, I didn&#x27;t try that at all, haha). They will make sensitive teeth more sensitive for a few hours to a few days, so be cautious of that. Next time I will spend the extra $$ on the even higher version, but I may have to get professional whitening to achieve the shade I am trying to get....</li>
    <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve had my braces removed, I&#x27;ve always wanted pearly white teeth. Based on majority of the reviews, I was excited to try out this product. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth, like the packaging said it would. As of right now, after my 20th strip, my teeth are slightly brighter but still yellow. With that being said, I am slightly disappointed as this product was not able to carry out its full effect for my teeth. As for the teeth sensitivity, it was very minimal and it wasn&#x27;t as bad as what most reviewers claimed it would be. I will not be repurchasing this product again because of the minimal effect it had on my teeth but I am glad that it worked out for majority of the people out there.</li>
    <li> Used it for about a week and its been showing results. But I have to say, since I have sensitive teeth, after using it for my first time I had some incredibly bad tooth ache only once or twice. But after that first day, everything was working perfect. Great product.</li>
    <li> They do what it says on the packet...............nice white teeth.  Just follow the instructions and you get the results you want</li>
    <li> These really work the best of all.  I saw improvement on the first application. I&#x27;ll buy these again for sure.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than a store that&#x27;s for sure , and it will make your teeth nice and white.You should try it.</li>
    <li> Really works! Make sure you &amp;#34;do not&amp;#34; brush your teeth before applying strips, per the instructions. I didn&#x27;t realize that I was not supposed to brush teeth before applying until I read the directions.</li>
    <li> I used the product as was described but it did not work, My teeth are in the same state as they were previosly, I doint know what kind of teeth the positive reviews have but this was a waste of money for me</li>
    <li> These work well. I chose these instead of the ones that were supposed to work in a shorter amount of time. These seem to whiten and only slightly irritate my teeth. The very slight discomfort is easily manageable with Sensodyne.</li>
    <li> Sticks to your teeth nice and I think they work better then most also, I will order these again, thanks</li>
    <li> These white strips WORK! And they work quickly too! You can wear them for up to two hours a day to brighten your smile quickly. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is way cheaper than going to the dentist for whitening and actually works, but it has a bitter taste when ingested (it&#x27;s hard not to) and makes my teeth extra sensitive the day after. I use it twice a week (instead of the recommended daily application) to moderate the sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This product really works! And the best pasrt until now, the strips doesn&#x27;t make any dammage to my teeth! I love it!</li>
    <li> Always skeptical, I figured that these things would work &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34;.  Fwiw, I used &amp;#34;tray kits&amp;#34; once, and in the past.  While the tray kits worked, these whitestrips REALLY work....and are much less messy!  I&#x27;ve only used about 6 of them (out of 20) and have seen remarkable lessening of yellowing in the bottom of my teeth, as well as some overall whitening of my smile.  Seriously, this product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve experienced NO sensitivity issues (I DID with the tray product that I used 10yrs ago) so far, but again, only 1/3rd into using these.  I feel great about my choice to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest 3D White Whitestrips for a few years now and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. The price tag originally scared me, but it is well worth the investment seeing as they aren&#x27;t a continuous product that you buy year round. The new strips provide a fantastic seal around your teeth, which makes them comfortable to wear. 30 minutes a night is not too much to ask, I usually throw them on as I get the house cleaned up or do a load of laundry. I have had some irritation come from the strips when followed by rougher brushing, but all in all, they are a fantastic product and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to whiten their smile.</li>
    <li> I saw a noticeable difference. They didn&#x27;t cause me any pain, discomfort, or sensitivity and the &amp;#34;leaking&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;oozing&amp;#34; does happen but wasnt too much of a bother.</li>
    <li> This is a whitening product that actual works.  If your teeth are a little sensitive like mine, I would recoment using every other day to give them a break between treatments.</li>
    <li> Loved this product. The strips significantly whitened my teeth just like they said they would. Other people commented on how great my teeth looked. The whiteness lasted several months, time for another application.</li>
    <li> Works well, nice white teeth after a few treatments.  Coffee is my downfall....I drink a lot of coffee therefore my teeth get stained. I am glad that there is a product out there that I can use at home without the HUGE dentist fee I would have to pay to have them professionally whitened.</li>
    <li> I like my teeth white!  I have professional bleaching trays from the dentist, but these are even more convenient for those times I want a quick touch up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, this is the first whitening product that I have tried but it really worked for me. It took about 15 days for people to be like &amp;#34;Oh wow, your teeth are beautiful!&amp;#34; So needless to say that had me sold. I will warn you that this may cause you to have sensative teeth so you might want to pick up some Sensodine toothpaste as well or you won&#x27;t be enjoying Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s like you were before.</li>
    <li> You get bang for your buck in this product- it&#x27;s slower than going to the dentist, but patience has its rewards.&lt;br /&gt;The strips are longer for your upper teeth, which makes sense and is a larger portion of your smile I guess.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping, Grip to teeth well. Gave it a 4 because I do not like wearing them for 30 minutes and for so many days. My teeth look a shade more white. Loved that I could buy these online, never wait in a shopping line, and they were cheaper than I found at drugstore.</li>
    <li> For enhanced results, I recommend brushing your teeth before &amp; after using these whitening strips. Brings out that pearl white smile</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the professional effects strips from Crest. I have been using them for about 6 months, but I recently realized how great they were working when my DENTIST asked at my 6 month check up if I had gotten my teeth professionally whitened!  I have been using them with the Crest toothpaste and the Crest mouthwash. I have had quite a few people comment how white my teeth are lately, and that had never happened before.</li>
    <li> My daughter used these for the recommended amount of time and her teeth were noticeably whiter.  She received many inquiries from those who noticed.</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a noticeably whiter smile in photos now. Usually I smile with my mouth closed because I was sensitive about my teeth discoloration. They look really white in pictures so I&#x27;m starting to have open smiles now. Problem is with teeth sensitivity. I used Sensodyne toothpaste while using this, which helped significantly. I can&#x27;t use the whitener everyday, so for the first two weeks I did every other day or so, and just do occasionally touch ups and slow whitening.</li>
    <li> Having White teeth is next to nothing as far as appearance and first impressions go. I tried this to start with but needed faster and less costly product so I switched to the \\&quot;tooth whitener\\&quot;. Its now on sale for only about $5.00 and works just as good if not better and in only 7days you see results. check it out.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> These strips do work if you use as directed.  They did cause one tooth to become very sensitive but a dose of Anbesol took care of the pain.  I use them every couple of months for upkeep.</li>
    <li> works great. visible difference</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past 2 days. My teeth are sensitive but this made them feel like they were going to fall off. The pain was not worth continuing.</li>
    <li> Item just as described. Good quality for the price. Worked great and Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> These make my teeth so sensitive I can barely stand to use them</li>
    <li> Very good i&#x27;m very like~~~</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear these at all. The pain was like something touching raw nerve endings in my teeth. The bottom strip wouldn&#x27;t stick which was probably a blessing in disguise.  I haven&#x27;t felt that sort of intense pain in my teeth since I don&#x27;t know when. I couldn&#x27;t rip the strip off fast enough.  $37.00 straight into the trash.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I noticed my teeth is whiten by 80% if it&#x27;s on for more than 30 mins.</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying I am a smoker. I had very yellow teeth as a teenager and through my young adult life. I see my dentist as recommended. When Crest first came out with white strips years back, I was hesitant to buy them. They are expensive and you really take a risk of losing a large amount of money. I asked my dentist of 20 years for a professional whitening. My dentist, told me I would get the same results from Crest white strips as a professional whitening for the fraction of the cost. My dentist was right. After 3 days My teeth looked amazing. Every year when a new line of white strips comes out, I buy them. My teeth look like what you see in the movies and I constantly get compliments. You could never tell that I am STILL a smoker. I just purchased the 3d White Professional, and these are by far the best ones I have used. It recommends 20 days of application, but my dentist advised up to 2 hours (4 strips) per day as tolerated. There will be gum sensitivity, but it will pass. If you use 4 strips a day like I did, that&#x27;s only 5 days of sensitivity. It&#x27;s well worth the minor pain after the 5 days. It will look as if you spent thousands on your teeth. If you are not happy with the results, crest will refund your money 100%. But, I can guarantee you, you will not be returning these for a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the strips half an hour for three days, and I notice a considerable difference! Even though they&#x27;re a little hard to pull off, they contour amazingly to my teeth!</li>
    <li> My teeth are not super sensitive, but ouch! These strips really hurt my teeth. They might be effective at whitening your teeth, but I won&#x27;t suffer through it to find out. Four hours after I took them off, I was in such pain that I resorted to taking some ibuprofen. That helped, but I am not going to use these strips again after that experience.</li>
    <li> It may be working ? I can&#x27;t tell?</li>
    <li> These give a natural whitening look to my teeth, even with my fair skin tone. Best of all, I have not had any sensitivity, which has been an issue with other whiteners for me.</li>
    <li> Recommended this product for a bright smile. Item came exactly as described and was easy to use. Great product to purchase</li>
    <li> Teeth sensitivity came along with the whitening effects. I actually saw the difference in my teeth after my 3rd use but I think I&#x27;ll have to use it every other day instead of everyday. I used this with the Crest 3D White Toothpase and the brand&#x27;s whitening mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just left each strip for 30 mins every night then I brush my teeth. In the morning I just brush it again but this time I use the mouthwash by Crest 3D White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might keep on using this as long as I can tolerate the teeth sensitivity which isn&#x27;t that a big of a deal for me as of the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just have to stay away from artificially colored processed foods to make the whitening process faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually gave one box to my sister as a gift for Christmas. I&#x27;d recommend this product to those who want a laser teeth whitening effect for a fraction of cost.</li>
    <li> These white strips are awesome. I love how they upgraded the product so the strips actually stay on your teeth and don&#x27;t slide around. Once you remove them you will be able to see a difference, well at least I did! I only use them every couple of months because I&#x27;m a coffee and tea drinker. I use them until I get my desired tooth whiteness, which is typically just in 3 days. After that my teeth remain very white for months! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It seems like everyone is getting a bad box, myself as well. These make your teeth extremely sensitive and do little to nothing in terms of whitening. Would not recommend until Crest gets this issue resolved. Probably gonna request a refund.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Started seeing a difference by the 6th day. The pain is very minimal even though I would apply it longer than the required time.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of strips in the past and have always had to use my retainer to hold them in place. These grip very well. I have had them in now for 15 minutes and have felt no slipping. But once they are placed do not try to move or adjust, just try to be careful when first placing them.  I have only just received them so I can not say anything towards their effectiveness, but crest is a trusted brand so my hopes are high.</li>
    <li> yes, my teeth are white and nice looking but they became really sensitive&lt;br /&gt;i feel cold air outside (winter time) i feel some weird thing  going on with cold or hot drink.&lt;br /&gt;i feel everything. its not really a good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;but yes, teeth are white.</li>
    <li> These are great! I see a small difference after the first use. There&#x27;s a noticeable difference after 3 days. They work. Isn&#x27;t that the point?</li>
    <li> Definitely can see a difference</li>
    <li> Did not try my product</li>
    <li> BLING! These grip the teeth much better than any other strip I&#x27;ve used. Whiten nicely without too much sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Perfect and much cheaper than in store</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these!  It&#x27;s how she keeps her teeth so white :)</li>
    <li> Works quickly. Hard to talk with them on, however, so read a book or something.  Plan on purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful thank you very much</li>
    <li> received with no problems</li>
    <li> Really works!  I have used other products and haven&#x27;t seen this kind of quick results. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> They work but sting after prolonged use.</li>
    <li> I found that this product had some effectiveness, but I had a serious issue with sensitivity. I&#x27;ve never in my whole life had sensitive teeth, and I used this product and, from the first strip, I had aches and pains all through my teeth and gums. I finally stopped after a week because my teeth were hurting constantly and in a HUGE way when I ate or drank anything hot or cold. Utility before vanity!</li>
    <li> My wife and I have used these Crest strips many times and it always does a great job. I guess we&#x27;ve become addicted to having white teeth and get turned off by seeing so many people who otherwise look nicely attired walking around with yellow teeth. Crest strips are easy to use and stick very well. Please, yellow teethed people, use Crest 3D strips!</li>
    <li> Omg such a amazing product!!! OK so I get this kit for free and was so super excited to try Crest 3D whiting kit.it works so well in just two use I could already tell a difference.  Now after 7 days my teeth look and feel like I had had them professionally whitened.  I rate Crest 3D 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a whiter smile! These are great. Just a tad bit of sensitivity on my teeth right after using them, but that&#x27;s with any whitening strip.</li>
    <li> These strips work so well. I don&#x27;t even have to follow the recommended schedule. I use them less than recommended and get amazing results! I have recommended them to several people (when asked of course).</li>
    <li> really works, but gave me terrible teeth sensitivity!</li>
    <li> Crest 3d works good and they don&#x27;t slip around on my teeth like the older ones did. I will say this though, they made my teeth hurt. I highly recommend using a Sensodine tooth paste 5 days prior to starting this treatment. The pain went away pretty quickly when I stopped using the strips.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any big difference.  Made my teeth sensitive.  For the price did not do the job.</li>
    <li> I have used this before. It was recommended to me by my dentist.  Use about every six months.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend especially if you can&#x27;t afford those expensive dental office procedures.</li>
    <li> great buy! my teeth ARE WHITER!</li>
    <li> light good quality easy to use it i used it with my wife  . love it because the size and efficiency</li>
    <li> It simply delivers what promises, the results are great!</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t see that these did much good. I am old so maybe they don&#x27;t work on old teeth but I would&#x27;t spend my money on these again.</li>
    <li> Iv been using them for four days now an I have noticed a little difference however they are causing me horrible pain. The pain doesn&#x27;t start until hours after I have use them and then lasts for a few hours. The pain is way to much for me don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll finish the box.</li>
    <li> Love these. Only Luxe though, other are slimy and do not stay on very well</li>
    <li> My teeth are not yellow but are definitely off-white. While using this product for the 20 days they were noticeably whiter but within two weeks after I was done using them they reverted back. Totally useless</li>
    <li> Worked very well removing the coffee stains......at least the top teeth...notice some yellowing remains on the bottom teeth which seems harder to get rid of and I also like the way the strips remain on the teeth without sliding off and need to be peeled away...........Very good results for using only 20 strips.</li>
    <li> Whitens your teeth in one use. I really like it. I bought a lot already and gifted it to my sisters. They also enjoyed the product and wanted me to buy more for them.</li>
    <li> I have noticed some whitening which I&#x27;m happy with.  Didn&#x27;t experience too much sensitivity but I only used it for a few days at a time or a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m lucky enough to have structurally sound teeth that are naturally white. However, for the majority of my teenage years and early 20s, I simply didn&#x27;t take care of my teeth. I&#x27;m also lucky enough to not have any damage from those many years of neglect, but the staining has...not been pretty. Let&#x27;s put it that way. I&#x27;ve wanted to whiten my teeth for years, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the outrageous costs for a professional treatment, which I was sure was my only hope for such deep staining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After consulting with my dentist, I decided to give these a try. I tried White Strips about 10 years ago without success, primarily because I couldn&#x27;t keep them on my teeth. I&#x27;m happy to report that these newer strips are MUCH stickier, and once you make sure they&#x27;re secure, they don&#x27;t budge. In fact, the top strip is even a little tough to pull off. The bottom strip is easier, but I also have somewhat oddly-shaped lower teeth, so that might not be true for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these six times now, usually every day (though I&#x27;ve skipped a day or two just because I forgot), and I&#x27;ve already noticed a major difference. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t have a movie star smile by any means. They&#x27;re still pretty dingy. But they look SO much better than they did, even though I&#x27;ve only gone through about 1/4 of the box. I&#x27;m really excited to see the final results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive at all, for the most part, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any sensitivity with these either. I asked my dentist about that before use, and she said sensitivity issues most often come about when people have nerve or root exposure. As that doesn&#x27;t apply to me, that might be why these don&#x27;t cause sensitivity for me. Just to be on the safe side, though, I&#x27;ve been brushing with an enamel-protecting toothpaste that&#x27;s made specifically for sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not confident enough to post a progress photo, but I fully plan on uploading a before and after shot once I&#x27;ve finished the box. In the meantime, definitely give these a try! I&#x27;m really happy I did.the box. In the meantime, definitely give these a try! I&#x27;m really happy I did.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with the results from this kit.  About halfway through my treatments, I realized that I could cut the strips in half to use since only my front teeth are not crowned.  They worked perfectly for me using them in this manner.  I would definitely recommend this kit to others.</li>
    <li> Love this ...causes a little senstivity to my teeth but gives great results</li>
    <li> This product works!  It is easy to apply and my gums were not sensitive from it.</li>
    <li> My teeth were nothing close to being yellow to begin with, but I really wanted those super white head turning teeth. I only used about 5 out of 20 packs, and I have already seen a huge difference. I saw a difference right after my first time using. My only issue with these is they made my bottom teeth VERY sensitive. The pain started about 5 hours after use, and it lasted for about 7-10 hours. Nothing would make this go away, not Sensodyne, not baking soda, not warm salt water, not tooth ache medicine, not ibuprofen, not anything. Mind I tell you, this pain was almost unbearable. I believe this is because I had braces, though, and the bar glued to the back of my bottom teeth was causing this pain. I do recommend these to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have any sort of tooth sensitivity! They are amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 59 years old and I had used Crest Whitestrips many years ago but experienced teeth sensitivity so quit using them. In early 2014, I tried Crest Whitestrips &amp;#34;Gentle Routine&amp;#34; due to sensitivity fears, but they did nothing to whiten my teeth, so I gave up on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to be brave and ordered Crest 3D White Luxe Professional Effects Whitestrips and after using a box, found there was a noticeable degree of whitening of my yellowed teeth. I bought another box and used most of the strips later that year and have definitely noticed an improvement that has lasted. The increased whiteness is particularly noticeable to me in photographs where I&#x27;m smiling, but my husband also commented that my teeth looked whiter. I have also used Crest 3D White Luxe &amp;#34;Glamorous White&amp;#34; toothpaste (label states: &amp;#34;Removes up to 90% of surface stains in 5 days&amp;#34;) twice a day over the past year and I think it&#x27;s possibly helped maintain some of the whiteness I got from the Whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had minimal teeth ...

    <li> Whitens teeth nicely and always better when you can find at a decent price.</li>
    <li> They do whiten teeth but it takes about a week to see results. The downside is that it causes teeth to become very sensitive. They also hurt a bit , like the feeling of having ice in your mouth for hours and not being able to spit them out. It actually kept me up a couple nights. I thought I would be use to it by now but nope.</li>
    <li> I use these about once a year and they work great. All of my students always ask me how I get my teeth so white.</li>
    <li> These strips actually WORK. They give my teeth some discomfort after use, and don&#x27;t really whiten in the corners of teeth because the film doesn&#x27;t adhere to the corners; however, for the price, it works for me. Plus, I hate going to the Dentist, so I would much rather whiten at home lol.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter and she raved about it. She&#x27;d tried many whiteners that didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
    <li> It worked on my friend so I thought it would work for me. Turns out it does not work for everyone. Not only that, I used it for 2 weeks and it actually disintegrated my gums on the bottom. After a few months, my gums are slowly growing back but still can see a visible hole. You can google and see a lot of people complaining about this happening to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend it!</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews about this product, I wanted to give it a try  myself. My teeth were not bad to begin with, but I&#x27;ve never seen them so white! I did start seeing results after the 4th use and after using almost the entire box worth of strips, I am so very pleased! I would definitely recommend this product, it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I use these strips maybe once a year.  They really stick to your teeth.  Even though these are longer than original, I wish they were even longer.  I have a wide smile that shows the sides of my teeth.  I want more of my side teeth whiter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m roughly halfway through the box and so far it has definitely whitened my teeth. I&#x27;ve used these in the past and I already knew that they would work wonders. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4-stars is because after about 7 consecutive days my teeth always start to get very sensitive. So I normally have to take a 3-4 break then start back up again. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth so it&#x27;s not a pre-existing issue, it happens every time I use Crest&#x27;s teeth whiteners. I was just hoping they would figure out a way to make it less abrasive on your teeth without having to sacrifice whitening power. Oh well, I&#x27;ll always buy these. Just be mindful of the possible sensitivity that it may cause you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the 2 hour Crest White Strips before and they really hurt my teeth. I expected these to be less powerful because of the 30 minute use per day. I was surprised to find that these still cause pain in my teeth even an entire day after using them. I followed the recommended use instructions and put them on for 30 minutes around 8pm, but I was feeling pain in my teeth, particularly when drinking cold and hot drinks, the next day up until about 10pm. I will continue to use these, but I think I&#x27;ll try 15-20 minute sessions every other day to see how these feel.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE AMAZINGGGG. You can already tell from the reviews these strips got and i tried them every day and wore them for about an hour each time and my teeth saw major whitening difference after 5 days.</li>
    <li> There is a difference between white and pearly white, and these strips will get you there. I use them every now and again.</li>
    <li> We tried these very expensive strips. My granddaughter had a piano recital and she wanted to loo her best...her teeth started feeling really sensitive after just one use, there was no difference in her teeth...now about 8 yours later she said her teeth REALLY hurt..I don&#x27;t recommend this product. you may not experience the pain as per reviews, not all do but be advised YOU MAY. I am going to call customer service and ask for a full refund...</li>
    <li> ive been using these for years, was suggested by a friend who uses them. they work great and everyone compliments me on how white my teeth are! i lie and say i dont use anything lol but  these work really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; you get a top and bottom strip in each pouch it says to use them every day for 30 mins. however if you have sensitive teeth i would recommend doing the 30 mins, but only 2-3 times a week. they make your teeth hurt. but i do it twice a week and they still work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO!! if you use tanning beds, i put them on before i go in and just smile with them on for the first couple mins, and they work even faster. ALSO!! they can get sticky on your teeth, i always brush my teeth after. but i still love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope i could help!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product (after using original Crest white strips and professional effects in years past) from an Amazon seller named Bargain OTC. I would assume that my product was defective, as it seems no others have had the problem I encountered.&lt;br /&gt;I followed directions exactly, but since it was my first time using these particular strips, and because they were hard, stiff and uncomfortable, I decided to remove them after 20 minutes...They would NOT come off! They were &#x27;glued&#x27; on as if I had used Super-glue. I rinsed and soaked with hot water and gently as possible pried them off of my teeth little-by-little. I was left with bright white patches on my teeth! I was scared to death. I wanted to call an ER dentist. Luckily, the patches faded away slowly, they were gone by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I packed the strips right back in the box (still with shrink-wrap, but for one small rip) and contacted the seller, Bargain OTC. They got back to me the next day...they refused to help in any way-No return/ NO refund. They told me to contact Crest. I WILL!...Be careful!!</li>
    <li> My teeth went from light yellow to white in a short 4-5 days and then continued to brighten. I am very pleased and recommend highly...</li>
    <li> DIDN&#x27;T WORK AS WELL AS I HAD HOPED.  THE WHITENING SEEMED TEMPORARY WHEN I EXPECTED IT TO LAST LONGER THAN IT DID</li>
    <li> I used it for 20 days straight i didnt saw any difference im not happy with the product it just didnt do the work it says it will do. highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical probably like everyone else but these strips worked great for me.  I have used them twice over a year period and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I bought some for my dad who has 30+ years of coffee drinking stains and they didn&#x27;t completely whiten his teeth like they did mine so I guess if your teeth are really stained they might not give you the results you need.  If you have slightly stained teeth these strips will make your teeth pearly white</li>
    <li> I did see a improvement on my teeth!! Love it!! only thing is my teeth is so sensitive!! and sometimes i get bad sensitivity pains after using these strips. Its not painful, just very discomforting. But these strips really work! i&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these strips did anything.  I used them faithfully for 20 days and my teeth do not look any whiter.  I can compare them to my dental work and don&#x27;t see a difference.  I will say the strips stay on better and have a less horrible taste than the old strips.  However, they didn&#x27;t work for me.  I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> My teeth felt sensitive after 3 days of usage. I stopped use and feel like I wasted $45. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the professional effects level of the Crest strips.  Once I had my teeth really white, I have just had to use the strips about once every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> My own dentist recommended these, and I was amazed at the results.  A number of years ago I had spent lots of money to have custom made trays and they worked fine. Since they no longer fit well, tried the strips. They are fantastic. I was skeptical at first. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to brighten their teeth. Easy to apply too</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have had no pain or discomfort while using these strips, however, I have been using Sensodyne toothpaste.</li>
    <li> These simply worked ok. However they didn&#x27;t cover all of the teeth surface like others said.</li>
    <li> these work great and they don&#x27;t have to be on that long</li>
    <li> item works as decdribed online. ive noticed a difference in my teeth only after using it for 6 days. a significant difference. good stuff.</li>
    <li> I didnt use them all at once, just a one every few days, I dont want my teeth to look too white.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> My teeth looked brighter and whiter after about ten days. I did have some sensitivity, but it was tolerable. Will use the product again in the future.</li>
    <li> These strips really work so much better than i thought my teeth are at least 3 shades white. I used the strips twice a day in the morning and before bed, i seen a big difference after the 4th day of use,every time i went to work people were like , there&#x27;s something different about you did you change your hair, so on and so on until i smiled big and then they knew lol.  .The only thing that i didn&#x27;t like about these strip were the taste, i know it&#x27;s not suppose to taste good DUH!,but the taste got a little sickening over time. Overall great product and i will be ordering more boxes.</li>
    <li> Whitens teeth well within a few days, but unfortunately once you stop using them it fades away, also can leave to some minor sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product, hoping it will help whiten my teeth but I am not seeing any changes.  I followed the directions, it doesn&#x27;t even paste properly to your teeth.  I am very disappointed for a product that sell for that much and does nothing.</li>
    <li> this is the first time I use it. after 30 minuts It&#x27;s pain!!! what&#x27;s worse!! It has been painful more than 6 hours !!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I had the magic results you see from the commercials, but I have definitely noticed my teeth being whiter and that&#x27;s what it says it does. So no complaints here. One thing is the instructions don&#x27;t really give you a lot of guidance, and they don&#x27;t tell you that it tastes exactly like peroxide (shocking i know) but a heads up would&#x27;ve been nice. I&#x27;d get it again.</li>
    <li> def make your teeth whiter and temporarily more sensitive overall worth it tho</li>
    <li> Have been using this product four days.  See a great improvement thus far and am looking forward to the end result!  Also, the advanced seal technology is fantastic.</li>
    <li> You notice a difference right away.  This product is much less expensive buying it online than in the store and it works very well.  I don&#x27;t use the box at one time, but spread the treatments out and it last a long time and have no trouble with sensitivity.</li>
    <li> The price fluctuates wildly so check the per strip price. They seem to be cheaper here than at stores with a coupon. I can&#x27;t get thru all 20 without my teeth getting too sensitive. I thought a 20 pack meant you had 2 dosages - but no- they really want you to use for 20 days straight. My teeth never get really bright white, but I have to stop somewhere between 10-14, and they&#x27;re adequate. They&#x27;re not the weaker ones like the &amp;#34;Vivid&amp;#34;- I can tell because I do get so sensitive. So I split the box and wait a few months in between treatments.</li>
    <li> Worked great , very happy</li>
    <li> I wanted white teeth for my wedding. I followed the instructions and was pleased to see a perfect smile in time for the big occasion. There was no reactions from the teeth or the gums. I recommend this product to all who want whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery, and the item arrived in good condition, factory sealed with expiration date in 2014. As for the item itself great quality as always with all the Crest products. One has to remember though that these are one of the strongest formulas of the Crest whitestrips, so some teeth sensitivity issues may arise, but this discomfort normally goes away if you take a day off or right after the full treatment period. I would recommend Professional Effects to people who don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, otherwise I would suggest using Gentle Routine.</li>
    <li> Great product so easy to use..I find it whitens my teeth in about four days use the rest of the strips periodically.</li>
    <li> Whitens teeth super quick!  Shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Love these. They really work!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the lower strip was longer &amp; stuck a little better.</li>
    <li> These strips adhere very well to my teeth. When removing the strip, I actually have to tug on it to pull it off. The size of the strips is large, enough to cover and treat all my top teeth that are visible when I smile. However, I have sensitive teeth and find that this particular formula causes additional sensitivity, up to 3 days after using the product. Unfortunately for me, I will have to go back to Crest&#x27;s sensitive formula, which is gentler, but also effective for whitening.</li>
    <li> It works as it says; whiten my teeth quickly. My teeth got sensitive if I used it 4-5 days straight. I did get few white spots, but it didn&#x27;t stay long.</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled and works great!</li>
    <li> Incredibly effective. The first time you use the strips, 30 minutes, you get clear results! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Ochischaet ot naleta, ne bolee.</li>
    <li> it can make your teeth sensitive after a while of use. it can hurt your teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter now.</li>
    <li> ouch my teeth. but so white</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not fit for sensitive teeth. I can&#x27;t eat anything because of the tooth pain after use it several times.</li>
    <li> I see results after using these one time. I left them on for a half hour my teeth didn&#x27;t hurt, until later that day &amp; the next day. My teeth were so sensitive they hurt every time I breathed! I don&#x27;t know how someone could do more then one treatment with in 24 hours. I like that they weren&#x27;t messy and stayed in place.</li>
    <li> Always a great product! Results last for a long time and you&#x27;ll get many compliments.</li>
    <li> The whitening was apparent enough that I have received comments saying teeth looked whiter.</li>
    <li> I tried these on a whim, and was surprised by how effectively they worked. I keep up on dental hygiene and did not expect to see major results but I was shocked this product worked extremely well</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest White Strips for years. After the initial treatment of 20 days, 2 hours or twice a day for 7 days depending on the product you purchase, you do not have to use them again for a few months and then only for a couple of days. My dentist compared my teeth to a chart and I am at the second to whitest level possible. I am thrilled with the results. Over the years the strips have improved with the Advanced Seal Version and maybe I am getting used to it but they appear to be less harsh on my teeth and I have little or no tooth sensitivity. Amazon has these items priced $10 below the retail price in my area. I spoke in length to my dentist and was assured there is no way this product can harm your teeth. I have all my friends and family addicted to a beautfiul smile. TRY THEM!!! You will be amazed at the quick results.</li>
    <li> This product worked very well for me. I don&#x27;t have deep stains or gray stains - just some yellowing from coffee etc. For whitening strips, I had tried the 2 hour version of Crest before with decent results, and store brand that I had to return (the strips wouldn&#x27;t seal properly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much better than the 2 hour version in terms of both comfort and results. There was some sensitivity but not as much as the 2 hour version. Very tolerable for me. I did not use them daily - sometimes I forgot, sometimes I wanted to take a break. I could see results after only a few days and it really wasn&#x27;t a hassle to use for so many days. Keeping something on half an hour is not so hard to plan for (as opposed to 2 hours). I still have 8 or so left and my teeth are really white so I may save them for later. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> We used these for 20 days before our wedding.  Both of us had noticeably whiter teeth by the end of the box.  It did come with some sensitive ness the morning after some of the uses</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help whiten my teeth before my wedding. I wanted to whiten my teeth but I didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg at the dentist office for something I knew would be temporary (I drink a lot of coffee and red wine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few were a little painful as it burned the gums surrounding my teeth so I did it every other day for a while and then worked up to every day. That being said, after my gums got accustomed to it, the strips no longer became a problem. They stayed put in my mouth (although I never tried to drink with them on), I had no problems talking with them, on and were surprisingly comfortable (after the burning incident passed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth whitened by about 1 or 2 shades (this is just an estimation) and my teeth were indeed quite nice for my wedding (enough for people to notice and comment on them). I ended up not using all of them (because of the burning problem in the beginning). So, it&#x27;s nice to know that if I have an event to go to a few applications can perk up my smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is no substitute for a proper whitening at the dentist. But if you are looking for a quick perk in your color of your teeth, I would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> This is an excelent product for the tooth, I already used it about one year ago and I bought it again because my tooth get much more white and clean than it was. I really loved it, I advise everybody to buy that.</li>
    <li> These strips work great for a short period of time. I am a X smoked and my teeth are whiter than ever.</li>
    <li> I am 30 and had abused the use of coffee for several years at work so I had a slight discoloration going on with my teeth and was becoming self conscience of it.  I could not afford the dentist whitening so I thought I would try these since I had heard good things.  I used 16 days of the 20 day regime and my teeth are so white now.  (these are level 4 of the 5 levels offered)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth sensitivity got really bad toward the end and I had to stop using them even though I was only four days from the end... it was really bad.  My whole mouth was throbbing and I could barely eat or drink anything.  All of this is warned about on the package and - just as specified - all the sensitivity went away only 2 days after I stopped using.  If you can handle the sensitive teeth for a while and push through, it is definitely worth it!!  My teeth look great now.  It has been several weeks and I have had no more issues with sensitivity therefor proving there are no long term issues.  I will probably do this once a year from now on.</li>
    <li> Never take advantage of it is effective&lt;br /&gt;Conversely became my teeth very sensitive&lt;br /&gt;I regretted buying&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I do I instructions on&lt;br /&gt;But no bleaching my teeth remaine</li>
    <li> It says result will be shown in 10 days but in fact I could see the difference only in 3 days .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make another order .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it up</li>
    <li> They are great! I bought them to use before my brother&#x27;s wedding. I really saw a difference in only two days! I didn&#x27;t even go past a week before I was more than satisfied. I&#x27;ve used strips before and these were by far the lease gross/gooey. They stay on your teeth well and you can talk and continue on with your day while you wear them. I would buy again. It&#x27;s worth the money (and still so much cheaper than professional whitening! Another member of my family got their teeth whitened at the dentist for a lot more $ and had the same results I did.)</li>
    <li> It is a noticeable differnce after about a week (for me).  It just has to be part of a routine every morning and at times the inconvenience of leaving it on for 20 minutes or more as you are trying to have your morning tea or coffee or breakfast is cumbersome.  You can also do it any other time of the day, but once I got home, again was too busy for &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t do what I tried to do and wear them all night.  Oooh weee.  Your teeth may become super sensitive for a couple of days.  Silly decision on my part, but when else are you not sipping water or eating lunch and dinner?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, they work.</li>
    <li> I used these white strips, with hopes that I&#x27;d see the same results I saw a couple years ago when I tried Crest white strips. Unfortunately, I did not see the same results. There used to be just one type of Crest strips - to be worn twice a day for 30 minutes each time, for 14 days. The old strips worked beautifully, and I searched everywhere for them. But I believe Crest discontinued them, and now the only strips available are the newer &amp;#34;professional effects&amp;#34; strips. I tried the &amp;#34;3D Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips 20 count.&amp;#34; I used them exactly as directed, and unfortunately they didn&#x27;t work. I do see a slight improvement/whitening, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable, and certainly not worth the $34 I paid. The old strips were only $19.99, and they gave me a dramatic improvement/whitening every time. I wish Crest would bring the old strips back. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The strips work great. There is no slippage, and after 3 days I already saw whiter teeth. I am on day 4 now, day 20 I expect great results. Only Minor sensitivity after using it as well.</li>
    <li> This is the second strongest in the crest white line. Goes on smoothly and is a vast improvement from the ones I used 2 years ago. Was not blown away by the whiteness. Will have to try another brand or the strongest version next time.</li>
    <li> simple enough, the strips whitened my teeth, just not all that much.</li>
    <li> I saw results in as little as three days of using the strips.I was very pleased, though my teeth became a little more sensitive.</li>
    <li> I get Crest Whitestrips once a year or so to do follow-up brightening, it works well though doesn&#x27;t make teeth pure white which I wouldn&#x27;t want anyway - that looks too fake!</li>
    <li> I took a picture on day one and then again on day three. The results were amazing! I had no idea my teeth needed whitened so badly. I only use this 4 days in a row, then skip a day or two, as using it more than that causes slight sensitivity. Actually, after my initial whitening and using most of the box, I just keep a box on hand and use the strips every so often to brighten my smile. I also use Crest 3D white toothpaste.  I have recommended this to others and they have got great results as well.</li>
    <li> I used these a while ago and got tons of comments. Everyone noticed the whiteness in my teeth. The only side effect I had was sensitivity but I left them in a little bit longer on a few occasions. These work very well if you dont want to pay for professional whitening!</li>
    <li> These work pretty well. In the beginning I always had a lot of saliva built up because my mouth wasn&#x27;t used to it and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could swallow with all of the whitein stuff. After a while I stopped caring and it made it much more pleasant experience</li>
    <li> Crest white strips are worth their weight in gold. After just one application you can notice a difference. I don&#x27;t use them everyday but as maintenance to keep my teeth white. I receive compliments all the time about my smile and teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have used that I saw a difference in just a few days. It is great that it is thin, sticks well to the teeth, doesn&#x27;t ooze peroxide out, taste is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I used 4 sets of strips and got to the level of whiteness I wanted, so I stopped using them. Within a week my teeth were yellow again and I don&#x27;t drink wine or coffee. The box has like 20 sets, but I don&#x27;t want to blind people with paper-white teeth...</li>
    <li> Excellent product, grips very well, does a great job.</li>
    <li> Love it !! You can see the difference after you take it</li>
    <li> Last time I&#x27;ve used crest strips was 5 years ago, and these age great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable to use. Each sealed packet has 2 strips, 1 for the top teeth and 1 for the bottom. The strips aren&#x27;t sticky or gooey like the ones I used years ago. They sit in the mouth and don&#x27;t bother you, you can even talk (almost normally) while wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they whiten very well. I&#x27;m not even half way through the pack, and my teeth are noticeably whiter!</li>
    <li> work the first time i try it. very good product. i cant believe it work so well. it easy to wear and wont come off either.</li>
    <li> These keep up my professional whitened teeth, white.  Coffee darkens my teeth, but Crest 3D really makes them white, again.</li>
    <li> My item arrived within two days of placing the order and no less, all the way from the east coast to the west coast.  I was shocked!  Item was packaged well and received without damage.  I also received the best price around.  Many thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Price is good and it helps get your teeth white. One treatment does the job well. Go get yourself one.</li>
    <li> Crest 3d White Professional Effects Teeth Whitening strips have worked for me for a long time! Tried a test at my dentist office...tried the bleach trays and then they checked my whitening shade, only up one. Tried the white strips, went back to the dentist, compared the whitening shade, went up three. :-) Everyone asks me what I do to get my teeth so white. :-)</li>
    <li> I purchased  Crest 3d White Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Strips 20 Count and used then twice on top and bottom teeth. I am now in constant pain! My teeth hurt, I can&#x27;t put anything cold or hot near them and I am having trouble sleeping from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT use these strips again!</li>
    <li> My results were kind of...average is the word I would use, I guess. I used one box of this product with the 3D toothpaste. I did notice a little change, especially after combining with the toothpaste. My teeth appear to be a little brighter and less yellow, but nothing to go crazy over. I&#x27;m pleased enough with the results, but I suspect that two boxes might be needed to get more desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive teeth. A few times I experienced a little irritation around my gums and some teeth sensitivity issues, but nothing that was unmanageable.</li>
    <li> my teeth hurt every time i put them on. the pain only lasts a couple hours but is still an inconvenience. it does whiten though so that why i gave it some points.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as described and was surprised at how easy and comfortable the strips were to use and wear.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth looked whiter after the first use and on using as prescribed daily they are whiter than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend these, i will continue to use</li>
    <li> I recently stated using the crest 3D whitestrips with advanced seal. I used it twice and my teeth already started hurting due to the peroxide. Im pretty bummed my teeth hurt so bad because I really want to use up my strips, They did seem to brighten my teeth. Maybe ill try to get Sensodyne toothpaste and see if that helps! They do stick on great, but also made my mouth water like crazy. I truly wanted to believe in them, but the pain hurts too much.</li>
    <li> I needed to go to a wedding at the end of the month and I started using these crest whites, after 3 days, I already saw results. My teeth got sensitive once in a while but all in all, great product.</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth really sensitive after using...but it does the job only useing one box for wedding... Probably won&#x27;t use again</li>
    <li> I have used these many times before and love them every time. They whiten and brighten my teeth with each use. My teeth are a bit sensitive but these don&#x27;t cause my any pain. LOVE. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with the color of my teeth. Bad hygiene as a child has made my teeth yellow and I regretted it very much so later on. It&#x27;s uncomfortable to smile because I&#x27;ve always felt that everyone could see my yellow teeth, so I tried to avoid smiling at all costs. I&#x27;m a 19 year old who should not have insecurity problems with my teeth but I didn&#x27;t really know how to deal with it. I saw these strips on Amazon, looked at the reviews, and decided to give them a try. I didn&#x27;t have much to lose, other than the $40 I splurged on these strips. I was really excited to try them out, but had to lower my enthusiasm because there was always the possibility of the strips not working for me. I put them on right away, and was surprised at how comfortable they felt. The taste is bad but I got used to it after a few uses. Luckily, my teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive at all and these strips didn&#x27;t cause me any discomfort at all, other than the first few days when I put them on. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t notice a significant change in the color of my teeth. Yes, they do appear a bit whiter, but not more than that. Judging by the reviews everywhere, I thought I&#x27;d see more of a change and was disappointed when I did not. I don&#x27;t drink coffee, tea, or soda, so maybe it has more to do with my bad hygiene as a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to finish up the whole package before writing my review, so I could be more sure of the results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy another pack, to see if the change would be more significant then.&lt;br /&gt;Will update when I&#x27;m through with those as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO: Do not use these strips more than once a day. I tried the maximum, which was 2 and they made me feel a bit of pain throughout the night and the day after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22. I have health teeth. But after using it my teeth pains a lot after drink ice water! It do make my teeth look better but I feel my teeth are thinner! Not recommand at all!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son, he loved it, and noticed results with just a few apllications. Also, his first time using, and had no sensitivity!</li>
    <li> worked well noticable whitening. will do again in 6 mos. as recommended.</li>
    <li> Whitens teeth with no sensitivity problems</li>
    <li> Difference is not dramatic</li>
    <li> really works, but a little sensitive as well</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve used this with good results each time.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and did a good job whiting my teeth.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  I could see a result with one use.  Not messy like other teeth whitening products I have used which have been unpleasant.  You can put them on and go.  Very Pleased.</li>
    <li> amaaazing!! Worked so well and it&#x27;s so easy!!</li>
    <li> Works OK. Not great.  More than one box needed .</li>
    <li> Good price and prime shipping</li>
    <li> Not sure if it is my teeth or the strips but they didn&#x27;t get as white as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using the Crest White Strips.  These are much improved over the old ones.  They really stick to your teeth so you can talk and move your lips without worrying if they&#x27;ll move or fall off your teeth.  They do make my teeth really sensitive, but using the Sensodyne toothpaste helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my dental hygienist recommended it.  My teeth have lost a lot of their luster over the years and were beginning to yellow. She had some success with the white strips so she suggested I try them before I invest in professional whitening.  I guess I was hoping for a miracle whitener.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  I followed the product specifications and wore the strips daily for 20 consecutive days but I really don&#x27;t notice a big change.  I also used a whitening rinse but even used in combination with the strips there were minimal results.  The product did say it could be used twice a year so I may give it another try but all in all it did not meet my hopes for a whiter smile.</li>
    <li> The strips definitely made a difference. I don&#x27;t know about 4 shades but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable. Ill try again and see what happens</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away after using these white strips. However, I have to stop every so days for a break because my teeth are so sensitive. If you get these, make sure you brush you teeth VERY well after using.</li>
    <li> These worked great for me, although I get sensitivity with all bleaching products. I noticed a difference in three days and I&#x27;m so happy when I see my smile in a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have trouble with pain and sensitivity while using these, you can get a desensitizing gel made by Opalescence from a dentist for $40 to use in conjunction with the WhiteStrips.</li>
    <li> Do not use as often as I should!  Or as long as I should, might not be the product for me.</li>
    <li> The product suggests to press the strip for 2-3 seconds onto the surface of your teeth, but I don&#x27;t do that. It grips extremely well just lightly tapping down the edges of the strips to my teeth. Don&#x27;t apply immediately after you&#x27;ve brushed your teeth either. I find it makes my teeth more sensitive.</li>
    <li> I had never tried any teeth whitening products before this product, and I can honestly say that I probably won&#x27;t need to, as the Crest 3d strips did a very good job whitening my teeth. In my case, increased whitening was noticeable after about a week of use, and the effects lasted for some time (several months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star from the review because there is some discomfort in using the strips. The strips are pretty easy to apply, and they stick on your teeth pretty well, but some may not like the synthetic smell of the gel. Also, some people will experience more sensitivity than others, and for me it wasn&#x27;t too bad, although there were occasions when the sensitivity could be a little uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One lesson in tooth sensitivity that I learned while using these strips: DO NOT fall asleep while wearing these things. I know it sounds stupid, but I once accidentally took a 3-hour nap while wearing the strips (instructions say to remove after ~30 minutes). Needless to say, when I awoke from my much-needed slumber my teeth felt like icicles. It was like biting down on a piece of super-cold metal, and clenching your teeth on it for a few minutes--not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than some sensitivity (and my little mishap), I would highly recommend these strips for someone looking to whiten up their teeth.</li>
    <li> This worked wonderfully! My teeth are definitely 2 shades whiter after using the strips. I recommend this strength over the lower ones, especially if you want to see results.</li>
    <li> i got it on time and it was as i wanted. i used i feel good about it. i can see the effect of it. thank you</li>
    <li> Great product. This is the first time, other than whitening toothpaste, that I have tried a teeth whitening product. I noticed a difference in the color of my teeth within days. The strips were easy to apply. They took a little getting used to at first, but after a few days it was second nature. At first the strips made my mouth salivate, or get a little foamy because I wasn&#x27;t used to having something over my teeth. With the extra saliva the strips tended to move easily. I have to be careful when applying. But like I said, this went away after a few days. I will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> these strips work well - ish.  they did whiten my teeth, but not as much as the product would suggest. and that was with 3D whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I needed to whiten my few natural teeth to better match my partial and now there is not such a big difference.  Very happy, indeed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;My friends like it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for my friends and family&lt;br /&gt;It reach in time&lt;br /&gt;Will I will order again</li>
    <li> First of all, I have decently white teeth to begin with; however, I&#x27;ve used only four of the strips and they are already at least a shade lighter! As the package says you can begin to expect change after the third treatment, which is exactly what happened to me. I have sensitive teeth so I was expected there to be much more pain, but it is definitely bearable. I started using Sensodyne the day before and am using to brush my teeth 3-4 times a day. I was skeptical to use these after using the cheap daily strips a few years ago but these are completely different, they actually stick to the teeth and whiten. Definitely worth the investment and am already feeling more confident!</li>
    <li> This performs as promised, there is a noticeable difference even after 2 treatments.  Watch for sensitivity through.  A friend told me to brush with sensitive toothpaste a week or two  BEFORE beginning treatments to make sure teeth won&#x27;t hurt.  Even if it does, the sensitivity isn&#x27;t bad, and goes away in a day or two.</li>
    <li> The strips are easy to use and work better than advertised. I can put them on and continue to conduct my business and talk to clients without difficulty. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> At first, I was a bit hesitant about buying the product due to its side effect of sensitivity. I&#x27;m on day 9 (9th pair of strips) and I must say, they do not create ANY sensitivity for me, but such side effects are always subjective to the individual&#x27;s own physiology. They definitely DO whiten your teeth. At my 9th day, I can significantly tell that there is a difference. The two front teeth I have are differently shaded; one being a bit more yellow-ish tinted than the other. After using this product, my teeth are uniformly more whitened and clean looking. I leave them on for 30 mins. a day, and set up an alarm that goes off for me once 30 mins is up. During the mean time of waiting, I usually watch television or just listen and watch youtube videos to pass the time. I can say that this product DOES whiten your smile. Another thing I was hesitant about was the potential of whitening your teeth. My teeth aren&#x27;t THAT yellow, nor is it the right shade of white I wanted it to be, and so far, the progression of whitening my teeth has been satisfying. It does not hurt for me and it whitens your teeth at the fraction of a cost in comparison to whitening at the orthodontist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 5/12/13&lt;br /&gt;After reaching strip #11, I finally began to feel that sensitivity/ache that most users were talking about.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the strips for about a day or two, and the aching was gone. The aching wasn&#x27;t as bad as i expected it to be. It really wasn&#x27;t that painful.</li>
    <li> These strips work within the first few times. Unfortunately, I have been too busy and too tired to put them on consistently every night but when I do, they whiten fast! Within two days of putting them on, I noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> Within three days my teeth are already whiter. I love Crest Whitesetrips and have been using them for years. These are great as they really adhere to your teeth. I can only do them three days on...two days off, otherwise my teeth get too sensitive. I only need one box every 1 year to 1 1/2 years..of course I am not a coffee drinker, but i do drink red wine, which is where most of my stains come from. I havent tried the crest whitestrips that are one level above this, but i honestly don&#x27;t think it would create that much of a difference for me to pay the extra $10-20 more.</li>
    <li> Are you supposed to use this before brushing your teeth or after brushing.</li>
    <li> Definitely it is best product in the market. It was my second time using the whitestrips. This time I started to use Sensodyne 2 weeks before and I had no sensibility. Great result, I recommend.</li>
    <li> Did nothing to my teeth, will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and it really whitens your teeth. I only use once a month now just to maintain the pearly whites.</li>
    <li> Touch up kind of whitening</li>
    <li> Really made a difference in my daughter&#x27;s teeth. They were gray/brown due to illness as a baby and dentist didn&#x27;t want to bleach them so early (13). These strips helped tremendously. Lightened her teeth considerably...brought back her smile!</li>
    <li> I used them twice daily with no side effects and the results were very rewarding.  This is a product that met or exceeded my expectations for the purpose for which I purchased them.</li>
    <li> These Whitestrips were my savior 1 month before my wedding.  White teeth like never before without the huge price tag. When my teeth became sensitive after 3 or 4 days continuous use, I paused for a day or two and resumed.  I would recommend but for folks who have strong enamel. I can see how sensitive teeth might be painful.</li>
    <li> Definitely does not work. Makes teeth hurt for days while keeping them the same color.</li>
    <li> Actually only got my teeth to where most people would start using it. I&#x27;m 75.  Sending for refund.</li>
    <li> They work, but they don&#x27;t work. Guess not as great as I thought they would. Oh well</li>
    <li> My teeth are extremely sensitive and within a few days my teeth are killing me, but theres no doubt these work incredibly. Even though its painful i&#x27;m still doing them haha. Love these!</li>
    <li> I apparently have more sensitive teeth than I thought. After a few days, my mouth was so uncomfortable I ran out for sensodyne and had to take lots of ibuprofen to dull the pain. I gave them away and the new user was pleased with the result.</li>
    <li> These work great. To reduce sensitivity, I cut the strips in half and only apply it to the outer surface. Plus you get more out of the product :)</li>
    <li> No Gel, All Glue. No Results</li>
    <li> Great!  Burns a little.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest White Strips for years but feel like the classic strips which are no longer available are just as effective and only half the cost.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one that has worked for me.  I drink a lot of coffee, and other products didn&#x27;t do it.  Very easy to apply and remove.</li>
    <li> In fact it did whiten my teeth quite a bit. I loved it the first day! But after I used it second day my teeth sensitivity went through the roof. It was such an awful feeling I never used any of the strips again. I am thinking maybe to try using it every other day....but for now I am still recovering from experience. Will try to update my review whenever I try to use it every other day.</li>
    <li> The reason I gave this review is that after  3 or 4 uses my teeth are extremely sensitive. I did read the reviews and saw how some people experienced sensitivity. Everything was going great but after the third day, my teeth were hurting so bad. Even a little breeze was enough to feel excruciating pain.  After a day or two of not using it everything went back to normal. I decided to try it again but this time the pain was worse. Till this day my teeth are really sensitive. On the plus side it did whitened my teeth a little. I wish I could have completed the treatment to see how white they would be but the pain was too much.</li>
    <li> They work! Very efficient</li>
    <li> I was amazed how quickly these strips whitened my teeth, BUT be warned, it may make your teeth hurt. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, so I wasn&#x27;t worried, and the first few times I had no problem. However, I woke up one morning after using these the night before and my teeth were severely uncomfortable. It happened again every so often after that. If your teeth start to hurt, I recommend using these every other night and taking them off as soon as the 30 minutes is up, not a minute over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - It works great, but be prepared to be a little uncomfortable occasionally.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my wife; she said It was okay, but thought her teeth should have been a little whiter.</li>
    <li> My stedaughter was very pleased with this product and would recommend it to friends and family. This product was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Although the white strips did noticeably whiten my teeth they burned my gums and after two weeks I noticed that my gums had receded... permanently.</li>
    <li> makes my teeth pretty white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what else can you really ask for?  burns sometimes when i use it a few days in a row.</li>
    <li> I used these strips exactly as instructed for the full 20 days, and saw only a tiny improvement that no one else would be able to notice. My teeth were not badly yellowed to begin with (no smoking, no coffee, some wine), so that may be part of the problem. The taste is strange, and the strips did cause a slight amount of sensitivity, but I didn&#x27;t dock stars for that because I was clearly warned about it, and the pain only lasts for a second. Overall, I would suggest you spend the money and get a professional job if teeth whitening is that important. I leave this at 2 stars because I reserve 1 star ratings for when I believe the company is acting dishonestly or the product is dangerous, which is not the case for this product.</li>
    <li> I feel comfortable reviewing this, even though my new kit is unopened, because I&#x27;ve used it within the past year. My new order is sitting unopened, because I&#x27;m trying to get over the traumatic experience of the last time I used it. The main thing you need understand is that these whitening strips WILL WHITEN your teeth, considerably and in a short period of time; HOWEVER, it may be at a cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m needing to whiten my teeth, again, and I trust the results I&#x27;d gotten from these strips in the past..... except..... I&#x27;m having a hard time building up the &amp;#34;nerve&amp;#34;(lol) to open this kit. I look at the box and think back of unpin-pointed searing pain in my gums/teeth, sleepless nights comprised of sharp jolts of pain extending to the rest of my body, and teeth that were sensitive to just about anything that was the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; temperature. Not joking when I say the pain lasted for about a month, after I stopped, and was very intermittent/came and went whenever it felt. I swear to you, there were nights when I was too scared to go to sleep because I didn&#x27;t want to deal with panic attacks after being pulled out of my sleep by phantom jolts of excruciating pain.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend~~really whitens like professional dental whitening.  Only concern it  that the receipt printed from computer will be honored for the $10 off rebate offer on this product seeing the $10 off rebate was mentioned on your site for sale of this product.</li>
    <li> The one star is for Crest, not product itself.  I got my white strips through amazon and sent a rebate form attached in the Amazon website to Crest.  Today, I received a letter from Crest saying that they can&#x27;t offer a rebate since the receipt that I submitted shows that I used an in-store coupon while purchasing my box.  I did NOT use an in-store coupon.  It was straight from Amazon.  I will contact them and hope I can straighten this out but this is a bit annoying.  Such a hassle!</li>
    <li> The new design is great - I have used Crest strips for several years to keep my teeth from yellowing.  Good product.  These are a definite improvement from the basic strips - easier to be applied and they stay in place.  The strips do NOT move once applied.  You can talk and drink while wearing them - no more worry about them slipping off.  You can see a difference in 3 days - using them once a day.  You can use them when you notice a slight yellowing and bring your smile back to a pleasing white.</li>
    <li> I use these once yearly and always get compliments on the results. Fairly hassle free to apply and non-irritating for me as long as I avoid letting them touch my gums. Delivery was prompt and the price was super reasonable -- a little less than in the discount big box store factoring in the free shipping offer that I took advantage of. Delivery so convenient!</li>
    <li> Half way done 10/20 treatments and I love them. Teeth are better looking and noticeable</li>
    <li> This for me, is by far the best of the best!  It really does the job!  Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I saw noticeable but not overly dramatic results.  Process was easy and painless.  Strips adhered well and were a cinch to apply.  Will definitely try them again in 6 months.</li>
    <li> I was scared about the secondary effects but, it really works perfect, is very good product and of course the brand is a good one, the strips are easy to put and it holds perfect in the mounth.</li>
    <li> These strips were recommended to me by my dentist.  I found that they do indeed work and work well.  My smile is much brighter than before.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time spending all that money on Name Brand products click this link for natural, cheap and effective whitening products. [...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an ex-smoker of 36 years.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my teeth paid the price...I looked like I had a mouth full of buttered popcorn!&lt;br /&gt;But, after using one (1) box of these whitening strips, 30+ years of yellowing just disappeared!!&lt;br /&gt;Now, the only reason I&#x27;m not giving five stars is, I had a tooth replaced. It&#x27;s base color, a light brown, now shows in a row of white. It tends to &amp;#34;stand out&amp;#34;, and be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know of a way, short of returning to the dentist, how I can &amp;#34;re-whiten&amp;#34; this fake brown tooth?</li>
    <li> Not my first time using this product so i wasn&#x27;t surprised with the results. it&#x27;s a wonderful product, gives great results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different teeth whitening strip and Crest really is the best to go with! They do actually work and they don&#x27;t hurt/burn your teeth/gums while you wear them. I did notice some increased sensitivity so I only wore the strips once a day and that worked out well.</li>
    <li> I had little expectations when I ordered these because I was not a beleiver that these actually worked. Well they did, my husband noticed right away teeth were looking alot whiter. I would definately recommend them, and buy them again.</li>
    <li> whitened my teeth and only 30 minutes a day!! A lot cheaper than going to the dentist for this treatment</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, I am very pleased with the Crest strips.  I NEVER want to undergo teeth whitening procedure in my dentist office...and I really trust my dentist.  The Crest strips help gentley lighten and I feel less guilty  with each coffee/tea I consume!</li>
    <li> I received my product like a week ago and used it 4 times so far and I think my teeth look slightly whiter than before. The first two days it was really painful but then I kinda got used to it. I will update later!</li>
    <li> This is my third package of Crest White Strips.  I started with the 14 count, but realized I needed a little more time, so the 20 count was perfect for my needs.  The whitening lasts for months, but I would recommend using the other Crest whitening products (toothpaste, mouth rinse) for upkeep.  I also recommend not overdoing it.  Twice per year (every 6 months) is enough to keep your teeth looking white and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I ordered these white strips before my wedding so my smile would be bright and white! I used them for about three weeks before. I have sensitive teeth and was not able to use them for the recommended time/frequency. There were suggestions to reduce the frequency if you have sensitive teeth and I did. They still worked great and I felt like I had a white confident smile for the big day!</li>
    <li> ive been using these since i was 13 (im now 19) , its the only thing that truly works. I tried other strips and trays and they were more painful and less effective. I love these whitestrips , its the simplest , affordable way to remove stains!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended  by a coleague whose teeth I admired. I tried it myself and I believe it is the best product so far. The results are visible and although I get a little sensitivity one day after I used the strips it is worthed the pain.  I&#x27;m happy I found this product because I drink a lot of coffee and this are so affordable. Only regret: I wish this was available in Europe as well.</li>
    <li> When I have gone to the dentist for cleaning the last couple visits after using the Crest Professional Strips my Orthodontist has commented on how white my teeth are and asked if I used a whitener. I only need to use them a couple days and the stains go away and my teeth look great so I don&#x27;t usually do the full 7 days. I also leave them on for an hour instead of 1/2 hour. The instructions say if you do not experience any sensitivity you can do this. Use these instead of the less expensive Crest whiteners because you actually save money due to how effective they are.</li>
    <li> So, I am halfway through using the product, and the sensitivity hasn&#x27;t been that much of a negative. I have always had issues with sensitivity to whitening treatments, but I haven&#x27;t had so much with this. I found that using fluoride rinse helps, and I did cut down how hard I brushed because there was some sensitivity (may not be the best thing, but at least my gums are not killing me). At this point, the whitening is satisfactory. Although, I am halfway through the cycle, I expected to see more of a difference (like I did with the Listerine strips that they discontinued). The result hasn&#x27;t been extremely noticeable, but there is indeed some sort of a difference.</li>
    <li> The pieces of plastic the strips were attached to would frequently come off for the ride when I tried to take one of the strips off, and would prove nearly impossible to remove.  Other strips wouldn&#x27;t stick to my teeth whatsoever (which were never brushed first as the instructions told me to do) and had to be throw out.  It seems like my teeth have become whiter, but I did not get what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I am a coffee, tea and red wine drinker.  For years, I did nothing about my teeth and admittedly, they were looking a bit yellow.  A good friend of mine pointed out the Whitestrips to me and indicated that I might want to try them.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything until about the third application, then WOW!  My teeth looked so much better and whiter!!  I now use these once a week (and still continue to drink coffee, tea and red wine), but the weekly application keeps my teeth in great shape, to the point where I get compliments on them from time to time.  I now have a subscription through Amazon for them; worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pricey, but worth it. Apply it twice and you&#x27;ll see a significant difference. Every month or so I do 2 more applications. Doing it in 2&#x27;s gives you a great confidence boost without making you beam like Ross Gellar. One box will last you a while, so it&#x27;s worth the investment. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with sensitivity like some other reviewers, and I would describe myself as having sensitive teeth. I also didn&#x27;t have any problems with gum-bleaching either. I love this product!</li>
    <li> too much money for what little results you get.  that&#x27;s just a simple fact.  they are robbing us with these results... back in the day the products were stronger for cheaper. now there are 8million different strengths at 50million different prices. It is ridiculous.  this product is supposed to be the best and strongest and it doesn&#x27;t compare to the strength of the original product released years ago before they realized we could be raped by big business. I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used professional dentist-made trays / gels before.  Those work great, but cost a ton!  I decided to give these a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;ve used 10 of the 20 treatments and could easily stop now.  They are strong and have whitened my teeth drastically.  My only warning is that they obviously can make your teeth sensitive.  This happened to me after 5 treatments.  I simply stopped for 2 days and it quickly resolved and I resumed treatments.  Overall, I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I love the way it stays put and doesn&#x27;t slide around! I use it weekly to keep on top of my dentist&#x27;s efforts</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product because it is the best thing out there to whiten teen. I use it every year, since the first time i bough it. I could not believe the results. Its a small price to pay for a bright smile then going to a American dentist (they are very expensive). Try it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only gone through the first 5 days of this treatment, but it is already achieving the effects I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some stains from smoking on my bottom teeth, which have faded significantly, and are almost gone already. My teeth are also significantly whiter than they were - I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use the treatment for the full 20 days, since I&#x27;m not looking for my teeth to look unnaturally white, just to remove the staining from years of smoking, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I&#x27;ve definitely gotten what I wanted. I&#x27;ll likely save the last half of them, and do another treatment in 6 months to a year or so!</li>
    <li> My mom used these, she had never whitened her teeth before (whitestrips or dentist professional) and she saw a big difference. Shes a coffee drinker and has had only minimal work done to her teeth. She was so impressed that she bought another pack for herself and one for my father! It truly works and is a cheap alternative to professional dental whitening.</li>
    <li> I was fully planning to take my teen (who had requested a brighter smile) to get a $400 treatment at our dentist&#x27;s office. It was suggested that we try these first, which we did. The result of only half of this box was pretty amazing. My dd told me she experienced a little sensitivity (that faded away after a few days) but was very happy with the result, as was I. I would highly recommend these for a little lightening and brightening.</li>
    <li> My girls received a box each and they are very happy girls. It is easy to apply and worth it to be able to smile with confidence. Thanks</li>
    <li> Our whole family loves this product --- it&#x27;s easy to use and provides noticeable results. Economical and more effective than some other whitening strips we&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, you can see the change in short time, but be careful if you have sensitive teeth, you can feel some hurt in your teeth</li>
    <li> Lots of salivating while these are on my teeth. Keep near a sink... A mail in rebate came along with this product</li>
    <li> These strips work very well if you follow the directions.  They are easy to apply and stay on well for the allotted time interval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend thid product.</li>
    <li> I purchased a whitening gel prior to buying the Crest Whitestrips. Though the gel was dentist strength, it was hard keeping the gel away from your gums because the mouth piece sucked! Whitestrips are definitely more convenient and I used almost the whole package, whereas the gel I hardly finished half a syringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take several sessions before you notice a difference, but you WILL see the difference, just be patient! I had no issues with sensitivity when paired with Sensodyne. Yes it gets foamy but it beats holding your smile in place for 30 mins with the gel sitting on your exposed teeth. Teeth whitening is never easy, so if you want whiter teeth, youre going to have to suck it up and deal with the negative aspects of whichever method you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Invisalign now, and I still used them before I got my attachments. When I get my attachments removed at the end of my Invisalign process, I will repurchase and use these strips again and again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  So many people have given it good reviews.  I have just a few strips left, and I am not entirely satified.  Has it helped?  Yes, but I think I either need another box to get my results or these just aren&#x27;t strong enough.  I think the best bet is to go to your dentist.  Most dentists will whiten your teeth for $100.  This package was over $40.  So you do the math.</li>
    <li> After the 15 strip or so, my teeth are sensitive, but they are pretty white, so im happy with the results</li>
    <li> not as good as whitestrips Supreme FlexFit</li>
    <li> After the 7th or 8th strip, the pain for me was unbearable. I didn&#x27;t have sensitive teeth when I started to use these stripes.</li>
    <li> These work great! I have the gel that my dentist prescribed, and these work better than that!  Definitely will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; from now on.</li>
    <li> I believe you would be just as satisfied using Hydrogen Peroxide as a daily mouth wash for whitening. The Whitestrips might work a bit, but you will not be amazed.</li>
    <li> My teeth are white...trust me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work as advertised.</li>
    <li> These can and do work, but there are several factors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They are very expensive.  Roughly $35 to $40 a box, and even occasional $5-$10 coupons don&#x27;t ease the cost too much.  (You all should also know that these are one of the most STOLEN items, next to electronics and alcohol.  Common sense tells you why..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You have to use them on going.  If a few strips or even one box made everybody&#x27;s teeth pearly white, the product would never have an ongoing business.  You have to use them religiously, and then do &amp;#34;maintaining.&amp;#34;  Again - see above.  This requires quite an investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The product is much more convenient than say the &amp;#34;trays of opalescence&amp;#34; (which also do work over time, but they are messy and awkward).  That is also why you are paying more for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Can cause sensitivity for some people, sometimes mild, sometimes extreme.  This can usually go away in a few hours, but, it can be painful for that time being.  You have to weigh everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Obviously, not everybody has perfect straight teeth where the strips will attach and lay evenly.  Technically, in my opinion you don&#x27;t necessarily have to have perfect white teeth all the way in the back sides of your mouth (nobody sees those anyways), but for people like myself who are also nit-pickers, the strips will fit different people DIFFERENTLY.  For people with very bad, crooked teeth, you may get very little out of these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  Most importantly - very few people have perfect, PERFECT white teeth in the world, not even babies.  The people you see on the cable news channels, movie stars, commercial people, soap stars, etc all have airbrushing done, or they have veneers or lumineers.  You have to have some degree of realistic-ness, too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying a box - it is an investment.  If it works and is comfortable for you, try another box in time if you see results.  If you don see any, I would look at other options.tions.</li>
    <li> whitening is ok, but they do not stick to the teeth well.</li>
    <li> First off I had absolutely no success with the strips.  Getting them to stay on my teeth is a hassle and they burn my gums if I get them even touching the slightest bit.  I&#x27;ve had far better success using dental trays with cheap peroxide gel.  I also get my teeth professionally whitened every couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is their rebate policy.  Both a friend and myself had an issue.  If you apply any discounts to your order, even subscribe and save, they will not honor the rebate.  I do a lot of rebates, and this is the only company that has ever done that to me.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use with my wife. I can say that the results were great for me, but not so great for her. She couldn&#x27;t use these due to the discomfort/pain these caused for her teeth. I had no such issues and got great results. If these don&#x27;t cause you any pain/discomfort, I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> It worked as advertised. I am pleased with the whitening results and it was pleasant to use. I will use again when necessary.</li>
    <li> After 5 uses, my teeth are clearly whiter. But the sensitivity that comes and lasts nearly 24 hours after every use is a drawback (talking hurts a little). I use this product in combination with the glamorous toothpaste and mouth cleanser. They help alleviate the pain a tad.</li>
    <li> I mean you can&#x27;t go wrong with crest white strips. I have been using them for years.</li>
    <li> My teeth were in need of whiting and after 2 days of using this product i can already see some results. I reccomend this product if you&#x27;re looking for safe teeth whiting</li>
    <li> I havent rêcived it for 1 month. Very dissapoint. Send it to me again immediately, I need it before Uwednesday 28 th Jul</li>
    <li> This was a big disappointment. When I opened the first pack they seemed wet inside. I thought maybe it was a fluke but after opening several, I noticed they were all that way. I then checked the due date and found they were over a year past due. A total rip off.</li>
    <li> For the price, it works well. I did notice my teeth whitened after a few uses, though there were some spots whiter than others.. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth like other reviewers, but it actually bothers the tip of my tongue near the strips! The irritation is mild, and usually goes away by the next day.</li>
    <li> When I use these strips, people actually notice a difference, which is exactly what they&#x27;re for. It&#x27;s impressive when people who see you every day or at least very frequently notice a difference because that means it&#x27;s really making your teeth a lot whiter. Really easy to use. I like these a lot better than the first iteration a few years ago. They stay on your teeth a lot better now. I put them in in the morning as I&#x27;m getting ready, showering, etc. and after half an hour they come out &amp; then brush your teeth &amp; done!</li>
    <li> Ive gotten compliments on people noticing how white my teeth are since ive started using them so I think they are working.&lt;br /&gt;was a little bummed that the time you are supposed to leave them on is half an hour plus. its not terrible but awkward.&lt;br /&gt;but definite results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved CREST white strips. They always work on me. Normally I will just do it like once or twice a month because you leave it on for 30 minutes and it makes my teeth SO SENSITIVE!!!!! If you don&#x27;t do it everyday, you&#x27;ll be fine. You can always start with it once a week and then add more if your teeth can handle it.</li>
    <li> After being referred to this product, I had high hopes.  The product does appear to work for various portions of the tooth (typically the upper portion near the gums).  That being said, the side effects can be horrendous.  The sensitive teeth in the entire mouth after utilizing this product for more than three days outweighed the product&#x27;s effectiveness.  This sensitivity lasts several days after stopping the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One disclosure that should be made clear on this box [or in the description, in all fairness] is that persons with cardiac issues should proceed with caution.  The main ingredient in this product is known to cause/worsen cardiac arrhythmia.  I wish I had done my research ahead of time.  Unfortunately, my arrhythmia worsened for two days.  Once I stopped the product (for two days), I converted back to normal rhythm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product with two stars for the mere fact that it has some effectiveness; but, the rating is low based on the poor communication to the consumer of the risks.</li>
    <li> The first Crest Whitening Strip product I had tried was the Crest 3d White GENTLE Routine Teeth Whitening Strips 28 Count. These had absolutely no effect and costed me over $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I saw Crest was having a $10 rebate promo for Professional Effects, and I saw all the great reviews other people had, I decided to give these strips a try. I&#x27;ve only used half of the box and my teeth are noticeably whiter. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results! I like that I can save the other half for use at a later time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE:&lt;br /&gt;My P&amp;G rebate went through successfully, so in the end I only paid ~$24 for this product. (Cheaper than GENTLE, which costed over $30)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SENSITIVITY:&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that these strips would hurt, because I experienced some sensitivity with the GENTLE routine. But surprisingly I had no pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;These strips stick firmly to your teeth and are much better than the GENTLE strips, which would move around in my mouth a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend your money on the gentler treatments because they have no results. My experience with GENTLE was discouraging but after using Professional Effects, I can&#x27;t deny the results. They work!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely makes your teeth white but it makes it very sensitive; well at least for me. I would NOT recommend to whiten as frequently as they say. I whiten about 2 times a week. Great product but has a price.</li>
    <li> I love these, they do help my teeth become whiter, I waish that I could use them all the time, but my teeth are really sensitive so I have to take breaks, But I&#x27;m fixing to buy more! Thanks</li>
    <li> love it.. but the teeth ace wont let me sleep :(</li>
    <li> I was fairly skeptical of these at first. However, after two weeks the difference was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth did get sensitive after the first week, so I swapped to every other night and continued that. Still works how I expected and the white is lasting. I have not used this product in about a month and the color has been the same. I will probably use this every other month in the future.</li>
    <li> This thinga have a good price on amazon they work awesome much cheaper than getting a dentist whitening and almost as good</li>
    <li> These adhere to teeth much better than the previous kind, and made a measurable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  Even a crown looked whiter.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before, but this time I had to use more of them to get the same whitening.  Maybe because I&#x27;m older...?!</li>
    <li> I drink a lot of tea and coffee. Plus I eat a lot of blueberries. So I am prone to staining of my teeth. I use these periodically and they work fabulous! Beautiful teeth in 30 minutes. And I do not have problems with my teeth hurting afterward. But I do use Sensidyne Enamel building toothpaste as well.</li>
    <li> they really whiten, but i have slightly sensitive teeth so it bother me.</li>
    <li> great product, cant beat this  price</li>
    <li> See a great difference</li>
    <li> it really painfull after use fell like am losing teeth never purchased again</li>
    <li> These work pretty good.  Teeth some times get a little sensitive while on the program.</li>
    <li> Amazon provides these at such a great price in comparison to the local CVS stores. I love them and they work like wonders!</li>
    <li> I saw a definite improvement after 2 weeks of use. The difference wasn&#x27;t dramatic, but honestly I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be. The only downside was that my teeth were SLIGHTLY (ever so slightly) sensitive for half an hour after each use.</li>
    <li> This is very good and worked more than I expected. It&#x27;s really a professional result.</li>
    <li> I saw some difference in my teeth. It does make my teeth sensitive so I only use two a week or one a week.</li>
    <li> ouch.... pain is beauty... wear them every other day, and they stay on so well.</li>
    <li> The whitening works fast.. I could tell a difference in the color of my teeth in just one use. I would recommend this product to anyone. Great Product and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> These white strips are amazing! They make your teeth super white! I only need to use 10 and usually save the other half for next time! Most def worth it!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for our son who has tooth damage from the antibiotics he took as a young child that include yellowing and stirations. I learned of these strips from a couple whose daughter also had this problem and she was cured by using these particular strips for 60 days. I consequently asked our son, Greg, to try them for 60 days. Unfortunately he had an allergic reaction after using them for only 7 days. I have asked him to try them again at 7 day intervals and report on his results. I have not had another report as yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited that these would do the trick since having the teeth resurfaced would have cost about $1,000 per tooth. Maybe someone would like to research this at the company.</li>
    <li> Love these. Much whiter teeth!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a coffee lover who uses whitening products day-to-day when I can (i.e. toothpaste, gum, floss). Still, my lovely caffeinated drinks leave my teeth with a bit of a dingy shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these Whitestrips about a year ago to amazing effect. I recently ordered them again and am in the process of using them as I type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are staggering. Even only 5 strips (uses) in, the whitening becomes noticeable. The only investment on my part has been the affordable price of Amazon and 30 minutes per use. Since my teeth aren&#x27;t overly sensitive, I even apply the Whitestips twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limit your exposure to coffee, red wine, etc. and your smile will shine.</li>
    <li> After using them I started to love my smile actually , they are amazing and they get the job done ❤️ ..</li>
    <li> Could really see a difference.</li>
    <li> Fast whitening but results unfortunately faded too soon.</li>
    <li> It creates discomfort for my teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth were visibly white after first application (I drink a lot of coffee, however); I do experience a fair amount of teeth sensitivity for 24 hours application. I would say 5/10 in terms of discomfort.</li>
    <li> Did not work as advertised. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Bottom portion of the treatment had no adhesive. Product could not be applied correctly.</li>
    <li> Good product. Was not abrasive</li>
    <li> did not notice a difference yet (not completed the program)</li>
    <li> In addition to twice daily brushing, flossing and water piking, I have tried all the over the counter whitening methods.  Pens, trays, lights all provided some whitening, but none were as effective as 3 weeks of the 3D Crest strips.  I was unable to tolerate the Zoom treatment because of extreme sensitivity, but these Crest strips have done a great job.  I have noticed that several of my friends (we are 65+) have graying or yellowing teeth, and they just don&#x27;t  look nice.  My teeth are a beautiful and natural white, and are a very sensible alternative to the extremely expensive veneers.</li>
    <li> Okay product, but I waited and waited for it to arrive in the mail.  After about three weeks, I had to cancel the order.  I did receive a prompt refund from Amazon.  I bought this product at a local retailer, tried it and liked it okay.  I did not notice a big difference in the whiteness of my teeth, maybe 1 shade lighter, but I didn&#x27;t have any ill effects either.  Not sure if I would purchase this product again as the price does not justify the barely noticeable outcome.</li>
    <li> Whitestrips arrived on time.  Box was not rigid.  It was bent on some parts, but recipient was happy with it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe there are any negative reviews for this product. This is the most noticeable and affordable whitening product I have used. My teeth are sensitive, but just switching to every other day fixed that.</li>
    <li> It worked very well.  Just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Does a great job whitening and doesn&#x27;t give me sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Did not enjoyed using it much. I think i would see a different illumination of shading for my yellow teeth. Did not remove the stains i was hoping for. I might go see dentist for them white my teeth, but dont want to spend big bucks to have it done.</li>
    <li> The strips arrived as promised and were in great condition</li>
    <li> Tried every whitening gel the dentists offers without any success then tried these!! Whitestrips are the only thing that works for me.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and a heavy STRONG/BOLD coffee and tea drinker, along with a cigarette habit (I know, I know... bad!!).&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these strips were the first ones I&#x27;ve tried to ever make a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Rembrandt, other Crest strips and other brands that escape me right now, previously.&lt;br /&gt;My sisters and my children all noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASY to use and they stayed on tight until I took them off.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any irritation, except for a mild uncomfortable feeling for the first 2 days, after that I guess my mouth got used to them.</li>
    <li> I spent a night in totally agony after using the 2 hour 3D Whitestrips. It was unbelievable pain, like the dentist was zinging your nerves over and over and over.... Horrible!! Tylenol did not even begin to touch the pain. While I was unable to sleep from the endless pain, I got on the internet and found that TONS of people have had this same excruciating experience. Nice! Thanks to Crest for continuing to sell these despite obviously knowing the risk. AND, the added bonus is that my teeth didn&#x27;t look remarkably whiter. I&#x27;ve used the 20 minute version with no problem, but I would never recommend these to anyone! Use them at your own risk, or be smart and don&#x27;t use them!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 5 days and I&#x27;m already noticing results.  My teeth aren&#x27;t super white but they&#x27;re definitely improved, and I&#x27;ve still got 15 treatments left.  The sticker-y strip is kind of unpleasant and your mouth tastes gross for a while if you don&#x27;t brush your teeth, but it&#x27;s not too bad.  Sensitivity isn&#x27;t too big of an issue; I only notice it when drinking something cold or chewing minty gum.  These aren&#x27;t perfect but they definitely do work.</li>
    <li> These strips do a fabulous job of whitening teeth. I am trying to maintain with the 3D white toothpaste and mouthwash. So far, so good. Maybe I am just lazy, but it took a lot of discipline on my part to do the strips 20 days in a row. Maybe next time I will try the faster strips. These strips did not make my teeth sensitive. Oh, another great whitening toothpaste on this site is the Dr. Collins whitening toothpaste. Tastes great, is gentle on your mouth and cleans teeth amazingly.</li>
    <li> It did make my smile whiter. I ordered it because I saw the commercial. overall, good stuff. sometimes when its in contact with mouth gum may cause pain, but it will be gone when removed.</li>
    <li> Did the job, and a much better price than in any stores that I checked. I would of given 5 stars but I think everything could be cheaper. I noticed results right away, in about 4 days! Not hard to use. Most people didn&#x27;t even know I was using it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. It didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive and my teeth look amazing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Ultra&#x3D;fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, now I&#x27;m a believer! I can smile with more confidence and I can truly say (even though it sounds cliche) that this stuff changed my life!</li>
    <li> yeah, they&#x27;re expensive...but you pay for what you get..and these are the best.</li>
    <li> I have tried other Crest strips but they would always slide off of my teeth.  The adhesive in the Professional Effects helps strips stay in place.  Works great!!</li>
    <li> Best teeth whitening ever!</li>
    <li> Great teeth whitener, thanks!</li>
    <li> Sensitivity!!! oh man, these are annoying after the first 5 days. However, THEY WORK. If you want whiter teeth, these are the cure.</li>
    <li> Such an improvement from the last Crest whitestrips I used years ago. They stay on your teeth without slipping off. Also, the whitning gell stays on your teeth rather than all over your mouth. The product works well and you can get the desired results in just a few uses.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using these.  They&#x27;re easy to use, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter since they didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Nice product and price</li>
    <li> My daughter &amp; husband uses these 3D-whitestrips. They are very happy with the results they get from using them.</li>
    <li> Always get complements after just a few times!</li>
    <li> In me worked well, but not in my wife</li>
    <li> Using product at this time  and  came across  one of the packages that did not have any  of the gel on it...hope I dont find  that again. Ordered the larger  quantity box.</li>
    <li> I love these and the price on Amazon is the best.  Sometimes you can get a mail in rebate for Crest strips on crest website too.  these are worth the price.  My husband and I do these once a year since we are big coffee and wine drinkers.  My dentist always thinks I go some where to get professionally whitening done and I don&#x27;t.  These are gentle on the gums and my husband had very sensitive gums.  Highly recommend and only once a day@</li>
    <li> I like Crest 3D whitestrips and use them once a year or so, but I feel like the ones I bought from Amazon (rather than in-store) was less powerful. It didn&#x27;t whiten the way the in-store ones have.</li>
    <li> Worked great! I&#x27;ve tried several teeth-whitening products, and this is the only day-and-night change I&#x27;ve been able to observe. Some of the whitening toothpastes are capable of eventual whitening, but these strips will genuinely, actually make your teeth a shinier white within the time specified. I just put them on, followed the directions, and everything went as stated. If you&#x27;re looking to whiten your teeth, I&#x27;d recommend going straight to these strips rather than waste your time with everything else!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t eat ice cream anymore after three days of crest white stripes</li>
    <li> Gift, as this person uses this product and was happy with it.</li>
    <li> and i like that it sticks to the teeth well.</li>
    <li> As a smoker and heavy coffee drinker, my teeth had a very yellow/brown tint.  Saw a difference after just one application.  Did notice some pain and sensitivity after the 3rd or 4th day, so I stopped using daily.  Now, I use once or twice a week.  Because of this, I cant comment on how much teeth will whiten with regular daily use, but my teeth are still several shades lighter than before using.</li>
    <li> Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++</li>
    <li> it is okay, it does help lighten your teeth but..........it hurts! its burns my teeth (maybe i just have really sensitive teeth) really wanted to like these! but not for me!</li>
    <li> Teeth can never be whiter</li>
    <li> It worked great for me!</li>
    <li> These work great. My teeth are so white, and I get  so many compliments from my co-workers on how white my teeth are.</li>
    <li> Great price with the coupon that was offered on Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 59 years old and I had used Crest Whitestrips many years ago but experienced teeth sensitivity so quit using them. In early 2014, I tried Crest Whitestrips &amp;#34;Gentle Routine&amp;#34; due to sensitivity fears, but they did nothing to whiten my teeth, so I gave up on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to be brave and ordered Crest 3D White Luxe Professional Effects Whitestrips and after using a box, found there was a noticeable degree of whitening of my yellowed teeth. I bought another box and used most of the strips later that year and have definitely noticed an improvement that has lasted. The increased whiteness is particularly noticeable to me in photographs where I&#x27;m smiling, but my husband also commented that my teeth looked whiter. I have also used Crest 3D White Luxe &amp;#34;Glamorous White&amp;#34; toothpaste (label states: &amp;#34;Removes up to 90% of surface stains in 5 days&amp;#34;) twice a day over the past year and I think it&#x27;s possibly helped maintain some of the whiteness I got from the Whitestrips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had minimal teeth sensitivity using this product, and the strips adhered well. After pressing the strip into place, I then pressed onto each tooth with a finger, and held it for 3 seconds to make sure the strips were well-adhered to all tooth surfaces. In the past, the old Whitestrips made me drool like a teething baby, but that didn&#x27;t happen with these strips, although, it was sometimes difficult to keep my lower teeth dry enough to apply the strips due to salivating. A blotting of my teeth and gums with a paper towel helped dry some of the saliva so I could then apply the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend using this product if-- like me and my middle-aged teeth-- you don&#x27;t expect dazzling, white-as-snow, Chiclet-teeth, and keep your expectations realistic. As Crest advertises, the Whitestrips supposedly remove 14 years worth of stains, and the results have been satisfactory for me. My whiter teeth have definitely given me more confidence when smiling, and I just ordered another box.t ordered another box.</li>
    <li> These are great for a freshen up every 4-6 months.  Be sure to only leave them on for 30 minutes or gums will get sensitive.  But it works and a must to keep teeth looking white and clean.</li>
    <li> They honestly do work well. You have to use them as instructed and prepare for at least 7 days of twice a day whitening. While the results are good, it doesn&#x27;t last long if you don&#x27;t watch what you eat and drink.</li>
    <li> Saw results after a few uses</li>
    <li> I bought this over the summer for a wedding.  You see the difference in just a few days.  I combined with Crest 3D toothpaste and worked well. My teeth did get a bit sensitive but not too bad.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d be smart and save a few bucks, so I ordered the Crest 3D Whitestrips from Amazon. These things should have an expiration date them! When I attempted to pull the strips off of the plastic backing the backing part that was against the strips came off with the strips, making it very difficult to separate them. It&#x27;s as if the whitening magic had turned to glue. Won&#x27;t be buying these from Amazon in the future!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product. She has been using this for a few years now and always gets compliments on how WHITE her teeth are. Great price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years now and love them.  Everyone comments on how white my teeth are after only three days!</li>
    <li> I love these things. After trying the budget brands and forgetting to use them, these are the complete package. Just pop in a strip and leave it for a min of 30 minutes and boom. Noticed a difference within the first 3 applications. Easy to put them on your teeth then forget about them until its time to take them off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these twice now over the years. I am a wine director and spend 4 days a week sampling wine so I need to remove wine stains periodically. This really works unlike generic brands. I tried Target brand and it tasted so terrible that I threw it out. I will use this one again, it&#x27;s much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never using this product again. The whitestrips made my teeth so sensitive for three days omg i couldn&#x27;t even breath because it hurt like hell. I was so desperate because i couldn&#x27;t eat or drink, awful experience.  And I only  used it once for like 20 min not even the 30 min like it says.</li>
    <li> I am not that satisfied with the product because I saw the difference in my teeth but a minimum difference</li>
    <li> It really works! I have smoked for years and don&#x27;t even use the product every day and the brilliance has increased by 70%&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> This is my first review in internet websites. From childhood I have yellowish teeth. Used so many products and went to so many dentists for teeth whitening, none worked. This product is awesome. Almost after 30 years I like to smile. I brush my teeth twice a day and I never ever have issues with my teeth but still they look yellowish. I always use to feel bad to smile in front of people as they look very yellowish. After using this product my teeth looks very white. THANKS A BUNCH for introducing such a nice product. REALLY IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> My daughter used these 20 day pack and was happy with the results.  Not as expensive as a professional whitening but does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> Works well every time. My teeth are so much whiter since using them, not that I had really yellow teeth but it definitely makes a big difference!</li>
    <li> The White Strips are great - I have been using them for years and always get comments about my bright smile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I ordered this product, there was an advertisement for a $10 mail-in rebate.  I waited until I received the product (yesterday)to print the rebate form, but now I can no longer find it on Amazon!  I love the WhiteStrips, but I could have gotten them cheaper at CVS since they are offering a $10 off coupon.</li>
    <li> worked great. teeth turned white with only using have of one box. currently on 2nd box. on their way to pearly white. they were very yellow before.</li>
    <li> This is a solid teeth whitening product.  I began to notice a difference in about (4) days.  Some people will find, as I did, that the strips are difficult to remove, plus there were times that it felt as though the adhesive was still on the back side of my teeth several hours after I had removed the strips.  I always brushed and rinsed after each use but there was still this &#x27;sticky&#x27; feeling, not too bothersome really.  Overall, they did a decent job of whitening my teeth; as far as the results lasting for any length of time, I believe that would be completely dependent on the individual&#x27;s lifestyle and habits, e.g. how often they normally brush, do they drink coffee, tea, and or wine, do they smoke, etc., etc.  I am about (3) weeks out from using my last strip and I can tell that there is already a bit of staining back on my teeth but I do drink coffee and tea throughout the day-I know, shame on me!  I don&#x27;t think anyone will be disappointed in their results but then again, no one should expect miracles from ANY cosmetic product.</li>
    <li> So, I like that these strips whiten your teeth beautifully. I don&#x27;t like this pain in the teeth after using them for a couple days in a row. I started using them every other day, and that improved. I also don&#x27;t like that three weeks after you are done using them, your teeth go back to their previous color. I have an off-white color to my teeth and wanted a pretty white that I see some other people get from teeth whitening. However, after talking to them, I realized that they frequently use these and therefore, I only gave it four stars. I&#x27;m a little worried about long term effects from using them frequently, so I&#x27;m sticking to every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite satisfied with the outcome as the strips often left parts of the teeth untreated. The strips that they provided didn&#x27;t cover the entire teeth. So I ended up having whiter teeth in the front with side teeth remained yellow. Definitely not a desired outcome.</li>
    <li> When I use the strips several days in a row people often comment on how white my teeth look. The only downside to the product is that it does cause my teeth to have some temporary (1-2 weeks) sensativity / pain with cold food or drinks.</li>
    <li> Amazing, works quickly. I cant wait to see what it looks like after twenty days. Buy it you wont be dissapointed</li>
    <li> They do help whiten your teeth but don&#x27;t expect to scare people when you smile! Whitening strips depend upon what your teeth color was when you started to use them so everyone will have a different opinion about their effectiveness. I am not disappointed in using and buying them from AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I love the 3D whitestrips, especially the advanced seal to hold them in place better.  I have been using Crest Whitestrips for years even though I have sensitive teeth.  I find I cannot use them every day for 30 days, but rather sometimes every other day or every 3 days.  For my purposes, this gives me the desired result even though it takes longer.  This product will be a staple for me for many years to come.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about whether an OTC product would really whiten my teeth. It seemed to be too good to be true at the price. But these actually work and they are easy to use. The bleach can make your stomach somewhat acidic though.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than buying locally and was the same product as we&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
    <li> I can feel the product working and see the white spots on my teeth but after the 14 treatments, I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are as white as they should be.</li>
    <li> Great price!  these always work well for me</li>
    <li> I get asked by people how my teeth are so white all the time and it&#x27;s all thanks to this baby! Totally great results. I&#x27;ve been a use for 3 years and I&#x27;ll rebuy this product every time.</li>
    <li> So based on my experience and my husband&#x27;s experience, these actually do work. In my opinion they don&#x27;t whiten as dramatically as professional whitening systems which seem to make teeth almost pure white, but they significantly and noticeably whiten.  I&#x27;m really happy with my teeth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to general yellowing, my upper canines had always been much yellower than the rest of my teeth for some reason. It looked really weird. My dental hygienist suggested I snip pieces of white strips off and use them only on my canines for a few days, and then start using them as directed on all of my teeth. This worked wonderfully.  My teeth are all an even shade now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tune up every 6 months or so with one or two days of repeated treatments to keep my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not had tooth sensitivity or any other side effects.</li>
    <li> All the crybabies on here talking about how bad it hurts their teeth...that&#x27;s gonna happen. It also makes your white teeth white, AS ADVERTISED. Use some Sensodine and suck it up. These things are great! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Product as describe.... good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used White Strips for several years. People comment on my white teeth. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> My teeth are not sensitive in the slightest, so these don&#x27;t bother me at all. Love em, will be purchasing them in the near future.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product because I believe in the brand and the quality. Trust me, it has definitely lived up to expectations and would do business again!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been quite awhile since I tried a whitening product but I had high expectations for the whitestrip professional effects....good news folks, THEY WORK! a lot of the enamel on my teeth was removed when I had my braces taken off moons ago &amp; my teeth were pretty discolored (I&#x27;m a coffeeholic!), after one wk I could tell a difference, after two wks my husband commented on how much better they looked &amp; after three wks my folks &amp; friends started commenting on how good they looked! the kit instructions say you can use two kits per yr, after finishing this kit &amp; giving my chompers a little break I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing how the second kit will do...I&#x27;m not expecting my teeth to be gleaming white, but I am hoping for an even bigger change~ tbc!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had visibly whiter teeth within 5 days - even others noticed and complimented my whiter smile.  I was fortunate in that I didn&#x27;t have the sensitivity issue (which is odd considering I have very sensitive teeth and gums).  I wish I began using this earlier.</li>
    <li> The productive states it will remove 14 years worth of stains and it worked as advertised. Strips did adhere well.</li>
    <li> very good &amp;iacute;tem. Leaves my teeth whiter without cause sensitivity. I repeat every year</li>
    <li> I only use it once and do not to use it again. It is to hard to put the tap on my teeth because teeth are wet; after I put it on both upper and lower teeth, saliva just out of control, too much on the mouth and need to clean up frequency.</li>
    <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long after you&#x27;re done using it. But will probably repurchase and continue using.</li>
    <li> These work fairly well, but only to a point. If your teeth are really badly discolored, this will only make a small dent in it and you&#x27;ll need a dentist&#x27;s treatment. If you just want to brighten up your teeth a little, these will help.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my husband. They seemed like they were old and did not work like the ones you buy at the drugstore. Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> Like it is advertised, Crest 3D Whitestrips does whiten really well. I have been using this product for 3 years and I do about an application once every 2 weeks. I find this is the best routine for me because my teeth does get sensitive after using the strips.&lt;br /&gt;People often notice and compliment on how white my teeth are. The new grip technology is great because it really holds onto your teeth and doesn&#x27;t slide around.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to keep using this Crest Whitestrips for years to come</li>
    <li> My teeth are already whiter, as it says, after a few uses. I have to separate days of using them as I have sensitive teeth already, and this increases it- but otherwise, great product for the price. Speedy shipping, too.</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast and in good shape. Packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself sticks &#x27;like glue&#x27; to your teeth - so no chance of moving. Directions didn&#x27;t seem to include timing. Unfortunately, this product made my teeth quite sensitive after 1st use (but I am susceptible to this with bleaching products)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the seller, but these white strips were not for me.</li>
    <li> This results were fantastic, although it did remove some enamel from my teeth. There was no sensitivity after, and I strongly recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> These strips work better than Zoom whitening from the dentist. If you expect immediate results, don&#x27;t waste your time, none of these products work instant. If you want great results in about 2 weeks, here it is</li>
    <li> i am not satisfied at the level of brightening</li>
    <li> Bottom line, this product works.  I&#x27;m sure it depends on the person, but it WILL make your teeth sore.  My teeth have never been sensitive before, but after wearing just 1 sessions (30 mins) of these strips, my teeth ached.  I bought some Sensidyne toothpaste to try to counter this, with some positive results.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I noticed results very quickly with these strips. Definitely some of the best and highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> The strips were very easy to use and I could see results even after 1 week.  The main issue I had was that even if you pressed the strips as much as you can into the crevices of your teeth it wasn&#x27;t perfect.  I had to really pay attention though to notice it, and it seemed to worse on my bottom teeth which overlap lightly.  Overall though, I was happy with the results given the price.</li>
    <li> I feel that the Original Crest Whitestrips did the best job out of any of their new formulations.  Plus they were about half the price.  Crest really got cheap on us.  They should be reducing their pricing, since they have been around so long and I would bet it costs them pennies to put the peroxide into the strips.  I have tried most of their newer products, and none compare to the Original.</li>
    <li> it really works! used a few strips and made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product! It actually works! But beware it does make your gums sensitive, well mine were anyways. I just used it every other day and it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have nice white smile!</li>
    <li> Awesome. I&#x27;ve finished two rounds of 20 and bought two more. Struggled with yellow teeth a long time and this finally is changing things. I can really see the difference when comparing to a back bottom molar that the strip doesn&#x27;t reach. And unlike old versions of strips these stay on well so I can leave them on while doing anything else I feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two sets of 20 applications, if you look at the Alca chart for acrylic teeth I&#x27;ve gone from like a 26 to a 12.  I do however wear the strips for like an hour and a half a day when I think it says to do it for like 15 minutes or half an hour.  You can really wear it that long without it impacting any of your normal day activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have over-sensitivity with my gums the first 3 days and like one of my teeth actually hurt for day 2-4.  But after that I was fine.</li>
    <li> Product works but have had 3 lower strips come out dry (no adhesive). Hopefully Amazon sees this review.</li>
    <li> My teeth were pretty white to begin with and these still showed results. They&#x27;re strong, so expect to have a little bit of soreness in using them.</li>
    <li> These are the best strips I have tried so far to whiten teeth. Really watch out for sensitivity if this is an issue for you. Using this every day gave me a dull throbbing ache that prevented me from eating/drinking some things comfortably. Take sensitivity seriously to prevent it from interfering and try alternating days (or even every two days).  Also, be aware of the shape of your teeth to make the strips press against the most surface area needed. Two of my teeth barely extend in front of the others, and they are slightly lighter than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a fantastic option for those who want noticible results within a month but cannot afford or do not want to pursue professional whitening procedures at the dentist.  My teeth were not particularly stained to begin with, but using these has definitely left noticeable results that I appreciate thoroughly!</li>
    <li> I tried these and after the first 8 strips i saw a minor difference, but i let my sister try one and after just one strip it was very noticeable. They are comfortable to ware and have a tolerable taste but if they work for you then its totally worth the sacrifice. when you ware them, they kind of give you a lisp so i wouldn&#x27;t recommend using them if you KNOW you are going to be talking to someone. I do wish the strips were a bit bigger just to cover more area but they do reach all the important spots.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend these, fancy box... not much more. Product will barely maintain any whitness you currently have. Waste of money here and fairly expensive at that!</li>
    <li> I bought four different 20 packs between December 2012, and July 2013. I am writing this review in July 2015, and I can assure you that the whiteness I gained in that 8 month period has been lost. I&#x27;m back to square one. So yes this product works, it works really well in fact. But to keep the whiteness you must keep going back and spending lots of money on a product that solves a petty issue for most, teeth whiteness. Although it helped me have great senior pictures and gave a boost of confidence going into college. It was not a viable in the log run. I spent&lt;br /&gt;$134.80 for just 8 months. By the way, as of 7/31/15 the current price is $41.58, I spent $28.51 on one occasion. It&#x27;s over-priced for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have sensitive teeth or a lower pain tolerance the repetitive use of these will make your teeth susceptible to pain. For example, one evening I put them in and accidentally left them in over night. Waking and brushing my teeth was painful even with warm water. Then when I made cereal, the cold milk drove me nuts.</li>
    <li> Tried 2 packages of these along with using the 3D toothpaste.  No change.  Save your money. Would never purchase these again.</li>
    <li> This prodcut really worked :0! my teeth are much whiter. Easy application and definitely worth its price. The only weird thing is that it increases teeth sensitivity but it goes away afterwards ;o overall, great product!</li>
    <li> My friend had used the Crest 3D whitening strips and had amazing results. He did complain about pain, but because he went through with the process for 30 days I figured the pain would be bearable and worth the result. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I used I started noticing sharp pain during the 30 minute prescribed use of the whitening strips. My teeth hurt mildly the following day. I thought very strange but figured it was still bearable. The second day I left the strips for 2 hours, as suggested. I can say today has been one of the most painful days of my life. I could hardly talk, I almost cried several times. My friend and I had to leave in the middle of our Sunday service because I couldn&#x27;t bear the pain. We tried several pharmacies but none had anything for the pain I was feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what was the pain like?&lt;br /&gt;For me the pain was not on my gums but actually on my teeth. My teeth were ultra sensitive. I could not talk, or breath, or do anything without feeling a sharp pain shoot through where the whitening strips had been used. I bought a numbing paste, which I applied to my gum and teeth. That only slightly soothed my pain, but the pain was still very present. I took 4 ibuprofen and there was still pain. I bought sensodyne toothpaste, Crest sensitive toothpaste, and other sensitive cream but to no avail.  I also bought Listerine Total Care. Though the Listerine burned my mouth it slowly help me bear the pain.  I found that hot and warm water were the only things that actually kept the pain at bay long enough for me to squeeze a sentence out to my friends who were trying to help me. The sharp pain lasted for 24 hours and is only now subsiding. I was able to eat soup fine, but the day has been very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this product CLAIMS to be Enamel safe, the pharmacist told me that the whitening strips eroded my enamel hence the sharp pain I have been feeling the whole day. The pain is not worth the white teeth. REMEMBER, there is nothing out there to soothe the ultra sharp pain while you are going through it. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. Waste of my $40 dollars. I do not recommend this project AT ALL!othing out there to soothe the ultra sharp pain while you are going through it. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. Waste of my $40 dollars. I do not recommend this project AT ALL!</li>
    <li> Did what I was hoping for. My dentist actually recommended this to me. He said it was a lot cheaper than having my teethe whitened at the office.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly and in a brand new box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because it works, but it does make my teeth very sensitive. So i suggest if you already have sensitive teeth try a less harsh version.</li>
    <li> I see a huge difference after only 4 days use! This product is for my son. He has only been using the strips for 4 days and his teeth are noticeably whiter. Even his girlfriend&#x27;s mom who is a dental hygienist saw a huge difference already...</li>
    <li> This product is great!!! I saw results after three days. Make sure to use the required toothpaste to avoid gum sensitivity. Thumbs up to this product, I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love these Strips.They really do work and dont hurt my teeth like other have. This is my second time purchasing and have had a great experience.</li>
    <li> A great low cost and effective way to whiten your teeth. I use in conjunction with a teeth whitening toothpaste and mouthwash, so all together they make your teeth a much nicer white!  People have always paid me complements after having completed the course of strips.  I use it every 6/8 months. Even without the discount I would recommend you buy this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different teeth whitening strips and I have to admit, these are by far the worst. They spotted the ends of my teeth, making them significantly whiter than the rest of the surface. The only thing they were really good at was making my teeth ultra-sensitive.</li>
    <li> I used these for the first time. I&#x27;ve always been afraid they would hurt my teeth, but from reading reviews, decided to give them a try. I used the sensitive toothpaste for a week before trying them. I didn&#x27;t have any burning of the gums like I read about. Just as others have said they worked in about 3 days. I&#x27;m a tea drinker and my teeth were dingy. I&#x27;m so happy. I hope it lasts for awhile. I found out if I dried my teeth off with a cotton towel it was easier to attach the strips. The strips do not cover the back teeth. i guess you would need to go to a dentist to get your teeth whitened to do that. I think they use trays. Over all I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> Good product stays put and whitens teeth extremely well. Teeth are super white and experienced little to no sensitivity afterwards. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular coffee and tea drinker, so I was excited when I read reviews on here from baristas saying that these worked really well... lol. I followed the directions as directed for 20 days. My teeth definately look cleaner and brighter, but not as white as I had hoped.. especially when these are advertised to take 10 years worth of stains off of your teeth.  Although, in photos, my teeth really do look whiter.  Overall, I imagine it works differently on different people, so I recommend it if you don&#x27;t have really tough stains on your teeth.</li>
    <li> LOVE CREST WHITE STRIPS! GREAT PRODUCT AND COMPANY.  I TRY AND USE THESE AT LEAST ONCE A QUARTER IF NOT MORE.</li>
    <li> this very shop was at a good price at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works just as if you woud have gone to he dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is represents a good safe of money</li>
    <li> I have tried Rembrandt Whitening trays and I was left with serious burns on my gums that hurt for a week. My gums are healthy. Does this happen with Crest White strips?</li>
    <li> The Crest 3d White Professional Effects Teeth Whitening strips work as advertised. I saw results in as little as 3 days.</li>
    <li> I have been using these strips for a couple years now and they are great. After a lifetime of drinking both coffee and red wine I did not do a lot of smiling to show off my dull yellow-white teeth. But now everyone who knows me comments on the fact that I am always smiling! Why not? It makes people feel good and I now have a very bright smile! I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the pain or discomfort that a lot of people do, my wife has but she gets thru it by using Sensadyne and taking a day off here and there. The strips are very easy to use. I have nothing negative to say about them.</li>
    <li> It does remove stains but I was hoping for whiter teeth. My teeth do look less stained and I&#x27;m happy, I just was hoping for more dramatic results.</li>
    <li> these are alright but very expensive,,had to try them though</li>
    <li> Really works.  After two weeks saw a major difference.  It&#x27;s been a month and WOW !</li>
    <li> These are the only white strips that I use because it only requires 30 minutes. If I leave it on for more than 30 mins, the next day my teeth will have sensitivity which is a downside to this white strip but I think it varies on other people. It does it&#x27;s job and makes teeth whiter and it&#x27;s easy to use if you follow the directions. I just wish that the bottom strip was longer so that it would cover more teeth instead of just what people can see.</li>
    <li> This was pretty good, my teeth were yellowish and it lowered my self esteem but this really helped. it does make your teeth sensitive but nothing to extreme, probably like a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10 and it does make an amazing improvement but quite a good one and i had two friends actually ask me how i got them to be so white, if i was you i would definitely try it</li>
    <li> I used them for 21 days and my teeth appeared a couple shades whiter. It&#x27;s not hard to use at all. I highly recommend it. Now that I&#x27;m not embarrassed to hide my teeth, I can&#x27;t stop smiling now.</li>
    <li> acceptale deleivery time, but the sticks was delievered without toothpaste which I expected to be together</li>
    <li> Used 3 boxes of this already, and my teeth now r like shiny white. Srs, my friends actually told me not to laugh when i&#x27;m taking pictures with them, cuz they said my shiny white teeth is making their teeth looks yellow in the picture.</li>
    <li> product as described, well packed, fast delivery, fair pricing</li>
    <li> First off, these strips work. I used the strips once a day for 30-35 minutes every morning after brushing.The sensitivity was mild and there was noticeable splotching in the first couple of days. The whitening eventually evened out and my teeth began to get a few shades whiter but around day nine I began noticing tiny (0.5mm) holes forming on two of my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;I panicked and stopped using them immediately. Everything was fine in my last checkup two months ago, so I figured these couldn&#x27;t hurt. I guess that was my fault but I never imagined these strips would turn my teeth into Swiss cheese!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely do as the box recommends and consult a dentist prior to using these strips.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply although not so pleasant to wear but its for a short time each day so it didnt bother me. I didnt notice tremendous whitening results though so I dont think i&#x27;ll do it again.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have a bigger mouth and bigger teeth, but I have to use two strips on the upper mouth at the same time to cover all my teeth. They should be as long as the lower strips (which should be a little longer too...). But in general, they work very well for whitening, and I would highly recommend. Do NOT leave them longer than 35-40 minutes (if you want to go longer), as your teeth will be VERY sensitive the next day. I accidentally left them on for an hour (I forgot I had them on), and let&#x27;s just say, the next day was not very fun!</li>
    <li> They work if you can stand the hypersensitivity. I had to stop after 10 one time applications because of the pain.</li>
    <li> Really no need for me write a review, as the product description \\&quot;speaks the truth\\&quot;. Unless your teeth were never white to begin with, due to illness, etc., then this product DOES work, and yes you WILL see results. HOWEVER...as any dentist would tell you, do NOT exceed the daily recommendation of 30 minutes...my own mother told ME not to as it could cause gum irritation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;So use, don&#x27;t abuse and enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;*HAPPY HOLIDAYS from my family to yours*</li>
    <li> Always my go-to. Have been using the professional version for years now. Be careful not to put them over gums - will likely increase sensitivity.</li>
    <li> It works, but your teeth need to suffer the sourness. I always use it before the bedtime, so I can sleep before the sourness starts. The seller is little unprofessional. I received the products without the original package, and I don&#x27;t remember that I had chosen the options for it. When I sent message to the seller that why I didn&#x27;t get the package with the products. He/she just didn&#x27;t reply me at all. It makes me very upset. I just want a explanation.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this things. Gets her theeth white. Going to try it one day myself.</li>
    <li> I get TONS of compliments on how white my teeth are.  This is a very inexpensive yet highly effective way to whiten your teeth.  Get rid of all of those old stains and brighten your smile, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Have used 17 out of 20 strips so far and there is no visible difference with the exception of some white spots on my upper front teeth. I also avoided drinking coffee, cokes and brushed my teeth every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work for everyone else but doesn&#x27;t for me for some reason. What a waste of 50 dollars.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well these worked! I have been a complete skeptic regarding all teeth whitening products throughout my life. I ended up buying these before my wedding just to try them out and was very pleased with the results. After one box, my teeth looked significantly whiter. I ended up using two boxes before my wedding, and my teeth looked great. These strips didn&#x27;t taste bad, were easy to apply and remove, and didn&#x27;t give me any pain despite having pretty sensitive teeth. I think I&#x27;ll definitely buy these again the next time I have an event where I want sparkly teeth. The one thing I would warn about is being careful to apply them the way you want them, as trying to move them around or getting the adhesive wet makes them stick less.</li>
    <li> These work very well. I see improved whiteness after only a few treatments. I&#x27;ve never had any sensitivity issues with them.</li>
    <li> I noticed after the first day that my teeth looked a little lighter, by the third day I definitely saw the difference. This product does what it says it will my only objection is when it&#x27;s in my mouth for the thirty minutes the gel leaves a disgusting taste in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my smile!!</li>
    <li> It has a terrible taste and makes the 30 minutes it has to be on for very long and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Works as always, if you wear them 3 days straight your enamel may hurt a bit (sensitive teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried I used expired strips, but according to the box they&#x27;re good through 2017!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems finding a good whitening solution.  The original Crest whitestrips are too gooey for me and would slide around... an uncomfortable treatment, but they did the job.  I tried trays and whitening pastes, but they wind up treating the gums, cheeks, etc and for a few days I&#x27;d feel like I had been chewing on glass.  When I read about the Luxe strips, I decided to give &#x27;em a try.  There is noticeably less gel on each strip... in fact, it&#x27;s sometimes hard to get the strip off of the plastic backer.  It really sticks to my teeth and I almost forget about &#x27;em for the 30 minute treatment.  Well... you don&#x27;t forget about &#x27;em, but you can go about your normal day and do things around the house or talk on the phone during the treatment.  When you peel &#x27;em off, they are still stuck on well to the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brush quickly before (to knock away anything that might prevent good contact of the gel to the tooth) and then follow my normal brushing routine when I&#x27;m done.  I&#x27;ve used it every day for the past 6-7 days and I&#x27;m not experiencing any of the sensitivity issues or problems with my cheeks / gums that I&#x27;ve had before.  I get a bit of dry-mouth for 30 min or so after the treatment, but nothing uncomfortable or that a sip or two of water won&#x27;t solve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are noticeably whiter and the coffee stains are starting to disappear (my real reason for needing the product).  Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> After 16 uses i still cant se any result, im so disappointed after all good reviews tha I read. I have not that yellow teeth because I have whitening them 2 yers ago professionaly and now they became a bit yellow so I dicided to try this. They are a bit so small for big teeth and it makes them har to stay glued in the back of the teeth like the should. And my teeth was icing A LOT !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Disepointed , they dident work for me.</li>
    <li> It was my fault not to check it before I used one of them.Then I found that the typeface of the letters are shadowy and fuzzy which seem like fake. It makes me dare not use it again.</li>
    <li> I keep a pretty clean mouth. However, I do tend to drink a lot of coffee. So over the years my teeth have been stained, and I decided it&#x27;s time to start whitening.&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the whitening strips has been pleasant. I wore them twice a day for thirty minutes as instructed. After finishing a box, I could see a noticable difference. I ended up getting another box to whiten a bit further.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth became sensitive for a day or two during whitening, but the sensetivity was very minimal. It was more like I was aware of my individual teeth in my mouth; I would have expected pain during cold/hot food&#x27;s,  but that was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;Application is very simple and straightforward. I did have to get some of the strip on my gum line. This ended up giving me a minor chemical burn on that area causing some temporary discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that takes away from the experience is that you whiten one strip at a time twice a day. This means that the process is slow and steady. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, because it does in fact work. It&#x27;s just that you see the results trickle in, and even though your teeth are getting whiter,  it is just hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do recommend this product. Since I did not feel much sensitivity I am thinking about trying the one hour strips, too.</li>
    <li> Good product and great price.</li>
    <li> Using it now, seems to be lighting my teeth a little.</li>
    <li> Does the job and priced right.</li>
    <li> It did brighten my teeth as advertised. I took about 3/4&#x27;s of the strips to do it, but it did work. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product got to me a week before it said it would be here. Works wonderful! Noticed a difference after only the first application.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just got lucky to have healthy teeth. I have not experienced any sensitivity at all and my teeth are whiter than I expected being a smoker. I have never whitened before so I saw a huge difference. These are great and I will continue to use as needed. I don&#x27;t want that movie star white I just want a healthier white. I noticed some people have whitened so much their teeth are almost blue! Sorry, not attractive to me.</li>
    <li> Not worth the time or dollars. It gives sensitive teeth, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a terrific price.</li>
    <li> I use teeth whitening strips every 6 months or so to keep my teeth looking bright white as I drink a fair amount of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These works well for me and provide a great whitening effect, just like the ones you&#x27;d pick up at the store.  The only thing I noticed was that the &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; that they use to stick to your teeth wasn&#x27;t as strong as the ones you&#x27;d pick up at the store.  The reasoning behind this, I believe, is that the older these get, the less stickiness they have to your teeth leading me to believe that these may have been sitting for awhile before purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They still worked great, just took a slight bit more consciousness to keep them in place on my teeth.  I&#x27;d still highly recommend them for the 30% discount.</li>
    <li> My kid loves this.  Says his teeth are much whiter.  He drinks a lot of soda.</li>
    <li> Well, they definitely work, I am about 3/4 way through the 20 treatment box and there is definitely a noticeable difference.  I normally have very sensitive teeth/gums and have not once experienced any increased sensitivity/pain from using the strips.  Would recommend for an easy quick improvement to your teeth.</li>
    <li> This product far exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would work. I have partials alongside natural teeth, so I really needed this to work. I used them as directed and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in the whiteness of my natural teeth at all. I wasn&#x27;t expecting huge results from a strip, but was very disappointed. I also used the Crest 3D Whitening toothpaste along with the strips. As far as the sensitivity issue, brushing with a toothpaste for sensitivity should help. That is what I did when I started having trouble with the sensitivity when using the whitening strips. They are very easy to use and stay in place very well. They just didn&#x27;t seem to whiten my teeth at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest Professional 3D Whitestripst for a few days now, and the only thing I really take issue with so far is the fact that my box had less than 20 packets in it. Maybe it may not seem like a big deal, but if I pay for a dozen doughnuts, I&#x27;d be a little put out if I only received 11. I paid for 20 and therefore that is what I should have received. Another minor issue is that the strips are indeed slightly painful, though the pain is not too bad and changes to a kind of buzzing sensation after a while. I would like to update my review when I have used all my strips.</li>
    <li> Great at whiting my teeth and don&#x27;t regret buying it. Although this can be slightly painful for some people with sensitive gums or teeth I haven&#x27;t had any problems except once where I had a sharp pain in my tooth, but it shortly went away. The only negative I have with this product is that it only whitens my front teeth that people see when you smile, but not the back.</li>
    <li> Gift for my boyfriend he definitely wanted teeth whitener because he was a former smoker. He loves it and it was a decent price.</li>
    <li> I love these whitening strips because 1) they work!, and 2) they don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth, 3) they are super sticky so they don&#x27;t slide around your mouth.  The other strips that move around always make me wonder if my gums are getting bleached but these stick to your teeth-- which is the whole entire purpose of these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitve teeth.I normally use these every other day, and brush with sensodyne tooth paste and don&#x27;t have any sensitivity as long as I stick with these combos.  I also switch to the Crest gentle strips if I start feeling sensitivity.  I&#x27;m not on a timeline to whiten my teeth and use the whitening strips to maintain a healthy bright smile.  Don&#x27;t need to go crazy bleaching to get white teeth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 4 strips in and already see a clear improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally thinking I would have to get veneers to whiten my teeth (due to long time coffee drinking) but my dentist dissauded me and said that the the home kits not only worked with less irritation but also had a longer lasting, more permanent effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are easy and quick to apply, and stay on rock solid.  They are correct that you  can easily talk, drink, etc. with them in.  I personally don&#x27;t drink with them in since it&#x27;s only a half an hour but certainly it won&#x27;t bother the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a before photo and I&#x27;ll try and post the &#x27;after&#x27; once I am done with all 20 but even four strips in and I&#x27;m already sold on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some quick items to be aware of:&lt;br /&gt;1 - There is a minor taste that will hit the tip of your tongue as it contacts the back seam of the  strips.  Nothing major, but be aware it&#x27;s not tasteless.&lt;br /&gt;2 - I have not had any irritation at all.  However, I did 2 days in a row, then started  spacing to every other day so that may have helped.&lt;br /&gt;3 - Removal - that&#x27;s actually a bit of effort since the strips become very gummy and they have a very solid grip onto your teeth.  That said, I&#x27;d far prefer that than if they were slipping around and sliding off since that would defeat the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously did a dental whitening where they used  a laser/light and ran you through multiple trays of stuff over a two+ hour period.  My teeth were very,very sensitive for well over a week from it and the whitening effect both wasn&#x27;t that much, and promptly disappeared in only a few months.  Not at all worth the time, discomfort or money (I think it was $350 -$400 or so?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By contrast, these strips have already provided noticeable  whitening 4 strips in, no discomfort at all, and a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product worker better than I expected the advance seal is great. I started seeing a difference after 6-7 uses and am thrilled with the end results! I experienced no sensitivity which was one of my main concerns using these. I would definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> If this is the very first time that you&#x27;re using a whitening product, you will see results within a few treatments and noticeably white teeth in the coming week. When I used this for first time, the strips removed much of the coffee and tea stains. So when I went out with friends one day after 3 months since the treatments, someone noticed that I had nice white teeth. I was ecstatic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t perfect though. The strips tend to shift around and not stick to the tooth in some areas due to the formation of your teeth and the silva build up. But it works more or less.</li>
    <li> They did an amazing job whitening my badly yellowed teeth. I didn&#x27;t want sparkling white teeth, but they look SO much better. It took about three boxes to get the results I wanted, but I am in my sixties and my teeth were very yellowed. I really like the advanced seal of these strips also....they stayed on my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Does not work at all.  Save your money and purchase a real whitening treatment from a dentist.</li>
    <li> using this product was just lose money. stripes are uncomfortable,fold out, just a mess.&lt;br /&gt;putting in your teeth is all an ellaborated work.</li>
    <li> These work well...but it warns you on the box that your gums/teeth might be tender after use and mine were!</li>
    <li> i saw noticeable whitening immediately within 2 days and figured wow at this rate i ll have super white teeth. for 50 bucks .wow!! and then the whitening stopped. my teeth didnt get noticeably whiter from days 3 through 20.that was my experience dont think i will buy again. it was expensive. i mean i might try the one  rated 5 but thats even more expensive.hope this helped. i drink coffe everyday</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Purchased here on Amazon with a coupon (sent in a rebate as well) and I am satisfied with the product! I read the reviews on here prior to making the purchase. Since this is over the counter, I already knew not to expect too much. I am an avid coffee drinker - I have to drink it everyday, and my teeth are of yellowish hue. It&#x27;s nothing drastic but I find myself photoshopping the color of a couple teeth and decided to do something about it. I caved in and got this. Man, I must say, it is amazing! The results are awesome! I have 4 strips left and saw a HUGE difference! My teeth are much much whiter! Nothing drastic like you&#x27;d expect at the dentist, but it really does look so much better!!! My teeth are no longer yellowish. You have to do this everyday though! I saw a difference after the second time but saw a BIG difference after 2 weeks of using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have sensitive teeth but yes, after using this product, it has become a bit sensitive. It did hurt the first 2 times (sharp pain) but it was very bearable! Definitely worth it! However, I don&#x27;t know how this would affect others with sensitive teeth already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
    <li> These white strips were new in factory wrapping and were just as expected.  I read the many tips and suggestions from other reviewers and they were spot on.  Results are great!  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a week or so and the results have been amazing. I noticed whiter teeth after the first use and the results have only gotten better. I am an avid coffee drinker and so my teeth were getting a bit yellowed. Since I don&#x27;t have the extra 500 for a professional clean I chose this reasonably priced option and have been satisfied so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Will cause minor sensitivity after use. Not too bad as others have reported.&lt;br /&gt;2. May irritate gums if you floss prior to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is a great product with great results. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Be careful to not leave it for too long. You might risk getting horizontal lines in your teeth which take some time to go away. Aside from that I think it&#x27;s a great price for what you are getting. I would say my teeth improved about 3 shades or so. Again, for the price and convenience this is a no brainer for people who like white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it gives you a pearl white not an opaque white. That&#x27;s good because it looks more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not leave it for longer than 30 mins!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The whitestrips do exactly what they say. I didn&#x27;t notice any results until about the 5th day into using the product. They fit quite well if done right. However, there are always a fair amount of sections that come in contact with your gums and after 30 mins of these chemicals on your gums it really hurts. The sore lasts for 12 hours, sometimes more. It also increases sensitivity to eating and drinking in that timeframe. YMMV.</li>
    <li> Had it for three days in a row, and on and off for a while. 25mins a day, take one or two days off every a few days, and don&#x27;t have it on for too long each time, teeth can get a little sensitive. Other than these, it&#x27;s just a life changer.</li>
    <li> I have been using these every day in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Started to really notice a difference around strip 15 and did have some sensitivity but honestly thats what you get with whitening.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can&#x27;t stand is that the strips do not cover all of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I want to whiten all of the teeth that I smile with and not just have part white and part not, seems pretty dumb.&lt;br /&gt;May get a double pack next time and use 4 strips.</li>
    <li> I use this once a year without fail. I always get compliments on how white my teeth are. Crest is my secret.</li>
    <li> I faithfully did the 20-day treatment and did see a noticeable improvement in the shade of my teeth.  I am going to follow it up with a 14-day regimen to see if I notice any further improvement.  Both of my adult kids swear by this product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, I never believed people whitened their teeth with these strips but after 4 uses I am a believer. I am a heavy smoker and I drink a lot of coffee so my teeth were pretty yellow. I&#x27;ve used the strips for 4 days now, an hour each day and my teeth are noticeably whiter. I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or pain like some people say. I love these and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Whitened my teeth about 3 Xs whiter after using the whole box.  I have purchased a 2nd box.  I may try another Crest Whitestrip if these do not work better.</li>
    <li> I wanted whiter teeth ahead of my wedding, so I asked my dentist for her recommendation. I&#x27;ve used crest white strips and dealt with painful sensitivity from them before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my teeth are straight, she recommended I start with Crest White Strips before spending hundreds of dollars to have her whiten my teeth (I appreciate my honest dentist), especially since treatments in the dentists office cause the same level of pain--if not more pain she said! My dentist did give me VERY good directions though. First, she said to only pay attention to the &amp;#34;maximum&amp;#34; directions. So since the box says no more than 2 boxes a year, and 1x a day for 30 min, not to exceed those guidelines. But I should otherwise &amp;#34;play it by ear&amp;#34; based on sensitivity--the effects are the same even if the strips are spaced out more. Also, I should start whitening 8-9 months in advance of my wedding, with the 2nd round of strips 2-3 months ahead of the wedding to avoid sensitive teeth ... Read more</li>
    <li> As I get older I bought these for myself as a birthday PRESANT to me and I DOO drink a lot of diet coke SOO it&#x27;s a must and I work for a major airline SOOO I need nice white teeth when talking to paying passengers</li>
    <li> So I used this and I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference (although my teeth are already pretty clean). But then I met up with a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen a while and she said, &amp;#34;Wow, your teeth are so white!&amp;#34; So maybe it does work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is pretty simple. I didn&#x27;t experience any pain or sensitivity like others claim. It is a little bit gross and tastes like hydrogen peroxide, and is a little bit of a mess when you take it off. But that&#x27;s the price of white teeth I suppose. Also, it&#x27;s rather expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about a week and i have already noticed a big change in whiteness! I will say however that they do cause sensitivity in your teeth. i have stopped use to brush my teeth with sensodyne since and it has cut down on the sensitivity. I recommend that your prepare your teeth with that first for a 2 weeks before using these. They work though i would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great for a quick whitening of the teeth!  Easy to apply.  Easy to remove.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love white strips, but they do make your teeth sensitive so be wary! My teeth are brighter after removing white strips and to maintain this pearly white feature, I simply keep up with good dental hygiene. I use white strips at least every 6 months - if I remember to</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this product.It&#x27;s so much cheaper than having a dentist give you the same effects professionally. I liked the fact that they whiten the back of your teeth too, not just the front. It definitely does what is advertised, and I&#x27;ve seen results as early as 3 or so days. Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> Even if you only wear them for short periods of time, there is a noticeable difference after the first wear.</li>
    <li> I researched and spoke with my dentist about all the options for teeth whitening in depth for a while and found the reviews and information lead me towards this product. I was already using the 3D White toothpaste and already noticed a very slight difference just using that alone and decided to get their mouthwash too. I immediately started using the strips the day they came in. It&#x27;s been 5 days and I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference. I chose professional effects not only because I had my braces removed this year, but I am a smoker AND a big coffee drinker (both leave heavy stains, as most of us know) and it has already removed a majority of the damage I&#x27;ve done to my mouth. I&#x27;m extremely ecstatic about this product and will finish the pack as well as order another next year and go through it again (As recommended by Crest and other reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: However, these strips DO indeed make your teeth sensitive. I do not mean necessarily just to cold air or cold drinks/ice. It&#x27;s almost a short throbbing pain in some areas. It didn&#x27;t persist for me, just happened for a few minutes after. Also...do NOT, I repeat, DO NOOOOT wear these longer than the recommended time on the instructions (30 minutes) if you want to avoid sensitivity. I went an hour (just to experiment) on two treatments and noticed a HUGE difference with pain and sensitivity. If this is a big concern for you, I did notice the mouth wash and toothpaste they offer under the same like do help with this issue. You could also consider trying a toothpaste FOR sensitive teeth to help.</li>
    <li> I bought in hopes of whitening my teeth. But after tyhe first use my teeth were so sensitive I had to stop using,</li>
    <li> My first review i must say it work pretty well my teeth look whiter i would recommend to others for whiter teeth</li>
    <li> Just what I needed... never thought it would be this easy</li>
    <li> Worke for some time, I think for the price it was worth it. Although my dentist told me to not use them anymore :)</li>
    <li> They work very well and much cheaper than Target or WalMart</li>
    <li> I would buy these again. It showed improvements but dont miss days.</li>
    <li> They work like a charm and I will buy them again I am sure.</li>
    <li> Does whiten! I&#x27;ve had some tooth sensitivity a couple days after using it but it&#x27;s not too bad and it does help brighten your smile!</li>
    <li> these are amazing, they really work.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I split this pack, so we essentially got 10 strips each. Even with 10 strips we saw a distinct difference in the whitening effects on our teeth!&lt;br /&gt;Putting them on is easy.&lt;br /&gt;Sitting and waiting is kind of awkward, as your mouth naturally salivates from something being there. The box says you can drink water, but you can&#x27;t eat or drink anything else. I recommend using a straw if you&#x27;re going to drink water.&lt;br /&gt;Taking them off is the funny part. They REALLY get stuck on your teeth! So be careful when using your nail to get that one corner off, because you&#x27;re going to want to dig in--resulting in a nicked gum.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these product works! Even at half the amount!</li>
    <li> Works as described!  By the time I finished off all my whitening strips, I had a beautiful, much whiter smile!  :)</li>
    <li> Even after the 1st application of the strips and their 30 minute session I noticed slight whitening; Excited to see what the other 19 strips will do for my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;PROTIP:&lt;br /&gt;my dentist recommended using your fingernail to push the strips into the cracks in between your teeth so those too will get whitened. Otherwise you could end up with a butter-teeth look to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve used all of the strips my results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about 9 strips in, I have been using this product for six days, doing it twice a day when I can. I am amazed with the results so much! My teeth were stained yellow, and now my teeth are pretty damn white! And I still have 11 strips left so i any wait to see the full results! The sensitivity isn&#x27;t that bad for me also :D</li>
    <li> My husband have really yellow teeth. It&#x27;s so yellow that when he smiles, it&#x27;s the first thing people notice. Disgusting, I know! I bought this product for him and ensure he use it daily. After about the fourth day, we both notice his teeth were whiter. He completed his final treatment today and his teeth looked amazingly white. I bought another box for myself and currently on my 8th treatment. I do notice my teeth got whiter. I do feel a little sensitivity on my teeth, but not enough to whine about it. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for pearly white teeth.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, but I&#x27;m convinced! The first time I used them, the difference was significant. The second and third strips, done on consecutive days, turned my teeth from yellow to almost white. Much much better than those cheap whitening toothpaste. Much easier to use than those expensive plastic tube things you have to boil to get into the right shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is a little expensive. For a cheaper option, I tried the following paste gel for whitening and it works wonders too. Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RH1TRE/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000RH1TRE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;theaventblog-20</li>
    <li> I started using these a few weeks before my wedding to brighten my smile and they did!  I had only done any sort of whitening in the past once or twice and it had been several years.  These were very user-friendly and the time went by very quickly.  I have veneers on my 2 top front teeth and just cut that one in half so that those weren&#x27;t covered.  This gave me more coverage on the top teeth along the sides.  I think I got some sensitivity one day and just skipped a day or two after that to let it fade away before I started again.  I didn&#x27;t use the whole box and have a ton left over to do another run at some point in the future.  Great product.</li>
    <li> So far this is working for me but I have just started.</li>
    <li> I wanted my teeth nice and pearly white for my wedding, and this definitely delivered! The last time I used Crest White Strips was probably more than 10 years ago, and oh man have things improved! I love how they stick on your teeth now, and don&#x27;t slide anywhere. I definitely noticed an improvement in my color, and will go to these every time i need a bit of a touch up. Thanks to these, my wedding smile was perfect !</li>
    <li> These strips are supposed to be the non slippery kind that stuck to your teeth. I had to literally rip then off my teeth because they were so sticky. Then I had shooting pain on my front tooth after that!</li>
    <li> All Good, no Problems...</li>
    <li> Have been using this stuff for almost a month now. It has really made a difference in the color of my teeth. It has made my teeth somewhat sensitive, so I use it every other day until I finish the package. I also use the 3D Crest White toothpaste and mouthwash in conjunction with these. So much cheaper than having this done at the dentist office. I am very pleased. Plan on doing another program in 6 months to keep my teeth looking good.</li>
    <li> Awesome whitining power. I also use the blue LED light and it seems to work.</li>
    <li> These strips really did a nice job and they weren&#x27;t all sticky like other strips.</li>
    <li> i could see a difference in my teeth after just using one time but be careful this my cause sensitivity to the gums if you leave it to long did not have a problem with it sticking would recommend this to someone who want a quick fix</li>
    <li> Highly satisfied. Stick to teeth very well. Noticed a difference in 3 or 4 uses. Alot of improvement since the first Crest whitening strips that I used.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely high-priced item, so we were happy to find it here at a much better price.  The best part is, that it is actually an improved product that is easier to use and the results are better by perhaps 15%.  Hard to find truth in nearly anything, but this is improved and the cost was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Expensive but really does the job to whiten your teeth.Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works well from the very first strip!&lt;br /&gt;I realized my teeth were turning yellow so I invested in this product. I would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;Tooth sensitivity is a problem, especially if you&#x27;re a grinder. But it is temporary as it says on the box. I didn&#x27;t use the strips back to back over 20 days, and I have only used 5, my teeth are 2-3 shades lighter already! Love it!</li>
    <li> I know a lot of people are discouraged by the tooth sensitivity from using Crest whitestrips. I have experienced so much pain in the past that I would only make it through about 3 days of whitestrips. I think my teeth were more sensitive than most. I gave up the idea of using whitestrips becuase of the sensitivity and the gel would get it my mouth and gross me out. Then about 5 years later, which brings us to now, I saw these whitestrips and decided to use them. My dentist recommended that I use Sensodyne for a month before I began whitening because I explained to him my problems in the past. And WOW! I cannot believe how much better these are. My teeth have been experiencing minimal and very bareable pain. Also, these ones are not as gross as the original kind. They stick to your teeth way better. I still have the idea of the old ones stuck in my head, so I put part of a paper towel in my mouth to separate my tongue from my teeth and catch build-up saliva. Sounds kind of weird, but...

    <li> dear god, my teeth. so insanely painful, do not try this at home!!</li>
    <li> Just buy them they work, and they work fast. You will have whiter brighter teeth within a week trust me!!</li>
    <li> I would say my teeth are 3 shades whiter, not a huge difference but enough to feel that it was worth it. I also used the brand&#x27;s toothpaste and wash so that helped. Like most stuff in this category, they work best when used as directed, so don&#x27;t skip a day or leave them on longer than needed. One thing I am not sure of was whether you are supposed to rinse and brush after? I always did but that may have reduced the power of the whitening.</li>
    <li> My teeth were lightly yellowed (no cigarettes and little coffee). Didn&#x27;t notice a big change until about strip #12. My teeth look white now. Not &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; white but a natural white. I&#x27;m pleased with the product and will use it when the dreaded yellow returns.</li>
    <li> Im very satisfied with this product. I would recommended to everyone, I always buy this products for my whole family.</li>
    <li> It works. You will tell improvement in just one use. Just don&#x27;t do it too often that can be bad on your teeth and make them sensitive. To get the brightest of white teeth you will have to keep using often and more because stains come in layers. This seems to just strip it back slowly, but I promise you will see results!</li>
    <li> When there is only a small amount of whitening chemical on one end of the strip, and the rest is dry..?.  Not very useful..</li>
    <li> Fine product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I hate trays, I always feel like I&#x27;m drooling, and its just gross. I tried Crest White Strips back when they first came out many years ago in the 90s, and they were gooey and impractical, so I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom gave me a box of these and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed! The idea to add the peroxide right to the adhesive is genius, they really wrap right around your teeth and stick there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sensitive at all, but I think its because I&#x27;m a hard brusher. 4 days in and they&#x27;re noticeably whiter. I&#x27;ll update at the end of the 14 Days!</li>
    <li> I purchased these online and when they came, the strips were completely dried up and hard.  It is definitely not worth the time to re-package them to return.  I buy products off of Amazon.com daily, but I am disappointed and wish I had just purchased the whitening strips elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;ve been using it for a week. It works as described. From the third day, my teeth became whiter without any sensitivity. What I don&#x27;t know is how long will it last?, I will try to update later.</li>
    <li> White teeth everytime!!</li>
    <li> You can tell there was a small change but nothing really dramatic.. Might try the next highest level higher now that I know my teeth didnt hurt like others</li>
    <li> I loved crest whitestrips, and I love the fact that I was able to purchase them as a lower price than the stores! Overall great purchase.</li>
    <li> My wife has used these for awhile so I decided to try them and they work well. My teeth were noticeably whiter after about 10 strips. I usually leave them in for about an hour as I don&#x27;t see how the extra time can hurt anything and the taste and feel do not bother me that much.</li>
    <li> With these you do see improvement very fast. The only problem with the product is that if you use them continuously, they will make your teeth or tooth hurt really bad. But it&#x27;s worth it and I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of improvement.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product because it gives me a very white smile in a matter of no time.  However I have to take several days off at a time because it really hurts my teeth.  I will get shooting pains in my teeth after a use, sometimes into the next day.  I will use a couple times throughout the months but it does keep my smile white.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not looking for a real white result then this will work. It will only turn the color of your teeth 2 or maybe 3 shades lighter. If you&#x27;re looking for a bright smile or shiny white smile I&#x27;d save your money and go to a dentist for whitening.</li>
    <li> Now i have White teeth</li>
    <li> These now give you some options to speed up the whitening time, wearing them from 1/2 hour for gradual whitening up to 2 hours for rapid results.  Expensive, but I can remember when the only option was at the dentist&#x27;s for $500, and these give comparable results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth but using these made my teeth hurt all day!</li>
    <li> Works and I don&#x27;t experience any teeth sensitivity</li>
    <li> As a coffee &amp; wine drinker, the Crest 3D White Professional Effects White Strips are a MUST-HAVE! I definitely recommend it to anybody who drinks wine or coffee and/or smokes cigarettes. I buy and use these throughout the year, and they definitely make a HUGE difference. I would, however, use them only half as much as directed if you have sensitive teeth. Anybody who is looking to whiten and brighten their smile, try Crest 3D White Strips!</li>
    <li> Good. The product is very nice. I used it for 3 days, and the result comes out nicely. very nice!</li>
    <li> First of all, all of the strips were removed from the box above and placed in an envelope and mailed to me.  When I used the strips, it didn&#x27;t appear to have any gel on the strips.  Very poor quality</li>
    <li> It only whitenened part of each tooth, leaving the the rest yellow. I am very disappointed. Now my teeth have awkward white strips and would have been better before I used the strips</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much else to say that the title doesn&#x27;t may clear - you can pay the dentist way more money for the exact same results, or you just get a cleaning and then use these on your clean teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice (first one might&#x27;ve been a 14 day one), and my teeth&#x27;s color have improved greatly. The first worked amazingly well to the point where I&#x27;ve gotten a compliment on how white my teeth were, and I barely flashed a smile. I used a second one six months later, but it didn&#x27;t do as much as before. I&#x27;m planning on buying this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mild discomforts were basically these small, sharp pains in my teeth for me, but I got used to them soon. They disappeared completely a couple days after I finished using it. I used them once every day for 30 - 40 mins.</li>
    <li> It does not make my teeth sensitive, I have been using it for a week every night before bed time for 30 minutes, I can already see the difference.</li>
    <li> this was my first attempt at a teeth whitener, and i wasn&#x27;t impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;re supposed to put these on your teeth and not get any of the strip on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it burns your gums, and when i removed it, it left a white residue on spots of my gums.  i had to pick at it and rub it off, which left that spot raw and almost bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried em twice, the rest are still in my bathroom drawer, i doubt i&#x27;ll ever use em.</li>
    <li> Completely caused my teeth to become EXTREMELY sensitive after only 2 applications. Stay away.</li>
    <li> It is quite easy to use -- the fact that you have to dispose of the sticky strips after half an hour is a bit of an inconvenience. Careful to dry off your teeth -- my bottom teeth especially needed that -- or the strip won&#x27;t stick too well.</li>
    <li> The product is definitely working and I do notice an improvement. I did not have any discomfort or gum soreness or sensitivity as noted by many other users.</li>
    <li> This works great. Yoh can notice it worki g aftrr 3 days. Only fear is that its rotting my tooth and remove all my natural coats of protection on my teeth.</li>
    <li> These work pretty well. I can only use them for 3 days at a time because my teeth get soooo sensitive that i have trouble sleeping at night.</li>
    <li> I love how these strips stick to your teeth and I saw changes within 3days I highly recommend the 3d way better then the original ones</li>
    <li> My teeth are very strong, I can eat lots of sour fruits and food, but I don&#x27;t know what was in this product that made my teeth hurt real bad for a whole week. I do not suggest this product. I&#x27;m sure this works for many people, but I wasn&#x27;t one of them. The reason I bought this product was because I used the whitening pens before and they were fine and didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth, so I decided to get something stronger.</li>
    <li> These strips have come a long way since I last tried them in 2007. They attach very nicely and with a firm grip.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t salivate profusely, and there was no weird taste. I almost forgot I had them on at times. The results were really good. My teeth looked significantly whiter. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> ok but acturally prefer HD system</li>
    <li> toothache after using it</li>
    <li> Perfect thing. thanks</li>
    <li> works but they are messy, if you do more than 1 per day they hurt your teeth and make them extra sensative for days, I still have most of them un-used due to how annoying they were to use and use arm and hammer gel instead</li>
    <li> It works!  I found this cheaper at Costco, but the product itself works.  I&#x27;ve only cycled through 3 strips but you can noticeably see a difference after the 1st use... The 2nd and 3rd use don&#x27;t appear to have as dramatic as an effect as the first strip, but since this process involves the entire box, I will have to wait and see the final results.  They really have improved upon these compared to when they first came out with the product.  The strips do actually stay on with a grip on your teeth, which makes the process a whole lot easier!  The sensitivity isn&#x27;t really an issue for me either unlike the old days!  Overall, very happy with the progress of this product!  Cant wait to see what they have in store for us in the future.</li>
    <li> I have had teeth whitening done by dentists twice before in my life. Both times were with custom made trays and 15% gels. I have used other over the counter Rembrant whiteners a few times since then with average results. This whitening product is the BEST over the counter that I have tried! It works almost as good as the professional dentist whitening and at a fraction of the cost. Do not brush your teeth immediately before using this product as it will make your gums burn. I ball up two paper towels and put them between the back of my teeth and my tongue. The paper towel will absorb the spit so it won&#x27;t get under the strips and dilute the whitener. Set a cooking timer.  Keep the strips in the full time, 30 minutes for this kit. The maximum shade of whitening depends largely on keeping it in those last few minutes. Use each day until the strips run out. The hard part is avoiding tea and coffee. In my opinion this kit works good. I hope this information helps.</li>
    <li> These are pretty great.  I used the 1st box regularly.  I bought a second box to just sort of maintain the progress achieved by the first.  I&#x27;m a frequent coffee drinker and these have really helped brighten and whiten my smile.</li>
    <li> work better than other brands</li>
    <li> Best adhesion of any I tried.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Perfect. On time delivery.this is so much cheaper tan even the sles put on at the stores. The 3d really makes it adhere to your teeth better.</li>
    <li> These were very efficient! I wanted to whiten my teeth a little before my wedding.  I only used 4 strips I think and felt that was sufficient.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I stop using it after the 5th one because my teeth got very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts every time I breath cold air, and sometimes even eating.&lt;br /&gt;It did get better after days, but still don&#x27;t recommend it..</li>
    <li> These work good.  I had purchased a smaller container and they were good decided to purchase the larger one.</li>
    <li> Effective and I had a good e-coupon...otherwise, Crest strips can be a bit pricey but they are effective.</li>
    <li> These work great. Tried them on our dog Rufus, and now his teeth are at least 3 shades whiter.  Now when we compare his teeth to the other dogs in his neighborhood we can totally see the difference. He is the most popular dog on the block now.  There&#x27;s this one maltipoo that is such a total hater.  Every time Rufus comes by now she snaps and starts barking at him..Totally jealous because she isn&#x27;t the most popular one now.</li>
    <li> Makes your teeth hurt but you will get results.  I&#x27;ve used the VIVID which is rate 2, this one is 4 so I&#x27;m expecting really good results.  After two uses (two strips) I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference and am happy with this product.  I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using crest white strips for years and always have fantastic results to the point where I have strangers telling me how great my teeth look. However this last time i used them I saw Absolutey 0 difference. I don&#x27;t understand why. I barely even had any tooth sensitivity which I usually have when using the product. Something just isn&#x27;t right. I almost felt like these weren&#x27;t real Crest.</li>
    <li> They work great as one reviewer said you need to dry your teeth before you Apply. They have taken 20yrs of coffee, smoking stains off my teeth.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, quick acting whitening strips.  I used them a few weeks before a Wedding and they worked great.</li>
    <li> Good product.I like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Whitestrips for over a decade and this is the best one yet.  I enjoyed the immediate whitening effects within the first few days of use.  I do lament the fact that they subside within about 4 months, not the 6 months as stated.  The treatment was easy, it takes no more than 30 minutes a day and this particular product features a strong adhesive and seal which prohibit slipping and sliding.  I used these for spring wedding season, and they definitely provided me the sheer white color I was after.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and great service.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time around I gave this a shot. The first two times, I didn&#x27;t see results and felt that I quit too soon. This time I was determined to see it through. I bought the box with 44 treatments, and so far, I have used 40, as directed. I would say that I gave it a good shot. My results - - - absolutely zero. No difference whatsoever, despite suffering through the teeth sensitivity and annoyance in having to find time each day to do this. I am a middle aged woman with your typical yellowing that comes with age and a cup of coffee a day. Nothing major. Since the bottom strip only covers the front 4 teeth, I could see that they were exactly the same color as the other bottom teeth that were not covered by the strip. Really disappointing. I&#x27;m done...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but after 3 days I could see some improvement! After 20 you could tell a difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used five strips and my teeth looks more whiter than the other days...! I just love the way how it works and have low sensitivy that last for few minutes and that&#x27;s ok, will bought another box at the end of the year!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, regularly get compliments on how white my teeth are after using this product. Typically touch up ever year or so to maintain. Only downside is that it does not get in-between your teeth but that is a natural limitation of any strips.</li>
    <li> Very good product i use it and my family also..we all love the result ..worth it</li>
    <li> I love having white teeth! I used to use this all the time but my teeth are very sensitive! They say.. Beauty is pain so I would still use it. It does whiten your teeth! I would prefer the &amp;#34;advanced vivid&amp;#34; white one though.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love these! For the first time ever I have white teeth. They do not budge from the teeth after application. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> It worked ,was a bit afraid to try but it made a difference</li>
    <li> They hurt really bad and they didn&#x27;t make a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, didn&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
    <li> These definitely did what they were supposed to. My teeth are signifiantly whiter but without the fake whitened look. There was some minor tooth sensitivity, so I skipped a day here and there.</li>
    <li> Really works and very easy to use!</li>
    <li> My favorite teeth whitener (and I&#x27;ve tried them all!). Excellent high quality product. Really works</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the sensitivity that other people have complained about.  If you do not have problems normally with cold foods, you probably will be fine with these.  The product whitens my teeth nicely after only a few uses.  I just wish they didn&#x27;t have to stay on so long (30 minutes) to do the job.</li>
    <li> Started to see a difference immediately.  They will adhere better to dry teeth.  I applied for one hour instead of 1/2, not sure if it helps but didn&#x27;t hurt.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent results after the 8th session</li>
    <li> works. but i fell asleep with it overnight and woke up to a pounding headache and blood shot eyes. Food didn&#x27;t taste right all day, too, I think it messed with my tastebuds.</li>
    <li> These things truly work. If I have an event or an interview coming up, I will use these strips a couple of days prior and the results are noticeable. They are even noticeable the day of! Overall, great product. Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I did not see any outcome</li>
    <li> Best thing to use other than bleaching at the dentist office. When used as directed, it will whiten your teeth a couple of shades.</li>
    <li> i love crest whitening stripes. it didn&#x27;t affect my teeth sensitivity and now i feel more confident when smiling and taking photos.</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth very sensitive, but so worth it for the price! Had a vacation and I ordered them a month out so I&#x27;d have some pearly whites in the island pictures.</li>
    <li> Excelent product.  Nothing works better than these strips.  DON&#x27;T buy the cheaper ones !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This has to be a defective box of product!  The strips are SO think and dry they won&#x27;t even mold to my teeth.  I believe this is intentional being sent this way and heat got to the box or something.  I can&#x27;t even use them as they won&#x27;t bend.  I&#x27;d never recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good price and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> They work extremely well, and I&#x27;ve had excellent whitening results. I don&#x27;t like how sensitive they make my teeth. The pain is very temporary so I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best strips out there!</li>
    <li> They stay in place----I like that---No slipping!</li>
    <li> I bought the white strips for my grandsons who had just had their teeth cleaned. I was surprised how well it really worked. Their smile is brighter and they like it as well. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Works not really visible after 3 applications, but it is pretty obvious after probably 5-6. Doesn&#x27;t hurt the teeth, if it does do as directed - skip for a day or two, and continue.</li>
    <li> Worked great! I was able to notice the difference right away.</li>
    <li> This is just the best I love this Whitestrips they work great, I only used it for a week and my teeth is so much whiter already, this stuff is real good. I will always use this Whitestrips LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well, but I feel the results don&#x27;t last as advertised.</li>
    <li> it work, but I don&#x27;t know if I want to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;It whiten teeth after 3 days usage, but afterwards the effect seems to be unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is it make your teeth weaker, and if you have cavity, you will feel it instantly.</li>
    <li> Good product and price</li>
    <li> My teeth have always been well taken care of but even with daily brushing and care they were still slightly yellow even with constant. The white strips here took my teeth over the top to looking a million times better. My teeth are significantly whiter from what they used to be and the product worked as advertised. With only 20 treatments my teeth look perfect and anyone considering this product should certainly give them a shot I am 99% sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips are okay, but the effect doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.  Probably won&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the 2nd I&#x27;ve purchased. It helped a little to whiten my teeth by a shade, but it stopped and doesn&#x27;t get any whiter than that (which is not quiet white... fortunately, my teeth weren&#x27;t that yellow anyway, just thought it will actually make them WHITE?!!&amp;#62;)</li>
    <li> I have used this twice, each time for an hour. I noticed a difference right away. This does cause teeth sensitivity. That&#x27;s expected with any teeth whitening products. But I guess I used it for too long the 2nd time because my teeth hurt for a whole day. I couldn&#x27;t even sleep due to pain! So I&#x27;m spacing the treatments to every 3 days.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only done one treatment so far and holy shnikeys... I&#x27;m going to be blinding people by the time I&#x27;m done with the whole box! Here&#x27;s a photo of just one treatment...already took off like 3 years of smoking and drinking coffee.&lt;br /&gt;Only down side, and probably cuz I&#x27;m doing something wrong... Is i drool a lot when these things are on cuz I&#x27;m too scared to swallow (that&#x27;s what she said?) anyway.. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> As described. I have always liked this product. I feel it works very well.</li>
    <li> This product worked much more quickly than with other whitening products I have used and worth the additional cost for the professional version.</li>
    <li> shipped in no time. product is very good and easy on the pocket.&lt;br /&gt;it does the job pretty well, just like a professional job at the dentist with a fracture of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, if your gums are sensitive, use Sensodine tooth paste for couple of days then apply the strips ;) a trick that works everytime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazing product, very good seller</li>
    <li> does the job for cheaper than the dentist. only problem is it does tend to make my teeth sensitive for a day or so, but it goes away.</li>
    <li> It works fantastically well and I am very satisfied with the results. I usually leave it on for a little longer than 30min but I don&#x27;t use it everyday. Everyone&#x27;s teeth is different, so some people might need to use more than one box to actually see results.</li>
    <li> Fast whitening. There difference is obvious after 3 days. For the price and result, I can&#x27;t be more happier.</li>
    <li> This is my third box of Crest Whitestrips in a span of about six years. I did my first box according to the instructions and was really pleased with the results - since then, I keep a box handy for touch-ups every now and then. I&#x27;m a heavy herbal and green tea drinker, which is great for everything but trying to keep my whites pearly. These are perfect for brightening me up every few months or so. (And better than they were when I first started! These stay put on your teeth!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each individual use packet has two strips - one for top teeth, one for bottom. I always dry my teeth with a towel, slap these babies on, and catch up on some reading or watch a show on Hulu. I keep a cup handy if I need to spit (it makes me salivate for some reason...and I don&#x27;t like to swallow it)...overall, it&#x27;s not a glamorous affair, so I definitely wait until I have some me time. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;This is a convenient, affordable option for teeth whitening that WORKS. People compliment my teeth on a regular basis and usually end up asking me how I did it...I credit this product &amp; good oral hygiene habits. :) And of course, Amazon (and their awesome coupon you should be sure to clip!) has pretty much the best deal I&#x27;ve found. This can run you around $40 at your regular grocery stores, pharmacies, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity can definitely be an issue and is the reason I took off a star. If I lose track of time and leave them on longer, I pay for it later with sensitive teeth. Also, I pay attention to my teeth - if it starts to hurt, take them off! If I experience tooth sensitivity, I&#x27;ll wait a week or two until I try again. An enamel-strengthening toothpaste and mouthwash is important when whitening your teeth and helps a lot. As far as taste - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad. I don&#x27;t expect it to taste good and I don&#x27;t swallow it - I mean, hello, I&#x27;m chemically whitening my teeth. However, I will say I remember the taste/smell took some getting used to when I first started...but nothing major. (Also, white marks in the beginning is normal - don&#x27;t freak out, they go away. :) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;In terms of affordable and effective, this is your match. Whether it&#x27;s your first time or just a maintenance product, I definitely recommend.st started...but nothing major.

    <li> i dont know if these ones worked better than the regular ones, but i think theyre the same price and works just as good.  I drink coffee etcetc, and whitening my teeth every once n a while is a must.  But i get sensitive teeth after whitening, so i usually buy a box and only put one on once a week, if that.  keeps my teeth happier, i dont think it matters if you do them all at once or spread it out.but just dont abuse these things, it could be painful. OH tip: give at LEAST a couple hours after youve brushed your teeth to put the strips on, i sometimes get these shooting tooth pains with these strips, like REALLY painful....ummm but yah, you should still buy this stuff cuz the pain is worth your white smile in the end :)</li>
    <li> I started out with acceptably-colored, not yellow, teeth; I just wanted them a bit whiter, so I thought I was a good candidate for this product. I just didn&#x27;t notice any difference. All that time excessively salivating with these unpleasant-tasting strips on my teeth, the tooth sensitivity, and they&#x27;re not at all brighter, are you kidding me? What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening strips in the past, and these are the best strips I have used. They stay in place better and do a great job.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to give up my coffee, but it stains my teeth. There has been years of staining and using different toothpastes makes much of an improvement. I noticed a difference on the first day and my teeth are getting white with each use. I especially love the way the strips stick to my teeth. I used whitener before, but the strips slipped and slid and my mouth watered so I didn&#x27;t get the full effect of the strips. The strips are easy to peel off, just take your time and pull slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Crest 3d White Professional Effects Teeth Whitening strips.</li>
    <li> great bargain. cheaper compared to the price at grocery stores. does its job!</li>
    <li> I like these white strips but I like the original 3D white strips more. They both whiten the same but the original strips were thinner and seemed to form my teeth better than the newer strips. The newer strips are thicker and do not form each tooth as well as the other ones, thus making me feel that they&#x27;re only whiten the surface and cannot get in the cracks of my teeth. These white strips do work though. My teeth do get white, the strips being thicker than the old ones doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t whiten your teeth. I guess I just like the material of the old ones better.</li>
    <li> They do the job with no side effects or discomfort.  The results are noticeable within a few days of use.  Easy to use, and they stay put, even while drinking water.</li>
    <li> I have used all the 20 count and guess what it made my teeth yellow-er!! Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Purchase these about 1 time a year, continue to work great.  Can easily tell a difference after use.  No problem with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never been whiter , I really like the strips they dont fall off , they are very confortable and it took about 7 applications and my teeth were whiter than usual. i stopped using daily  now only use twice a week to mantain ... will purchase again</li>
    <li> They hurt my teeth gums to a point it makes me cringe. Haven&#x27;t noticed any change after 7 straight days using it other than a little bit of whitening.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Absolutely fantastic. Got it free from a promotion.</li>
    <li> Leaves my teeth leaving a little pulse but i have read that it is an okay thing. I also don&#x27;t like how i have to dry my teeth before putting it on because  it will slip right off. But otherwise it does they job.</li>
    <li> It really did make a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but these do work.  They did not make my teeth &amp;#34;Ross&amp;#34; white, friends reference, but noticeably whiter.  It would be 5 stars is my teeth hadn&#x27;t become more sensitive.  It&#x27;s not dramatic but just a new feeling that I&#x27;m still not comfortable with.  Overall still worth it.</li>
    <li> Working so far! First day it makes your teeth sensitive, but I think I may have gotten used to it after 3-4 days! So any reading this, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much change on my teeth. I&#x27;ll probably try the 2 hour express whitening strips. Pretty dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Works well, especially if you leave it on for 40 minutes or so.  I find that both brushing before using, and using on consecutive days increases my tooth sensitivity.  I used the strips twice and  saw a noticeable difference.  What I do not like is that the bottom strip is shorter in length than the top strip;  The old professional strips were the same length.</li>
    <li> The Crest 3D Whitestrips do exactly what they say they will. They whiten your teeth! Best to start off with a cleaning from the dentist and then keep them clean with these. Very easy top use. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I see the difference just after 3 uses! Easy to use and it works! I have gotten quite a few compliments on how white my teeth got. :)</li>
    <li> These whitestrips work very well.</li>
    <li> Purchase my White Strips regularly here on Amazon for a great quality freshly dated product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Okay I talked to my dentist about these strips as he&#x27;s a relative. This is what he said:&lt;br /&gt;The strips will temporarily open the pores of you&#x27;re teeth to whiten. In the pores there is a natural moisture (Ew I didn&#x27;t know that) when you use the strips your natural moisture will be depleted for awhile causing some sensitivity but this does not harm your enamel or teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have gotten good results with these. I don&#x27;t use use them every day though, when I&#x27;m trying to whiten like before my wedding, I use them every other day and I leave them on for 30-45 minutes at least. I also use ACT restoring mouth wash and toothpaste for sensitive teeth during the process as my dentist recommended. It beats the 500$ whitening professionally and it&#x27;s safe and it works. But yes there will be some sensitivity. Use the mouth wash and tooth paste and take every other day off to combat it.</li>
    <li> Good product. I could see the diff in few days after using it. My teeth are sensitive, but they are ok with this. It&#x27;s a bit pricey though.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest white strips for ten years now, people don&#x27;t even ask what I want for gifts because they already know. It had been about a year since I did a full box, I usually use one strip every week or so, and I started noticing some serious yellowing. Then that commercial got in my head and I was literally walking around thinking, &amp;#34;if you&#x27;re not whitening....&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I ordered these and they are just what I expected but better because the strips grip your teeth like never before. The solution bubbles up and tingles a little but I have not had any sensitivity. I use one or two at a time, and don&#x27;t use them every day. It will probably take me a month and a half to use this box up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with Crest White Strips!</li>
    <li> Bought this product a year ago and have been using it intermittently to touch up on my whitened teeth.  Crest has a lot of different whitening strips, but I recommend this type specifically.</li>
    <li> Definitely not professional results but very good for the price.</li>
    <li> After a failed first attempt (I couldn&#x27;t get the strips to stick), I tried the same box again. This time, the strips adhered to my teeth and whitened them to some extent. I would use them again.</li>
    <li> Great product...easy to use, only 30 min a day for 20 days, really does whiten teeth as advertised.  I give it 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> Crest whitestrips are the best teeth whitening retail product i have used.  Of course a professional Zoom whitening 1 hour session is the best and fastest whitening you can get, but that costs 200-400 dollars.  Crest offers a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used whitestrips in the past, but I&#x27;ve never used this kind with this advanced seal technology. After my first use, I couldn&#x27;t believe how difficult it was to remove the strips. It was borderline painful to peel them off my teeth. Be warned, if you have sensitive teeth, these strips are designed to stay on and you will feel it when it comes time to take them off.</li>
    <li> My teeth are so white and I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or any problems! These strips have been terrific. I have never used any other whitening products and my teeth were very stained.  This is a wonderful product! I am definitely going to purchase it again!</li>
    <li> This product is fairly easy to use.  One time I had a problem with the strip staying on my teeth but once I figured out the best way to use them it worked fine</li>
    <li> Very good. It&#x27;s the second time that I&#x27;m buying this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. I will certainly keep buying this product</li>
    <li> The best stripes to whiten teeth.  I have tried many other products including the professional dentist.  I found that this product works the best.</li>
    <li> Brightened up my coffee stained teeth....it really works.</li>
    <li> Strips work great when used as prescribed.  Great deal for the price.  I would purchase them again.  Highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these are great. Especially not for the money. I saw all these great reviews for the Crest 3D and thought I should give it a try. First of all there will be sensitivity, some people more than others. If you floss and put them on right after you floss, you will be cringing. Don&#x27;t do that. They actually don&#x27;t work great either. Some other brands such as Rembrandt which are much cheaper and dissolve actually worked the same. They really don&#x27;t work way better than the other brands. I would recommend staying away from these if the price of these remain the same.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended these and I am happy with the results.  Teeth are a little extra sensitive during the two weeks that I&#x27;m using these and maybe a week or two afterwards, but everything returns to baseline eventually.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I was going to have whitening done at the dentist but my sister said to try these first and I&#x27;m glad I did! They stay on so much better than other crest white strips I e used and thus I have noticed a whitening. Occ tooth soreness but not unbearable and not for long amts of time. Very easy to wear.</li>
    <li> Easy application, and I could already tell the difference after a few treatments.  It did make my teeth sensitive so I should start using it every other day to see if the sensitivity goes away.  It is a nice product overall.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t going to give you celebrity white teeth, but they will definitely remove stains and give you a brighter smile that you&#x27;ll notice after just a few days of treatment.</li>
    <li> Brush yo teeth like normal mouthwash like normal use these work!</li>
    <li> Thjs does as it say and easy to do</li>
    <li> The product is really good , u can see a difference in ur teeth . They do become whiter but in my case , next day, my teeth become very sensitive .. It&#x27;s hurts a bit and had headache .. But they are whiter :)</li>
    <li> During a conversation with a friend, when I mentioned I wanted whiter teeth he recommended these to me as he had had good results with them. I could see the difference only a few days after the first use. They&#x27;re great, i thought they would be a bit fiddly but they attach really well to my teeth</li>
    <li> I used these twice a year. love them</li>
    <li> I wish they was longer</li>
    <li> didnt notice a difference just made my teeth hurt &amp;#62;.&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> White strips work great! Help lighten teeth and are more affordable than traditional mouth trays. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great change, noticeable and gums and teeth were not really sensitive as they have been with the trays from dentist. Works well and would use again!</li>
    <li> White teeth. It&#x27;s always apparent but not immediately obvious. Girls, interviewers, everyone always remembers that there&#x27;s something positively off about you. They think about it for a while before they realize it&#x27;s your crisp, flourescent, white teeth. Boom. They&#x27;ve been thinking about you for longer than they probably should have and your foot is in the door.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well these worked. Got rid of some stains that I thought were there for life. You don&#x27;t have to wear them long. Only drawback is that they make my mouth increase saliva production which tends to loosen the strips. But since you don&#x27;t have to wear them long it&#x27;s not a huge problem.</li>
    <li> Definitely work, but its a bit of a slow process, and kind of a pain to remember.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, mostly convient to use and it did whiten my teeth. We will see how long it is effective.</li>
    <li> These worked really really well.  My teeth were noticeably whiter after just a few days and have stayed whiter months after finishing the treatment.  I didn&#x27;t notice any sensitivity and will buy these again in a few months just to keep up with having beautiful white teeth.</li>
    <li> People. Please stop complaining about whether or not these came in the box - it&#x27;s an obvious shipping issue. (Box: Bigger/ more likely to be damaged, extra waste, etc. Then, of course, there is the cost of shipping.) Mine also arrived without the box (which I really appreciated) and were in perfect condition and fresh. Kudos to the seller. The strips whiten, and I am happy. Can we focus on the actual product performance (not the box), and review that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I will not hesitate to order these again from the same seller; they work, do not cause excessive pain nor are they uncomfortable to wear. The bonus is that the seller did not send me any wasteful packaging.</li>
    <li> Never seriously considered getting whitestrips, but after trying a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; version where I had to deal with messy gels and a retainer-like teeth guard, I decided to try them. I was truly surprised how quickly and effectively they worked. Like the box says, after a few times, you&#x27;ll already start to notice results. They&#x27;re super easy to put on and take off and virtually no mess. I wouldn&#x27;t wear them out or if you have to talk to people, but definitely for 30 mins before you go bed is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love having white teeth as I drink coffee daily I have to be on top of it, thx Crest</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and can&#x27;t stop raving about it. It has truly been able to make me feel better about smiling. My teeth has changed with only a few strips, I can really see the difference. I&#x27;m going to continue to use them all and see how much whiter their going to get. This product is definitely worth the money and I will buy again if needed be!!</li>
    <li> Works amazing! I saw fast improvement in the coloration of my teeth.  You can even skip between days and still gradually get whiter teeth.</li>
    <li> Never tried it before and I took a chance on it. Definitely saw a difference after some uses. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> These white strips really do get the job done. For 20 days, my teeth get whiter and whiter. Easy, painless and efficient- these work great!</li>
    <li> Love these strips!  My daughter and I both use them and she is a very hard one to please!  Doesn&#x27;t mind the taste at all and her friends noticed right away!</li>
    <li> I love this strength over the 1-3 strengths by crest white strips. This version has superior durability and stick to my teeth (almost too well) which the lower strengths lack. The other strips I had tried in the past would always slip and move on my teeth and the formula would irritate my gums easily and I almost couldn&#x27;t use them on a daily basis because of the gum irritation.  I&#x27;ve used this product for 5 days so far and I can already see a difference!</li>
    <li> I cannot say that it does not affect my teeth at all because my teeth became quite sensitive for like 2 days after I finished using it, but the whitening effect is not visible.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I noticed a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth, but I think it did something.&lt;br /&gt;A couple times I drifted to sleep with the strips on, so I had them on my teeth for an hour instead of a half hour, and my teeth hurt the whole next day.  That eventually went away, though.  But as long as I had them on for the directed time, I didn&#x27;t experience any pain or sensitivity.</li>
    <li> After I went through about 10 of the strips, my teeth is visibly whiter. I thought my teeth couldn&#x27;t be whiten because I was born with yellow teeth. the down side is that my teeth get sensitive after using it.</li>
    <li> Recently this product is not avalable in the local stores. They only offered the strips that had to be worn longer. These are 30 minutes each day for 7 days. great price also.</li>
    <li> These work, but slowly. That’s not a bad thing. I get zingers in my teeth if I whiten too much. I can use one of these wait two or three days and do another. If I use them every day I get zingers. So I wait between uses. Each time I use them I see a small difference, so they get whiter with each use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely positively LOVE this product!!  I saw a BIG difference in 2 uses!!!  Tooth sensitivity is a down-side but the overall rating of this product is great!  Still using to this day and absolutely adore it.  If you really have sensitive teeth use Sensodyne to reduce tooth sensitivity, or you can go out and get the Crest Sensitivity toothpaste to use with this product.  If sensitivity is too intense, use every other day but if you use the sensitivity toothpaste, you should have no problem. :)))</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this and truth be told I was a bit skeptical. However, was pleasantly surprised how effective strips are; teeth became whiter after third day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about every 2-3 yrs to keep my smile looking white. This last purchase was for my husband whose teeth were very yellow (he&#x27;d never whitened before). He started noticing a difference by the 4th to 5th time he used the strip. He still has 10 more strips to go. I joke around with him that his family won&#x27;t be able to recognize him next time they see him. He has a wide smile, so we might cut some of the last strips to place on the side teeth/molars. But it&#x27;s not really that noticeable.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I purchased this and I&#x27;m glad I bought these strips.  My teeth were significantly whiter after just three uses and I stopped.  I didn&#x27;t want to appear as if I had gone and bleached my teeth, that&#x27;s not my style :).  So, I still have a lot more when I want to freshen up.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips ever since they&#x27;ve sold them.  They keep getting better and more effective.  I bought these for my son after he had his braces removed.  Now he has a beautiful, straight, pearly-white smile!&lt;br /&gt;Even my dentist agrees that they work.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D white luxe strips work well at whitening teeth but they cause tooth sensitivity!</li>
    <li> Works well. Saw a difference after 3 days of daily use. I have sensitive teeth anyways so i figured i&#x27;d kill two birds with one stone by using Sensodyne toothpaste to minimize any sensitivity. Its day three and so far no worsening of sensitively. Remember to place strip just high enough to cover all teeth, placing it too far on the gums is a big no no (it  burns!). 3D effects was worth the $28 bucks (After $10 mail-in rebate).&lt;br /&gt;-Happy Customer :)</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I think it whitens my teeth a little bit each time from coffee or tea stains.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone with yellow teeth as a possible help.</li>
    <li> This product works very fast and very well.  It takes thirty minutes, so you need to have some time for it.  They have improved these so much since the last time I bought them.  When you put them on they do not slip or slide around, they stay where they should be.  The effects are visible right after you use them.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really a great product but i want buy to my family member but i couldn&#x27;t more than three !!&lt;br /&gt;why ??</li>
    <li> I have been using Crest White Strips for a long time off and on. I have always been pleased with the results I get from using them. I could always see the difference in my teeth in a few days if that long. I must admit they are pricey but worth it. I will always do 10 treatments and wait a couple months before using the rest because the whitening is farely quick for me and satifying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest whitening strips for years and the results have always been great. I just use a few strips a month to maintain the whiteness of my teeth since I&#x27;m a coffee drinker. My teeth don&#x27;t get as sensitive as they used to with the older style strips. When people ask me how I get my teeth so white, I tell them about these strips. Even my dentist noticed how white my teeth are!</li>
    <li> Have tried whitening strips in the past that did not work, but these do. Very good for the price, make sure you leave them on for at least an hour, up to two hours for best results. Definitely try them.</li>
    <li> Works good and these are way cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my teeth whitening holy grail. Though I love the supreme cos it works fast, I prefer this because it clings onto my teeth very well and (believe it or not) allows me talk and drink.</li>
    <li> I have tried 3 types of Crest strips (7-day, 3-day, etc.) and in my opinion, these are definitely the best balance of results and (dis)comfort.  In my experience, all 3 strips gave very similar (if not the same) whitening results.  The determining factors of which strips to purchase depends on the amount of patience you may have and how sensitive your teeth/gums may be.  With this version, you apply a top and bottom strip once a day for 30 minutes (20 days duration).  The final results do take longer to obtain but i experienced very minimal teeth sensitivity.  However, I will add that I use Sensodyne toothpaste which helps quite a bit with minimizing sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips themselves were very easy to apply and did a great job at adhering to my teeth.  They do not have an excessive amount of whitening gel (compared to the 7-day strips) so application was very clean.  The &amp;#34;AdvanceSeal&amp;#34; technology worked very well as the strip was still holding strong to my teeth after the required 30 minutes.  Overall, usage was uneventful (which is a great thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using some form of whitening strips every 10-12 months for the past 5 years and these are my favorite version.  I highly recommend this product if you do not mind the extended duration and/or if you suffer from teeth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> this is the second day i use it ..... my teeth so hurt....i&#x27;m so regret i use this suck products......</li>
    <li> It worked very well within the first two days, but soon after using my teeth became sensitive. Recommend using every other day to avoid teeth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> They were shipped fast and was in good packaging, I don&#x27;t know how they worked I bought them for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Use in Moderation, Not to have transparent teeth. This product is banned in Europe, peroxide damages enamel</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve purchased these sooner.  I am only on day 4 and have already seen a HUGE difference!  I have used whitening kits previously and they had a horrible taste and have burned my fingers but these are amazing.  I also have not had any tooth sensitivity!  Can&#x27;t wait to see how my teeth look after I complete the entire box!</li>
    <li> I could tell a big difference after about 3 or 4 treatments.  Your teeth does get sensitive after which lasts less then 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I am a smoker and coffee drinker. This works for great for removing the stains in between dental cleanings. Just follow the directions and you will see the difference in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> Did not whiten as I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used about 10 days worth, and it works really well. My teeth are noticeably whiter. Also, everything was as described. Package fully intact, not damages, looked and was  brand new.</li>
    <li> not surprised that I got what I paid for. It did what its suppose to do, no complaints. plus I got the $10 rebate for purchasing :)</li>
    <li> They work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> It is way cheaper than a dentist whitening treatment. You can see the difference in color within a few days. It might make your teeth to be sensible to cold for a little bit but nothing permanent in my case. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Horrible!! It left white spots on my teeth that didn&#x27;t go away! And it always hurt my teeth badly. I can&#x27;t even describe the sharp pains. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!</li>
    <li> It really works with no sensitivity issues whatsoever.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It really works.</li>
    <li> kinda iffy about these. I&#x27;ve only used two of them.</li>
    <li> on time del, meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> What a great way to brighten your smile at home. Easy as 1.2.3.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! I am addicted to this product</li>
    <li> Works better than the dentist</li>
    <li> I used it several times but seems not to notice much difference between before and after. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s cheaper than going to dentist.</li>
    <li> OK, first lets talk about cost effectiveness. For the price of this product ($35), the strips do a good job of removing yellow and stains from teeth. No, it won&#x27;t give you those &amp;#34;bleached&amp;#34; white looking teeth, but it will remove layers of yellow on both the inside and outside of your enamel. Does it look the same as a $200 whitening treatment? Probably not, but for those that need some years of yellowing removed, or perhaps as a maintenance treatment, this is the product - at the right price - for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my own personal success with these strips? Before, I had teeth that were slightly yellowed -  most likely from my love of drinking tea. I used the strips as directed, 1/2 hour every day. I put them on at night and just went about my business. No, they don&#x27;t have a pleasant taste and they aren&#x27;t the most comfortable things to have in your mouth, but should you really expect a yummy flavor from strips with peroxide in them, striping off layers of yellow? Nope. I noticed results after four days, and after 15 days my teeth were exactly what I wanted - a nice natural white color (not &amp;#34;bleached&amp;#34; white, as I think that looks silly and wouldn&#x27;t want that). I didn&#x27;t need the full 20 days of treatment, so I still have 5 strips I can use as maintenance in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 because I did have some sensitivity issues after about a week of using them. Nothing too serious - my teeth just felt tingly and cold air/food bothered me a little. The package does say that there may be some teeth sensitivity while using the strips, so it&#x27;s not like consumers aren&#x27;t warned beforehand. Also, you have to be careful how you place the strips on your teeth. If you put part of the strip on your gum, it&#x27;s going to hurt after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good whitening treatment for the price. I would recommend this to anyone in need of an affordable whitening that wants a natural looking smile. If you&#x27;re looking for bleached white teeth, however, this is not the product for you.r bleached white teeth, however, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> these are great. my teeth are sensitive and i fear bleaching to the degree that i don&#x27;t do it and never have with any regularity.  these are wonderful.  the taste is ok.  there is no sensitivity and the white pops after a few uses.  i will use them as long they are around</li>
    <li> I tried these being a long time coffee drinker and smoker. Yes they did whiten my teeth a bit but at a cost. They made my teeth so sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t drink anything hot or cold without tooth pain. I had to visit my dentist which informed me that regardless what they claim they do erode tiny holes in the tooth which leaves access to the nerves causing the pain. I was told to stop using these and start brushing with sensidyne toothpaste. The pain has slowly eased. White teeth might look nice but who cares when your in pain!</li>
    <li> It works but not as strong as advertise</li>
    <li> They are excellent. Been using them for years. If you can tolerate the first few days of pain it&#x27;ll eventually stop hurting and you&#x27;ll get amazing results!&lt;br /&gt;Tip: cut the strips smaller to fit your teeth area only and do not wrap it over your gums. This will help greatly in feeling less gum pain.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this. It makes no difference. If you want whiter teeth you need to go do professional whitening not only does this not work but it caused me so much pain.</li>
    <li> It works but hurt my teeth. After the second time I use it, I had toothache for about two days. So, I don&#x27;t think I will use it any more.</li>
    <li> I read about these on some forums and in reviews before I bought them and decided to give them a shot. Like another reviewer I found that the strips are large enough that I can cut them in half lengthwise and get two uses out of one strip. It does seem like my teeth have gotten whiter, which is the goal. But I&#x27;ll have to check with my dentist next time I&#x27;m there to see how far up the white scale I&#x27;ve really progressed.</li>
    <li> Not a very good taste, even once taken off the teeth. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference after using them.</li>
    <li> Excellent results. I can start to see whiter teeth after the third treatment. Read the directions first and it&#x27;s so easy. No pain, no problem. Teeth do get whiter, just don&#x27;t expect miracles. Each treatment is just 30 minutes. The different is noticeable. Lasts about 6 months. Then get another box. These strips cover the front teeth, upper and lower. After the full treatment you can look in the back of your mouth and see the difference; front teeth that show are much whiter. I plan to continue to buy one box every 6 months.</li>
    <li> I only used it three or four times and my teeth are definitely White enough.</li>
    <li> How many times am I going to have to write a review on something I&#x27;ve already reviewed more than once before</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this except that if you have sensitive teeth you should try it for three days then give your teeth/gums a day off so that you dont get sensitivity. As far as results , they are as good as I have ever gotten and I have tried everything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for three times and I can&#x27;t use it any more. It make my teeth too painful that I can&#x27;t sleep.It does whiten my teeth a little bit,but the feeling is so bad. Now I don&#x27;t know what to do with the rest of it.</li>
    <li> I only had to use one box! These really work and they are so convenient to use. We are now hooked on the toothpaste, as well. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> great price and teeth are so much whiter</li>
    <li> I have yellow stained teeth probably from coffee. Tried some gel before but wasn&#x27;t really brightened up my smile. This guy starts working since the first use. :D  After a while I notice my teeth look less yellow. It&#x27;s not bright white of course but look whiter &amp; nicer now. I tried to leave it on about an hour and it could get sensitive. Better stick with the 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> The strips are easy to apply, have little taste and do what they are suppose to. The have made my gums a little sensitive but not bad. They will dry lips if left in too long. I am very satisfied with the results. Would use them again.</li>
    <li> Age: 56&lt;br /&gt;Teeth: still have them all - haw haw haw! and they&#x27;s purdy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using crest whitestrips (once or twice a year) for years now, and they do work quite well for me. My teeth aren&#x27;t deeply stained, however, so if yours are, you may have different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regular coffee drinking and occasional wine drinking, I find the Crest strips to work effectively to brighten and whiten my teeth. I&#x27;l use them once or twice a year--especially now with the stronger versions, I find I don&#x27;t need to use them as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using them regularly, I find I can purchase a box and use them every day once a day for about four to five days, and then use the rest for once weekly &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; until the strips are used up. If you are just beginning to use this product, I suggest you follow the instructions to the letter, for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is tooth sensitivity, and their solution to cut back on the use of the product does help. If you can not cry like a little bitch when it happens and suck it up, the little bit of sensitivity is worth it (teehee). Seriously, though, the sensitivity goes away. If yours does not or you just can&#x27;t stand it, then try one of the products that isn&#x27;t as strong, or use something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to big ass white-toothed grins, y&#x27;all.</li>
    <li> Maybe because I quit smoking and am not a coffee drinker, my teeth didn&#x27;t get that much whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive teeth and this product wasn&#x27;t too bad. If I felt my teeth hurting I&#x27;d take a day off and would be able to resume the next day. I didn&#x27;t have any residual sensitivity from using these.</li>
    <li> I bought the strips online, an saw that there was a 10.00 rebate. So I sent for that. Thought well this will be nice. And so far that hasn&#x27;t even came to me. Ok, I used every strip, but instead of doing the 30 min, I kept them on anywhere from 45 min to 2 hrs every single night for 20 days.  I literally could not see any dif  in my teeth.  I am not sure why. I mean ,I take care of my teeth, but still I thought they would look whiter. But they did not. So, today I contacted Crest Co. . Because it states ,if you are not satisfied they would give you a full refund back. That is exactly why I tried them, cause I thought what have I got to lose. Right? Wrongggg..&lt;br /&gt;I told the lady from Crest everything I have just said, she said I was unable to receive a refund because I had already sent in for that 10.00 rebate. And she said , you can only get one . Needless to say I was very mad and upset that I was unable to get my refund.  I told the lady that I would expect that they would deduct the 10.00 that I had sent for, but she said there was no way.. I even spoke to her supervisor. So, what I am telling anyone who reads my review, if you try their product, don&#x27;t send in for the 10.00 rebate. Wait till you have used all the product, then if it doesn&#x27;t help you, you should be able to get your refund. Atleast that is what they led me to believe.  But as for myself, I was very disappointed in the product. It did not whiten my teeth at all as far as I could tell. Barb</li>
    <li> They work, but not as well as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I grew up in a family that never talked about dental hygiene. My teeth were not a pretty sight. I have used this for 3 days (have the fourth in now) and the difference is already remarkable. No more hiding my teeth when I talk! I can&#x27;t even imagine what they&#x27;ll look like after I finish the pack... I&#x27;m a little afraid I won&#x27;t recognize myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would have difficulty putting/keeping them on, but it&#x27;s actually pretty easy. My teeth are not perfectly straight, but I still manage to get these to cover all of the area needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people mentioned sensitivity. I have always had sensitive teeth, but I have had no problem with these so far. They even go over my gums at some points (as I said, my teeth are not straight), but it hasn&#x27;t bothered me a bit. I will update if this changes throughout the course of the treatments, but I was so excited that I had to review this now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest whitening strips for years.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve just reached my whitening saturation or what, but I don&#x27;t notice a dramatic difference in color when I&#x27;m using these.  Also, this formulation has caused me major sensitivity that I didn&#x27;t have from Crest whitening strips in the past.  I actually have to use a toothpaste against sensitivity in the days before and after I plan to whiten.  I&#x27;m going to use this box up and then probably get a different formula.  I&#x27;m torn though, because I want something more effective than this since I&#x27;m not getting the results I want, but the sensitivity is really painful.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Its.. Good and im using it.. Waiting for the result.. Moreover, wish u make discount if anyone order more than one</li>
    <li> I have used crest strips on and off for years with pretty good results. I hesitated to buy the professional effects because of all the reviews reporting tooth pain/sensitivity.  I have never had a problem with sensitivity so decided to give it a shot thinking the worst that could happen is it would hurt my teeth a little but if it did I could always take an advil or discontinue use.  I am on day 11 and am not seeing noticeable results.  For me, the strips do not adhere to my teeth as tightly as I had expected based on the product description, therefore they are not at all difficult to remove.  I have not experienced any pain or sensitivity but on the other hand, I have also not seen a lot of whitening.  It has been 2 years since I last whitened my teeth and I do drink coffee everyday but the box says that it removes 14 years, or something similar, of stains. I agree with another reviewer on here that the old crest strips that were cheaper and used twice a day were much more effective at whitening teeth. One more thing, with the older brand of crest strips, I used to have a lot of gel remaining on my teeth that would need brushed off after but none at all with these new strips which makes me wonder...  I have 9 more days of strips so maybe there will be a miraculous whitening at like day 19 or something, if that happens, i will definitely let you know.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried whitening strips and I am def. impressed. Started noticing results within 3-4 uses! I didn&#x27;t have any problems with them staying on or anything like that. I would def. use again</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t do at all what it says. I wish I could get a refund. My teeth aren&#x27;t yellow they are more of an off white and I was looking for a brighter smile. I don&#x27;t see a difference at all.</li>
    <li> i really loved this product i didn&#x27;t used it all but it gave me a good result :D&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it for everyone</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money. Maybe I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t possible. My teeth weren&#x27;t so much stained as yellowed. Used the product. They are the same. So didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; them AT ALL.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t whiten very much, i have sensitive teeth and these really made mine hurt, and they didnt stick very well to my teeth.</li>
    <li> These really work but use them sparingly as they can make your gums blistered and teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> These strips made my teeth super sensitive for hours afterwards, even breathing hurt!  I can&#x27;t say how well they really worked because I only used them a few times before deciding the pain wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> They work very well but I still expected more whiteness. I guess I must be demanding but overall , the bottom line is they work! It might work better I guess for different people who have different natural whiteness on their teeth. I highly recommened them.</li>
    <li> This product work,  fits to your teeth and is very comfortable , easy to apply.</li>
    <li> They work pretty well, can definitely tell the difference. I have used these many times, about once every year. Easy to put on, stay on your teeth, and don&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
    <li> This whitestrip does make my teeth whiter after fews days of using it. However, after I have used the entire package, my teeth slowly losing its white color. I was expecting it to last at least for a few months, but my teeth only remain white for a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;P.S I dont drink coffee at all, I guess I need to go for a professional dental whitening treatment.</li>
    <li> Not sure if these work yet.  I&#x27;ll update later.  Only on day 3. I have sensor teeth/gums and these don&#x27;t seem to cause any issues with that.</li>
    <li> Works great on my teeth. I receive compliments everywhere I go. Some say it hurts their teeth, I have never had any problems. But when the price is low, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try to find out!</li>
    <li> Great results.  Love this product</li>
    <li> Crest white strips just keep getting and better. They keep my teeth beautifully white. I&#x27;ve been using them for years.</li>
    <li> I used this product 2 years ago and I had to stop after 7 strips, not because my teeth were a bit sour (yes it does), but because it got to the point they were &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; white and shiny. So I gave it to my wife and she only used 5 strips and stopped with the same reason. We were extremely happy.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought it yesterday again. After 2 years my teeth still look good. So I used only strip and they already look perfect. This time my teeth are no longer sensitive like before. I am giving the rest to my friend, who is going to have a wedding next week. I am sure he and his wife will love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these in a few years. I seem to remember Crest only having 1 choice of whitestrips back then and now there are several. I chose this as it seemed to be strong but not too strong and had good ratings. Also it used to come with a piece of paper with different shades of white to compare your teeth before and after. I miss that. It&#x27;s so hard to tell if there is a difference or not. I just finished the treatment and no one has commented on my teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, something I never experienced before is about a week in I noticed a few hours after using the strips my teeth start hurting and becoming sensitive to hot and cold. It go worse as I used it more. Usually goes away after a day. I&#x27;m not sure if this is strong than the old one I used to buy or I have more receding gums or what. Also they are much more stickier and really need to pull hard to get them off. Which is better because the old ones would slide around and make a lot of saliva in my mouth which is always pretty gross.</li>
    <li> These really work well.  No problems at all with it and it did indeed whiten my teeth.</li>
    <li> Be careful if you are using a clipped coupon for this product and are applying for a rebate because P&amp;G is denying the rebate if you had gotten a discount via coupon or subscribe &amp; save. Even though it&#x27;s mentioned in T&amp;Cs, I had never had a problem in the past getting both the coupon and rebate for myriad products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Amazon came through in the end and gave me promo credit. But be very wary of P&amp;G and how they stick to the letter of the law.</li>
    <li> I only used the strips 4 times and my teeth are much whiter, Sometimes my teeth get a little sensitive and it feels like you are getting little shocks from the bleach but that is expected. Why pay for it to be professionally done when you can use these white strips.</li>
    <li> 4 of the 20 strips were defective:  they would not stick to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe there is a problem with the product.  I believe that the product was mishandled in storage prior to shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Amazon I would like:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Assurance that your health products are not &amp;#34;stolen&amp;#34; merchandise that is being re-sold through Amazon by 3rd parties?&lt;br /&gt;2)  Replacement of the defective strips or refund for the portion of my package which was defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed:  John Medders</li>
    <li> They work but DO NOT leave them on for more than the time in the instructions. They can cause severe tooth pain. One day I accidentally left them on for an hour because I was wearing them while cleaning. Later that night my tooth break to hurt and they were so sore that I couldn&#x27;t sleep all night; even after taking pain relievers!</li>
    <li> Have you bitten 10 lemons at the same time?? Try this, then here you go!!</li>
    <li> This product does not budge once you put it on your teeth, which is one of the reasons I repurchase this product. But this makes my teeth SUPER sensitive after about 30 minutes of use and I would just them for less time but less than 30 minutes I don&#x27;t see much difference in my teeth. Using them once a week has helped me cut down on the sensitivity rather than twice a week</li>
    <li> great, as described and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Not working as dramatic as I wanted but my teeth really aren&#x27;t that stained.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t look any further for whitening assistance. excellent product, fair price.</li>
    <li> Gave my teeth a great new white look!</li>
    <li> I was a smoker for 20 years (recently quit YAY!! lol) and a huge soda drinker for most of my life (which I also completely gave up). I could not afford the $500 plus dollars to get my teeth whitened by my dentist, so I decided to try this product. I already have very sensitive teeth, and can only use sensodyne tooth paste. I did not notice any more sensitivity than usual except on the 2 days where I attempted to use the strips twice in one day. As long as I stuck to the once a day use, the sensitivity was not noticeable at all. I put these in every morning while I did my morning workout, since you are able to sip water with them in...and I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all. I LOVE them and they will officially be my go to product for teeth whitening from now on! My teeth look amazingly better!!! I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments, and could not be happier with the results!!</li>
    <li> Love crest whitening products!</li>
    <li> I used it right away and removed years of smoking and coffee stains in about an hour. My family noticed it right away.Great product.</li>
    <li> Within the first week I could already see very noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;Like everyone else has mentioned, there was some sensitivity, some days were not too bad and other days seemed worse.  I think it was worth it though.&lt;br /&gt;I used one per day, first thing in the morning for 30 minutes.  I would break a toothpick in half to get a flatter/blunter end so I could push the strips in between my teeth.  I did not do that the first week and the small spaces between my teeth started to look darker because the front of my teeth were getting so much whiter.  The strips do stick to your teeth very well, can sometimes be a pain to get them off, but i would take that over the strips sliding off.  After removing the strips, some of my teeth were left with very white spots, but they go away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;One complaint I do have with this product is the strip for the upper teeth could be a bit wider.  In order to cover the front of my upper teeth, it did not leave much of the strip to fold under to the back of the teeth, not a big problem though.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fine...results from the product were fair, not great.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice. I had to wait a week until doing the second treatment because it made my teeth even more sensitive than they already are (by the next day they feel normal again). I&#x27;ve always suffered from sensitive teeth, so it wasn&#x27;t a shocker. The stains on my teeth, close to my gums, are still there. Maybe it takes more treatments to whiten those areas, but I dread so bad doing it that I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll ever do it as much as it should be done to see enough of a difference. After I take the strips off, and brush my teeth, 3 hours later I start feeling bad zapping in all the teeth that were treated...and it gets worse as time goes by. By 9 hours after it was done, the pain starts to subside. It&#x27;s hard for me to function on the day I do it, and I even tried taking Advil to relieve the pain. They do appear to be slightly whiter, but with these sensitive teeth of mine, it&#x27;s painful!</li>
    <li> Whitens the teeth, at a much lower cost that going to the dentist. That&#x27;s it lol</li>
    <li> Decided to try these when they were being offered with a coupon a few weeks ago as I always wanted to give them a shot, but didn&#x27;t want to spend so much if they didn&#x27;t help. Very happy that I did. I&#x27;m a soda and coffee drinker so my teeth were fairly yellow to start. I used them daily for the first week and have being using them a couple times per week since then. I can definitely see noticeably whiter teeth in that time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced too much tooth sensitivity, just a bit here and there but it fades after a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***My only con is that they aren&#x27;t quite long enough. They only cover the front 8 teeth on top and bottom. That&#x27;s a good way to tell if they&#x27;re working though. The teeth that aren&#x27;t covered are much yellower. I&#x27;m going to try to use 1 &amp; 1/2 strips on top and bottom to finish the box to reach more teeth each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with results so far though and likely will buy again when a good deal is on.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I really noticed a difference or not.  After a week use I did have to stop for a little due to teeth sensitivity others have mentioned.  Ended up using all 20 strips but was more on a every other day basis till completed.</li>
    <li> Tried the regular Crest Tooth Whitening Kit and it did nothing.  This is much better.  It works even better if you do one session right after another.</li>
    <li> They work as advertised, but your teeth do get a little sensitive halfway through the treatment. I broke mine up into two sessions.</li>
    <li> No good i waste my money</li>
    <li> Good price came in great time and worked amazingly!</li>
    <li> Great product, works as described.</li>
    <li> I have a subscription to these White Strips because they work extremely well and i do see a difference in just a couple days of use. I subscribe so I get a delivery every 3-4 months. I highly recommend these strips and no issues as long as the teeth are  all real (no caps, crowns, bridges, or implants). Also, some people have a sensitivity when the strips are used or kept on for longer than 30 minutes or more. I don&#x27;t have that problem because I&#x27;m lucky and know how to follow instructions :).</li>
    <li> These whitening products make your teeth really sensitive and don&#x27;t stay put. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth but after using these strips ONCE my teeth were very sensitive for an entire day. It was so miserable I threw the rest of the box away.</li>
    <li> They did whiten my teeth, but CAUTION!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re onto the last five strips or so, they will begin to hurt. It&#x27;s hard to describe the pain, which feels internal and stinging in the teeth. This was very painful, but without professional whitening at a dentist, this is the best option for whitening your teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works great for me.</li>
    <li> My teeth got so much whiter, they came I&#x27;m fast. Every penny you pay for this is worth it, considering how white this can make your teeth, all of my friends noticed and now I am very confident of my smile</li>
    <li> A bit expensive for what it is though they do work for me. I left my first one on for 45 minutes. A portion of my gum had turned white and later died and shed with no pain. only pain is from frequent (once a day) use that can cause my teeth to be sensitive to temperature differations. It is not a disabling pain which will leave me coming back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First application has the biggest improvement for me and a few friends afterwards the reward of brighter/whiter teeth falls off which each use.</li>
    <li> I noticed my teeth getting lighter over the past week. Would have given it 5 stars but it didn&#x27;t make my teeth like REALLY white. But I guess it&#x27;s because the stains are harder to get off since I have never gotten any treatments before. Probably just need to get another box or something. By the way, I also just bought the 3D White toothpaste and mouthwash. Makes me feel like I have new teeth after I get it all done (: enjoy.!</li>
    <li> After buying and returning so many counterfeit gel refills for my trays (and Amazon continues to sell them anyway) I finally turned to these and have been amazed at how well they work.  Yes, &#x27;d rather have the gel in the trays, but the hassle wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It is inexpensive and is worth spending your money on rather than buying something at an expensive price.</li>
    <li> Great results.  Looking at the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture I took horrifies me.  The white strips held in place nicely even while exercising.  My teeth are very sensitive, and although some days were more sensitive than others during the process, I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t get excruciating.  I will look forward to using these again.</li>
    <li> I thought my teeth would look like an actors but they are just marginally whiter, it&#x27;s an OK product fore whiter teeth..</li>
    <li> great price for a great item.  Thank you.  The rebates never work when we have submitted them.  Too bad.  Product is great.</li>
    <li> I saw a difference after the first use! These work great. I also went out bought the 3D toothpaste and mouthwash. My teeth have never been whiter. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Nice way to whiten teeth, without any pain!&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t finished the strips yet but I already notice an improvment, would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> My teeth look great!  Not artificial at all! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> They work great!!  I&#x27;ve used other&#x27;s and these are the best.  Try them you won&#x27;t be sorry. Dont use eeryday, they will make your teeth too senistive.</li>
    <li> i love this product I am only 10 days in and I thought about waiting until I finished it entirely but I have already seen such amazing results in this short amount of time that I have to be honest if you&#x27;re looking for something that will whiten your teeth this does exactly that. Super easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t take much time at all you can shower, read, clean up do whatever you need to in the amount of time the treatment lasts. Definitely recommend it&#x27;s pricey but you really get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I drink tea all day long, these strips started making a difference after only a few days. I would buy them again!</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job.  My teeth are whiter but not as white as I thought they would get. I&#x27;ve ony used them for about a week  or 10 days so I might get more results later.</li>
    <li> After 3-5 uses, it does increase the whiteness of your teeth.</li>
    <li> I got my braces off about 6 months ago and my teeth just felt so disgusting and yellow, even after buying expensive toothpaste and mouthwash, the whole 9 yards.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product and within the first 3 days, I was getting COMPLIMENTS on my smile, saying my teeth are so white. That never happens haha!&lt;br /&gt;I ended up only using half the package (7 strips I believe) over the span of about 10 days, and 3 months later, my teeth are the same shade of white.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately these strips do wear off in about 6 months, so instead of purchasing 2 of these boxes a year, just purchase one, and every 6 months, use half of the strips.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re feeling skeptical about it, just take a risk and go for it. Defenitly the best $40 I spent in a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s actualy working pretty good, my teeth are definitely whiter and it&#x27;s easy to use and so fast, I just wear it 30 mn while i do my make up:) and shipping was super fast too!</li>
    <li> These seemed to stick better to my caps than my natural teeth but they don&#x27;t whiten caps.</li>
    <li> These strips are a good way to whiten teeth at home. The effect is noticeable quickly, one can see the difference  after 3 uses but, as with all teeth whitening procedures, one has to repeat the use of strips after awhile. I had my teeth whitened in the dentists office before and these strips do just as a good job as at docs for the fraction of a price though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some results, so they are worth trying.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these as I&#x27;ve heard great things about their effectiveness, however my hopes went down the drain when after trying them out twice (out of 20) my teeth got so sensitive that it actually hurt me the whole day after. I am not new to teeth whitening (done two professional sessions in the clinic in the past) but never had such a result. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not like the commercials, where the people have ridiculously shiny teeth. However, It worked for me. My teeth were stained from soda and coffee and this removed all the stains and the overall look of my teeth. I&#x27;m only halfway through the pack and can see I huge difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: My teeth were very sensitive for the first 4-5 days, but it got way better after that.</li>
    <li> Be careful with how long you use the strips. They left my teeth very sensitive and hurting for several days after only one treatment.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery, just what I expected</li>
    <li> These are great, better than anything else out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited to try these because of the price. I bought all the cheap stuff and finally gave up and bought these. I NOW HAVE WHITE TEETH WITH NO YELLOW STAINS! Well worth the money, I will never buy anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOTE** Use for 2 hours! I got amazing results when I used them for that time. A had a little sensitivity, but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helped. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving the CREST 3D WHITESTRIPS a solid four-stars. My teeth were not brown or really yellow, but they weren&#x27;t as white/bright as I would like them to be, since I smoked for nearly 20 years, so that&#x27;s what I was working with. I&#x27;d say that my teeth were kind of yellow and off-white, and other than that, I have no teeth or gum problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after using the CREST WHITE STRIPS, I have really noticed that my teeth are about a shade whiter. Not glowing white, but I can definitely tell a difference. They appear to be lighter, brighter and cleaner looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me longer than the 20 day supply because I had to stop after every 3-4 days because I would get sensitivity issues in my upper and lower canine teeth (I think that&#x27;s what they call them), so I would have to stop for a few days and then continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About day 13 or 14, actually the 13th or 14th strip used, I could really tell that my teeth were much brighter but they never got any whiter/brighter than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have rea... Read more</li>
    <li> They adhere very well to the teeth and are comfortable. They don&#x27;t irritate my highly sensitive teeth and gums. I noticed improvement within the first few times I used this product. This is the best product I have ever used for teeth whitening. I have tried many others and they all left me with chemical burns and super sensitive teeth. Try these, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> At first I was hesitant about these strips but after reading some of the posts from other buyers I decided I&#x27;d give them a try and I did. By the third day I saw an absolute difference on my teeth, I&#x27;m a coffee drinker and my teeth tend to look like a shade darker than your regular white but these strips brought my white back!! The only problem is that the whitening doesn&#x27;t last as long as one would think, I had to continue with the treatment until all the strips were gone and then I didn&#x27;t buy them again; needless to say, my teeth are back to square one. In short, this is a great product but is also an ONGOING process in order to keep your teeth looking white.</li>
    <li> They seem to work well if you follow the directions!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work, Not worth it!</li>
    <li> I recognized the difference from the 4th day&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s kind of boring, I like the results at the end :)</li>
    <li> I can see the difference in brightness after the first week</li>
    <li> So far so good. I use these a few times a week and my teeth look pretty good. (but honestly my teeth were pretty white to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a bit different then other whitening strips I have used in the past as they are not as wet and they seem to stick really well to your teeth. Almost too well as it takes a little bit of effort to peel them off of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a product that you will always have to use. It is not a one time thing, so I am happy it is here on amazon and I can repurchase from time to time to keep my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
    <li> Works great.  Only reason for 4 stars is the cost is high.</li>
    <li> Do not hurt my gums, they are great!</li>
    <li> They work! They work well! But they work temporarily! In my experience i&#x27;ll have to keep buying these all year long. I don&#x27;t drink coffee, soda, or smoke but thats just me, they are worth a try.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of Crest White Strips. Sure beats the expensive dentist whitenings.</li>
    <li> Stuck to my teeth and really did make a large difference!</li>
    <li> Does a great job for our family.</li>
    <li> The whitestrips really work.  I&#x27;ve tried them before.  I brought them online because of the price.</li>
    <li> Thank you very process was excellent and</li>
    <li> What is there not to love about Crest Whitestrips!  Easy to use in your own home with good results.</li>
    <li> these work great but it seems like they only keep your teeth white temporarily</li>
    <li> Caused extreme sensitivity to my teeth.. lots of pain.  I recommend buying oragel if you experience it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product . Go anf get them professionally whitened</li>
    <li> Loved these! They don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> they work.  good value</li>
    <li> These things are surprisingly effective; and don&#x27;t make my teeth noticeably more sensitive. I had tried them before when I found some in a drawer at home - they might have been there for years and they didn&#x27;t work particularly well. Either they go bad over time or they have improved their design and formula. These fresh ones I just received really stick to the teeth well so you don&#x27;t have to keep repositioning them - and they have a very effective whitening effect.</li>
    <li> guess I&#x27;m not dedicated enough to use this as often as they suggest. I could tell the difference even after 1 application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before and they HAVE DEFINITELY WORKED. After 2-3 uses I saw obvious results. I purchased another box a year later to try again and this time, almost no difference. I&#x27;ve been using the strips every other day (to avoid sensitivity) and I&#x27;ve only noticed an extremely slight difference in whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to give these a bad review, bc I have used before and loved, but I&#x27;m thinking maybe I got some sort of faulty box? I wrote to the Crest website and am hoping for an answer, bc I would like my money back for this product. There&#x27;s no reason why I should be spending so much on a product that has done basically nothing for me.</li>
    <li> This product works! I noticed after about four uses that my teeth were whiter. And they continued to get whiter after each use. No irritation. It&#x27;s basically peroxide-coded sticky tape that you put on your teeth. It foams up a bit, and the strips easily remove when you pull them off after to allotted time (30 minutes). Simple, easy, and effective.</li>
    <li> Does the trick. If you haven&#x27;t done it - get on it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a teeth whitening junkie and have used these before with great results.  They came so fast I thought they were another order. I will repeat this order when needed!</li>
    <li> This one really works unlike many predecessors of the same and other brands. What helps is more robust stickiness where it sits tight on your teeth</li>
    <li> These are strange. I waited until I finished them all and now here I am. You know, these DO whiten your teeth. A LOT BUT... only during the days that you&#x27;re using them. I have gone three days without using them because I used them all up and my teeth have gone from pearly white (from the strips) to yellowish again. It&#x27;s so weird. I mean, are we supposed to be using them all year every single day to get that pearly white look? How often are we supposed to use them again? Again, these are good during the days that you&#x27;re wearing the strips. Once you&#x27;re off the strips, the pearly white color fades. Am I the only one with this problem? No, I don&#x27;t smoke or drink soda or coffee, etc.</li>
    <li> Excellent result , I had high doubts but the effect was so clear and obvious</li>
    <li> Got it at a great price, and i love the results!!!!!</li>
    <li> Results are barely noticable and my teeth were sensitive for days.  Not worth buying.</li>
    <li> Only slightly better than using regular baking soda for whitening.  Not worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly.  Very good price!</li>
    <li> I have to admit when I first tried this I felt like I didn&#x27;t really see a difference. My teeth were not terribly yellow, I just wanted them to look healthy. I tried them within the first three days and thought they didn&#x27;t do much, but when I talked to my family and friends they all noticed a significant change in the color. It wasn&#x27;t until going back to old photos that I realized that they really did work. I ended up only doing it for about five days and their still white. I do advise to try and stay away from foods that can really yellow your teeth, I noticed that they start to darken but I use colgate optic white to help maintain the brightness. If you have doubts that it&#x27;s not working take pictures! :D</li>
    <li> Yes this keeps my smile bright! Love the new grap texture.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth but normally just to hot and cold. i used them 3 times in a row as directed. the first time i saw some different no pain. the 2nd time u used it i felt pain like i was chewing on ice all day. the third time i used it i hurt so bad it was the worst pain my teeth have ever felt  but my teeth was a white as a if i got a cleaning. i dont ever get really yellow teeth. i use a lot of whiting product and i not eat or drink staining food or drinks. i still use them but i use them one every few day when they aren&#x27;t white because after the 2 time in a row they hurt. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a person with sensitive teeth and maybe to some one do doesn&#x27;t have sensitive teeth because it work well it just hurts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these white strips on numerous occasions and they never fail.  I see results after 2 uses, and significant whitening after a week.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this product wanting a whiter smile and had used some from a different brand previously I knew that the whiteness wasn&#x27;t going to exponential but i just wanted a healthier smile. Something to know is that you can potentially have a significant amount of sensitivity in my case the pain after 3 days was pretty intense and i am not someone who exaggerates about pain. This is just something to know i realize everyone may have a different experience but now i am left with 17 more treatments and i don&#x27;t think it is worth it resume using them.</li>
    <li> These normally work great but the strips in this box don&#x27;t stick onto teeth.  Bad batch?</li>
    <li> Crest always has a coupon for at least $7 off on the internet. It&#x27;s worth the few minutes it&#x27;ll take to check.  I work for a dentist and even we can&#x27;t buy them for this price.</li>
    <li> These strips work very very well. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my teeth. I have recommended them to at least five of my friends. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Pretty okay, kinda made my teeth have this weird feeling after intensive use. I personally didn&#x27;t notice much of a different. I dont know, maybe I didnt&#x27;t use it enough.</li>
    <li> Helped my smile when I needed it the most. Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> this level 4 version will fully satisfy you need to whiten your teeth without a trip to the dentist!  you can get $10 cash card back per household, which is even a greater value for this product for a limited time. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For over the counter, this is as good as it gets. I will buy these again when I run out. I like to keep these on hand and use twice a month as needed.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product but I guess it didn&#x27;t work for me. I followed the directions and used a strip 30mins a day. After about 10 strips, I was a bit skeptical because I saw very little to no change at all. I have now used up almost all of the strips, with one or two unused, and still do not see much result. ):</li>
    <li> I bought this one as a gift for my sister, and we will see what she has to say. I used to use these before, always buying them from target or walmart, but will see about the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical first, but after only 4 applications noticed big difference. Good product.</li>
    <li> Great product , and totally worth it !</li>
    <li> They do what they say they will, you just gotta use them frequently.</li>
    <li> I have now used these three times and my teeth are whiter, yes, but they really hurt. These make teeth more sensitive and give teeth a weird, tingly feeling. I&#x27;ll continue to use them but I wish my teeth didn&#x27;t hurt so bad. No problems eating or drinking though, like other people.</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars because it deserves it!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the first initial change in my teeth after one use. The larger change occurred after three treatments, then again at eight treatments. This product works as intended and I recommend it for anyone trying to achieve that great smile.</li>
    <li> Level 4 is the way to go if friends tell you you have white teeth, but if you feel like you have some \\&quot;room to grow\\&quot;. Very sticky, so you can put them in and have full conversations. I experienced minor sensitivity on day 4, so I took a day off, and it went away within a day. I had used Crest Whitening Strips about 10 years ago, and everything about them has changed for the better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it came on the market and it works like a charm! i didn&#x27;t even use the recommended amount because i thought my teeth would become TOO white! it seems to depend though. My mother used them and saw no results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but my wife&#x27;s friend told her that it works so she wanted to try it.  My friend tried some other white strip years back and I do remember her saying that her teeth were sensitive.  I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;whitening tooth paste for years and you know they don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well what a surprise.  It works.  My wife has sensitive teeth but she did not complain about teeth becoming more sensitive.  She is a coffee drinker and her teeth definitely gotten whiter.  Don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last, but Turn a skeptic into a believer.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and nice item thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried both and have been much happier with these.  They adhere and stay on much better than the Pro Effects (the previous version of these, not the Intensive one) and the results are faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grind my teeth so I&#x27;ve caused some wear to the back of my teeth which makes them extremely sensitive.  Because of this, I can&#x27;t wrap the strips all the way to the back of my teeth or I&#x27;ll be miserable for days. What I do is cut them in half so they only go in the front of my teeth, only my dentists sees the back of my teeth anyway so who cares what that looks like. I have a small mouth so either the short or long ones cover well but you can just cut them up and use half of a short and half of a long one day, and the other halves the next.  I would do this with the pro effects but I had a big problem with them staying on. They were always sliding around while these, because they adhere so well, stay in place just fine. They work just as well as wrapping them and I get double the use making them very cost effective</li>
    <li> makes my teeth sensitive</li>
    <li> These whitestrips go on easily and stay on extremely well. They are level 4 whitening which just like instructions say, show results in 3 applications.  Very good product and best price I found.</li>
    <li> Havent used this kind of product before but I def like it and got great results.  I noticed after 5-6 treatments a big difference.  Strips are easy to use and stay on great.  Def recommend and use again.</li>
    <li> The good news:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no problems with sensitivity or \\&quot;white spots\\&quot; during treatment.&lt;br /&gt;(Then again, all of my dental work is in excellent condition.  No old fillings or anything.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At my age (53), the whitening was not as much as I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;All the same, an improvement and a 1st taste of whitening,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I will seek professional whitening at my dentist&#x27;s office in several months.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, a little pricey but IMHO the pro results are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older brother had whitening done at his dentist&#x27;s office with the trays but, even if overdone, the results were spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;It makes him look far younger and you can&#x27;t take your eyes off of the whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I see results, nobody else has noticed.</li>
    <li> I have used white strips before, in college, and loved them. Personally, I am disappointed with these. My teeth are not noticeably whiter, and they caused a lot of tooth sensitivity. I&#x27;m really bummed that I paid almost $40 for something that has essentially left my teeth the same as before, except for a few days of extreme sensitivity. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The whitening power is great, the way they hold on your teeth is great.  The strips just need to be a little longer, especially the bottom strip.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working fine</li>
    <li> Made my teeth sparkling white.  Received many compliments at work after using these.  Long lasting effects if you combine with products that strengthen your enamel.</li>
    <li> These strips are not like the original ones that slide off easy, they grip to your teeth and are almost wax like. Plus, after two uses I am already seeing a noticeable difference! Love them!</li>
    <li> Good method to whiten outside of the dental office. Follow instructions and don&#x27;t damage your teeth. Very reliable product with reliable results. Results last a long time too, even for those coffee drinkers!</li>
    <li> I originally got my teeth professionally whitened by a cosmetics dentist.  They turned out beautifully, but after the custom mold they made of my teeth plus syringes full of prescription whitener, it ended up costing me over $700.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that these strips work just as well, and I love that they don&#x27;t slide off like other brands.  People always comment on my sparkling teeth!  I only use these 3 times a week because they do make my teeth slightly sensitive.  Especially right when I take them off.  SO worth the price though.</li>
    <li> I was nervous to take these at first cause of my teeth being so sensitive but i think its worth it. if you want to have noticeable results but dont want to pay a ton of money to get your teeth professionally whitened then you def should buy this. just make sure you buy them off amazon and not at the store cause it can get way expensive. but anyway- teeth sensitivity is there but its bearable to say the least</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s too many caffeine in these. 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Made a big difference in my smile.  In fact I noticed I have been smiling a lot more lately. My wife even commented that my teeth were noticeably whiter and looked good.</li>
    <li> These work great. They are the same as the ones you buy in the store. I use them about once a week for a touch-up.</li>
    <li> not the best thing i have tried it did get my teeth whiter eventually but took longer than i anticipated</li>
    <li> I can see the difference already, easy to use and effective.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the original product years ago.</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN GOING TO THE DENTIST..THIS WORKED ON MY FIRST USE</li>
    <li> They really do work. Buy they again and again</li>
    <li> Only half way through the strips and i already see the difference! They stay on the teeth real good and even though i already have super sensitive teeth, these don&#x27;t make it worse. Five stars!</li>
    <li> I never once compalined of sensitive teeth -- until trying these whitening strips.  May not be the best for those already sensitive to hot/cold water, etc.</li>
    <li> I decided to try a scientific experiment.  I applied the strips to my upper teeth only, leaving the lowers untouched as a control.  After applying all 40 strips, one per day in the prescribed manner, to just my upper teeth, I compared uppers to lowers.  I could see no whitening effect whatever.  My teeth are old but sound.  No pain but also no gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I wonder if much of the improvement people report is imaginary.  It would be easy to see what one hopes to see, unless photographic records are kept or a controlled experiment such as mine is carried out.</li>
    <li> For me the strips did not make much of a difference to the colour of my teeth as it did with many of the other reviewers, i dont think it is worth the price! None of my friends noticed the difference i Have some pictures before and after my use with the stripes here [...]</li>
    <li> Saw the differences after just 3 uses, it&#x27;s amazingg ! totally worth every cent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these pretty regularly for whitening over the years, and I think the best compliment was my dentist&#x27;s observation that used properly, they are a more than impressive substitute for professional whitening. I think these are just as good as the 2-hour ones with much less hassle.</li>
    <li> came quickly and exactly what the description stated. great price to boot! very pleased to say the least.  the expiration date is a year from now also, so you have a year to use all 20</li>
    <li> What can I say, great product and really does work. Only issue is that it will make your teeth really sensitive and I mean to everything (even breathing through my teeth hurt). However, this is easily solvable. A week to two weeks before using this product I start brushing with Sensodyne Proenamel! It strengthens my teeth and when I am using the White Stripes, I hardly feel the annoying sensitivity. Depending on how sensitive your teeth are may require you using the Sensodyne  a little longer before and after using this product!. It&#x27;s worth it though as I am always getting compliments on my teeth and smile.</li>
    <li> These strips work pretty well. I had a few people comment on how white my teeth had become! However, after I stopped using them they seemed to go back to their old color. Will have to keep using them.</li>
    <li> This will give a noticeable whitening effect to the old pearly whites. Might notice some sensitivity but it does go away. It is a 20 day process, once a day, or it says you can double up to hasten the effect. Either way, the result is whiter teeth without the expensive visit to the dentist for a similar process.</li>
    <li> No doubt Crest Whitening Strips brighten your smile, but be aware (especially if you have sensitive teeth) of subsequent tooth aches. The pain occurs hours after removing the strips. At times it is tolerable but other times its just unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you are seeking an alternative to bleaching treatments with a dentist, however I would keep a few Tylenol on hand just in case.</li>
    <li> Good product but it makes your teeth and tounge very sensitive!</li>
    <li> These do wonders for me!</li>
    <li> it was not very effective for my teeth. my stain has followed me for at least 16 years. I was too lazy to brush my teeth when i was young, now I purchased this item and wanted to whiten my teeth a little. however, the product review was like it is marvelous, it did not work well on me.</li>
    <li> Product works great! See effects in 5 days. Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;4 is professional strength that is better than other products.</li>
    <li> I use it and did not see a big change, its better to save up money and get it done by a great dentist.</li>
    <li> The product does work really well, I would not recommend using it after brushing your teeth as it makes your teeth even more sensitive. I usually don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth but after using this for 3 days in a row my teeth started hurting a little when drinking Ice Cold water, which is how I always drink my water regardless of season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use it 2 days in a row every month, my teeth look great but I already brush my teeth 2 times a day so my teeth are and always have been in great condition. Never had cavities or any other work done on my teeth, ever. I have been blessed.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and was so pleased with the results that I ordered it again.&lt;br /&gt;The adhesion of the product is outstanding.</li>
    <li> The whitestrips really work and whitened my teeths after only a few applications but it does cause sensitivity for a day after use.</li>
    <li> This definitely whitened my teeth a good amount (I&#x27;m going to have to try again to get my teeth where I want them though). Easy application, fast, stays on tight, and you really do see results within three treatments. As for the taste, it&#x27;s not pleasant... at all, but it wasn&#x27;t completely awful - just bearable. My biggest complaint is that it has caused severe sensitivity for me (and I&#x27;ve never had sensitive teeth before).</li>
    <li> I bought these to use before my wedding. I just finished my first box and oh my gosh!! My teeth look so great! I didn&#x27;t have yellow teeth or big noticeable stains, but I just wanted my teeth to be a little bit more white for my big day. I will add that they did cause a little pain every now and then on my gums. Then after removing them my gums were sore the rest of the day. But hey pain is beauty! It&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Am noticing a difference! Whiter teeth are on the way. Love how they stay in place so securely!</li>
    <li> Made my gums bleed after 2 days of using it. Pain and sensitivity lasted about 1 week. Going forward, I will leave professional whitening to professionals. There is a money back guarantee via Crest, but they don&#x27;t make it easy...</li>
    <li> To pay $40 for a whiter smile once or twice a year, these strips are definitely worth it. Being a 19 year old woman who does not drink coffee or smoke, my odds at seeing better results are probably higher than most who indulge in these activities. That being said, my teeth have still been a little yellow over the years, but I have used Crest whitening strips twice in my life and have seen beautiful results. My mom says that my teeth are practically glowing, and I got compliments in the first week that I finished the strips. Three family members/friends commented on how great my teeth looked. Great product overall.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Works well. Each strip is quite large. I like cutting them in half and getting double for my money!</li>
    <li> It works! Very good product and I recommend! Is not expensive and at 4th day my teeth were white. Loved.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. At a faction of the cost,.  My teeth were white already but after I use this they were bright white! Noticeable</li>
    <li> Only into my 6th strip out of 20 and already see huge results. I can stop now and use the rest for touch ups.</li>
    <li> On amazon website, it is advertised there is special offer of $7 and $10 rebate. You will NOT get $10 rebate if you use $7 discount. This is switch and bait. I am contacting BBB right now. Do not buy if you care about your rebate. Not happy</li>
    <li> So far so good! A+++++ Great product</li>
    <li> excellent price and very awesome product!</li>
    <li> I ALWAYS USE THESE. THEY ARE GREAT. I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND USING THEM ALL THE TIME. I GET A BOX, USE THEM THEN WAIT ABOUT TWO MONTHS BEFORE I USE THEM AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I have held off on any over the counter teeth whitening products for years as I just never believed they would work.  I had some lines in two teeth that I always believed were permanent, after a week of using these strips they are almost completely gone and my teeth are much whiter in in general.  Great product.  One warning, they may cause some mild gum irritation and teeth sensitivity at first.</li>
    <li> I used it as the directions told me to. I&#x27;d say my teeth only got about 15% brighter which is barely noticeable. I will have to look for something stronger. Just not that my teeth are not very stained, maybe 20% yellow. In my opinion, the more yellow your teeth are, the better it will work for you.</li>
    <li> Next best whitening compared to expensive whitening treatments from the dentist. I find it best when u dry your teeth and mouth slightly first with a paper towel so the strips don&#x27;t slide around.</li>
