      <li>but it smells more like vanilla than bananas!</li>
      <li>Work amazing...</li>
      <li>Excellent product that deep conditions hair and smells great.</li>
      <li>I would have to say that this is one of my top 5 conditioners, and the shampoo is just as good.</li>
      <li>It smells nice is a great conditioner and a decent detangler.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair very light and shiny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more purfumey then fruity.</li>
      <li>My hair always feels nice and silky smooth with this conditioner.</li>
      <li>And the banana smell is so lovely.</li>
      <li>I buy a lot of products, I am such a product junkie and this conditioner is the BEST.</li>
      <li>so I use Head and Shoulders most of the time.</li>
      <li>I really love this.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>It smells great, and is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>conditioner is very sweet smelling, like banana candy.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that is both wavy and curly</li>
      <li>I bought the Banana Conditioner hoping to have the same great results I have received from Body Shop&#x27;s products, but to my dismay, this conditioner made my scalp break out in dandruff.</li>
      <li>So I am now 33 and came across it on here and decided to buy it again and am not sorry I bought it!</li>
      <li>Great smelling product but not a very effective conditioner for color-treated hair.</li>
      <li>i can really feel how clean my hair is when im done using it.</li>
      <li>It smells heavily of fresh bananas- not a fake banana smell at all.</li>
      <li>Liked as much as the shampoo of the same name.</li>
      <li>Very surprised this conditioner isn&#x27;t more highly rated.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does actually smell better going on than when you sniff from the bottle.</li>
      <li>I only wish there was more of it because I have a lot of hhair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its very hydrating!</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and it was delivered well-packaged.</li>
      <li>I have quite coarse hair, and this conditioner makes my hair look and feel smooth.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t smell as much like bananas as I was hoping.</li>
      <li>It helps control frizz but not as much as I&#x27;d like it too.</li>
      <li>My hair is always soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>I thought it would be more natural and mild, but I was wrong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like someone&#x27;s idea of a banana, and maybe in hard candy form.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding conditioners that meet my criteria (no or low silk proteins, no silicones, mineral oil, naturalish) that are also effective and this fits the bill so far.</li>
      <li>Left my hair soft and shiny and very manageable.</li>
      <li>It smells just like bananas and makes your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and almost all store bought shampoo I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>I used to use this when I was 14 years old.</li>
      <li>From high end to low end</li>
      <li>It conditioned okay, not great.</li>
      <li>And probably you wouldn&#x27;t want to smell like a true banana; at least not without some sugar or desserty element thrown</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little thick and hard to get out of the bottle, but it does condition my hair and make me happy.</li>
      <li>I like this product a lot, but it is definitely for people with dry hair or normal to dry.  </li>

<li> I like this product a lot, but it is definitely for people with dry hair or normal to dry.  </li>
<li> I find it a little too moisturizing for my normal hair</li>
<li> does not last long at all for me.</li>
<li> I have long hair that I bleach</li>
<li> To avoid smelling like a fruit salad, I keep my other smelly stuff (like deodorant) in the same area.</li>
<li> I also color and highlight it so it can get dry if I don&#x27;t baby it or if I spend time in the sun.</li>
<li> For reference, I&#x27;m latina with dry, frizzy hair and oily scalp.</li>
<li> so it gets dry and frizzy.</li>
<li> This does not smell like a banana, neither wet nor dry.</li>
<li> Use it sparingly as it can overcondition your hair unless you hair has a very dry texture.</li>
<li> Not tested on animals which is harder to come by</li>
<li> Although it smells a little weird when your hair is wet, but once your hair it dries it smells sweet like bananas.</li>
<li> Smells vaguely like bananas, but doesn&#x27;t leave the scent in your hair (which is the only reason why i bought this) and doesn&#x27;t particularly condition.</li>
<li> my hair is soooo long it is almost down to my hiney!</li>
<li> This moisturizes a lot without weighing my hair down.</li>
<li> I have very thick, dry, course, colored hair</li>
<li> The bottle is small too.</li>
<li> The only bad thing i have to say about this is that i feel like i have to use alot.</li>
<li> I have very thick curly hair and the bottle</li>
<li> have bad dandruff</li>

    <li> one of my favorite conditioners! It smells heavily of fresh bananas- not a fake banana smell at all. It makes my hair very light and shiny. Best of all, anything from The Body Shop does not test on animals!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, but it smells more like vanilla than bananas!</li>
    <li> I have quite coarse hair, and this conditioner makes my hair look and feel smooth. And the banana smell is so lovely.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell as much like bananas as I was hoping. It&#x27;s much more purfumey then fruity. It conditioned okay, not great. Probably would not buy it again. I have very thick curly hair and the bottle does not last long at all for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Body Shop&#x27;s brand shampoo for years and I love it. I have sensitive skin and almost all store bought shampoo I&#x27;ve tried has resulted in my scalp breaking out with dandruff. I bought the Banana Conditioner hoping to have the same great results I have received from Body Shop&#x27;s products, but to my dismay, this conditioner made my scalp break out in dandruff.</li>
    <li> I love this product i can really feel how clean my hair is when im done using it. Its very hydrating! The only bad thing i have to say about this is that i feel like i have to use alot. But it does give great results! I would defiantly purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this online! I was a big fan of the Body Shop&#x27;s banana hair putty in the 90s. When that went out of stock, I downgraded to the banana conditioner. I believe even that went away for a while, but now that I see it again, I am stocking up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bad dandruff so I use Head and Shoulders most of the time. But once a week, I use this as a deep conditioner. Works great. It&#x27;s a little thick and hard to get out of the bottle, but it does condition my hair and make me happy.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this conditioner in The Body Shop stores.  The formula is still the same as I remember. Use it sparingly as it can overcondition your hair unless you hair has a very dry texture.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so shiny and I think it is a lot softer than before. I use it with the Body Shop ginger shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is very sweet smelling, like banana candy. I thought it would be more natural and mild, but I was wrong.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product but not a very effective conditioner for color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> If you are a fan of banana scented products, then you willl LOVE this! It smells great, and is very moisturizing. I love this prodcut, and would buy again! For reference, I&#x27;m latina with dry, frizzy hair and oily scalp.</li>
    <li> I really love this. I have long hair that I bleach so it gets dry and frizzy. This moisturizes a lot without weighing my hair down. It helps control frizz but not as much as I&#x27;d like it too. I also wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I found the smell off putting.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, but it is definitely for people with dry hair or normal to dry.  I find it a little too moisturizing for my normal hair so I use it sparingly.  It smells wonderful, though.  I used the banana conditioner back in the 90&#x27;s and it smells just as I remember!</li>
    <li> This is great. It smells divine! Can&#x27;t wait to give it to the raffle winner for a baby shower! It will be a great prize.</li>
    <li> Smelled heavenly!  My hair is always soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> Excellent product that deep conditions hair and smells great. Not tested on animals which is harder to come by then you would expect</li>
    <li> This does not smell like a banana, neither wet nor dry. It&#x27;s more like someone&#x27;s idea of a banana, and maybe in hard candy form.&lt;br /&gt;This being said however, I can&#x27;t say I dislike it. My hair always feels nice and silky smooth with this conditioner. I only wish there was more of it because I have a lot of hhair.&lt;br /&gt;It does actually smell better going on than when you sniff from the bottle. And probably you wouldn&#x27;t want to smell like a true banana; at least not without some sugar or desserty element thrown in.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I&#x27;m going to buy it again. I&#x27;m the banana queen.</li>
    <li> Liked as much as the shampoo of the same name. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This smells just like bananas and moisturizes well. Although it smells a little weird when your hair is wet, but once your hair it dries it smells sweet like bananas. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very surprised this conditioner isn&#x27;t more highly rated. Left my hair soft and shiny and very manageable. I have fine hair that is both wavy and curly and I have alot of it. I also color and highlight it so it can get dry if I don&#x27;t baby it or if I spend time in the sun. Shipping was fast and it was delivered well-packaged. Would buy from this seller again. As a matter of fact, I plan to buy the sister shampoo.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!!! Love it!! :)</li>
    <li> This conditioner was a pleasant surprise.  It smells nice is a great conditioner and a decent detangler.  I have a hard time finding conditioners that meet my criteria (no or low silk proteins, no silicones, mineral oil, naturalish) that are also effective and this fits the bill so far.</li>

I used to use this when I was 14 years old. So I am now 33 and came across it on here and decided to buy it again and am not sorry I bought it! When I run out I will get it again, this is one of those MUST HAVE items. I have very thick, dry, course, colored hair and it worked for me and my hair is soooo long it is almost down to my hiney! lol Work amazing...definitely try but just do not order through the company I ordered from, it took over 2 1/2 months to get here!</li>
    <li> Not as banana-ish as I&#x27;d hoped but still smells good and works well.</li>
    <li> Smells vaguely like bananas, but doesn&#x27;t leave the scent in your hair (which is the only reason why i bought this) and doesn&#x27;t particularly condition. The bottle is small too.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it when I smell like banana-scented suntan lotion. To avoid smelling like a fruit salad, I keep my other smelly stuff (like deodorant) in the same area.</li>
