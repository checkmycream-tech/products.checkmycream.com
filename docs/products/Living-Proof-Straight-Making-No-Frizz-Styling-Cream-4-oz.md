### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>, it gets to its best).  </li>
      <li>, best it can be</li>
      <li>The best way I can describe</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t afford it aways, as a bit pricey, but is a wonderful hair product.</li>
      <li>like I said product itself is very good since I already know and have using it before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And pricing was very good.  </li>
      <li>I followed the instructions and applied it before styling with a flatiron, and the immediate results were great.</li>
      <li>so I knew it would be good.  </li>
      <li>I had read so many great things about this company and product but</li>
      <li>My hair feels healthy and looks great with this product.</li>
      <li>The downside of it is that you do have to use a lot of it and its kind of pricy --</li>
      <li>I really like the styling products the best of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I bet you will be thrilled with the results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recommendation: Perfect for normal women with frizzy hair to use every day.</li>
      <li>this one by FAR works the best.</li>
      <li>I can style it curly or straight, but it gets frizzy in Washington, DC&#x27;s incredibly humid summers.</li>
      <li>it stays smooth and silky during the most warm and humid days!  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>My hair was shiny and smooth and straightened out really nicely.</li>
      <li>Have more hair styles to pick from, because your hair now behaves-it obeys you</li>
      <li>And the wave is more pronounced.  </li>
      <li>This stuff didn&#x27;t work any better than the $3 products you can buy at Walmart.  </li>
      <li>Really love your hair, not just think it is okay, acceptable</li>
      <li>My excitement for this product mostly paid off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, I did notice significantly more breakage than I do when using Frizz-Ease, which I will be returning to.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product and will buy again when my tester runs out.</li>
      <li>My hair looked great, took less time and effort to do, and my hair looked great for an additional day-I get 3 days as opposed to 2 between shampoos.</li>
      <li>This product has a great clean smell to it and really does work well on over straightened, frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>That is totally fine with me, since I prefer to wash every day.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of this product.  </li>
      <li>This product makes a huge difference in drying and styling my hair</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t checked my shampoo / conditioner, but I don&#x27;t think mine contains silicone (I use Pureology shampoo andconditioners, which are sulfite free).  </li>
      <li>the Frizz Cream did not keep my hair frizz free.</li>
      <li>It was love after first shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have my hair done at good salons and regularly use high-end products (Kerastase, Rene Furterer, Bumble and Bumble, Crema,  etc.)</li>
      <li>Enjoy many new compliments about your hair and believe they are sincere&lt;</li>
      <li>However, for me I have tried not washing my hair on day 2, but for some reason the anti-frizz properties are not as good on day 2 (i.e. the non-wash day) - even if I have flat ironed my hair.  </li>
      <li>Much of which never sees the light of day again.</li>
      <li>My hair texture is not curly and not straight - kind of in between (but more on the straight side).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells like a fresh bouquet with the wrapper still on, and feels luxurious in the shower.</li>
      <li>but well worth it.    </li>
      <li>My hair ends up stick straight and soft with nice texture.</li>
      <li>I tried/used a ton of anti frizz straightening products, and this one was a success.  </li>
      <li>it does straighten your hair and fill in the breaks of the hair shaft that would other wise pick up moisture in the humidity.  </li>
      <li>I am a Caucasian female with lots of fine, chemically straightened hair, damaged by years of too much heat and too many chemicals.  </li>
      <li>This is a super product for those of us who want straight hair but were born with wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I live in FL and it does not fight the humidity at all!!!  </li>
      <li>The texture is fairly smooth on the top layer but kind of a frizzy mess in the back on the bottom layer.  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>As a hair stylist and salon owner, I literally had tried all professional products for my hair, after all I could try them for free as samples or return them if I purchased them.</li>
      <li>I wash my hair daily, and this product does work better each day you use it in a row (i.e. after using it each day for about a week</li>
      <li>But this is the first time purchasing  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Testing environment: Hot tropical island, close to coast.</li>
      <li>But this is the first time I purchased it from this provider.  </li>
      <li>Some background first:  </li>
      <li>I have a cabinet full of hair products promises to get rid of the frizz and make my hair soft and manageable -- none of them work.  </li>
      <li>This product also does a good job of protecting my hair from damage (i.e. from daily blow drying and flat ironing) as it forms a protective layer over the hair shaft.  </li>
      <li>Also just be aware not to use too much product - for me when I use too much it makes my roots greasy by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>If you wash and style your hair every day, or maybe even have a different type of hair, it might work fine.</li>
      <li>Add in the styling gel, and you now actually have straight shine that can survive heat treatment and still smooth your hairstyle.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>But what really sold me was the way my hair felt.</li>
      <li>I can, to give us ladies a heads up!used too much of the styling product</li>
      <li>I decided to try this Living Proof Straight Making No Frizz cream.  </li>
      <li>During the summer it is a fight to keep my hair straight but now using the No Frizz Serum</li>
      <li>,i was sent nourishing styling cream I wanted straight.</li>
      <li>another misleading item I purchased, living proof used to make it the picture shows straight making but..,.</li>
      <li>I was very upset to find it doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I like the straight making styling cream</li>
      <li>I live in Florida and it is hot and humid</li>
      <li>I ordered this product after reading a review in my newspaper about how it was the first new anti-frizz technology in a decade.</li>
      <li>This product has a nice, but not overwhelmingly strong smell.  </li>
      <li>This product has also cut my styling time down by about 1/3 - as I now don&#x27;t have to flat-iron my whole head, I just need to touch up the ends - and sometimes I can get away with not flat ironing (if I&#x27;ve done a good job straightening with the paddle brush during my blow-dry).  </li>
      <li>Not for high fashion or anyone who wants to look like they have products in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and live in a very humid area.  </li>
      <li>Over your entire head, your hair falls smoothly and naturally, soft and supple, relaxing close to your head as if by choice.</li>
      <li>While it made my hair soft, it also made it fall out in large masses.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product because it keeps my hair from frizzing and it protects my hair when I use my hair dryer, flat iron or hot rollers.</li>
      <li>and since you dont wash straightened hair everyday, the added fresh smell feels like you freshly shampooed your hair.  </li>
      <li>it reminds me of the way Aveda products have the distinct smell, but once my hair is dry I no longer smell it.</li>
      <li>I still had to use a flat iron, but it didn&#x27;t take quite as long to get all of my locks super straight.    </li>
      <li>I was ready to ditch it after the first use, but thought that perhaps I used too much of the styling product (instructions say to use liberally), so I cut way back the second time – same results though.  </li>
      <li>so there is no need to apply it directly to the crown).  </li>
      <li>Straight Making No Frizz Styling Creme only because Sephora was offering it as a sample.</li>
      <li>Does not make it soft</li>
      <li>I have allergies and am sensitive to smells and it does not make me sneeze.  </li>
      <li>No heavy, greasey build up.  </li>
      <li>I have color-treated, naturally curly hair that has damage and breakage.</li>
      <li>I live in the desert in the middle east, and this product keeps my hair stick straight even when its 115 degrees outside and 100% humidity.  </li>
      <li>While not quite photo-ready without laying in extra product, Living Proof&#x27;s no-frizz system creates a natural look with bounce and free flow without the mess of frizz.</li>
      <li>This is supposed to be a no-frizz line, but my hair is literally frizzier than it has ever been, and this includes the time I had my bags stolen at JFK in the middle of summer and had to use hotel products on my hair and style with a hotel blow-dryer with no flat iron, then go out in the high humidity.  </li>
      <li>Hair looks absolutely natural, including the occasional fly-away from too-short strands.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally wavy and can be a challenge at times especially with any humidity.  </li>
      <li>That is why I only apply the product to the ends of my hair (it gets naturally distributed to the crown of my head when brushing / blowdrying -</li>
      <li>One key thing to be aware of with this product is that it DOES NOT work unless you use it with heat (i.e. you have to blow dry and/or flat iron your hair after applying it).  </li>
      <li>Now excuse me while I go throw away all the old hair products in my cabinet!</li>
      <li>Then, I still blow dry and flat iron, but it makes my hair MUCH smoother, and</li>
      <li>Before using this product, I would usually blow dry my hair, which makes it pretty straight on its own, but it is still not smooth - especially at the ends, so I would use a flat iron to tame the ends.  </li>
      <li>and I blow it dry, finishing with a round brush and then run a flat iron through it to smooth it out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was very small and costly especially when it calls for coating of entire hair.  It made my hair frizzier inside and outside in the humidity.</li>
    <li> I have long naturally blonde hair.  The texture is fairly smooth on the top layer but kind of a frizzy mess in the back on the bottom layer.  My hair is one length and I blow it dry, finishing with a round brush and then run a flat iron through it to smooth it out.  I live in Florida and it is hot and humid so by the time I would get to my car I&#x27;d sweat a little on my neck under my hair .. and my frizzy mess would return.  This product prevents that from happening and helps give my hair an overall smoothness and shine.  My hair feels healthy and looks great with this product.</li>
    <li> I think this product can work, but it seems like the people who like it have hair that isn&#x27;t very dry or damaged and just need a little extra control.  I have color-treated, naturally curly hair that has damage and breakage. I used this product in varying amounts and alway had the same results.  When blow-drying, it became hard to get the brush through my hair as it dried.  The best way I can describe it was like having a coating of shoe polish on my hair with a slightly tacky texture.  It made my hair look dull and lifeless and it became a little bit stiff.  I definitely do not recommend for those with curly and dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Coping with Florida&#x27;s humidity is always a challenge. This product worked about as well on the frizz as other much less expensive products. However, I did notice significantly more breakage than I do when using Frizz-Ease, which I will be returning to.</li>
    <li> I have a cabinet full of hair products promises to get rid of the frizz and make my hair soft and manageable -- none of them work.  I read about this in Oprah Magazine and promised myself I wasn&#x27;t going to fall for something else yet again.  However, I live near the ocean, and there&#x27;s usually a stiff wind blowing humidity off the water, so in desparation I decided to try this Living Proof Straight Making No Frizz cream.  IT WORKS!  I have very thick, coarse, frizzy hair, and this makes it shiny, soft and straight.  Not only that, but once I&#x27;ve blow-dried or flat ironed it, it STAYS for several days.  I love it.  The downside of it is that you do have to use a lot of it and its kind of pricy -- but well worth it.    Now excuse me while I go throw away all the old hair products in my cabinet!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and live in a very humid area.  During the summer it is a fight to keep my hair straight but now using the No Frizz Serum it stays smooth and silky during the most warm and humid days!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers I have everything on the market. Much of which never sees the light of day again. I tried Living Proof Straight Making No Frizz Styling Creme only because Sephora was offering it as a sample. I love it. I put it through my hair section by section and then blow dry section by section, then go over with flat iron. My hair is crazy thick and coarse which is why the extra time is needed. My hair ends up stick straight and soft with nice texture. I love this product and will buy again when my tester runs out. Like another reviewer pointed out the stuff has a smell to it when you put it on - it reminds me of the way Aveda products have the distinct smell, but once my hair is dry I no longer smell it.</li>
    <li> As a hair stylist and salon owner, I literally had tried all professional products for my hair, after all I could try them for free as samples or return them if I purchased them. I had suffered with my naturally frizzy, wavy hair, spending at least 45 minutes every day to look decent to go to work. But never really happy with my hair. I was in Sephora one day with my Mom, and I saw the Living Proof. After hearing the sales pitch and return if not happy, I thought what could I lose by trying it? It was love after first shampoo. My hair looked great, took less time and effort to do, and my hair looked great for an additional day-I get 3 days as opposed to 2 between shampoos. But what really sold me was the way my hair felt. My hair is of a coarser feel and with the Living Proof, it felt silky, but not like slimy from creme rinse or weighed down like with a heavy product. And as I have used in over the last 3 years, my hair has continued to improve. Yes, it is very expensive and I can get products at cost, but with my hair it is worth every penny. Try it at Nordstrom or Sephora, where you can return it. But I bet you will be thrilled with the results. I really like the styling products the best of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to:&lt;br /&gt;1. Buy back extra time by spending less on your hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Really love your hair, not just think it is okay, acceptable, best it can be&lt;br /&gt;3. Enjoy many new compliments about your hair and believe they are sincere&lt;br /&gt;4. Have more hair styles to pick from, because your hair now behaves-it obeys you&lt;br /&gt;5. KNOW that when it counts the most, your hair will not let you down by looking bad....&lt;br /&gt;Then try this system-after all you will see that it works for yourself because your hair will provide the Living Proof.</li>
    <li> Revived the wrong product</li>
    <li> It did not perform as advertised.  Quite a disappointment.  I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my $ on this expensive non working product. (I used a gift card).  I did research and found a review that stated after she called the company and complained that it didn&#x27;t work, that people use non-silicone shampoo and conditioner.  I did just that. Still didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after reading a review in my newspaper about how it was the first new anti-frizz technology in a decade. I have medium-fine hair and lots of it, with lots of body. I can style it curly or straight, but it gets frizzy in Washington, DC&#x27;s incredibly humid summers. I followed the instructions and applied it before styling with a flatiron, and the immediate results were great. My hair was shiny and smooth and straightened out really nicely. I thought I had finally found the frizzfighter I&#x27;d always been looking for. The next day, though, my hair was dryer, frizzier, and duller-looking than if I hadn&#x27;t used the product at all. If you wash and style your hair every day, or maybe even have a different type of hair, it might work fine. I&#x27;m sorry I spent the money though.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this product.  For me - this product is a miracle!  My hair texture is not curly and not straight - kind of in between (but more on the straight side).  However, it is impossible for me to wear it wavy, because it just looks like a half wavy / half straight frizzy mess!  Before using this product, I would usually blow dry my hair, which makes it pretty straight on its own, but it is still not smooth - especially at the ends, so I would use a flat iron to tame the ends.  Enter this product - I use about a quarter-sized dallop, and rub it in mostly to the ends of my towel dried hair (I have long hair -down to my shoulder blades, and apply this product to the bottom 4-6 inches).  Then, I still blow dry and flat iron, but it makes my hair MUCH smoother, and the anti-frizz lasts all day - even when I go outside (vs. when I don&#x27;t use the product, my hair will frizz up when I go outside, even after the flat iron).  I live in the desert in the middle east, and this product keeps my hair stick straight even when its 115 degrees outside and 100% humidity.  This product has also cut my styling time down by about 1/3 - as I now don&#x27;t have to flat-iron my whole head, I just need to touch up the ends - and sometimes I can get away with not flat ironing (if I&#x27;ve done a good job straightening with the paddle brush during my blow-dry).  It also seems to make my hair dry a little bit faster with the blow dryer.  One key thing to be aware of with this product is that it DOES NOT work unless you use it with heat (i.e. you have to blow dry and/or flat iron your hair after applying it).  According to Sephora (and I have seen this in person), the heat activates the \\&quot;straightening\\&quot; properties.  So you can&#x27;t just apply this product and air dry - it won&#x27;t work.  Also, I have read that others said it doesn&#x27;t work with shampoo / conditioner containing silicone.  I haven&#x27;t checked my shampoo / conditioner, but I don&#x27;t think mine contains silicone (I use Pureology shampoo andconditioners, which are sulfite free).  I wash my hair daily, and this product does work better each day you use it in a row (i.e. after using it each day for about a week, it gets to its best).  However, for me I have tried not washing my hair on day 2, but for some reason the anti-frizz properties are not as good on day 2 (i.e. the non-wash day) - even if I have flat ironed my hair.  That is totally fine with me, since I prefer to wash every day.  Also just be aware not to use too much product - for me when I use too much it makes my roots greasy by the end of the day.  That is why I only apply the product to the ends of my hair (it gets naturally distributed to the crown of my head when brushing / blowdrying - so there is no need to apply it directly to the crown).  This product has a nice, but not overwhelmingly strong smell.  Usually I can only smell it immediately after I put it on, but not throughout the day.  I have allergies and am sensitive to smells and it does not make me sneeze.  This product also does a good job of protecting my hair from damage (i.e. from daily blow drying and flat ironing) as it forms a protective layer over the hair shaft.  I have tried tons of straightening products for my hair - and this one by FAR works the best.</li>
    <li> With shipping I paid approx. $30 for this product.  What a rip off!!  I was very upset to find it doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  I have medium length, wavy, thick hair which I straighten every day.  This stuff didn&#x27;t work any better than the $3 products you can buy at Walmart.  I live in FL and it does not fight the humidity at all!!!  Does not make it soft, does not help it get any straighter than if I used no product at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!  This product is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I like the straight making styling cream another misleading item I purchased, living proof used to make it the picture shows straight making but..,.,i was sent nourishing styling cream I wanted straight. I can buy nourishing in a store by me I don&#x27;t need to go on line to get it what a waste of time and money for me. thanks for the false picture.</li>
    <li> Based on my horrible experience with the No Frizz shampoo, conditioner and styling cream, I’m calling out the glowing reviews of Living Prof as shams.  Some background first:  I am a Caucasian female with lots of fine, chemically straightened hair, damaged by years of too much heat and too many chemicals.  I have my hair done at good salons and regularly use high-end products (Kerastase, Rene Furterer, Bumble and Bumble, Crema,  etc.) and a few low-end products that perform above average (E.g., Tres Semme heat protectant).  I have also tried the infomercial products (e.g., Coolway Transform, Ovation, Wen).  Before Living Proof No Frizz, Wen was the biggest fail:  While it made my hair soft, it also made it fall out in large masses.  Put simply though, I will take shiny soft hair that falls out over the dry, unruly, frizzy mess Living Proof No Frizz produced.  This is supposed to be a no-frizz line, but my hair is literally frizzier than it has ever been, and this includes the time I had my bags stolen at JFK in the middle of summer and had to use hotel products on my hair and style with a hotel blow-dryer with no flat iron, then go out in the high humidity.  That was bad – this is WORSE!! In addition to being frizzy, my hair is dry, which makes it poufy.  And it looks filthy.  And the wave is more pronounced.  My hair is literally defying my Sedu Revolution flat iron. Finally, although I can’t swear to it, it looks to me like the products stripped my demi-permanent hair color.  It has been three weeks since I had my hair colored, then treated separately with Sebastian Cellophanes.  My hair was still dark and shiny.  After two uses of the no-frizz line (shampoo, conditioner, and styling lotion), my hair looks noticeably lighter, with no shine.  Seriously – this product is so bad I don’t have a clue how Jennifer Aniston – or anyone who cares about a reputation -- lends her name to it.  I was ready to ditch it after the first use, but thought that perhaps I used too much of the styling product (instructions say to use liberally), so I cut way back the second time – same results though.  BEWARE.  If you are still tempted to give Living Proof a try, buy where you can return it.  I am taking it back tomorrow.  Those of you who say it works – I am calling you out as fakes!!!!!  I will post this everywhere I can, to give us ladies a heads up!used too much of the styling product (instructions say to use liberally), so I cut way back the second time – same results though.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before so I knew it would be good.  But this is the first time I purchased it from this provider.  Very fast shipping. And pricing was very good.  Would definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy and can be a challenge at times especially with any humidity.  This product makes a huge difference in drying and styling my hair plus I have no frizz now or hair that sticks up.  Tell people about this all the time.</li>
    <li> My excitement for this product mostly paid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a fresh bouquet with the wrapper still on, and feels luxurious in the shower. A half-teaspoon of the shampoo is enough to generously lather my thick, mid-back length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? Using the shampoo and conditioner will not create the look of slick, sheet-like hair with a lot of product in it. Add in the styling gel, and you now actually have straight shine that can survive heat treatment and still smooth your hairstyle. The styling system is a lightweight product that, aside from its heavenly scent, feels and looks like it isn&#x27;t there. As if it softened your hair, like boiling water on ramen, then went away. Hair looks absolutely natural, including the occasional fly-away from too-short strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the strands seem to want to line up together. Over your entire head, your hair falls smoothly and naturally, soft and supple, relaxing close to your head as if by choice. No one would ever call your hair frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Testing environment: Hot tropical island, close to coast. Washed with hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Perfect for normal women with frizzy hair to use every day. Not for high fashion or anyone who wants to look like they have products in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: While not quite photo-ready without laying in extra product, Living Proof&#x27;s no-frizz system creates a natural look with bounce and free flow without the mess of frizz.</li>
    <li> This product has a great clean smell to it and really does work well on over straightened, frizzy hair.  I apply everytime I flat iron my hair and since you dont wash straightened hair everyday, the added fresh smell feels like you freshly shampooed your hair.  No heavy, greasey build up.  I tried/used a ton of anti frizz straightening products, and this one was a success.  I can&#x27;t afford it aways, as a bit pricey, but is a wonderful hair product.</li>
    <li> This is a super product for those of us who want straight hair but were born with wavy hair. I found that I had to use quite a bit, two quarter size squirts, for my long hair. My came out straighter than usual after my blow dry and was very soft. I still had to use a flat iron, but it didn&#x27;t take quite as long to get all of my locks super straight.    The only negative of this product is the price. Considering the amount that I need to use, I would go through a bottle a week. If you have the bucks, try it, you will like it.</li>
    <li> Well, once again I fell victim to a \\&quot;no frizz\\&quot; product promise. This product didn&#x27;t do anything for my frizzy hair, didn&#x27;t control the curls, nothing. It&#x27;s expensive with little results. I&#x27;m still looking for a miracle.</li>
    <li> it does straighten your hair and fill in the breaks of the hair shaft that would other wise pick up moisture in the humidity.  only use a little bit!  it will last a long time so the price is comparable to other quality products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t perform to my liking.  I had read so many great things about this company and product but the Frizz Cream did not keep my hair frizz free.</li>
    <li> like I said product itself is very good since I already know and have using it before.&lt;br /&gt; But this is the first time purchasing  in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;very dissapointed with the condition of the container. Unknown sticky, dusty, and, black markers are everywhere on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason why I&#x27;m not returning this is just I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
    <li> I really like this product because it keeps my hair from frizzing and it protects my hair when I use my hair dryer, flat iron or hot rollers.</li>
