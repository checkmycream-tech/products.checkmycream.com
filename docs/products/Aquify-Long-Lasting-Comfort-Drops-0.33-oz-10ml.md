      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>My first choice.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a seasoned wearer.</li>
      <li>And the product does exactly what it says.  </li>
      <li>if it really</li>
      <li>Product is very moisturizing to the eyes.  </li>
      <li>I like these - they really soothe my eyes</li>
      <li>I like this product very well.  </li>
      <li>I usually use it one time a day, and it an be used more, but once a day adds the moisture needed to keep my contact lens very comfortable all day long.</li>
      <li>My eye doctor highly recommends them</li>
      <li>These drops kept my lenses comfortable, and clear for the whole day, and half the evening.  </li>
      <li>I live in a desert climate, wear soft contacts.</li>
      <li>I sometimes suffer from dry eyes and find Aquify Solution and Comfort Drops the only products that provide comfortable contact lens wear.</li>
      <li>They replenish the moisture, clean the contacts, and last more then just a few minutes like the other drops do.</li>
      <li>this product fixed all of my issues.</li>

      <li>probably every few days/applications, I use blink&#x27;n&#x27;clean.  </li>
      <li>Why pay 10x the per ml rate of your multipurpose solution just to have the exact same solution in a smaller bottle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>I had used this product some years ago and It really gave dry eyes a relief.  </li>

      <li>I was stunned and more than a little ticked off when my local Walmart Store discontinued this product a little over 2 years ago.  </li>
      <li>I recently moved to another state and none of the stores have them (checked all the major stores like Walm-Mart and Target as well as the smaller ones like CVS/Walgreens</li>
      <li>If you use a drop in each lense every morning, this little bottle will last you a long, long time so, worth the amount paid.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every drop out there, I&#x27;ve wasted hundreds in search of drops that actually work---providing relief that lasts and doesn&#x27;t cause any unpleasant effects.  I&#x27;d say roughly 3/4 of the drops on the market perform like Chap Stick: once it wears off, you&#x27;re left even more dry and uncomfortable than before you used it.  The rest just don&#x27;t do what they say they do.  Half end up making your eyes feel almost gummy with regular use.  Why pay 10x the per ml rate of your multipurpose solution just to have the exact same solution in a smaller bottle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, one day I found what we&#x27;ve all been looking for.  Aquify drops.  I still didn&#x27;t know just how good I had it though until I ran out and couldn&#x27;t find them.  I bought some other brand, thinking no big deal.  I got irritated real fast with the other brand.  I still couldn&#x27;t find them so I tried another brand... and another... and another.  Then I finally found them again.  I cleaned out their stock.  Recently I&#x27;ve run out again, and now I&#x27;m ordering these here.  It&#x27;s a good price, less than I pay retail.  And the product does exactly what it says.  It actually relieves your dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, these go great with blink&#x27;n&#x27;clean.  I use aquify as needed and probably every few days/applications, I use blink&#x27;n&#x27;clean.  Seems to extend the life of my contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the great work, CIBA!  And please don&#x27;t ever change or discontinue these!</li>

    <li> These are the best contact lens drops!  My eye doctor highly recommends them and I see why (no pun intended).  No other contact lens drops will work for my sensitive and dry eyes.</li>
    <li> I went to all the drug stores, including Target and Walmart to buy Aquify Long-Lasting Comfort Drops and no one carries them. I was so happy when I found them in Amazon.  Too bad it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger bottle.  My eye doctor recommended this product because of my dry eyes after my laser surgery.  Great product!</li>

    <li> I like these - they really soothe my eyes</li>
    <li> Aquify is a great product that little people no about because Opti-Free and Clean-Care dominate the contact industry. The re-wetting drops from aquify is great because you only need one application and your good to go for a long time. I have contacts on for 12+ hours daily because I am always on the move. I put 1 drop in each eye during my lunch break and I feel like the contacts are fresh from my storage case. Heres a tip: apply a drop of the re-wetting drops before you take out your contacts and it&#x27;ll be easier to take them out instead of pinch your eyeballs to death.</li>
    <li> I order these specific drops because my eyes are sensitive and this is the product I was recommended to buy by my doctor and the one that worked for me. But instead I received a completely different looking product. Seem to be similar but now I don&#x27;t know if it really is.&lt;br /&gt;So if you need to buy this product specifically, don&#x27;t bother ordering here.</li>

    <li> I like this product very well.  It seems to last quite awhile. Living in New Mexico, everything is dry including eyes so I have to use a product like this all the time.  This may be the best I have ever used. At this point in time I intend to continue using this one.  I also ordered the soaking solution and am very happy with that. I wear round the clock nite and day contacts. Drops like these make it possible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only drops I like, don&#x27;t know why they are no longer in regular drugstores.  If you use a drop in each lense every morning, this little bottle will last you a long, long time so, worth the amount paid.  Nothing else feels like it.</li>

    <li> Aquify comfort drops were my daily go to solution for inserting my RGP lenses in my eye.  I was stunned and more than a little ticked off when my local Walmart Store discontinued this product a little over 2 years ago.  I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a comparable product, and as of now have not found an equal to it.  These drops kept my lenses comfortable, and clear for the whole day, and half the evening.  I just can&#x27;t figure out why companies have a great product, and then just dump it.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense.  The excessively high price online for this, in the very limited places where u can find it, are totally ridiculous.  Please bring back my Aquify!!!!</li>
