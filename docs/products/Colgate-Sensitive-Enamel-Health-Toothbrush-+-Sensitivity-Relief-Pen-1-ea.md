      <li>It was nice and easy on my teeth and gums and</li>
      <li>Better than a manual toothbrush for me.</li>
      <li>I never saw this product before... was so glad to see it appear in Vine...</li>
      <li>Love the way the head feels and brushes.  </li>
      <li>More money.</li>
      <li>they will never get better</li>
      <li>The taste is ok.</li>
      <li>I love how the pen fits in the brush.</li>
      <li>I really love this pen, and when it runs out....</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is softer than most I have tried but designed with lots of bristles to cover more area when I brush.</li>
      <li>Three days with the sensitivity pen worked better than any of them</li>
      <li>I just started using the relief pen, and within 48hrs, I notice significant relief!  </li>
      <li>The Sensitivity Pen fits into the bottom of the toothbrush and is easy to use - twist the knob at the bottom of the pen until gel appears on the tip.</li>
      <li>You could easily just stick to the routine you&#x27;re in now</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>I liked this toothbrush pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally think of tooth brushing in terms of pleasantness but this one just feels good.</li>
      <li>The toothbrush itself is good, the bristles are very soft.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy handle is easy to hold, and the bristles are like air, gentle, but very effective cleaning agents.</li>
      <li>I freely admit to not being diligent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, the toothbrush too bulky to fit in my toothbrush holder</li>
      <li>The toothbrush is so light that, even with the pen inserted, you feel like you are holding</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still relatively comfortable, however.</li>
      <li>I did like how the pen is designed to fit inside the brush.</li>
      <li>(your results may not be as good, since sensitivity has many different causes).</li>
      <li>As for the brush itself, the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t cause soreness with the first use, while also doing a great job of scrubbing my teeth.</li>
      <li>So I was excited to try out this sensitivity gel.</li>
      <li>Clean</li>
      <li>, I never thought it would actually clean my teeth.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unlike many extra-soft brushes, which feel just too soft, this one adds some rubber bristles to give more oomph.</li>
      <li>The sensitive gel numbs the teeth at first and then tastes pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Storing the Sensitivity Pen is a mixed blessing – it is a great feature because I know exactly the gel is when I need it; it is not so great if my teeth started hurting when I am away from home and not near my toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The soft toothbrush is a nice touch.</li>
      <li>gel has no bad taste---it tastes sort of like toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>A lot of toothbrushes have moved to this dynamic, but Colgate&#x27;s is the best one I have used simply because my teeth feel clean</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this is a really interesting concept I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update when I know how long the toothbrush bristles stay good.</li>
      <li>the research looks credible and promising.</li>
      <li>I really love this sensitive toothbrush with a built-in sensitivity relief pen.  </li>
      <li>This pen thing ain&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say it was completely gone, but it was certainly better.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a very clean process, both on the insides while one is sawing away at the sensitive spots and afterword when the wand gets used again and</li>
      <li>The Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush introduces a pretty interesting concept.</li>
      <li>This is one of many recent products intended to desensitize teeth and protect enamel from mild acidic demineralization.  </li>
      <li>The tube stores right inside of the bottom part of the toothbrush, very conveniently!  </li>
      <li>My wife is the one with the sensitive teeth and regularly uses Sensodyne toothpaste with consistently good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very gentle.</li>
      <li>So far this toothbrush is working just fine.</li>
      <li>And, overall, I was pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Sure, this isn&#x27;t exactly the reason it&#x27;s made but it still actually worked well for me.</li>
      <li>her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitivity relief didn&#x27;t last more than 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>I am used to brushing with an electronic toothbrush (Philips brand), but I am using this more and more instead of that because that one simply hurts my teeth and gums, even when switched to its &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; settings because the heads that attach are ultimately not very accommodating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have super sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>The handle is bigger than most normal toothbrush handles and has a grip to it which I like.</li>
      <li>Most people think they have to grind away with tough, stiff bristles and this really does more harm than good.  </li>
      <li>Comes with a tube of sensitive relief spray that is nearly stored inside the brush for easy access.</li>
      <li>The cream doesn&#x27;t taste good or bad, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>You can really feel the numbing agent take affect.  </li>
      <li>Much to my amazement, I could not find any.  </li>
      <li>and you are ready to go.  </li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just requires too much effort to use with an effect I didn&#x27;t even notice.</li>
      <li>It could be coincidence but it really seemed to make a difference for me.</li>
      <li>The problem is my son has real dental problems that need fixing so this really didn&#x27;t alleviate the pain.</li>
      <li>The application wand looks really officious and like it is all business, and I suppose that it is.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the cream on a tooth that can be sensitive -- the cream comes out easily, brushes on fairly well, but I&#x27;m not sure how well the cream stays on long term.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure the sensitivity pen worked.</li>
      <li>At the same time, it does a great job cleaning my teeth, which I think is in part due to three circular rubber &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; that are blended in with the traditional bristles.</li>
      <li>The style of this brush is just like my older whitening brush that came with a clip-on polisher.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used toothpaste for sensitive teeth without much help, so I was very eager to try this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that I will buy this for future use when this sample runs out and in any event, I have become a Colgate convert after a lifelong aversion to the brand.  </li>
      <li>high priced to me, but that is just my opinion...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d certainly recommend giving this a try if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Apply the gel directly at the source of the pain and gently massage for one minute – there is no need to rinse when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is as soft and gentle as a tooth brush can be.</li>
      <li>You are to apply directly to the source of and gently massage for one minute.  </li>
      <li>I think it would work for people with normal sensitivity but for those who have dental issues there</li>
      <li>You brush like you normally would</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you think of it, if you have sensitive teeth, you need to see a doctor, not buy a soft toothbrush and a numbing gel. So if this set a necessity? Not really. But for an occasional sensitivity period, I guess, this brush will work. It is as soft and gentle as a tooth brush can be. It will spare you some pain after possibly some dental work for a day or two while your gums are getting over shots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the sensitivity relief gel particularly effective, but maybe it&#x27;s just me. I did like how the pen is designed to fit inside the brush. That is neat.</li>
    <li> I was interested in trying this out as I have one tooth that is very sensitive, particularly to cold, and that rinse right after brushing can be quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this did not really seem to help very much--the instructions indicate that the gel should be rubbed into the affected area for a minute.  After doing so, the sensitivity problem was solved, but only briefly--as soon as you drink your morning coffee, it washes it away.  There is no long term relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself is *way* too soft.  The bristles left my teeth feeling like they had not been brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to a toothbrush with a little more oomph and a tube of Orajel to carry around with me to use when needed.</li>
    <li> I liked this toothbrush pretty well.  The head is soft and small.  The sensitive gel numbs the teeth at first and then tastes pleasant.  It was nice and easy on my teeth and gums and I like using it.  The gel last a while, as I still have some left.  And, overall, I was pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have super sensitive teeth but I do have sensitive gums. I usually go for &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrushes however some of them are more flimsy than soft. The Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush introduces a pretty interesting concept. You brush like you normally would and you&#x27;re also provided a &amp;#34;pain relief pen&amp;#34; for after. I am lucky enough that I&#x27;d never really experienced &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; after brushing my teeth so I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s like. My gums do sometimes tend to get irritated though and the pain relief pen did an okay job of making it feel a little less swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is a really interesting concept I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth the price. You&#x27;re basically just getting a rather flimsy toothbrush and a pain relief pen. You could easily just stick to the routine you&#x27;re in now and if you need pain relief go grab an ice packet. It&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush Plus Built-In Sensitivity Pen features extra soft bristles and soft rubber polishing caps. The Sensitivity Pen fits into the bottom of the toothbrush and is easy to use - twist the knob at the bottom of the pen until gel appears on the tip. Apply the gel directly at the source of the pain and gently massage for one minute – there is no need to rinse when you are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked on this toothbrush because of the soft bristles - they are the softest I have ever found in a toothbrush - they make brushing my teeth pleasurable. The toothbrush also does a great job of cleaning my teeth. The gel in the Sensitivity Pen is very effective - my teeth aren&#x27;t in the greatest shape and the does a great job relieving the occasional pain I get in my teeth/gums. Storing the Sensitivity Pen is a mixed blessing – it is a great feature because I know exactly the gel is when I need it; it is not so great if my teeth started hurting when I am away from home and not near my toothbrush. Also, the toothbrush too bulky to fit in my toothbrush holder - I am storing it on a shelf in my bathroom cabinet which is less than ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush Plus Built-In Sensitivity Pen has a few flaws but it is worth buying for the soft bristles alone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for several weeks and find that its softness is not like any manual toothbrush I have ever used before. It&#x27;s very sturdy handle is easy to hold, and the bristles are like air, gentle, but very effective cleaning agents.</li>
    <li> Seemed like a great idea but did not work for my daughters nerve pain in her tooth. Guess hers was just too severe and she needed a root canal. Might work for just normal sensitive teeth on someone else - but didn&#x27;t work for us:-(</li>
    <li> Pro-argin formulation is the best way to prevent sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Does not seem effective</li>
    <li> Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush really works, and it is 20-percent less expensive on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush and sensitive tooth treatment combo is a great idea!  I have an extremely sensitive tooth.  I often have to avoid either cold or hot drinks and food because of the pain.  I&#x27;ve used toothpaste for sensitive teeth without much help, so I was very eager to try this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like this---the toothbrush is quite a standard brush, except for having a hollow end opposite the brush.  It comes with a little dispenser of gel to put on the sensitive area.  You turn a dial at the end of the dispenser a few times, and gel comes out, and you apply it to the tooth that needs it.  There is a rubberized massaging area where the gel comes out, and you are instructed to massage the area for one minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After treatment, I had a nice glass of cold water and the sensitivity/pain was MUCH reduced!  I won&#x27;t say it was completely gone, but it was certainly better.  I was very happy!  I used it again in the evening (you are instructed to use it twice a day) and after the second time, the pain was even less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel has no bad taste---it tastes sort of like toothpaste.  It is supposed to seal off the area so the nerves can&#x27;t cause the pain, and I think it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser stores inside the toothbrush when you aren&#x27;t using it, so this takes up little more room than a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d certainly recommend giving this a try if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush has ultra soft bristles for those with sensitive teeth and gums. Comes with a tube of sensitive relief spray that is nearly stored inside the brush for easy access. I don&#x27;t have problems with sensitive teeth or guns but this toothbrush/spray would be helpful for those that do!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars</li>
    <li> Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush.  I go through toothbrushes, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different types.  This is a good toothbrush.  It has a built-in sensitivity relief pen.  I really love this pen, and when it runs out....I guess I will have to get another if I feel I need another for sensitivity purposes. (which I probably will.)  You are to apply directly to the source of and gently massage for one minute.  Two clicks of gel per sensitive tooth is recommended, and no rinsing is required.  Use after brushing.  I gave you the directions, so now you know how to do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
    <li> It seemed to help sensitivity for a little bit, didn&#x27;t last long though so I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This sensitive brush has extra soft bristles and the sensitivity toothpaste flavor is acceptable.  You can really feel the numbing agent take affect.  The only major drawback to that this&#x27; not an electric toothbrush.  You brush your teeth, then apply the relief paste directly your gums, messaging in the white paste for a minute manually with a plastic applicator located on the pen.  When finished, there&#x27;s no need to rinse-just put the tube inside the toothbrush and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> So far this toothbrush is working just fine. I only wish it were battery operated. The bristles don&#x27;t seem that different from the regular soft colgate toothbrushes I usually use. I&#x27;ve used the cream on a tooth that can be sensitive -- the cream comes out easily, brushes on fairly well, but I&#x27;m not sure how well the cream stays on long term. The cream doesn&#x27;t taste good or bad, so that&#x27;s nice. This may be helpful for people with sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ll update when I know how long the toothbrush bristles stay good.</li>
    <li> I have braces and the ultra soft bristles are awesome! To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure the sensitivity pen worked. The gel tastes like artificial ingredients, so I didn&#x27;t use it but a couple of times.</li>
    <li> This product sounded like it would be great. My son has very sensitive teeth and I thought it would be a great solution. The problem is my son has real dental problems that need fixing so this really didn&#x27;t alleviate the pain. I think it would work for people with normal sensitivity but for those who have dental issues there appears to be no other solution other that visiting the dentist. Darn It.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush itself has extremely soft bristles - almost too soft. I find myself having to brush a little harder than I usually would just to feel like I&#x27;m actually cleaning my teeth. It&#x27;s still relatively comfortable, however. The sensitivity gel didn&#x27;t work as great as I hoped. As others have noted, it seems to work for a short while, but this could be more due to massaging the area. It certainly doesn&#x27;t last long. Overall, it&#x27;s a decent sensitive brush with a gimmicky sensitivity gel that may or may not provide any actual help with sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Not battery operated!!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush itself is good, the bristles are very soft.  The handle is bigger than most normal toothbrush handles and has a grip to it which I like.It also comes with a sensitive teeth gel pen that clips into the bottom of the brush.  You twist it and then a little of the gel comes out so you can brush your teeth.  Usually my teeth are sensitive to cold water, but I&#x27;ve been able to drink water and it&#x27;s been fine.  It&#x27;s difficult to know when you have brushed enough on or when it&#x27;s been brushed on well.  There is no noticeable taste with it either.  You just massage/brush it in for a minute and you are ready to go.  I would recommend this to anyone that suffers from sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> A soft toothbrush is a plus for sensitive teeth and gums and this one fits the bill.  I use to work for a dentist and they recommend soft toothbrushes, when brushing your teeth.  Most people think they have to grind away with tough, stiff bristles and this really does more harm than good.  I like the softness of these bristles.  The base of this toothbrush is larger than most, but this is so the tooth sensitive remedy that comes along with it can be stored up inside the handle.  It has a mild toothpaste like flavor and does work on the areas I have with cold sensitivity in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Like the concept.  Love the way the head feels and brushes.  Love how effective it looks.&lt;br /&gt;The problems are as follow: 1} The bristle pattern on the head looks really strange, almost off-putting but the feel on the teeth and gums is really nice.  I got the impression that I was actually massaging my teeth and gums.  The problem is that, and it may be down to the extra soft bristles, is that edges of plaque were left on the vertical curves of my tooth surfaces.  I noticed this as the day worn on and I could feel little strips of build up that caused me to reach into my mouth with a tissue and wipe me teef down.&lt;br /&gt;2)  The application wand looks really officious and like it is all business, and I suppose that it is.  The problem is that the instructions state that one needs to rub the sensitive surfaces for one minute.  I&#x27;m not sure what that means.  One minute per tooth; one minute per bank; one minute per mouth?  No matter which, one minute is a very long time, just time it.  Furthermore, the wand is good for the oustides of one&#x27;s teef but it is quite unwieldy for use on the insides, and this is a problem.&lt;br /&gt;3)  It isn&#x27;t a very clean process, both on the insides while one is sawing away at the sensitive spots and afterword when the wand gets used again and there is caked stuff on it, and I think that there will always be caked stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I like the effect this has and the tingling sensation afterward.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that I will buy this for future use when this sample runs out and in any event, I have become a Colgate convert after a lifelong aversion to the brand.  The stuff that got me is the isotonic or foaming sensitive toothpaste it sells.  New product and it is GREAT!</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Better than a manual toothbrush for me. Soft bristles. Sensitivity Relief pen works well also with continued use.</li>
    <li> As advertised / helped with pain</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is softer than most I have tried but designed with lots of bristles to cover more area when I brush. Does the job well and feels nicer than I expected. I don&#x27;t normally think of tooth brushing in terms of pleasantness but this one just feels good. The little pen works well. I have two back teeth that get a little sensitive and this seems to be helping. I love how the pen fits in the brush. I probably wouldn&#x27;t be using it everyday if it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I never saw this product before... was so glad to see it appear in Vine... cause I have sensitive Teeth... for unexplained reasons, some teeth will be ultra sensitive to hot, cold, or just mouthwash.  I just started using the relief pen, and within 48hrs, I notice significant relief!  A product like this was long over do for those of us with sensitive teeth, willl report back in a month or two after further use...&lt;br /&gt;Hoping the sell the pen, without the brush, as the brush is too soft for my liking... not sure why the combined them...</li>
    <li> I received this toothbrush and thought it was a major fail – the bristles are so very, very soft, I never thought it would actually clean my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brushed my teeth and then used some disclosing tablets used to show areas that are missed after brushing.  Much to my amazement, I could not find any.  As soft as the brush was, it seemed to somehow get my teeth clean without irritating my sensitive gums.  I was so skeptical, I had to try it again on a different day.  Same result.  Clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen requires some diligence, as the effects build over a week.  I freely admit to not being diligent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen fits in the handle, which is huge and may not fit in a traditional toothbrush holder.</li>
    <li> You click the tube into the handle of the brush to get the sensitivity cream to dispense. The bristles are soft and there are rubber like cups to help polish the teeth. I have trigeminal neuralgia so brushing can bet intolerable. This system makes it easier to brush with less pain.</li>
    <li> I continue to use this toothbrush for the brush itself, as I am a hard brusher (that&#x27;s just my nature!) with sensitive teeth and gums. I brush so hard that I&#x27;ve often cut my gums, resulting in canker sores. No matter how hard I have brushed with this Colgate in the past month, I have yet to experience any pain or cut my gums. At the same time, it does a great job cleaning my teeth, which I think is in part due to three circular rubber &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; that are blended in with the traditional bristles. A lot of toothbrushes have moved to this dynamic, but Colgate&#x27;s is the best one I have used simply because my teeth feel clean and I can continue to brush hard without injury. I am used to brushing with an electronic toothbrush (Philips brand), but I am using this more and more instead of that because that one simply hurts my teeth and gums, even when switched to its &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; settings because the heads that attach are ultimately not very accommodating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the gel-filled pen included with this toothbrush, I am not using it. I used it twice and simply didn&#x27;t like how the gel feels on my teeth and it&#x27;s just requires too much effort to use with an effect I didn&#x27;t even notice. The pen slides into the handle of the toothbrush easily enough and stays there (and is a tight enough fit to be waterproof, as I keep my brush in the shower). The toothbrush is so light that, even with the pen inserted, you feel like you are holding nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can find a product like this without the gel pen, that&#x27;s what I will ultimately recommend for those with sensitive teeth seeking a toothbrush that will allow them to brush aggressively without injury. Without the gel pen, I figure one could cut at least $5 off this price.</li>
    <li> I really love this sensitive toothbrush with a built-in sensitivity relief pen.  The regular toothbrush has an extra large handle with rubber grip points that ensure that the brush does not slip or twist as you are brushing.  The sensitivity pen has soft rubbery feeling bristles that don&#x27;t agitate sensitive teeth.  All you do is turn the knob and toothpaste is released on the bristle end.  The toothbrush handle has a way to snap the sensitivity pen to it, so that they don&#x27;t get lost or separated from each other.</li>
    <li> For reasons I can&#x27;t figure out, when I get really stressed I get random tooth pain. It&#x27;s never in the same area like a cavity. It&#x27;s just random spots. I don&#x27;t grind my teeth so it&#x27;s not that. But something as random as only slightly cold water will suddenly hurt then later be fine. So I was excited to try out this sensitivity gel. Sure, this isn&#x27;t exactly the reason it&#x27;s made but it still actually worked well for me. After work, If I&#x27;ve got some sore spots, three times now I&#x27;ve gone ahead and brushed my teeth and applied the gel. It could be coincidence but it really seemed to make a difference for me. Even if it&#x27;s just in my head I&#x27;ll take it! As for the brush itself, the bristles are soft and don&#x27;t cause soreness with the first use, while also doing a great job of scrubbing my teeth. I&#x27;ve always been a manual Brush user and am very happy with th design of this one. It&#x27;s a bit smaller in the head than I typically get but it did the job thoroughly.</li>
    <li> The style of this brush is just like my older whitening brush that came with a clip-on polisher.  Only these bristles are softer.  The pen does help relieve pain along the gum line temporarily until one can get to the dentist because exposed nerves are always in jeopardy of being symptoms of even bigger dental issues.  The taste isn&#x27;t bad, though..</li>
    <li> I do have some sensitive spots around some gold crowns...they will never get better but if I can keep them from getting worse, I will be happy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for a few days, so far so good, but I feel I have to use it for at least a few weeks before saying anything negative.  So far I like the softness of the toothbrush around the gold crowns, I&#x27;m not using the little gel applicator as its too difficult for me to position it my areas of need,&lt;br /&gt;so I am using it sparingly on my fingertip. The taste is ok. Its nice that it fits up into the brush, that way you always know where it is. It seems a&lt;br /&gt;bit high priced to me, but that is just my opinion...has nothing to do with the item or the quality. If there is anything else I discover after using the product for another couple of weeks, I will be back to update my review.</li>
    <li> This neat little product worked well for me and it&#x27;s easy to use. Although it&#x27;s kind of expensive in regular pharmacies, it was worth it. UPDATE: The sensitivity is still gone two months after I applied it. FURTHER UPDATE: The sensitivity is still gone just over a year after I applied it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is one of many recent products intended to desensitize teeth and protect enamel from mild acidic demineralization.  You can key in this product&#x27;s active ingredient -- arginine bicarbonate -- and the research looks credible and promising. You simply massage a gel paste onto sensitive areas for a minute or two after brushing, and that&#x27;s it. The product includes an easy-to-handle extra-soft toothbrush, which brings less abrasion-related sensitivity. Unlike many extra-soft brushes, which feel just too soft, this one adds some rubber bristles to give more oomph. With a softer brush, brushing longer helps, too.&lt;br /&gt;I had a persistently sensitive area with receded gums and a filling placed 6 months ago, and have tried fluoride varnish, sensitive pastes, and APF.  Three days with the sensitivity pen worked better than any of them (your results may not be as good, since sensitivity has many different causes).</li>
    <li> Really works. I have a tooth that is very sensitive and needs some work. This calms it down considerably. The soft toothbrush is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> My wife is the one with the sensitive teeth and regularly uses Sensodyne toothpaste with consistently good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush-gel-pen thing received a &#x27;meh&#x27; rating from her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitivity relief didn&#x27;t last more than 45 minutes. Big downer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is nothing fancy and made in China. Another downer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitivity relief pen will have to be replace. More money. Another downer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d had luck with Sensodyne stay with it. This pen thing ain&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the softest toothbrush i have ever used! It is very gentle. If you have sensitive teeth, try an extra soft toothbrush. You won&#x27;t want to go back to a regular toothbrush afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a small tube of de-sensitizing stuff.  The tube stores right inside of the bottom part of the toothbrush, very conveniently!  I wasn&#x27;t able to find the ingredients for the de-sensitizer, but it works!  Since i started using it, I haven&#x27;t had to reapply any yet, and it&#x27;s been a week.</li>
