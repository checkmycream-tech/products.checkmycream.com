<li> but large bottle lasts a long time with only 1 ounce or less needed.</li>
<li> I use it everyday, so the large bottle will last me a long, long time.</li>
<li> Plus, it left my ends dry and split.  </li>
<li> I recommend the conditioner that is the same brand but comes in a \\&quot;Yellow\\&quot; container instead of the Pink like this shampoo.</li>
<li> so I only have to wash it every other day.</li>
<li> I color my hair and this makes my hair not feel so dry and adds shine.</li>
<li> Highly recommend this product for those who have thick hair.</li>
<li> The only product that moisturizes without weighting my hair down.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and makes my hair shining and not frizzy!</li>
<li> But, I was wrong.  </li>
<li> Considering the size, it is inconvenient to use it without a pump.</li>

    <li> I love these products .My daughter came to visit and fell in love with it. It&#x27;s worth every penny !</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, for sure!  Great quality, lasts a long time.  Makes hair soft, especially just after colouring.  I use it everyday, so the large bottle will last me a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo! Perfect for my hair! Suds up nicely and leaves a clean feeling. I think it helps me go longer between hair coloring appointments. Also, it keeps my hair clean enough so I only have to wash it every other day.</li>
    <li> Good seller.I really recommend</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Have been using it for years and can&#x27;t leave without it. The price is great for this size. I gave it 4 stars because there was no pump in the box for this shampoo. Considering the size, it is inconvenient to use it without a pump. The smaller size I have ordered before all had it.</li>
    <li> Great product-Great price!  Much cheaper than buying at the salon.  I&#x27;m glad to find it in a larger bottle so I can fill travel size bottles to take when needed.  The travel size you buy at the salon cannot be refilled as the top is not removable.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite shampoo! Nothing makes my coarse hair feel softer! I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> this does not have the same look, the same feel, the same washing experience or the same effect on my hair as the first bottle that I bought from my hairdresser.  the bottle and label are the same....hmmmmmm</li>
    <li> I like how my hair feels after using this shampoo.  Light pleasant scent. Somewhat pricey though but large bottle lasts a long time with only 1 ounce or less needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo.  It leaves my hair clean and shiny.  It helps maintain my hair color longer.  My hair stylist suggested this product.  I was using a brand name product I purchased at the grocery store.  It striped the color from my hair quickly.  Plus, it left my ends dry and split.  I noticed immediate improvement.  I was hesitant to spend the money on this shampoo and conditioner.  I did not think it was worth the expense, just a marketing ploy.  But, I was wrong.  The proof is in my hair.  There is a difference.  My hair is so much nicer and the color really lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo! Delivered on time with no problems.  I would buy again in the future.  I color my hair and this makes my hair not feel so dry and adds shine.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for color treated hair - especially blonde.  It is a great moisturizer and smells good, too.  This large size is a great value - beats buying a small size in the salon for a high price.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for highlighted/colored hair I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Have ordered this from Amazon for some time now and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> my favorite shampoo since Loreal company made it! Great strawberry scent, very soapy and gentle for hairs</li>
    <li> good price , fast shipping , very good product,</li>
    <li> The only thing stopping five stars is NO Pump comes with this.  Wonderful smell, great protection for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Loreal Professional is the best around.</li>
    <li> This stuff does a great job and smells wonderful. I do not like to use it without a creme rinse or mask though. I do like to change it up with an Aveda Peppermint shampoo though. They both do not bug our allergies either (nuts and soy).</li>
    <li> good products and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for colored hair, good price and huge savings.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOOOOOOOOVE this shampoo!  It is very gentle on my thinning hair.  I also love that it does not strip the Natural (vegitable based/herbal) hair color I use.  In addition it smells great!  All around a great shampoo. I recommend the conditioner that is the same brand but comes in a \\&quot;Yellow\\&quot; container instead of the Pink like this shampoo. Sorry not in my shower right now and cannot remember the exact type.  It&#x27;s for hair that is damaged.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Does not leave a waxy buildup on your hair leaving it feel soft.  Highly recommend this product for those who have thick hair.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it does!</li>
    <li> This professional shampoo leaves hair smelling great  and super soft!  Just a quarter size will suffice to feel a difference. No conditioner necessary.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was wonderful for my dry hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and makes my hair shining and not frizzy! Love the smell also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, for blonde bleached highlights nothing else even compares. It keeps my hair silky, shiny and nourished. The only product that moisturizes without weighting my hair down. Detangles and makes my hair easy to comb after washing. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I typically buy all my shampoo products from my hair dresser, but was happy to find this on Amazon.  This is great product for anyone who has had color treatement and brazilian blow out or straightener...  Only thing that would make it better is a push pump, as this is large bottle and a bit cumbersome in shower.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.  I&#x27;ll never switch - these products are absoultely the best money can buy.</li>
    <li> Real deal! Came in sealed in the original packaging in brand spanking new conditions!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years. This is the first time I have bought it on line instead of at the salon. What a great savings.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Barb McClain</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Used for years</li>
    <li> wonderful product....would recommend</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in tact.</li>
