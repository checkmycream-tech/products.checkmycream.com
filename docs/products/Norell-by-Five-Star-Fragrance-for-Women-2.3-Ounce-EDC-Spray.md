    <li> Okay, so in fairness, I don&#x27;t like this perfume at all.  BUT it&#x27;s a scent my Grandmother has worn for longer than I&#x27;ve been alive and she LOVES it.  This was for her, and she couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Now if only she&#x27;d put a little less on each time, we&#x27;d both be happy!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, so I was excited to find it and I received it in record time.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I first wore Norell in my 20&#x27;s &amp; 30&#x27;s. As it became impossible to find in retail stores, I drifted to others, but was never really happy with any of them. When I asked my husband, he said he liked what I wore when we were dating (some 20 years earlier), so I began searching for Norell &amp; was very happy to find it online &amp; ordered right away. He was, too. It brought back memories of our early life &amp; love. Lou has passed now, I&#x27;m nearly 65, but I continue to love Norell &amp; wear it &amp; still get frequent compliments &amp; questions as to what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> love norell.  have used it for years, &amp; people are always asking me what scent I&#x27;m wearing.  it&#x27;s just getting harder &amp; harder to find.</li>

    <li> sometimes I order my fragrance and it seems like it is a bootleg version.  This is the real deal and the order was&lt;br /&gt;shipped to me quickly.  I will order from them again in the future.</li>
    <li> Ive been buying this product for years,its my mothers favorite,(since around 1980).I hate it cost me double just to buy threw the computer,than when I used to get it at walgreens,that put a hurting on my christmas but for my favorite person I still done it.</li>
    <li> This is my signature fragrance and lately it&#x27;s been out of stock. It&#x27;s a delicious fresh fragrance with a hint of spice. Please bring it back soon at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Formula has changed, it&#x27;s not as good as it used to be.</li>
