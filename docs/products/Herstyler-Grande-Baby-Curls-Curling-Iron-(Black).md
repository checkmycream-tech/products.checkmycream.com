      <li>The product was exactly as pictured and works great.</li>

      <li>Has anyone been able to find a Herstyler glove?</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>i love this curling iron....</li>
      <li>One of my happiest purchases on Amazon. :)</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>you know im an expert at it&#x3D;).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve battled with straight hair all my life and the convenience to have curly hair in a matter of minutes is FANTASTIC!!!</li>
      <li>Such a good value!</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this curler is, hands down, the BEST one I have come across.</li>
      <li>it gets very hot!</li>
      <li>It only took about 20 minutes to do my whole head and it looks beautiful!!!  </li>
      <li>It does not get to no 400 degrees &amp; doesn&#x27;t stay hot!!</li>
      <li>The HerStyler is great if you just want a loose curl or wavy look.</li>
      <li>The material was very cheap nothing compared to the real thing.</li>
      <li>Received fast and the price was outstanding.</li>
      <li>It is a real steal on Amazon for a wand that does such a great job.  </li>
      <li>but you learn quick</li>
      <li>With this one however, it took a significantly shorter time, of about 15 minutes, to create nice waves since I didn&#x27;t have to use tiny sections of hair.</li>
      <li>Although I will say, the thermal glove is nicer on this model and of better quality than my new Remington iron.</li>
      <li>Amazing and the product is terrific.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for something that will curl my hair, AND have it hold, for 10 years without success.  </li>
      <li>do have long and thick hair and this one is just perfect for it :)</li>
      <li>it just does&#x27;t grip, the hair falls right off when trying to curl around.</li>
      <li>but you get really pretty hair.</li>
      <li>At first i wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this curler because it does not work like a regular curling iron</li>
      <li>and I have to use very minimum styling product too!</li>
      <li>I was expecting a more traditional curling iron.  </li>
      <li>Fast communication and even faster shipping!</li>
      <li>My roommate has this hair curler and the first time I used it, I knew I had to get one for myself!!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
      <li>I think the ceramic was made too much like a non stick pan!</li>
      <li>omg this thing is love every time I do a hair style I want to use it I would definitely recommend</li>
      <li>I do find that I really like the look of it if I do a whole bunch of these tighter curls and then run my fingers through them  to give it a more natural look.  </li>
      <li>Only downside is that it gets very hot and so user dexterity is important.  </li>
      <li>This product was exactly as described and makes gorgeous, shiny, frizz-free curls that last all day (or more!).&lt;br /&gt;However, just a heads up that this isn&#x27;t the wand for you if you are looking for big, beachy, VS style waves/</li>
      <li>Dead Sea Beauty is an AMAZING seller.</li>
      <li>it heats up fast, and it comes with a glove so you won&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
      <li>Lightening fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and company!</li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I (and all my friends who have borrowed it) really like this product.  </li>
      <li>The clampless design and ceramic barrel gives me frizz free curls that actually LAST</li>
      <li>For a long time, I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect tool for my long straight hair, which comes down my mid-back.</li>
      <li>If you want REALLY big curls this is not for you, its for just a wavy curly effect to your hair not big Shirley temple curls, But this product really curls your hair and it also does not damage your natural hair or any kind of hair extensions no matter the brand or texture.</li>
      <li>i received the herstyler classic forever straightner.</li>
      <li>That was it gives it just a little break to cool back to a more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>it looks very flowy and natural!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-The temperature gets HOT, REAL HOT (Definitely for people are used to curling their hair/experienced, otherwise pretend to curl your hair when it&#x27;s unplugged just to get a grip and feel of how to use the wand.)&lt;br /&gt;-The curls last ALL day!</li>
      <li>, know that because this wand does not have a temperature control it can get VERY VERY hot if you leave it on too long.  </li>
      <li>Wow, this item came in just 2 days after I ordered it!</li>
      <li>My only concern is if you hold the handle to close to the curling part of it you can burn yourself because it gets really really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have SUPER straight, thick hair</li>
      <li>The iron heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t need to set long on your hair.</li>
      <li>Went through the whole process, got messages that the items left their store, left some town in the US, and were on their way to me.</li>
      <li>I have very thick long hair and my hair would never keep any kind of curl.</li>
      <li>This is for someone who has long hair and wants ringlets- definitely not my style.  </li>
      <li>I sent it back and got a less expensive brand, Remington CI95AC/2 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Wand which works great</li>

    <li> Easy to use and i love it. My friend payed $120 for it at a shop, so im happy with this product at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I do have long and thick hair and this one is just perfect for it :)</li>
    <li> I would definently buy from this company again! The product was exactly as pictured and works great. I ordered on a Tuesday, and it was waiting on my doorstep when I got home on Friday. I highly recommend this product and company!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! I only give it four stars because the heat protection glove was WAY too big for my hands (I&#x27;m 20, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m a little kid complaining about an adult glove being too big). Also, if you grip too close to the barrel, the plastic is like crazy hot, so you have to be really careful to not burn yourself.    As for the actual curling, I give it 5 stars. I have SUPER straight, thick hair and it&#x27;s almost impossible to curl, much less have the curl hold. With this curler, it stays curly into the 3rd day (which is about the longest I can handle without washing my hair anyway)!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is AWESOME. My hair is Asian/Medium-Thick that can&#x27;t hold a curl to save it&#x27;s life no matter what iron or styling products I use. Curling my hair used to be a long, tedious process but this product makes it easier and faster. The clampless design and ceramic barrel gives me frizz free curls that actually LAST and I have to use very minimum styling product too! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this!     (The description doesn&#x27;t specifically say, but the Grande Baby Curls is the 18-25mm barrel).    Dead Sea Beauty is an AMAZING seller. Fast communication and even faster shipping! Thank you!</li>
    <li> omg this thing is love every time I do a hair style I want to use it I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the wonderful reviews.  I was expecting a more traditional curling iron.  This is for someone who has long hair and wants ringlets- definitely not my style.  I am passing it on to my daughter who does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled with straight hair all my life and the convenience to have curly hair in a matter of minutes is FANTASTIC!!! I LOVE this product!!</li>
    <li> The HerStyler is great if you just want a loose curl or wavy look. It comes with a glove to protect from burning yourself, which i have many times. That is the only setback it&#x27;s kinda dangerous so be careful when using it. but you get really pretty hair. I&#x27;ve gotten soo many compliments after using!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is so thick and hard to curl. And the curl won&#x27;t stay-but with this herstyler the curls stay for a long time. My daughter loves this curling iron.</li>
    <li> Even though the photo of the product shows a glove- it doesn&#x27;t bring it. Has that been a problem for any of the users? The glove that is sold by Amazon separately has bad reviews. Has anyone been able to find a Herstyler glove?</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and needed this type of curling iron for childrens theater backstage, and did not want to buy a really expensive model. This curling iron looks great and heats up well, but it just does&#x27;t grip, the hair falls right off when trying to curl around. I think the ceramic was made too much like a non stick pan! I sent it back and got a less expensive brand, Remington CI95AC/2 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Digital Ceramic Curling Wand which works great so I purchased 3 more!   Although I will say, the thermal glove is nicer on this model and of better quality than my new Remington iron.</li>
    <li> i love this curling iron.... it heats up fast, and it comes with a glove so you won&#x27;t burn yourself. It curls your hair fast, and i have thick long hair so i love that it dose it faster. It takes time to get use to it but its a great product. The price is great, make a great product affordable!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this 2 years ago and I love it. I have very thick long hair and my hair would never keep any kind of curl. For me to get a very tight curl/ringlet I have to take very small sections of hair and for me that takes an hour and fourty five minutes (which I dont do very often). If I just want to have big waves then I do bigger sections (which takes about 40 minutes) and then I brush it out and the end result looks like Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s hair from the garnier commercials. Needless to say I absolutely love this and I paid 200 for it!!</li>
    <li> My roommate has this hair curler and the first time I used it, I knew I had to get one for myself!!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The curler heats up FAST.&lt;br /&gt;-The temperature gets HOT, REAL HOT (Definitely for people are used to curling their hair/experienced, otherwise pretend to curl your hair when it&#x27;s unplugged just to get a grip and feel of how to use the wand.)&lt;br /&gt;-The curls last ALL day! (Depending on the occasion, I don&#x27;t even use hairspray!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- There is no light indicating when it&#x27;s on or off, so be very careful about that and pay attention to the on/off switch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this curler is, hands down, the BEST one I have come across. The sale price is almost too good to be true&lt;br /&gt;Amazon said it would arrive in 6-10 days. I received the item in 3 days!! That was an added bonus!</li>
    <li> This is horrible. The material was very cheap nothing compared to the real thing. It also took a long time to get to me. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY thick hair that goes half way down my back.  I have been looking for something that will curl my hair, AND have it hold, for 10 years without success.  This is awesome!!  It only took about 20 minutes to do my whole head and it looks beautiful!!!  It doesn&#x27;t look kinky at all...it looks very flowy and natural!  I would pay the full price for this if I had too!!</li>
    <li> Also got the hair straightener.  I have a GHD so why would I want another straightener.  Now I hope I can get my money back !!</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed with the service. Went through the whole process, got messages that the items left their store, left some town in the US, and were on their way to me. After 4 weeks, got another message saying sorry they could not deliver to where I am. Then why waste my time with false impressions, I could have gone elsewhere to get these. Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> It does not get to no 400 degrees &amp; doesn&#x27;t stay hot!! Not worth the money would not recommend anyone to buy!!</li>
    <li> For a long time, I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect tool for my long straight hair, which comes down my mid-back. I&#x27;ve always wanted waves, so I&#x27;ve used different methods such as curling irons, velcro and foam rollers, and even invented ways of waving my hair. Of course, the results were never really consistent. With this one however, it took a significantly shorter time, of about 15 minutes, to create nice waves since I didn&#x27;t have to use tiny sections of hair. I could take a good amount, wrap it around, and my hair still looks great! For the price, this product is awesome!! It even came with a glove, which I did not expect. Lightening fast shipping. It literally seemed to have taken 1 day! One of my happiest purchases on Amazon. :)</li>
    <li> Works great, I wanted something that would curl my hair but not make me look like I have gigantic curls in my hair. If you want REALLY big curls this is not for you, its for just a wavy curly effect to your hair not big Shirley temple curls, But this product really curls your hair and it also does not damage your natural hair or any kind of hair extensions no matter the brand or texture. Great buy!!!!</li>
    <li> This item is great! I paid $40.00 and it came with the glove so you dont have to buy it separately. The mall has this curling iron and they charge $150! Which is just ridiculous. Every time i curl my hair i get compliments. At first i wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this curler because it does not work like a regular curling iron so i jumped on youtube for a tutorial and next thing you know im an expert at it&#x3D;). So if you want those beautiful curls buy this product&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> Wow, this item came in just 2 days after I ordered it! Amazing and the product is terrific. Thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> i ordered this item expecting to receive the herstyler grande curler but insted i received the herstyler classic forever straightner. by the other reviews i imagine that this was just a mistake made by the company but now i dont have a curler.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is amazing. The only curling iron that will hold curls in my hair. The curls stay in all day! The iron heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t need to set long on your hair. Great product for a GREAT price! My friend got the same one when she was in Hawaii and paid $160 for it....</li>
    <li> Great item which works great on me and my sisters hair types varying from fine to thicker/course. Only downside is that it gets very hot and so user dexterity is important.  Burns hurt but you learn quick</li>
    <li> This is the same product they sell at the mall for $200. I have two teenage girls and we all LOVE it! Makes perfect curls every time! Such a good value!</li>
    <li> Im so In love with these they work great. So happy they come with a glove. They work fast and great.</li>
    <li> I had looked at a bunch of different wands online trying to find the best deal and best product.  I definitely liked the Herstylers and knew they made some very good products.  This product was exactly as described and makes gorgeous, shiny, frizz-free curls that last all day (or more!).&lt;br /&gt;However, just a heads up that this isn&#x27;t the wand for you if you are looking for big, beachy, VS style waves/curls - it makes smaller tighter curls.  I do find that I really like the look of it if I do a whole bunch of these tighter curls and then run my fingers through them  to give it a more natural look.  That way I don&#x27;t look like Shirley Temple but I still have voluminous bouncy hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;Also, know that because this wand does not have a temperature control it can get VERY VERY hot if you leave it on too long.  Even a split second of accidentally bumping your hand and you will end up with a blister.  I found that if I am taking my time curling my hair or have to leave it on for a while just flip it off for 30 seconds or so and switch it back on.  That was it gives it just a little break to cool back to a more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; temp.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I (and all my friends who have borrowed it) really like this product.  It is a real steal on Amazon for a wand that does such a great job.  Just make sure you know what you want your final product to look like and realize that you have to take into consideration the diameter of the wand.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this for a long time. It works great on any length hair. Received fast and the price was outstanding.</li>
    <li> This curling iron from Herstyler is the best product available for curls.  Warning:  use the glove included-it gets very hot!</li>
    <li> I got this curling wand in today, and I absolutely love this product! It create the perfect curls I was trying to create. I was suprised by this product because I have thin, long hair that normally won&#x27;t hold a curl, but this actually held for a long time. My only concern is if you hold the handle to close to the curling part of it you can burn yourself because it gets really really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Yes, Iwould recommend this to a friend.</li>
