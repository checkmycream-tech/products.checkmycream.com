<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am using this since last 2 years..but now I like this only..</li>
    <li> decent liner if looking for waterproof.</li>
    <li> I chose four stars for this product only because it smudges. As far as I can tell the product resists water, but comes off easy with a hand towel and water. I love this product in general because of the smooth application. I really do not like pencil on makeup because you have to bear down, so this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> Ok liner, but to say water or smudge proof is pretty deceptive. It really is not even resistant, at least for me. Very smudgey as it goes on and even an hour later I can run my finger over it and get a nice line on my finger. I like that I don&#x27;t need to sharpen it but other than that it&#x27;s no different than any other eye liner. I still need something I can wear on vacation with a snorkel mask so I will keep looking. This was available at my local Fred Meyers store.</li>
    <li> This is okay, but not great. It stays on about 4-5 hours by itself (I normally line a liquid black liner over it). My big issue with it is that the entire pencil falls out of the holder constantly! It happened the first time and I returned it to the store and got another one only to find the 2nd one does the same. There are better products out there.</li>
    <li> Smooth application and removal, but my eyelids tend to be on the oily side, so this is NOT a good eyeliner for me! Within 2 hours, it&#x27;s smudging off onto my brow bone, and by the end of the day it&#x27;s running all over and stinging the corners of my eye. This effect probably depends on eye and brow bone shape, tho, so it may work better for people without oily lids.</li>
    <li> good product...stays on....god delivery, too....fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product so I was very happy to find it on here. I was a great nervous buying it but it was exactly the same as when I buy it in store and even CHEAPER!! :) I am so happy and subscribe and save even more!</li>
    <li> It stays on pretty good. I use it in hot humid weather so I really put it to the test... Now to find a waterproof mascara that doesn&#x27;t just disappear under those conditions!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing Maybelline eyeliner for years now and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t wipe off easily or irritate my eyes. I have tried other, but a lot bother my contacts and this is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that hasn&#x27;t. I apply it once or twice a day it usually last unless I forget and start rubbing my eyes :) Onyx is the only color I purchase.</li>
    <li> After three uses the tip crumbled and was no longer usable. At least it has a twist function to push up new product. It was like applying a crayon to my eyelid. Once you got it on it looked good before it smudged and stayed on, even after using makeup remover. It seemed more like a Crayola Twistable than eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite eyeliner, but it has a major flaw.  After very few uses, the stick will break, causing the eyeliner to fall out of the tube if it&#x27;s tilted when I open it.  This is the 3rd time it has happened with this brand.  I kept giving them more chances, but this is the 3rd strike. As much as I love the ease of application and it&#x27;s darkness; it&#x27;s time to find a new brand.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this eyeliner has the ability to retract and there&#x27;s no need to sharpen.  It&#x27;s not the best pencil eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s not the worst.  It isn&#x27;t waterproof and it isn&#x27;t smudge-proof as others have pointed out. It&#x27;s pretty deceiving that it would be advertised in that way.  Actually, it is waterproof enough that it takes a lot of time to wash it off, but not waterproof enough not to come off on your fingers if you accidentally touch it.   As a whole, I do use this eyeliner often. It seems pretty run-of-the-mill--nothing really special about it.  I actually somewhat like the fact that it does smudge because it can make a nice smoky eye effect easily.    Onyx is a nice, basic black color.  I&#x27;ve had no major problems with it over the last month and a half I&#x27;ve had it, but it&#x27;s not something I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite eyeliner.</li>
    <li> All together an okay liner. Just a little upset the tip of the liner broke off while I was doing my makeup!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what I want, thank u, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner.  Goes on smooth and lasts all day.  Color is as expected.  Must have in my cosmetics bag.</li>
    <li> I loved this eyeliner the first time I bought it. However the second time around for some reason I did not like it as much. I noticed smudging after  several hours and it did not seem go on as smoothly as it did before. Maybe it has something to do with the different environment I am in or the weather (interestingly I loved this eyeliner in the summer and now not so much in the winter).</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, stays on until you take it off.</li>
    <li> Only eyeliner I have trusted for the last 15 years. Never fails.</li>
    <li> very hard to find around here and have to use enter net i love it and i can get them ship very fast just love it</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! It was always hard to find an eyeliner that would stay on and wouldn&#x27;t start to come down under my eyes throughout the day. Since I have been using this, it stays put, and goes on very nicely as well.</li>
    <li> Surprised with how well it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it since 5 years and I love it.  It stays a ling time and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Love it and recommended it to all my family female members.</li>
    <li> this stuff stays put longer than  lots of other kinds I have used.  It is less smeary in hot weather . my favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this eyeliner for years and it works the best for the top of my eyelid. I use a primer first because I do have oily skin and then apply a translucent powder on top, and it stays all day. I use a regular waterproof make up remover or baby oil to get it off and it comes off just fine.</li>
    <li> Its not the best eyeliner I had, but great for the price</li>
    <li> This is good eyeliner, but not great. It doesn&#x27;t stay where you put it and smudges all around the eyes. I only recommend if you don&#x27;t mind touching up the smudges every couple hours.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! For a stellar cat&#x27;s eye, I start with Maybelline&#x27;s Line Stylist eyeliner, which I use for drawing the more precise, thinner lines, then I fill in the space below to my lash line with this chunkier pal. It lasts and lasts and over a just thin layer of shadow, doesn&#x27;t smudge. As long as Maybelline keeps making it, this and the Line Stylist will be my liners of choice!</li>
    <li> I use this eyeliner... not to be confused with Maybelline&#x27;s other liner called &amp;#34;define-a-line&amp;#34;... that one is awful! The point always breaks. I&#x27;ve tried expensive liners before, but this is my tried and true. I use expensive foundation, concealer, and lip products, but Maybelline is the best for eye products... I even still use the original pink and green Great Lash mascara.</li>
    <li> Good daily eyeliner, cheapest on Amazon. Does not smudge much. It does need to be reapplied from day to night.</li>
    <li> Love this product...use it every day!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on smooth, and even when it&#x27;s down to the very end it never dries out. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of eyeliners, (pencils, liquid, etc) and this one is my favorite. Use it everyday, and it looks amazing.</li>
    <li> Works great!  stays on all day , love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, my wife likes and uses it.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner came broken in many pieces that consistently fell out whenever I opened it. I was really disappointed with the quality.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on like a dream and stays on for hours. I tried a ton of eyeliners throughout high school, but when I found this one I stuck to it. It&#x27;s been six years and it&#x27;s still the only thing in my makeup box I re-buy consistently. Only drawback is that it&#x27;s REALLY hard to get off, especially from your waterline, but I wear it almost every day so I&#x27;m not worried about a little residue.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and great for smudging to get that smokey eye look. Really does last all day. I like that it&#x27;s self sharpening/retractable so I don&#x27;t have to deal with a sharpener and shavings.</li>
    <li> Application could be smoother,</li>
    <li> How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;- Daily for the upper and lower eye lids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Twisting makes it convenient so you don&#x27;t need to sharpen it&lt;br /&gt;- Applies smoothly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The liner stick was broken when I received it so if I hold it upside down, the entire thing falls out.&lt;br /&gt;- Smears easily&lt;br /&gt;- Color fades fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;- Revlon ColorStay or something else entirely</li>
    <li> Was delivered with the eyeliner stick all the way scrolled out. So When I opened it, an inch of it just broke off. I will be returning.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t smear! It is waterproof too. It is easy to apply...it has a nice fine tip. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t stay put at all. Within an hour or so of applying it, I had huge circles under my eyes because the eyeliner smudged so badly. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all. I&#x27;ll stick with my gel eyeliner, which lasts all day and night without going anywhere, or fading.</li>
    <li> Better price than I can get in the store.  How can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> Love this product. Took a while to get used to it. Have to apply a couple of times to get it right, I can&#x27;t do it in one stroke. But this way you can regulate how thick you want it. Easily removable too.</li>
    <li> No smearing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives me dramatic looking eyes.  I swear my eyes pop!  One only needs a little mascara after applying Unstoppable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyeliner for years, it&#x27;s great.  I love being able to order it off of amazon for a great price and get fast shipping, no more trips to the store</li>
    <li> The only eyeliner I use (besides some liquid liner on top for an even more dramatic look). This liner goes on smooth and easy. I love that you can twist it and you don&#x27;t have to sharpen anything. A must have!</li>
    <li> I have the onyx color and it stays put all day. Glided on easily and is both smudge and waterproof. I love this eyeliner!</li>
    <li> I wear my liner on the inside of my eye and I wear contacts. I mention contacts as I often use rewetting drops. The eyeliner glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t come off during rewetting. In fact, I have rubbed my eyes and had a minimal amount of liner come off.</li>
    <li> It is too brittle and hard to sharpen.</li>
    <li> This is THE WORST EYELINER EVER!!! I had major racoon eyes it was so embarassing.  And I am pretty pissed off because I paid 8.00 for 0.1 oz that is going in the trash.  I am writing to Maybelline and they better give me back my money!</li>
    <li> Goes on easy and great for a smoky look when you smuge into the upper eye area; a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this same eyeliner since I was a teenager, and I don&#x27;t wear much. Just a little line on my upper inner-lid. It&#x27;s easy to apply, and stays on for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This product used to be my regular \\&quot;go to\\&quot; liner during college. I suffer  from very oily skin, so it&#x27;s important that I use make up with real staying power. Of all the drugstore brand eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried, Maybelline&#x27;s Unstoppable Eyeliner is my undisputed favorite! The product is inexpensive and it&#x27;s so easy to apply, you could practically do it in your sleep. Even with oily skin, I found that this eyeliner would last at least 8 hours with bold color and no smudging. If you are on a budget, this product is your best bet. I also recommend purchasing from Amazon. Regular stores have trouble keeping this product in stock!</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the raccoon eyes I saw an hour after applying the liner.  And it&#x27;s Maybeline even.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  1 star is too high of a rating.</li>
    <li> The pencil snapped off after 2 uses, and it&#x27;s not like I turned it too much.  Now it&#x27;s not usable because every time I press down, the whole liner falls back into the tube.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because: bada bum! I wear it everyday! I am wearing it now!&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I thought when the &#x27;eye marker&#x27; came out I would have found the product of my dreams, as it has got to be the easiest way to put on eyeliner, amirite? Imarite. For those of you who have trouble putting this [or technically any eyeliner] on, a trick: pull you eyelid either straight out and away from you so as you can easily draw on a straight line, or out and up so as to draw a curvy cat eye. Play around with it. This glides on smooth, is a great color, and does what it does for the purpose it was made for. I cannot stand products that do so many things you forget why you purchased it in the first place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this who have trouble putting on eyeliner, those who do not wear eyeliner, beginner make-up gals, and those who love the liquid eye liner look, but always seem to fail [i fall into this group.... :( ] Speaking of which, if anyone has tips on the art of liquid eye liner, feel free to reply to this comment! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is the best I have found and believe me, I have tried them ALL!!  I only use it on my upper lash line and the trick to keeping it in place is just to make sure that your eye cream is not too greasy.  Onyx is the best black and you cannot beat the price.  This eyeliner and a tube of Great Lash mascara are the two best beauty values out there!</li>
    <li> If you compare me to the average female, I guess you could say I wear a good amount of eyeliner – always have since I was 12 (now I’m 29) – anyway – I’ve tried many different brands/types of eyeliner, even ranging in price up to $25 a stick sometimes. This eye liner is the best I’ve found, especially for the price! It doesn’t droop, slide down or smudge after a couple hours (eye liner wearers, you know what I mean…) – it stays in place pretty nicely, and it is a good defining black for any style effect, simple or dramatic. My only complaint is I don’t know if the twisty eyeliner inside is actually as long as the tube, but I wish a stick would last a bit longer, however that could just be my issue because I wear so much… I don’t know. Anyway - I highly recommend you give the “unstoppable” a try!</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner I use. It goes on smooth and lasts all day. It&#x27;s easy to apply whether you apply it thicker for a more dramatic look, or thin for a more natural look.  I usually use the onyx color as I prefer black, but I&#x27;ve used espresso as well which is a nice dark color as well. It&#x27;s also nice as you just twist the bottom to get more. No need to sharpen!</li>
    <li> Love the ease of using an eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t require sharpening. Applies smoothly and stays on all day. Be careful not to drop it too much as it&#x27;s painful to see broken pencil pieces get wasted. For the price, it beats a lot of pencil liners I get at the department store.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this brand and model exclusively. I have started ordering online because the Wal-Mart and CVS near home are always sold out. I got her this off the internet and had it waiting for her when she got home from her trip. She was super happy and loves this product.</li>
    <li> It took awhile to get here, though this could&#x27;ve had something to do with hurricane sandy :S. Anyways it smudges pretty eaisly and by the end of the day I have raccoon eyes. DON&#x27;T SCROLL IT ALL THE WAY UP! Mine broke several times :(. The color is pretty opaque and application is easy (don&#x27;t expect a thin line though)..</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is amazing for quick, on-the-go application. It has saved my face SO many times when I&#x27;m running late and just need a quick fix-up. It goes on smooth, and you&#x27;ll never poke yourself in the eye to the affect of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is that it stays rather soft once on, so it rubs off and diffused sometimes, particularly on oily skin or in humid weather. All-in-all a great  purchase, though!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last that long, I have always had semi watery eyes and this eyeliner didn&#x27;t work well with me it smudges very easily and it flakes up. Hard to wash off when it gives you &amp;#34;raccoon eyes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I get this eyeliner all the time b/c you don&#x27;t have to sharpen it and it&#x27;s easy to put on. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it doesn&#x27;t last all day and wears off easily and fast.</li>
    <li> My new favorite.  Stays put, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t drag.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product it did take a little long to get here though.  This is the only eyeliner I ever buy because it&#x27;s the only one that goes on my eye. I&#x27;ve tried many eyeliners and none have worked except for this one. It stays on for awhile (2-4) hours but it starts to fade and smudge. You would think if it says waterproof in big letters that would it would be waterproof but no not really. You have to keep applying it throughout the day to keep it looking good. But once it&#x27;s on you&#x27;re good for a few hours. Great product but could be better.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, but I have a hard time &amp;#34;coloring between the lines&amp;#34; (wrinkles! haha!!) I Love it anyway. :O)</li>
    <li> This is a nice consistency - not too soft, not too hard. Able to put it on smoothly and accurately. Great value.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner does not give me raccoon eyes, and that is reason alone to hail this Maybelline eyeliner! Hooray!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner I have found in the past 4 years. This is the one that has lasted the longest with me. I have terrible allergies and thus had never bothered me. Comes off easy with a makeup remover and cotton pad.</li>
    <li> BEST EYE LINER EVER!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. It&#x27;s dark and gives you a bold look.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;It easily stays on all day with out reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;I even work a physical job where I am pouring sweat and wiping my eyes every now and then yet at the end of my shift the liner still looks perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, This eyeliner isn&#x27;t that pricey which make it even better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried sooo many kinds of eye liner and this one is the best, It&#x27;s smooth and blends easily and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;It also removes nicely using baby/olive oil or a baby wipe!</li>
    <li> All my other makeup products are MAC, but this eyeliner beats even the MAC equivalent.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and tried switching to MAC once but it just wasn&#x27;t the same.  This eyeliner  glides on very smooth and stays put all day.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge unless you really really rub it.  It&#x27;s easily removed with makeup remover or even plain soap and water (wouldn&#x27;t recommend that for the eyes though).  The best part is you don&#x27;t need a sharpener - you just twist and the pencil comes up from the bottom.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am asian and have an eyeliner smudging problem.  This is the only eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge.  I can cry and laugh and go all day and won&#x27;t smudge.  Also it helps if you put power on your lids before using</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job, and its definitely waterproof.Used for my wedding day and it stayed on all day! Even through the tears!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner really stays on. Other eyeliners smudge off by the end of the day but not this one.  I was impressed.</li>
    <li> Works well for a great price.</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner that stays on for the whole day and is easy to take off at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onyx is the color you need to select for Black.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from the drugstore a couple of days ago.  It works great for me - better than any I have tried, as most eyeliners smudge off very quickly on my lids.  I was tired and went to bed with my eye makeup on last night (don&#x27;t usually do this) and the liner was still looking okay this morning.  I purchased the brown which is a bit too light for me.  Next time I will get black or slate colored.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye liner for years. It&#x27;s great! Stays on through day 2. Highly recommended. Can sometimes crack a little, as all eye liners do.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. I keep buying it and I keep loving it. I love that there is nothing to sharpen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands of eyeliner. This is the first one that I have absolutely fell in love with. It goes on creamy so I&#x27;m not constantly trying to go over where I&#x27;m wanting to put it so it is a dark line. One or two swipes and it is a bold line. I never want to switch from this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner for the price</li>
    <li> This pencil broke every single time I used it!  Worst quality ever.  And it is not self-sharpening either</li>
    <li> Color is good, but it smears too easily. I also seem to be allergic, which is new. I&#x27;ve never had an allergy to makeup before.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. This is second one I&#x27;ve purchased...one from Amazon another at the store and both were broken at the very bottom. Doesn&#x27;t effect the product, just annoys me that it slides around in the container and can fall out sometimes.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner out there.  Been using it for years.  Does not tug and glides on smoothly.  No running.  Have tried drug stores  and department brands eyeliner.  This one is by far the best I&#x27;ve used!!!!</li>
    <li> Intense dark, smooth line. It is waterproof, but washes off easily with soap and water or face cream. I&#x27;ve tried several eyeliners, and this is the best for me.</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to apply, does not smear easily and stays put.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Claimed to be smudge proof &amp; waterproof.  In less than two hours I looked like I had racoon eyes. I learned my lesson in trying a new product I will stick with my usual tried and true  brand. This is headed for the trash bin.  It was also hard to remove once it had smudged.</li>
    <li> I did not find that this eyeliner was different than any other eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.Good product and goes on easy. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is what it said it is in every way. It&#x27;s the best I have found for the money.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to post on this, as in general, I LOVE the product.  HOWEVER - I would highly recommend NOT getting it delivered.  I had the exact same liner that lasted me a good year (I don&#x27;t use much).  I had this one delivered, and it is broken inside.  I have had chunks of it fall out, or slide in and out of the holder. I am so terribly disappointed in this.  I won&#x27;t ever have it delivered again - I can only assume that it was broken in shipment and must have gotten tossed around pretty badly.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with everything.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner was great. It went on smooth, and no smudging. I just wish I could figure out how to get it to twist so the liner would come up more. I tried to twist it up but the liner stick broke.</li>
