<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Husband loves this soap. Especially the smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews on this product and it seems that there is no middle ground, either people love it or hate it. I guess I now fall into the former camp. I have never used a shave stick before, only creams and soap pucks. I gotta say, using this and face lathering is pretty nice, and this stuff does in fact lather insanely well and easily! Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, and I can see why, however, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is supposed to be legendary. I didn&#x27;t care much for the fragrance, but it lathers and performs okay. Try 1 before considering a bulk purchase.</li>
    <li> I join the chorus in complaining about the smell when first opening this soap(Taco Bell cheap tortilla?). It does dissipate in a few weeks. This cylinder gives more foam than any of the three other soaps I use, it&#x27;s magnificent actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note on how to apply, I tried lobbing off a slither and frothing it up with a badger and it worked well enough. But, the best way to apply this soap is to rub the stick directly on your face then with a wet brush work it. It gives more lather and cuts out the manifold inefficient steps of slicing and working it in a cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shave cups sold here are absurdly priced ($15 for a plastic cup?). A big coffee cup can be had from IKEA for 3-4 bucks. Or, save your money and just use this stick sans cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star deducted for my first world problem of the initial third world smell. Hey, I&#x27;m paying with first world $.</li>
    <li> Looks like sidewalk chalk, in a paper/foil tube you peel off as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to use, rub it on your just-washed wet face and use a shaving brush to whip it into a lather.&lt;br /&gt;Works without a brush, but much better with one.  I was not offended by the smell, just smells like soap.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a good shave, not expensive. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best shaving sticks for the dollar. I bought mine several months ago and am just now opening the next one. The smell is pleasant, if bland, and it makes a very rich, thick lather when used with a brush. This product is not vegan, however, and anyone concerned about the inclusion of animal products should be warned that it is made with animal tallow. For a travel soap or an every day soap you can&#x27;t really beat this stuff, especially at the price.</li>
    <li> Better than most bar soap for a shave, but not great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used LaToja which admittedly has a nice scent, but it&#x27;s not as good as Arko in action. The goal is getting a great shave and you&#x27;re going to use an after shave or cologne later anyway, right? Canned goo like Barbasol is nothing but bubbles of air. Take a chance and try this. Use it like I do; you don&#x27;t even need a brush or bowl. I wipe the stick directly on face and head (I shave my head), wet my hands, lather it up well (the longer time it takes the better) and shave. You will be amazed at how well this soap lubricates and cushions. The scent is like Ivory soap, which will bring back memories of being a kid. Even though I shave head and face, one stick lasts me about a month.</li>
    <li> Its a great shaving soap stick.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re used to canned foam and found it satisfactory then don&#x27;t bother with Arko.  You actually need to swirl up a lather with your shaving brush, but when you do you&#x27;ll be delighted by the density, creaminess and soothing nature of warm lather prepping your face for blade attack.  Some people think the smell is off-putting but I liken it to the difference between Ivory and Irish Spring - a clean fragrance without cologne note.  The delivery method (wet the bar and wipe-on not suggested) recommended is to mold the pliant bar into your shave mug and by use of hot water-soaked boar-brush, whip up a shave mousse and apply to pre-wetted skin.  Occasional re-moisten is helpful.  I have tried dozens of cake and bar shave soaps but will never switch again.  Arko is the bomb.</li>
    <li> Bough this for my first DE shave it it works great! It formed a nice lather though it has little to no smell.</li>
    <li> The Arko shaving stick really lathers great best that I have ever used this is going to be my favorite soap will be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot beat this for the price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last couple of months and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers great, smells wonderful and I look forward to using it every day!</li>
    <li> Was really hoping to like this product, but for me it didn&#x27;t do much: the lather was thin and didn&#x27;t seem to lubricate or protect my face much during shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the smell completely offensive, as some reviewers here have, but let&#x27;s be honest -- it is more than a little institutional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, mid-shave I switched over to Proraso Green and Taylor of Old Bond Street creams, and the difference was striking: much thicker lather and a smoother shave. (All were applied with a Semogue 830 brush.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many wonderfully-scented, unctuously-silky shave creams and soaps out there for just a few dollars more, it seems that trying to save a couple bucks by buying Arko might be a false economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the groovy retro logo on the wrapper, though!</li>
    <li> Lathers up great, provides OK lubrication and blade cushion.  Only drawback for me is with my water it leaves a scum ring in the sink and build up on my razor.  In the end I went back to my cheap shave puck.</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant smell, and my husband has been very happy with it as an alternative to his usual canned shave cream. I ended up purchasing a push-up plastic tube to store it in, so it is easy to handle and travel with.</li>
    <li> Great shave soap! For any price this is a great product but the fact that it&#x27;s one of the cheaper soaps is a bonus. Lathers up very well, great protection and lasts a long time. I pushed mine into a bowl and its lasting forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several other kinds of shaving soap and finally decided to give this a try. People seem a bit divided on it - particularly when it comes to the scent. Overall, this reminds me of a bar of Ivory soap. It&#x27;s a clean-smelling scent, not really perfumy. I can&#x27;t stand things that have a heavy perfume smell, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how small the soap stick was. I don&#x27;t know why, but I thought it would be bigger. I opened it up and cut it in half with a pair of scissors, put one half in a zipper sandwich bag and mashed the other half down into my shaving mug. That was in June, and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve made a dent in it. I generally shave 6 days a week. I&#x27;m very pleased with how long this stuff lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is nice, and it lathers easily. And it comes off very clean - no residue. It&#x27;s so clean, in fact, that I sometimes have to grab my brush and reapply to be sure my razor doesn&#x27;t hang on parts of my face where I&#x27;ve already made a pass (other soaps I&#x27;ve used have left enough residue behind that a second pass wasn&#x27;t a problem). But I don&#x27;t consider this a dealbreaker, and like that it rinses off cleanly - I think that&#x27;s better for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely impressed. I think this is a great value ... and now I have a dilemma: I hate to go back to some of the other soaps I have in the cabinet to use them up, but I don&#x27;t want to throw them out and waste them, either. Guess I&#x27;ll keep them as spares for a while.</li>
    <li> This soap is one that I lather on my face rather than in a mug.  Arko provides a thick, long lasting lather.  The protection from razor burn and nicks is excellent.  The smell is pleasant in my opinion, some have described it as Citronella.  In comparison to other inexpensive shave soaps on the market that I have tried, this is clearly superior to Williams and better than Colonel Conk and Van Der Hagen as well.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> For four dollars and fifty cents this was an OK purchase.  ONE stick of shaving soap, that lathers somewhat better than Williams brand shaving soap, shipped from Turkey for under $5 what is not to like?</li>
    <li> I got the first stick of this soap free with an order of blades a couple years ago. I&#x27;m on my third stick now and have no intention of using anything else. It smells good, lathers well, and lasts forever. I wet my face, rub it on and then lather with a moist brush. I&#x27;ve tried several soaps and creams with varying results, and keep coming back to this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several soaps and creams, and this stuff is without a doubt the slickest soap ive ever used. unorthodox smell(compared to today&#x27;s scents, though its not strong), but this gives you tons of lather and great protection. if face lathering isnt your thing, it&#x27;s soft and will easily mold into a mug or whatever you choose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short. Great price, great lather, great smell, and molds easily into a shave bowl. Truly, a fine product.</li>
    <li> Sure there may be a few better shaving soaps than Arko but out there but this is pretty darn good!  I have never had a bad shave using this soap and it will last you a very long time.  Some people criticize the smell but I don&#x27;t get it???  I understand that it may not smell as nice as English or higher end shave soaps but the light lemon scent on this one is just fine.  This shave soap has a great slick, thick lather.  Every wet shaver should try this inexpensive soap and will enjoy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times and am really impressed as how well it works. I wet my face, rub the stick on my face and then use a brush to lather up. You get a surprising amount of lather that does a very good job of giving you a close shave. The only thing that some people might object to is the scent, which is a strong fake-lemonade smell, like lemon Pez. It is strong enough that I&#x27;ve noticed it when I walk into the bathroom but I personally like it.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t rehash the positives from everyone else I just wanted to add that this product stays slippery even after you&#x27;ve ran the blade over it and there is no visible foam. that is a great plus for a blade buffer like me</li>
    <li> This soap is really inexpensive, but I was expecting a thicker lather. I can whip a good amount of it with my brush I just cannot get the thickness that I can get with other products. It&#x27;s good for a quick neck shave, but I have found when I am shaving my whole face but the time I get the the end there is more of a film of residue than a lather protecting my skin from the blade.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about.  the other one I got Proraso was twice as expensive has a strong eucalyptus scent.  I like them both</li>
    <li> I recently started shaving with a safety razor and picked this shaving soap because of it&#x27;s cheap price. Soap dries up very quickly so you have to move really fast- which is the exact opposite of what wet shaving is meant to be like. Also leaves my skin ridiculously dry after use. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but next time i&#x27;ll get a cream that moisturizes a bit more.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that I would never find a low cost, great smelling, good lathering shave soap. I had tried a few others and found they just didn&#x27;t work well for me. Arko smells great and with just a little extra effort I can make a great lather. Arko is now my primary shave soap.</li>
    <li> Arko is a must buy for anyone who desires the experience of shaving excellence. It lathers with little effort and provides a rich moisturizing barrier between the face and razor blade. The issue with its strong odor is something that I think gets overblown. I enjoy the fragrance that Arko provides.</li>
    <li> Ive used other soaps- the kind you mix on a bowl. Those are very hard to use and my wrist would hurt before I even got done. This however is much easier you just rub on your face and lather comes out quickly with a brush. Does not get my wrist tired. Some complain about the smell it just smelled like plain soap to me you eventually don&#x27;t even smell anything at all. This does not shave as comfortably as the Arko shave creams but it is so easy and convenient (and cheaper) to build the lather that I dont bother much with the creams.</li>
    <li> Wet shavers are a contentious bunch; after reading wildly divergent opinions on this infamous Turkish soap with curiously anachronistic packaging, I decided I had to try it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Arko daily for over a month with my usual set up of a Merkur 180 and Astra/Isareli Personna blades, and I feel experienced enough to call it AMAZING. Its tallow-base makes for a downright fearsome lather WITHOUT a brush, allowing an effortless glide along the cheeks and neck. This is the first shaving cream/soap that has not left irritation on my neck! Did I mention that its price is a fraction of most others?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko&#x27;s most controversial quality is its smell; shavers love or loathe it. I happen to enjoy it, my girlfriend always wants to smell my face when I use it, SCORE! Of course, tastes are always subjective. But at the very least give it a try. Regardless, Arko is now MY go-to soap.</li>
    <li> suds wonderfully and is great for all the traveling I do.</li>
    <li> provides a clean scent (the lemony pezz, or artificial lemon scent) that is not so overpowering or long lasting, and provides an unbelievable lather.  Arko is only slightly harder to work up then tabac, and for the price difference get whatever scent aftershave you want, and your not going to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this box so I could introduce old school shaving to some of my friends and get them started, but I love it so much it kills me a little to give any of the sticks away. I have several fancy tubs of various kinds of shaving cream and soap with all sorts of scents and textures - but I find myself grabbing my Arko 3 out of 5 times when its time to shave. It&#x27;s so quick and easy to rub it on your face and then work up a lather that the other fancy stuff seems like a waste of time most days. It also smells really good and seems to help with shave bumps and the little acne that I used to get on my neck is gone. I love this stuff. I&#x27;ll probably keep using it the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap foams up into a nice, effective lather.  The smell is lemony to my nose. I have had not a single nick shaving with this product, and it seems like it will last a long time making it very cost-effective.</li>
    <li> This soap is great.  I love the subtle smell.  It lathers VERY quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet the stick.  Rub it all over your stubble.  Hit your face with a wet brush, and boom.... instant, luxurious lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the three stars, because of a double edged sword.  The product has a lot of glycerin in it, so it lathers AWESOME, even in hard water. On the other hand, the product has a lot of glycerin in it, so it stings my face when it stays on too long.  By the third pass, my face it burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same price point, you can pick up the [[ASIN:B001BX58QG Shaving Soap Stick 1.7oz stick by Speick]], which does not give me the burn, but lathers just as easily.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving soap for me because of the lather it provides. If you have quick growing thick facial hair, you will understand the necessity of a good lather. My suggestions to make this work even better are 1. use warm (very warm) water, 2. wet your face before applying the brush and 3. take your time when creating the lather with the brush and apply the brush on the soap a few times until the brush is saturated. I like the bowl version better because it is easier to use.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap makes shaving painless. Like most men, i have that one spot on my neck that always is sensitive and i always seem to cut myself, but after changing to a DE safety razor with this shaving soap stick, that problem has resolved itself!</li>
    <li> Many people claim this soap stinks. I have a very sensitive nose, can smell milk going bad two days before it sours. The aroma from this tallow based soap is minimal but if any smell is noticeable it would be the fragrance of clean. Tallow soaps have been around a lot longer than most and some jacked up added fragrances doesn&#x27;t make a more heavily processed product better, just perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take a clean soap smell for my face any day.</li>
    <li> Love Arko, most don&#x27;t like the smell, kind of like laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers great and slick as snot!</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse stubble. My set up in the past was either proraso, col conk, or kiss my face. I decided to try this arko shave stick based on all the reviews and plus its so cheap. I use the main Merkur everyone has, I think its the 180 and I used a derby blade that had one shave under its belt already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purposely didnt shave for about 4 days to get some nice stubble. I also didnt shower before this shave. I wanted to see how it works without the benefit of a hot shower with steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a plastic twist up container from west coast shaving for $1.75 and easily put the arko shave stick in there. This device is the icing on the cake, everyone should get this if you get an arko stick. Will make it so much easier to carry when traveling and no mess on your hands either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet my face and applied the stick directly to my face. I then took my badger hair brush, wet it and started rubbing it around. LATHER EXPLOSION. So much lather in fact, there was enough for 3 passes on the brush. I went to town and there was no nicks, cuts and no irritation afterwards. Plus, I can only imagine how long one stick will last if I shave 4 times a week. My guess is a few months at least. Also since I apply directly to my face, there is no bowl or scuttle to mess with and have to clean later. Less mess overall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell. Yes the other reviews are right, it smells like commercial soap. However, this stuff works so well and is so cheap, I could care less. Throw on some cologne or aftershave afterwards and problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long Proraso, Conk and all the others. We had fun while it lasted but I have moved on and my face and wallet will be better off for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/18 UPDATE: My shaves are still great and the strong commercial soap smell has greatly subsided, now its just smells like a hint of lemon. So don&#x27;t be put off by the smell, it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/31 UPDATE: Been shaving with this minimum 5 times a week since it arrived. Its barely made a dent in the stick and I have so much lather per shave that I end up not using most of it and just washing it off the brush when I am done. I couldnt shave everyday with conk or proraso or kiss my face because of facial irritation. None with this at all. Plus this will end up lasting longer than the others and thats with me shaving almost everyday.</li>
    <li> Two observations after trying this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I will never buy a cream again&lt;br /&gt;2. I will never buy puck soap again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is so amazingly simple and it works incredibly well- i am going to buy as many as i can just to make sure i never run out. No need for a bowl, just rub the stick on your wet beard, and hit it with a brush- instant lather and amazing glide and protection. I have even shaved without a brush, just used hand lather- still performed incredibly well. Total game changer.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. Bought a 20 pack... I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last me a life time seeing how 1 stick has lasted me nearly 8 a year. Perfect size for travelling too.</li>
    <li> Well... its soap and you shave with it. Their is nothing very fancy about this product except that it is really a great everyday shaving soap. You&#x27;ll find some people reviewing this product and commenting on the fact that it has unusual or heavy scent. While I love our country and people in it, a lot of people are not the most cultured sort. It would be like somebody from Turkey complaining about the scent of Barbasol, we all grew up with it.  Same circumstance just vice versa. Anyway great lubrication for a shave and loads of lather. The price and performance are outstanding. Is it as fancy as some creams or higher end soaps ? No not at all. Although do you really NEED to smell like lavender or sandalwood and have to have tea tree oil? Or are you more concerned about what a great Tallow based soap can do !</li>
    <li> First of all, the smell is not too bad.  It does smell like most people say... an awkward synthetic lemon scent.  I think it smell like a janitor&#x27;s closet or Mr. Clean multi-purpose cleaner.  And also like most people state, the scent mellows after leaving the package open a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I prefer the cheap Van Der Hagen puck soap to the Arko Shave Stick.  Arko lathers up nice, but it&#x27;s a drier, foamier lather than the VDH and, at least for me, although the Arko shaves nice, the VDH shaves nicer.  This is still better than a can of Barbasol or the latest Gillette Gel.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of this stuff however no matter how much water i put in this stuff it always seems to dry to my face as im shaving.</li>
    <li> Very nice shave soap! I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but the lather is easy to build, and the floral scent lasts. When not in use I keep this around in my med. cabinet above the sink and it has kind of served as a pleasant air freshener for the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tore the paper off as needed and slightly wet the end of the stick and rubbed it on my face for a few seconds, then moved onto the brush and built the lather on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives a crazy smooth glide and I would have no problems recommending.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo23SDGLPX1J7B4]]Unlike another reviewer, I don&#x27;t spend a whole lot of my time sniffing urinal pucks but I can tell you that the fragrance of this product is straight up old-school barber. It reminded me of the smell of Ivory soap but stronger. The consistency of the stick is not chalky but rather like clay. It lathers up great. If you want that old-school back-in-the-day shave this is the way to get it. See my video review for more.</li>
    <li> Lathers well keeps skin feeling pretty good, I prefer the Proraso stuff but this is still a good product. I&#x27;ll have to see how it lasts compared to the Proraso shave soap though.</li>
    <li> I have a travel kit that requires a stick of shaving soap rather than the one you normally find in a bowl. This lathers so well it makes shaving easy</li>
    <li> ARKO is some cool stuff. Perfect for traveling as you can leave your shaving bowl at home. I can&#x27;t believe the kind of lather that explodes from your brush simply from rubbing a thin layer on your skin. I don&#x27;t use this on a daily basis though, and prefer a more luxurious lather from creams like TOBS or Spencer &amp; Devon.</li>
    <li> First I will preface this review by explaining that I haven&#x27;t used a large variety of shaving bar soaps. But, that said, I do have plenty of experience with foaming and gel products for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why did I give this Arco a solid (and I mean solid) 5 star review? Because this shaving soap has lasted me for many months already of daily use without much loss of material. On top of that great feat, the soap has given me an excellent shave and works very well with my safety razor (which I love). I use a simple badger hair brush with this soap after brushing my face with hot water and have great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your impulse at first will be to use a bit too much but that is okay. After you adjust, you will learn that one good swipe across a stubbled and wet face will give you very nice results if you have a brush (almost a necessity). At the price these bars are offered, I can&#x27;t say much that isn&#x27;t positive about this product. The smell for me is pleasant and is something my girlfriend has commented on repeatedly and enjoys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bar looks like it can/will last for about 9-12 months if used daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one critique will be this: if you put the bar in a travel bag that is damp (from a not-fully-dried brush), the red decal and lettering can flake off of the aluminum-esque papered face, leaving a mess in your bag. But, if you&#x27;re aware and put the soap in a paper towel before putting it in a bag, then you&#x27;re a-ok.</li>
    <li> Would be 5 stars but it smells like a urinal cake.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, it&#x27;s just a strong industrial cleaner type smell and it fills up the whole bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compares favorably to my current favorite, the Palmolive shave stick.  Lathers even easier.  Not quite as slick, but very effective.  Hardly takes any water or effort to build a good lather.  I don&#x27;t know how you could possibly not get a satisfactory shave with this stuff.  And for the cost of this stuff, it&#x27;s a steal.  I plan to always have some on hand from now on.  If you can deal with the smell, this is your product if you&#x27;re shaving on a budget.</li>
    <li> Good lather with a brush, and shaves well. I did not find the smell offensive , in fact I like it.</li>
    <li> Husband didn&#x27;t like this soap so he bought a different brand, however, I like it just fine.</li>
    <li> I keep one in my hygiene kit to shave with when doing fun army things with fun army people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stick really cuts time while giving a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;Wet your face, wet the end of stick a little. Rub face with wet brush and bam you got lather going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrapper went for me so I redid with aluminum foil and have it in a ziplock.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but this stuff is pretty good.  The scent is very strong and soapy, I can see why that would put some people off.  But it lathers nicely, and I like the smell, personally.</li>
    <li> I think this is the easiest lathering soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he loved it! Vintage look and easy use.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to buy more when he needs it.</li>
    <li> My wife thinks the smell was a little strong when I first got it but after two weeks in the bowl it has become just a pleasant soap smell. I like it better than the more expensive soaps.</li>
    <li> Great lather, in your hand, on your face, or in a bowl. Great value, slick protection, and pretty good old school smell.</li>
    <li> Bought one, figured for the price I had to give it a try.  Love it, best soap ever, found it works better if you apply it onto your brush as well as your face before foaming. Went on Amazon and bought a 15 pack. A splash of pinauds afterwards and some moisturizer, skyrockets in flight.</li>
    <li> Smells like ivory with a touch of lemon. Some say it smells like urinal cakes or a headshop I don&#x27;t find that to be the case at all. Anyone you talk to on any wet shaving forum will agree that it lathers like a champ. I wouldn&#x27;t expect a luxury shave experience as this product offers more of a utilitarian &amp;#34;get the job done well&amp;#34; approach. If you have 10 minutes to get out the door and need to shave this is what I use. I have hard water and that&#x27;s no problem for this soap. You will not find a better working product at this price.</li>
    <li> Arko lathers like nobody&#x27;s business - thick and slick.  I use mostly for travel but also occasionally at home.  Some complain about the scent but I like it - I think it smells like soap.  Fill up a basin with hot water, dip the tip of the stick into the water to soften it a bit, rub on your face, &amp; lather up with a wet brush.  Heaven!</li>
    <li> This is the first soap stick he&#x27;s used, and he really likes it. Tube seems small but you don&#x27;t need all that much for a healthy lather.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. Rub it on your wet face and lather up with a brush. Too easy! I love the smell. Clean and fresh strong ivory soap smell.</li>
    <li> If your face is not sensitive, this stuff may work very well for you. I cut the heck out of myself using this, and I prefer a quality cream such as truefitt &amp; hill, trumper, proraso, etc. Those creams all build a richer lather than this shave soap.</li>
    <li> I purchased an Arko stick for travel, to use with my [[ASIN:B003B3UAM6 Wee Scot Best Badger Shave Brush 70mm shave brush by Simpson]]. The combination gave me a great BSS while on the road, but I am not a fan of the scent. It reminds me of that old bathroom soap that ground the soap cake into your palm like parmesan cheese, the smell, that is. Have to say that I don&#x27;t care for it. Also, when you open the stick, you will have no choice but to either loosely wrap it back up after use, or, as I do, store the open stick in a plastic bag. A better option would be a plastic tube with a cap. Naturally, that would affect the price negatively. These days there are many travel shaving soap options, so while Arko will give you a smooth shave, if the scent isn&#x27;t your thing, you can easily find something else.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for its shaving qualities, NOT for the scent.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get a better quality product for the money. Arko is a true classic. Rub this on the sides of your face a bit, wet your brush, and you will see mounds of lather almost instantly created. Some complain about the smell which to me smelled of an old fashioned barbershop mixed with soap or perhaps cleaning chemicals. It fades in a decent amount of time if you keep it out in the open, plus I honestly got used to it because it grows on you and I now enjoy the smell. Definitely a shaving soap every wet shaver should have in their collection for the amazing lather and the steal of a price.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great, but it takes forever to make foam from this. You have to cut off some shavings for your mug and then work for a few minutes to make a lather. So it&#x27;s not for beginners.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite &amp;#34;mass-produced&amp;#34; shaving soap. Lathers up great and the smell is classic.</li>
    <li> I can see why so many people love Arko.  It is a great performing shave soap, very slick and protective, easy to lather.  Just rub onto the wet face and work it with a dampened shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like slight lemony cleaner or certain laundry soap, real mild scent that does not linger, so you can choose what ever after shave splash or cologne you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick is very useful for shavers on the go, however, one might want to look into getting a dispenser for travel. (maggards razors has a twist to dispense type)</li>
    <li> This is a great lathering soap.  The stick is the cheapest option and you can warm it up and mold it into a shaving mug which is what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this soap for it&#x27;s easy to create, thick lather. I can load a brush and have more than enough for a three pass shave.  It smells like soap and some people don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; soap smell.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on you and isn&#x27;t an issue especially if you&#x27;re going got use a scented aftershave anyway. Why have two manly scents compete?</li>
    <li> Now that I know it is a quality soap, I will be looking into the Arko 12 pack in the future.  It is a cheap soap for daily use. I just wish it had a stronger scent.</li>
    <li> I was reading reviews on arko shave stick stating it contained no glycerin and decided to read the label contents.  I had to get out my magnifying glass to read it but lo and behold, it says glycerin on the label.  just fyi.  I love this stuff. It now is all I use</li>
    <li> Good value for the money. Don&#x27;t expect a La Toja though</li>
    <li> Lathers pretty well for soap in wetshaving with a brush, has a decent scent, and a great price.&lt;br /&gt;It was strange to melt down into a bowl, but it works.  It just doesnt melt down very well, you have to lather over a lumpy surface.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those that does love the smell of Arko.  One stick lasts for months, applies easily and makes a fantastic lather....highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used this soap and it gave me that old school feel, like when you go to the barber shop, the packaging is not in English, so I had to search online to find out how to use a hard soap(usually I use creams) other than that it is a great product and met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I got this since traveling with a full soap mug for DE shaving was a bit of a hassle. This soap works well, cuts way down on the bulk of other pieces one has to carry while traveling, It provides good shaving lather, smells good and is compact. I had originally thought I&#x27;d just use it traveling, but I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m likely to use it up at home. Definitely a good shaving soap, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Mash it right into a cup. Using it by wetting it and rubbing it on in stick form isn&#x27;t best. Makes a nice lather and smells nice too. Not a strong aroma at all. Keeps face nice and hydrated during shave. I&#x27;ll but it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good but makes good lather.  It does resemble the smell of Ivory soap but I like Ogallala and it&#x27;s made here in the U. S. of A.</li>
    <li> If you are a wet shaver this stuff is awesome! You can use it as a shave stick and face lather or do as I did and mash it into a container. Using it to bowl lather or face lather. Provide smooth comfortable shaves at a fraction of the price of more spendy shave soaps. Provides great lather and cusion! A must have for the wet shaver.</li>
    <li> First the scent is awful. It was an lemon industrial cleaner scent which gave me a headache after the first use. I aired the stick out for 2 weeks and the scent was tolerable. The lather is good. I&#x27;m not crazy about the stick form as it is hard to get enough soap in the brush for three passes for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard that the scent is love-it-or-hate-it, but I&#x27;m rather enjoying it. slightly citrusy. It whips up a great lather with my synthetic and boar brushes.</li>
    <li> This shaving soap is awesome, smells like barber shop, saves the skin.  Tallow; that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small stick but seems to last a long time.  If you shave a lot, you can buy in bulk much cheaper.</li>
    <li> smells like laundry detergent but works really well and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Best value of probably any product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time and gives a very good lather. I love the convenience of just rubbing the stick on my face and lathering up right on my face.</li>
    <li> Shaving snobs look elsewhere.  For the rest of us, this is one fine product.  I use it when I travel, without a brush.  I rub it over my wet beard after shower and work it in with my fingers.  There is more than enough lubrcating power for 2-3 passes.  I was orginally looking for something to replace my now discontinued Irisch Moos.  I tried several and concluded that this one may even be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand some complain about the smell. Are you kidding me?  Nice light citrus scent.  My only complaint is the cheap wrapper.  The Irisch Moos had a substantial plastic case.  This is wrapped in thin tin foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $4, Arko should be in every wet shavers rotation.  Amazing product.</li>
    <li> Great lathering soap. and great fragrance (the smell will diminish after a week unwrapped  if you find it to harsh)</li>
    <li> Foams great, scent is not very strong and is not as artificial as other soaps can be. Lasts FOREVER - I&#x27;ve had mine for 5 months and there&#x27;s still at least 1/3 left.</li>
    <li> I use traditional shaving brush, soap with old school straight razor for a long time. I have tried over 10 different shaving soaps as well as 20+ shaving modern creams. Soaps are definitely better than the shaving creams. If you check out my other reviews, you will notice that I have reviewed several other shaving soaps that ranges from 3-star to 5-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is 5-star shaving soap in my experience. It is creamy. It provides good amount of cushion and lubrication, better than all other shaving soaps out in the market that I have tried. It is easy to apply and use. It works with different water mineral content conditions. It has a refreshing pure soap scent.</li>
    <li> Try this soap.  You won&#x27;t be sorry .. Even if you don&#x27;t like it .. You will see what all the fuss is about .. It&#x27;s something</li>
    <li> This was my first stick purchased. I liked it so much I bought a box of 12 for $12 which is a great value.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shave soap. Left my skin a little dry but for the price conscious, this soap will do.</li>
    <li> Dad and hubby loves this soap.</li>
    <li> Once the stick is put into a bowl the smell is not nearly as strong as when you first open it, but I don&#x27;t personally dislike it either way, and guess what, it&#x27;s the ONLY shave soap that my wife comments about how good I smell after a shave, UNSOLICITED !!(hope I spelled that correctly). My shave soap collection is growing, and so far, Arko is just about the best I&#x27;ve tried. The lather is thick, rich, and provides great cushion for the blade. The scent of course, is subjective.</li>
    <li> Has a middle eastern smell which I do not mind. Have a hard time getting a think creamy lather but otherwise works well.</li>
    <li> It works extremely well, its cheap so can be melted down to fit your shave bowl, the smell dies away, whats not to like</li>
    <li> Well it is certainly not for everyone. It&#x27;s cheap, so I have no regrets. The lather is good. The smell is very distinctive but not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband complained that it gives him too close of a shave which leaves his skin irritated. I suggested not dragging the razor across his neck like he has a death wish, but there is no helping some people.</li>
    <li> Just received it today. Usually don&#x27;t write reviews unless I&#x27;am pissed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good: Cheap. Lathers terrific with a little water on a shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Stinks to high heaven. Smells like strong lye soap. Same soap as people used to wash their clothes over a 100 yrs. ago.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it gave me a headache within minutes after the shave. Threw it in the garbage. It&#x27;s cheap for a reason. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Arko provides a really nice shave and leaves my face really smooth.  I really like the smell, as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband to try.  He wanted to try different shaving creams to find what he liked, but after trying this his search was over.  He really likes how the Arko foams nicely and easily, does not give razor rash, or irritate his skin.  In addition, Arko is extremely affordable and has a pleasant light lemon scent making it a great buy.  The only thing he would change is the stick form...it works great for some, but he finds it a little inconvenient as he breaks it up into his shaving dish.</li>
    <li> The stick is very handy for travel as it eliminated the need for a bowl. It lathered up on my face, in fact probably easier and better than in a bowl. I may buy the sticks when my bowl is empty.</li>
    <li> This shave soap is fantastic. When I first put it on I wasn&#x27;t ready for just the amount of lather it can create. Only downside I have found is I only ordered 3, next time I&#x27;m getting the box.</li>
    <li> This product is an incredible value - possibly the best deal anywhere in the shaving soap/cream market.  Lathers up as well as Truefit &amp; Hill (my benchmark for lather quality and concentration) and is incredibly concentrated, with a little going a very long way.  An unusual scent - a blend of citronella, lemon soap and old corn tortilla  - but I&#x27;ve quickly grown to like it, and the scent of the stick has mellowed since I unwrapped it.  Shaving is all about the experience, and having a Turkish take on your morning shave keeps the routine interesting, and gives you something to think about and enjoy as you lather up.  My shaving supplies are a smorgasbord of international favorites, and the Arko stick is now right up there with the best of them and despite the low price - this is in no way a second rate product!  The best way  I&#x27;ve found to use this, is to skip the bowl and apply the stick directly to your wet beard, &#x27;brushing&#x27; it on against the grain.  All you need is  just light skiff, which your morning whiskers will quickly pick up.  Then take your wet brush and lather up directly on your skin.  The lather explodes out of nowhere.  My only slight criticism (more of an observation really) is that the lather has a somewhat &#x27;dryer&#x27; feel to it than some others that are somewhat more &#x27;slippery&#x27; - but that can be remedied with a little extra water and maybe a little pre-shave oil, if you are so inclined.  My face and skin feel really great afterwards, (does the tallow base condition the skin better than vegetable?) and a slight scent remains but is not at all offensive, nor does is compete with other aftershaves I use.  In all, this is a novel international product, of very high quality and ridiculously low price.  If you love shaving products like I do, this is one you shouldn&#x27;t overlook.  Have fun with it!</li>
    <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
    <li> This is a unique idea in shaving soap- it works very well, and the stick lasts a really long time. The only thing I would add is that if you are buying this after using the Regular Arko in a tube, be warned that this does not have the same scent as it&#x27;s tubular cousin. Personally I prefer the soapiness of the tube to the more perfumey aroma of the stick, but your preferences may vary.</li>
    <li> Recipient does not like it --- it smells bad!</li>
    <li> Arko is a really good soap, especially for how inexpensive it is. It lathers up really easily, even with hard water. The lather is also very slick. The smell is great, in my opinion. It just smells like soap. The only major downside I encountered was that it dried out my face far more than usual, though this was easily alleviated with a non-alcohol aftershave balm. Using a balm or aftershave with alcohol will only exacerbate the problem. Definitely a must have for travel kits.</li>
    <li> I have no used this yet, although I do like the smell... I also like that it&#x27;s pliable.  I can mash it into my own shave bowl, as it does not come in one.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I needed to shave and my brush hadn&#x27;t arrived yet, what to do?!?! Rub this stick on your face, splash a little water and rub vigorously with your hands. Was it the best lather ever? No, but it was more than acceptable to shave with. I love the smell, very clean &amp; plain soapy smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering as so many have claimed, and most importantly it doesn&#x27;t make your face smell like that all day, the scent disappears as soon as the shave is finished. Now that I have my brush the amount of lather I get off this shave soap is INSANE, I&#x27;ve tried a few other soaps here and there and felt like either they all sucked or I was doing something wrong that I didn&#x27;t understand. Whatever the problem was I don&#x27;t have it with Arko.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I love it. I like the scent, the lather is rich and thick, and once I figure out how to do this wet shaving thing right, I can almost guarantee this is going to be my shaving soap of choice. Inexpensive, great performance, and easy to use. What else would a newbie wet shaver want?</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I followed the advice of another poster and unwrapped the whole stick, put it in my shaving mug and then microwaved it for about 30 seconds.  You can then take a big fork or spoon and push the stick into the bottom of the mug.  I then just put what was left of my Williams soap on top and mushed that down on top. Anyway, this is a great shaving soap.</li>
    <li> The best.  Buy a 12 pack and save some money only $13.00 on Prime.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great on tough beard.  Has a medicinal smell that I like.  The bar is big and lasts a long time.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I had this soap thrown in when I bought something else and tried it.  Liked it so much I bought a dozen.  Pleasant \\&quot;old school barber\\&quot; fragrance that is clean and doesn&#x27;t linger.  Oodles of cream with little effort and very, very modestly priced.  You can spend more (a LOT more) but this stuff works.</li>
    <li> Great lather couldn&#x27;t be made any easier. If you are in wet shaving then you must try this one. I&#x27;m hooked forever!</li>
    <li> Stings my face when i use it. I googled it and said that excessive glycerin content my cause that. I guess you get what you pay for and this is junk.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you can find decent shaving soap for cheap, but this isn&#x27;t it, keep on looking and please let me know of any recommendations, as i will update this review if something comes up.</li>
    <li> The soap itself lathers well and has a pleasant scent.  Bought this for travel however I found I just don&#x27;t care for the concept of a shave stick, but that is personal preference.  If you leave it in the wrapper it came in eventually the wrapper gets messed up so you need some sort of other holder.  Eventually I heated it up and mushed it into a shave bowl.</li>
    <li> The arko brand shave stick, is turning out to be my regular probably 75% of the time.  I produces a rich lather, that lubricates extremely well, better then a lot of my higher end shave cram tubs.  The scent initially is very over powering, however  after a few days of sitting out, the scent does not become as overbearing.  T best use of this soap is to either mash it into a bowl, or grab one of those blank containers from mama&#x27;s shave soaps to put a shave stick, it works wonders, although an empty deodorant stick would work just as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale and I&#x27;m still on my first stick.  At this rate, I probably have a 2 year supply!  I shave in the shower and using the shaving stick couldn&#x27;t be easier.  Rub it on your wet face, grab your hot &amp; damp brush and just rub it into a lather.</li>
    <li> This stuff is cool.  I wet my face and rub the stick on my cheeks.  Then take the wet brush and start lathering.  Creates a really good lather. Great for air travel because it is a solid and not a gel or cream.</li>
    <li> The picture suggests that you get a box of soap but its really just a 75g stick (about 2.6 oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a mild scent to the stick that I noticed upon application but it doesn&#x27;t linger after rinsing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap produced a surprising amount of lather despite the fact that I didn&#x27;t have a brush to lather with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One noticeable annoyance is the foil wrapper which may make application difficult when your hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the stick is very malleable when its warm, I&#x27;m considering shoving the soap into an empty deodorant tube.</li>
    <li> One of the best value products I&#x27;ve ever purchased, Arko soap is dirt cheap and lasts forever. It also lubricates well and leaves you feeling clean after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes for the uninitiated in Arko:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-At first the product smells intensely, and almost obnoxiously, like an extremely cheap bar of soap. However, once open this smell will dissipate over a period of two weeks. After that it still has a faint aroma of that cheap soap; but instead of assaulting your nose, its smell induces a nostalgic feeling whenever you use it. It just reminds you that you&#x27;re doing things the old way, and in my oppinion this is not a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Again, the smell isn&#x27;t for everyone, even after it&#x27;s mellowed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You have to get the bar wet and your face wet before it will deposit enough soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap shines especially when mixed with other soaps, it enhances their properties and makes their lather better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, you&#x27;d be a fool NOT to buy something this good. Makes an excellent travel bar.</li>
    <li> Soap Performance - This gives a ton of lather, and feels luxurious, thanks to the tallow and glycerin. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap Scent - It has a strong lemon-like smell when you first open the stick, and I can understand why this can be off-putting. But I found this scent to completely go away after the stick had been open for a couple of days. Now it smells simply clean and old fashioned. Like Ivory but better. (I have high-end taste when it comes to my scents and perfumes, and this clean soapy smell is nostalgic and pleasant - and unisex!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economical - This soap should cost you less than a penny a day to use. The quality, performance and price simply cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I Use - I wet my skin and also the stick. I rub the stick across my legs a few times (I&#x27;m not a guy!), then use my brush to lather it on my legs. Easy peasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to DE shaving, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Arko. Fail-proof, good quality, great on skin.</li>
    <li> Smells clean like Ivory soap. Has become my go-to shave soap. Excellent lather, rich, creamy, slippery -- just make sure your brush is on the wet side; this soap likes water. Applying stick to face allows me to concentrate that initial waxy layer on sensitive areas for more protection. Applying to only about half my shaving area provides more than enough lather for a three-pass shave.    As to value, when compared to the Palmolive stick (the other low-cost, tallow-based stick), the Arko stick has more weight (75g vs 50g), but for less cost (at least via Amazon). I also find Arko has superior lather to Palmolive, though Palmolive isn&#x27;t a bad product.    Arko offers excellent performance, good price, great value.

    <li> I really like the smell of this stuff and so does g/f.  Great size for traveling and makes a decent lather. Can be kinda tough to scrub onto face if you only have light stubble.</li>
    <li> You know, every once and a while you run across a product that&#x27;s almost too good to be true. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a DE razor for perhaps five years now, and I really like trying new stuff, but I must admit I&#x27;ve gotten set in my ways because I&#x27;ve found what works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually shave with Bigelow or Proraso cream in a tube, although I&#x27;ll use a high-end soap cake from time to time, there&#x27;s a lot of good stuff out there. So one day I ordered some shaving \\&quot;thing\\&quot; from someone, and along with the \\&quot;thing\\&quot; they threw in a free stick of Arko. Even though I had heard some good things about it, I stuck it up in my cabinet and forgot about it, and went back to using my Bigelow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two months ago I happened to reach for the Bigelow tube and realized it was empty. Suddenly I remembered the stick of Arko that had been sitting in my cabinet for the last year(!) or so, and decided to give it a try while I was waiting for more of something else to show up. I like to use a scuttle, and the idea of just \\&quot;drawing on my face\\&quot; didn&#x27;t really appeal to me too much, but hey, any port in a storm, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got my face moist with warm water and I basically started \\&quot;drawing\\&quot; on it with the Arko stick. The smell is ok, it&#x27;s just not TOBS or anything like that. I wet my brush down and started whipping up my neck with it and was amazed at how quickly it turned into a nice lather. It took all of 15 seconds. I had a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The really crazy part is that the amount of soap that it took for my shave was essentially too small to notice! Let&#x27;s just say I got used to this stuff really, REALLY fast, and it&#x27;s now my go-to shave, at least for the time being. So here we are, at least two months later, and I still have well over a third of the stick left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say this also: some of these reviews mention the lack of good foam with this product. I&#x27;ve found that the foam is definitely different with the more utilitarian products, its more \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; and less \\&quot;creamy.\\&quot; That being said though, this stuff produces more than enough for me, but that&#x27;s me. I also know that water hardness makes a huge difference in the foam quality, you might want to try it again, but use some distilled water... the difference can be massive.That being said though, this stuff produces more than enough for me, but that&#x27;s me.

    <li> I can&#x27;t believe no one has mentioned this soap smells like Moroccan Orange Blossom Water...which smells refreshing to me. If it is actually in this soap, Orange Blossom Water is great at hydrating, purifying and toning your skin. I cut a small piece and put it in my shaving bowl. It lathers quickly and allows my razor to glide over my skin. The shave I got was much more comfortable and close compared to other soaps, creams and gels I&#x27;ve used in the past. I did feel a slight burning sensation on my cheeks when I had to apply more for an additional pass with the razor, but it went away within minutes after I was done and didn&#x27;t turn my cheeks red.</li>
    <li> This product is MUCH better than its price point might indicate.  It lathers easily and provides a slick cushion.  I think the only thing anyone would really have a problem with is the smell.  It smells like funky lemon--I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it; like lemon scented bathroom cleaner.  But if you let it air dry outside of the package for a while the smell dissipates.  Since I don&#x27;t really care for peeling off the wrapping and using it as a stick, I chop it up and press it down into my shaving mug.    UPDATE 2/3/15:  I have been using this and Tabac extensively to compare side by side.  Tabac&#x27;s lather has an amazing consistency but Arko provides better glide and comfort... Pretty ironic considering it costs many times less.</li>
    <li> Has a hint of lemon scent to it. But for the money it can&#x27;t be beat especially, for travel.</li>
    <li> What can you say?  This shave soap smells like the urinal cake of a truck stop restroom.  A dirty truck stop.</li>
    <li> A very good shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Great lather. I dont have much diversity of experience- but this is better than Col. Conk or Williams. Better, thicker, slicker lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.Its moldable. Good for travel, can be smushed into a variety of lidded containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Low cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell. I personally like it, reminds me of the barbershop shaves I used to get when I was younger. But I can see how people might not like it. It does NOT smell like cologne or any out of the can shave cream. Smells a bit like laundry detergent at first, but the smell goes away after you set the soap out to dry for a few hour everyday, within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I believe it&#x27;s tallow-based. That might be a problem for some.</li>
    <li> Rub it on your face, then lather up with a brush.  It&#x27;s that easy and you make a great lather, and get a great shave.  Also, it&#x27;s a very inexpensive product ($4 ish for one, but you can get a dozen for about $15 if you like it, comes to $1.30 a stick) that will last for months.  So, what&#x27;s not to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a lovely scented product.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like avocado, eucalyptus, sandlewood, etc.  It smells like soap.  So, if your shaving pleasure includes using a lovely scented product, you won&#x27;t be happy.  If you want a great lather at a ridiculously low price -- this one is for you.</li>
    <li> This stuff is cheap. That is the end of the positive things one can say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible, industrial, fake-lemon scent. Drys the skin. Lather is middle tier.</li>
    <li> 2 years and I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
    <li> Good lather, but don&#x27;t like the scent- somehow medicinal and musty and moldy rolled into one scent.</li>
    <li> Decent shave soap.  The smell isn&#x27;t really doing anything for me.  It smells like you just took a header into some sort of bush.  Not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> Gives a good lather and I personally like the scent. I hate the wrapper, I use this as my travel soap and the wrapper is now glued onto it from the soap getting wet and then drying. I&#x27;d recommend this product, but remove the wrapper and carry some other way.</li>
    <li> Easy to lather and smells good too.  Many folks have the notion this smells like a urinal puck but I don&#x27;t think it does.  It reminds me of plain, ol&#x27; Ivory soap.  If you have a sensitive nose maybe this isn&#x27;t for you.  One stick will last a very long time. See the guy on the package?  He is the cult leader.  Try it and see if he grants you permission to be a member.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on reviews/reputation as a travel soap (stick is easy to cary around when i travel, my Tabac puck stays in it&#x27;s cup at home.)  Performance-wise it&#x27;s brilliant.  Richer lather than Tabac and very smooth.  The stick will last you a really long time.  For the price it&#x27;s a fantastic bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint, and it&#x27;s a very subjective one, is that I can&#x27;t stand the scent.  It has a very perfume-y odor.  It almost makes my eyes water.  I tried to get used to it.  I couldn&#x27;t.  I know a lot of people actually like the scent, it&#x27;s just not for me.  I tend to like more natural, subtle scents.  The Arko smells artificial and overpowering to me.  I can smell it from 30 feet away when it&#x27;s sitting out- that&#x27;s how over-the-top I find this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, this is subjective.  If you can deal with the scent, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad soap. Good for travel and easy to mash into another container. Mine is in a giant twist dispenser like a giant tube of lip balm.  I won&#x27;t replace it when it&#x27;s gone because there are many others I like better.  For all of the talk about the scent and trying to describe it here it goes...IT SMELLS EXACTLY LIKE IVORY SOAP!!!</li>
    <li> Gives a good shave, lathers well. No extreme scents like some soaps seem to have. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is compact, easy to pack in your shaving kit.  The smell is very refreshing.  But the best part is using a shaving brush and suds up a lot.  At first I thought that it was not going to work.  Wet face and rub on your face then use your brush. Way too much lather, if there is such a thing.  It will not take you long to figure out how much to rub on your face.  The brush is what makes it go to town for a big lather.  Am getting more.  Razor gave such a close shave with this dense creamy lather.  Its fun to shave again!  Does not dry out my face and the foam does not disappear before I finish shaving.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> If you love bargains, try this.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending a few dollars on something you might hate and throw away, try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my shave feels when I use this soap.  Smooth and silky. Comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell:  For me, the smell is not a gourmet smell, it is, however, a comfort smell.  It smells like soap.  Another review said it smells like a dryer sheet. Yeah, kinda. But it reminds me of the smell of basic soaps from my childhood in the 60&#x27;s.  Plain old ivory soap or something.  I wouldn&#x27;t want it as a cologne, but as a soap, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;(If you HATE the smell of dryer sheet, you might end up throwing this away.  Some reviewers have noted that the smell goes away as the stick is exposed to air, so if you&#x27;re frugal, don&#x27;t throw it away immediately.)</li>
    <li> Used canned shave cream all my life. Yes it is more convenient, but I am now addicted to this soap stick. Shaves are definitely smoother, skin is better protected and it smells great. I will continue to buy this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Drawback: must be careful, and allow it to dry between uses. I don&#x27;t wet the entire stick and keep it on a coaster in my sink drawer.</li>
    <li> Lathers great, smells great; enough said.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pilot and travel frequently obviously. I needed something that I could use while DE shaving while working.  This stuff works great.  Makes a great lather and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.  You do need a brush to whisk it up on your face.  Just rub it on your stubble and work it up with your brush. I would probably use it at home but I have so many other soaps and creams that I need to use up.</li>
    <li> It feels and smells great! Easy to apply and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m a student and I also travel a lot for work so this handy stick will aid me in keeping clean,</li>
    <li> This stuff has a cult-like following on the shaving forum I&#x27;m part of so I had to try some.  Used it for the first time today and had a great experience.  I used it as a shave stick, rubbing it all over my face then added my brush and some water then POOF - lots of great lather.  The smell is essentially lemon and is a nice fragrance for the morning.  It does have a bit of an industrial lemon floor cleaner smell to it but thats not that big of a deal.  The shave was great and if you need more lather for a pass just rub it back on your face and start up again.  Also this is kind of a softer soap so don&#x27;t expect it to be like its glycerin counterparts.  Its also dirt cheap on here so theres no reason not to try it!</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this a try because I liked the price and the packaging. I was amazed by the efficacy of this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is economical, easy to use and provides for a most pleasurable shave.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this for as long as I shave.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and easy to use.  I prep my face with hot water, then rub the stick in and coat my face.  Then I take my badger brush, get it very wet and then work up a great lather.  I got a twist up container from West Coast Shaving to hold this. It works great.  It has a clean soap smell.  You cannot beat the price/value.</li>
    <li> When I first opened this thing I thought, &amp;#34;Oh no, what have I done?&amp;#34;  It smelled like the bathroom of a truck stop in the middle of nowhere.  Like industrial cleaner or a urinal puck (popular opinion for a reason).  I have to tell you though, it WILL wear off.  If you leave it sitting out for a week it mellows out into a very soft and pleasant Ivory Soap smell.  But scent aside, this thing is an absolute performer.  It lathers very well, is slick enough to protect my face (even with hard water), and lasts a good, long time.  Now I crave the stuff.  I can&#x27;t wait for whiskers to grow just so I can use it.  I pick it up and sniff it every time I walk into the bathroom.  I&#x27;ve been granted membership in the Cult of Arko!  It&#x27;s cheap and low risk!  Get a stick or buy a whole pack and give &#x27;em out as gifts!  One of the better items I&#x27;ve spent a couple of bucks on.  As they say, your mileage may vary, but if you don&#x27;t like it you can gift it to someone or toss it.  It&#x27;s cheap enough that you really can&#x27;t lose.</li>
    <li> Switching to this from barbasol can soap, it works like a dream.. easily able to work up a thick lustrous lather.  Some people don&#x27;t care for the scent, but personally I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Im a lil picked about my creams and soaps. Proraso is a standard old school like they say, big elbow is one of my favorites, many I don&#x27;t like. This stick us pretty big, more than I thought. Wet face and rub it on a ill bit then take brush and lather. Easy, nice simple smell, feels good, doesn&#x27;t dry my easily dried out skin and clearly will last a very long time. If I was a prepper this would be my go to shave cream and nothing else</li>
    <li> Really there is no way to beat this stuff for the price/performance ratio. As everyone else said, it is almost idiot-proof when it comes to achieving a lather with Arko. The lather is standard and simple....perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three things you will need to shave with Arko&lt;br /&gt;-A brush&lt;br /&gt;-A razor&lt;br /&gt;-Water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s perfect for traveling. mall and compact. You get your face wet, rub the stick on your face until you have a white film on it, and lather away on your face, with the brush. No need for a bowl. I am not a lather expert, and I times myself at 30 seconds and had a perfect, fluffy, rich lather. Oh, make sure your brush is wet too obviously. It might take you a couple times to get the hang of it, after that, you could do it in your sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those reviews complaining about the lather/performance oof this stuff, my suggestion is to go back to square one. maybe watch Youtube videos on how to lather properly, and aside from that, quit being an annoying snob. No biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only valid critique I have seen with Arko is that some people are turned off by the smell. Maybe because it&#x27;s not raspberry or citrus or cologne or whatever smelling, I don&#x27;t know. I have seen many older folks say that it smells exactly like what they used in old time barber shops back in the old days, that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> It works as shaving soap, and it&#x27;s a handy travel size. It leaves a smooth, oily feel on the face prior to shaving and adequately protects against shaving cuts. I did not love the smell, which is relatively powerful, and which lingers for some time after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, but the smell may not be for everyone</li>
    <li> Liked it so much I bought the box of 12.  So easy to use- lather is thick and protective.  One stick lasts a long time.  I still have just under half of my first stick left after shaving with it almost exclusively for nearly 2 1/2 months.  Scent is very refreshing- soapy and citrusy.  Guy on the wrapper inspires you to shave.  No need to mess with more expensive soaps as this is all you will ever need in terms of both value and quality.</li>
    <li> Foams up incredibly. So cheap, it&#x27;s a no brainer just to try out. Not my everyday shave soap but still use it once in a while.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of different soaps and William mug is the one I can&#x27;t stand. This is pretty much the same scent and lather. It doesn&#x27;t lather very well and it will dry up fast. My favorite is poraso and Taylor old bond I think is the name. I personal love lime and the mint it leaves your face tingling and the smell doesn&#x27;t last but a half hour after your shave. I don&#x27;t like leaving one star but this was disappointing. Spend the extra buck you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> A nice shave stick that lathers up quickly and provides a very smooth shave.  I personally find the smell pleasant although I know some people object to it.  I&#x27;m sure if you don&#x27;t like it you can probably find a friend who will take it off your hands for you.  Certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a mug and brush for a very long time, and have been using a straight razor for the last few years. I bought this shaving soap just for the heck of it and find that I love it. It is a little goofy to rub a stick of soap across your face, however this stuff makes a rich cream when you follow up with a wet shaving brush. The cream is slick and rich, making a really nice base for using my straight razor. I love the smell too. It has a lemony, citronella aroma reminiscent of Ivory soap. It also leaves my face feel soft a smooth. Lastly the price is great. Try it out and you will be surprised too.PS, I used Colonel Conk&#x27;s and Van Der Hagen Luxury mug soaps and this stuff easily beats them for shaving comfort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m more of a shaving cream person, but bought this to check out. For shaving soap, it&#x27;s pretty good. If you like shave soaps, you&#x27;ll like this. I&#x27;ll use this stick for traveling and stick to cream at home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to give it 3 b/c I just don&#x27;t like the way the paper looks all torn and crappy on my shelf for the 6 or so months it takes for me to use the stick. Also the soapy smell is super strong so if your not a fan of super strong plain soap smell then this won&#x27;t be for you. On the plus side, I haven&#x27;t found a better deal as far as shaving soap goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is good, not the best but good and can be kind of gummy if the brush does not have enough moisture to create a proper lather. To be honest I&#x27;m a big fan of making the lather in a bowl and taking my time with it to get it just right. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s the quietest part of my day so why not stretch it out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stay w/ Col. Conk for most days (good value). I also keep a tub of Taylor of Old Bond on the shelf for when I&#x27;m in a big hurry or for date nights (pricey but smells nice). Tried Proraso and Musgo Real....both smell too strongly of menthol for my taste. Just using those on big rush days.</li>
    <li> I like this shaving soap.  It smells very masculine and performs very nicely.  It produces a very rich and thick lather, providing good lubrication for the razor to glide against.</li>
    <li> A product of legends, this soap stick is unparalleled in its easy of use and functionality.  It has a nice, clean scent.  The Product lathers easily and provides good cushioning and glide to the blade while shaving.  Getting a twist container for the stick (from west coast shaving) greatly enhances the ease of use and application.  I ended up buying another 15 sticks from Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving now about 5 months and I&#x27;ve got to say this is one of the best values out there. This soap lathers very easily and gives a great, protective, slick shave.  I just rub the stick on my wet face and then whip up a great lather with a damp brush.  Very easy.  Ignore all the juvenile comments regarding scent -- this just smells like strong Ivory soap when you hold it up to your nose, but the scent dissipates quickly when you lather your face.  The scent is actually quite neutral, really.  I wish now I hadn&#x27;t wasted so much money on more expensive soaps.  Think I&#x27;ll buy a case of it next time.</li>
    <li> I have been using one stick for the last 7 months. I am a woman, and don&#x27;t shave daily, so I&#x27;m sure it probably lasts me longer than others. I am only about 1/4 of the way through the stick though, so I anticipate it lasting me at least a full year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use this stick. I take it in the shower with me, wet the end, wet my legs, and smear the stick over my legs. I am able to shave with no foaming involved. It creates a nice slick surface as is. Lately I have been using a brush to rub a little, just to make it white so I can see that all my skin is soaped, but it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the smell of this stick at all, though it doesn&#x27;t smell girly for sure. I suspect a nice smelling body wash on the legs when done would help the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price though, I will live with the smell. Between my recently purchased 12 pack of soap, and the 100 pack of blades, I might just be set with shaving supplies for the next decade.</li>
    <li> Arko isn&#x27;t my favorite shave soap but it gets the job done. Its real benefit is the form factor. It slips easily into a dop bag for when I hit the road and doesn&#x27;t make a mess. I usually manage to build a nice lather with it without having to use a mug. Its the only shave soap I travel with but I prefer other brands when I&#x27;m at home and have the space and equipment. For the price though its an excellent product that fills a niche in my toiletry&#x27;s repertoire.</li>
    <li> Arko has a strong aroma out of the box that gradually subsides. My wife wouldn&#x27;t let me keep it in the bathroom for about two weeks. Other than that, it makes a fantastic lather (I don&#x27;t even use a bowl) and makes for a great shave even in a hurry. Well worth the purchase and I plan on buying again.</li>
    <li> A very good basic soap stick for beginners and experts alike. Makes good thick foam for shaving with straight or safety razor or the disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Bought this for travel usage, and one day, I ran out of my shaving soap at home, so I thought I would try this for a day or two until I got back to the store, but this stuff words so well, I don&#x27;t plan on going back to a mug and soap.  Makes thick suds and works well for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly!</li>
    <li> Fantastic soap for beginners and veterans alike. I face lather using Arko and a Simpson Wee Scot brush, and lather simply explodes from my face.</li>
    <li> The first shave stick I tried was the one made by Palmolive. It was just ok and I was never really happy with its performance. It didn&#x27;t seem to give enough of a protective coating and as a result didn&#x27;t give me a great or irritation free shave. Since trying the Arko, I see now that it is much better. Its not perfect, but its much better than the Palmolive.</li>
    <li> Lathers very nicely, but I don&#x27;t appreciate the chemical smell.  I would recommend the readily available Vander Hagen Deluxe instead.</li>
    <li> This product irritated my husband&#x27;s neck and felt like it burned to him. It smells like laundry detergent. He will be sticking to a soap cake in a dish and a brush thank you. I&#x27;m glad he found out on one stick instead of buying the case which is cheaper per stick.</li>
    <li> I bought a stick to try, and I noticed two things.  First I found the smell to be a nice clean soap scent that is very much like Ivory soap with a hint of lemon.  A very nice clean scent, and not an offensive scent at all.  No it is not a fancy Truefitt and Hill or Taylor of Old Bond St. scent, but more similar to Williams Mug soap.  Second is that when I used it I simply rubbed the stick on my face, and then lathered with my shave brush.  Effortless lather!  The lather is also very very slick for a great shave.  The quality of the lather, and the slickness is just as good as many high-end creams and soaps that I have tried.  It actually out-performs some, and matches most high-end stuff.  Very surprising for the price! Some complain that it dries their face.  I found that it did not dry my face as much as William&#x27;s. Since I use an aftershave splash or balm this is not an issue, but I found that it is not particularly drying even when I don&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re looking for a very good everyday shave soap, buy a stick of this and give it a try.</li>
    <li> My title pretty much says it all.  Whether or not you love or hate this soap seems to depend purely on how you feel about the scent.  It&#x27;s cheap enough to try it, in any case.  What&#x27;ve you got to lose?</li>
    <li> I think these little sticks work amazing for lathering. I personally also like the smell. A lot of people say they don&#x27;t like it, but it reminds me of a soap my grandparents use to use growing up. There is a lot of nostalgia when i use this soap stick! Great for beginners and experts. this soap is always good!</li>
    <li> Great for traveling, but I also sometimes use it at home because I love the scent!  Lathers up very easily with a badger brush.  I just rub the stick on my wet face, then lather up with the brush!</li>
    <li> For the money, it&#x27;s the best.  I carry it when traveling, rub it on my face, lather right on my face and it does a GREAT job of protecting my skin and softening my beard.  My razor glides along.</li>
    <li> I bought this before a recent vacation to avoid traveling with larger, more expensive. creams that might get taken by a fickle TSA agent. The diameter is similar to that of a silver dollar and it&#x27;s only 3-3.5 inches tall, great for compact packing packing. I passed the soap across my face a couple of times and was able to generate a very nice lather using a boar brush. The shave was mildly cushioned and comfortably slick, but the smell was too much like Lemon Pledge wood polish for my liking. I will keep this for short business trips and the like but it will not be a regular soap in my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Tip: after carelessly tearing the top wrapper (leaving the soap potentially exposed for the trip home), I was able to cover the soap using the foil wrapper off the neck of a champagne bottle. I&#x27;m sure there are better ways to do it, but that might help you out in a jam.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Seems like williams if modern williams didn&#x27;t suck so bad. go the lemon fresh kind of scent as well</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I have tried a multitude of shave lotions, oil and soaps. Nothing is as easy as this: Wet face, rub in, use wet brush. the lather is very thick and with some body. I think I read in here that the lather feels &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, I&#x27;d say it feels thick, much better than the stuff from a can. We have very hard water and I still get a satisfactory lather. The only negative thing is that indeed it has a strange smell, not bad, but unusual.</li>
    <li> First, I have to echo the other reviewer&#x27;s sentiment about the picture being misleading.  The text does state that you&#x27;re buying a single stick, but the picture makes it look like you&#x27;re buying a box of &#x27;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially disappointed with my [[ASIN:B002A5OLHQ Arko Shaving Soap Stick]].  I prefer using a brush and mug, so I unwrapped the stick, cut it into shaving soap coins (which I believe are legal tender in Venezuela and Costa Rica, and certain counties in Arkansas), put them into my mug and stuck it in the microwave for 30 seconds to melt them.  What a mistake!  That&#x27;s what I do with [[ASIN:B001A3DNY6 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap, 2.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)]], and it works great--the soap liquifies, adheres to the bottom and sides of the mug, and once it resolidifies, I&#x27;m good to go.  This stuff softened, yes, but it didn&#x27;t really liquify.  Instead, it kind of foamed up and over the top of the mug.  I tried to use my knife to moosh it back into the mug, but it resulted in a very rough, craggy top surface.  Figured I&#x27;d just use the brush on it anyway--eventually I would wear down that rough surface and leave behind a smooth top that would work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I did!  This soap lathered up like nobody&#x27;s business when I put the warm, moist brush to it.  It made a little thinner lather than I usually get from VDH, but despite it&#x27;s thinness, it wasn&#x27;t runny at all--it stayed right where I brushed it, and didn&#x27;t dry out before my razor got to it.  My habit is to do three shaves in different directions, and the Arko lather held out for all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used an older blade, an [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]], probably about two shaves past when I would usually have replace it, but I was being lazy.  I kind of expected to nick myself a couple times.  But with the Arko shaving soap, that did not happen.  My blade glided across my face as smoothly as I could ask.  No nicks at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many have mentioned, the scent is kind of strong, and not entirely pleasant.  Some have compared it to citronella, which I can understand.  I though it was kind of a cross between the original Old Spice scent from when my dad used their cologne, and some industrial chemical smell.  VDH is more or less unscented, so I usually mix a few drops of my favorite cologne ([[ASIN:B00AATHC52 ASPEN by Coty]]) into the liquid when it comes out of the microwave, but I didn&#x27;t think that would be a good idea with Arko.  I didn&#x27;t think the cologne scent would mix well with the cloying scent the soap came with.  But while the scent isn&#x27;t my cup of tea, after you rinse your face well, it&#x27;s not very strong at all, especially if you wash your face afterward and use a scented after-shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is, for a single stick, the value isn&#x27;t great.  It&#x27;s a lot more affordable, and just as usable a product, as some of the much more expensive soaps out there, but at the single stick price, plus shipping, you could buy several pucks of Van Der Hagen locally.  When you buy more sticks at a time, the per-stick price comes down, and if you can manage to get free shipping in the deal, it starts looking really attractive.  The lather is very nice, the scent, not so much, but all in all, you can&#x27;t go too far wrong with it.  I&#x27;m dinging it one star only because of the scent.  While I would rather it liquify in the microwave like VDH, that&#x27;s not how the product was designed to be used, so it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to dock it for that.</li>
    <li> Great lather, nice smell and so simple to use. Seriously, this makes shaving a lot more enjoyable. Will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> This stick is like glue.  It is packed cheaply and does no provide the best shaving&lt;br /&gt;surface in my opinion after use.</li>
    <li> This soap finally did it. Most other shaving soaps and creams are now ruined for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get out of the shower and rub the stick of Arko all over my beard growth. Then I start to lather with a pre-soaked brush. In less than a minute I have thick, slick, incredibly cushioning lather. Lather with cushion that is superior to many more-expensive products. Lather that takes minimal effort to produce, which is great on a rushed weekday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Arko for more than 4 months. I&#x27;ve used other products to a lesser extent during that time, but I estimate that a stick will last 3 months of daily use with the way I use it. If you smash a stick of Arko into a bowl and lather directly on top of it, you will use more and it won&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the scent, I can say that it does diminish greatly in time once you have a stick of Arko unwrapped. While my whole bathroom smelled like Arko when I first unwrapped it, the scent is now much more gentle and something that I only smell when I am lathering. I find it to be a clean, soapy scent and I actually like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko is worth trying if you use a shaving brush. If you don&#x27;t, I suggest getting one and getting some Arko. I haven&#x27;t found anything that comes out of a can to work as well. Given the cost per use and performance of Arko, I am not sure if there is a better shaving soap/cream value out there.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap but the smell is something to either get use too, it smells like airplane soap but since i use aftershave and lotion I don&#x27;t really smell it that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Quickly gathers soap into brush&lt;br /&gt;2. Fast lather in bowl or on face&lt;br /&gt;3. Dense soap&lt;br /&gt;4. Once applied it doesn&#x27;t dry out quickly&lt;br /&gt;5. Leaves nice oily second coat once you start shaving&lt;br /&gt;6. Comes in tube and it easy to cut into sections for travel or whatever&lt;br /&gt;7. The price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The Smell (which I deal with)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended Arko to a few people that are starting out and mention the smell, however once they use it they love it and still use it, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Arko is a great economy shaving soap.  The smell was not offensive at all to me and actually has grown on me somewhat since I started using it.  I can best describe the smell as clean and lemony; if Ivory soap and lemon PEZ had a love child Arko shave soap would come out.  This tallow based soap produces an amazingly thick lather but it takes a bit more work to do so than with a glycerine based soap or cream.  While this soap can be lathered on the face straight from the stick that seemed kind of awkward and messy for me because the whole stick got wet so I just cut a chunk off, put it into a shave bowl then lather my brush from there.  The price is great and the stick lasts a long time.  I award Arko all five stars, 4.5 for the soap&#x27;s overall quality and price and the remaining half star for the retro, swanky lathered-face guy on the wrapping.  In my opinion, Arko is definitely worth a try.  For ease of comparison, TOBS is the gold standard I judge other products to due to its feel, smell and value.  Arko, despite its wrapping and non-regal smell, shaves as good as anything I have ever used.  Enjoy, hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I discovered the shave stick method of shaving via a You Tube video and became a fan. This Arko brand has a old fashioned barber shop smell that I find pleasant. It is a very economical shaving method and one stick lasted me over a year. I do recommend you get a holder for your shave stick (West Coast Shaving $1.75) as this makes use easier and less messy. Try it. Like stepping back to a better, simpler time...and it is exotic, from Turkey.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, gentle and pleasant scent, LASTS FOREVER! If you&#x27;re into wet shaving or just starting out, Arko is a must-have in your lather soap collection. It&#x27;s very affordable and I use this as my &amp;#34;weekday&amp;#34; soap, while saving my Proraso for the weekend when I can take my time. Wet your face and neck with warm/hot water, &amp;#34;draw&amp;#34; on the soap as if it were a big crayon then use your brush to lather straight to the face! Can&#x27;t get any easier. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when I run out, which might be in another 8 months.</li>
    <li> This works up a good lather, and I&#x27;m still not halfway through the same bar after a year. I only shave once a week or so, but that&#x27;s a good value. The scent is very mild.</li>
    <li> Great classic scent. Great lather. You should purchase a stick tube. Try the Arko puck in the travel case if available.</li>
    <li> As I wrote in the Williams mug soap review, I have a pretty sensitive nose, so you might say that this is just me, but I actually could not try this product, because to me, it stank to high heaven!! and while with the william&#x27;s I managed to get past or around it, I couldn&#x27;t with this one...&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could have tried out how slick it was, but I slapped it back in the box instantly &amp; sent it back.</li>
    <li> My wife gave this to me for Christmas. I had never used a shaving soap stick, and was eager to give it a try. Holy cow, what a shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s Turkish, and so for some might have that exotic from-lands-afar attraction. The price might be a little high when compared to other soaps (it is an import, after all), but you get a goodly amount: 75g, as opposed to 50g with Williams and 42.5g with Burma-Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is soft enough to crush between your fingers, with a pleasant, if not spectacular, smell. It goes on smoothly, and when used with a brush it makes a thick, rich lather that my straight razor just glided through. It rinsed off cleanly, and left my face smooth, clean, and without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using other shaving soaps for years, and Arko just might become my new favorite! If you&#x27;re serious about shaving, or are looking to try something new, this soap is worth a look.</li>
    <li> Great bbs shave with no irritation!</li>
    <li> Good, basic soap.  Not much more to say, other than you use this style of soap to load your face, rather than making a lather in a cup and using your brush.  Just rub the soap stick against your wet skin/beard, then lather on your face with the brush.  No offensive fragrance either.</li>
    <li> Throw this in your dopp bag, smear on your wet, stubbly face, massage in with a badger brush and you&#x27;re golden!  No soap cake mess to deal with when your scuttle is at home!  Great scent, too!!!!</li>
    <li> I gave this product a Four star because I like it. I&#x27;m hesitant to give it a Five star because this is the first Shaving Soap I&#x27;ve ever used  or purchased before. (Aside from shaving creams in cans). You hardly need any soap on your brush to fabricate a good lather. So I&#x27;m assuming I won&#x27;t be purchasing another one at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to start wet shaving. It&#x27;s inexpensive, Smells great, shaves even better.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Great lather. Industry standard.</li>
    <li> Quick review. I like this soap stick for the smell , ease of use and price.&lt;br /&gt;To use this simply&lt;br /&gt;1.wet your face with very warm/hot water&lt;br /&gt;2. rub the end of the stick on the area you will be shaving&lt;br /&gt;3. lather up with a boars hair or similar brush&lt;br /&gt;4. enjoy the incredible lather as you shave effortlessly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like a Williams mug soap puck, sorta</li>
    <li> This is a man&#x27;s shaving soap. Lather&#x27;s great! Smells excellent. Doesn&#x27;t leave a perfumey smell. Love it!</li>
    <li> First, the shipping from this company was very fast and arrived before the expected date.  Kudos to them, especially since it&#x27;s not Prime.  As for the soap, it&#x27;s just ok. For reference, I use a DE Muhle razor with Feather blades.  If your biggest concern is price, this will serve you well as long as you have a shave brush. If you rub it on your face without lathering it with a brush, it&#x27;s way too thick and will build up heavily on your razor. With the lather and brush, it&#x27;s very smooth, but has an odd tingle to it; not a nice feeling that you would get from Menthol, but rather a very mild burning sensation that will stay with you for the rest of the day.  I must admit that I have very sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m definitely not used to my face feeling irritated all day.  This isn&#x27;t to say that it gave me razor burn, but it sure felt like it.  As for the smell, it&#x27;s pleasant, but it just smells like traditional soap. This is unfortunate, as other reviewers have noted, because one of the luxuries of DE wet shaving is having those really nice scents that add to the experience.  This will not give you that addition.  I could, however see this being nice for travel given that it&#x27;s a hard cream (it&#x27;s definitely not a hard soap).  The bottom line is this: I can see why people like it, I don&#x27;t mind the smell, it delivers a good shave with a smooth feel afterwards (likely because of the animal tallow), but due to the slight burn and simplicity of the product, I&#x27;d rather spend the extra few dollars on Proraso White or even a few more dollars on a D.R. Harris product.  Update as of 3/21/15: I forced myself to use this soap again and the more I use it, the more I like it. As I said above, the smell is average but once you learn how to use it, this soap will give you one of the best shaves available.   Here are a few tips:  Rub it on a wet face against the grain. You&#x27;ll begon to see a very slight white buildup. Stop. If you keep going, you&#x27;ll have used waaaaay too much and it&#x27;ll buildup like I described above. Now take a firm brush (I like a boars hair over badgers hair for this) and lather extensively on your face. You&#x27;ll notice a good buildup on your brush and face. Now do your normal shaving routine using the lather from your brush when needed.   You&#x27;re face will be baby butt smooth and soft. I also haven&#x27;t had any burning issues since so it may have been the blade. I don&#x27;t lnow.   I still only give it 4 stars because it just smells like traditional soap. If I could give it 4 and 3/4 I would.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap, strong lemony smell, unisex use. However, picture is misleading I thought I&#x27;m buying a box not just one stick. BTW, in any supermarket in Turkey it only cost a $1.00 per stick.</li>
    <li> One of the best bargains in wet shaving.  One of the easiest soaps to get a great lather with any brush.  It has great lubrication and cushioning.  You don&#x27;t have to use it as a stick- its soft enough that I had an old empty TOBS shave cream container and just squashed it into the bottom.  As many other have said the main differences of opinion re: this soap is the scent.  People describe the scent as ranging from urinal pucks to lemon pledge.  I think it smells most like lemon pledge and kind of like it.  I do feel like it is a bit drying compared to most quality soaps or creams, but it would only be an issue if you were starting with dry skin. Great traditional product.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality at a cheap price and long lasting; more than my money&#x27;s worth.  If you use this as it&#x27;s made to be used it will serve you well.  As you can see when you read the ingredients; it is not really scented so I didn&#x27;t expect it to be. What I wanted was an inexpensive shaving soap that produced long lasting lather, a high degree of &#x27;slickness&#x27; that lasts, and as many shaves as possible from each stick. This product exceeds that criteria several fold.&lt;br /&gt;This product is consistent from the first stick to the last. As a daily shaver with a medium/heavy beard and sensitive skin, each stick lasts me about a month. The price I paid for a box of 12 sticks makes each stick cost about 0.85 cents each so it&#x27;s costing me about .03 cents a shave. Not bad for a product that is better than any canned or bar shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used. There&#x27;s enough lather left on the brush of a quality to re-lather for a second shave when I finish the first and it&#x27;s the same quality lather as the first.  It produces a slicker, more comfortable shave than any product I&#x27;ve ever used. In short: I can&#x27;t find any fault with it.&lt;br /&gt;It was made to be used with a shaving brush. Do your typical prep: Wet and wash your face with hot water and soap, let the soap set for about a minute to soften the beard, rinse, then rub the stick all over your face, then use a wet brush and work up the lather on your face to the degree you want it.  Done.  Shave. It&#x27;s not a shaving mug re-fill, it is made to be worked into a lather with a brush after rubbing the stick on your face. (I use a circular motion in rubbing the stick all over my face to get the soap under the beard and stubble for a closer,slicker shave)If other experiments fail; it&#x27;s not the products fault.  It&#x27;s your money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shaving stick with a D/E razor, Trac II and a Schick Hydro 3 and it works great with all three, never clogs the Trac II or Hydro. Arko also makes a tube shave soap and it works the same as the stick. The stick is a better bargain to me.stick is a better bargain to me.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaving Soap. I use it everyday. I was using Proraso and came across the Arko brand and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Just rub the stick on your face lather up with a wet shaving brush and start shaving. Works Great.</li>
