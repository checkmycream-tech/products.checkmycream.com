    <li> Works great for itchy, watery eyes from allergies. Best I have found in the last few years.</li>
    <li> The best eye allergy relief!  Fast relief and much better than other brands.</li>
    <li> it works;  especially great this year with more pollen in air</li>
    <li> Recommended for Hubby by our eye doc. Hubby has allergies and these drops have brought him much needed relief.  He highly recommends these for allergy season!</li>
    <li> Best eyedrops I have used that aren&#x27;t over the counter</li>
    <li> Great for Eye Iritations</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this at a local pharmacy, but thought I&#x27;d see if Amazon has it.  Much to my amazement, I discovered this three-bottle package!  Even with shipping, it was a great deal.  I&#x27;m set for the rest of summer and Fall and into the winter, and you can bet I&#x27;ll be back to see if this deal will brighten my spring.</li>
    <li> Closest thing to the latest prescription eye drops.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that fixes the seasonal eye itchies. Nectar from the gods for my eyeballs! I don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> My eye doc told me to get this and it works very well for dry itchy eyes,Amazon has the best price</li>
    <li> Recommended by my eye doctor, these drops definitely help relieve seasonal allergy symptoms like itchy and goopy eyes.  I use at night only, although recommendation is twice per day.</li>
    <li> Zaditor sure helps get me through the allergy season. I only suffer from eye allergies and Zaditor takes away the urge to pull my eyeballs out and rinse them in a glass of water. For me Zaditor relieves the burning and itching. I&#x27;ve tried other eye allergy products and they don&#x27;t work as well as Zaditor does. The eyes drops act as a lubricant for me also.</li>
    <li> This eye drop is just OKAY. For me anyways. This was suggested  to me by my allergist  since I could not afford the prescription  ones he prescribed.  $80 after insurance. It burns real bad. Also I have to use 4 times a day</li>
    <li> While not 100% they helped a lot!</li>
    <li> Fast service and a great price!</li>
    <li> My husband loves these eye drops. Our optometrist recommended them for his itchy eyes after mowing the grass and he says it does the trick!</li>
