<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product!!!! Before using it my skin was dry,dull with acne.Now my skin feels clean, fresh and I have less acne than before.I am also using:&lt;br /&gt;Q*Lumiere Organic Day Cree&lt;br /&gt;Aqua*Tica Organic Botanical Night Cream&lt;br /&gt;I*Light Organic Advance Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment&lt;br /&gt;and C*Perfect Skin Organic Foaming Face Cleanser  witch I love too.My skin has improved 100%.</li>
    <li> I love this mask, after a week of using this you will see your skin more clear. I use this mask every other day during a week. You should apply this mask after you wash your face, I am telling you because it does not tell you.  Also some very helpful advice is to make sure you are using a facial cleanser you trust. A great test to do is after you wash your face get a cotton pad and toner and wipe your face, if you get alittle dirt change your cleanser, if you dont, keep the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I use this scrub mostly during my showers leaving it on my face for a few minutes, but also once a week on a clean dry face. I normally leave it for 20 min, and after wash it off lightly scrubbing the skin. Love the smell, natural ingredients and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Organic products that actually work are priceless.  This masque and scrub delivers your dull skin to beautiful moist in and youthful. I am 47 years young and love the results.  Working in Afghanistan takes a toll on your skin but this product keeps my skin moist and refreshed. Great product line and you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product! It is very gentle as it cleans and exfoliates, and the smell is wonderful! My skin feels clean, very smooth and has a healthy glow after I use it. The list of organic/natural ingredients in this product and the other Sweetsation products that I use is amazing. I eat healthy organic/natural foods, and I am very thankful to have found skincare products that contain healthy ingredients instead of chemicals. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This berry-delicious smelling mask looks and smells like a scrumptious dessert.  Don&#x27;t let it fool you though, it is really a delightful mask loaded with healthy antioxidants for your skin.  Sit back and relax in a bath and let this feed your face and your senses!  Read my complete review here:  [...]</li>
    <li> Amaziiiiiiiiiiing !!! Leave your skin very fresh and clean , it&#x27;s just so good and that smell is so yummy lol.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about sweetsation products. I purchased this scrub, the brightening toner, and the calendula cream and all of them are incredible. If you&#x27;re second guessing buying from sweetsation DON&#x27;T, it will be the best purchase you make for your skin. The scrub and toner in combination are just what my skin has been longing for. In just 1 week of using these products my skin feels smooth and any blemishes that I had are completely gone. When the products arrived there were 2 unexpected little surprises for me. A sample of the brightening cream and the night cream. Both are awesome and I will definitely be purchasing them to use as a moisturizer. The toner is so wonderful that when I placed my order the company emailed me that it was back ordered and I should receive it a week after the rest of my order. The customer service of this company is by far the best I have ever seen. They were kind enough to send me an email to let me know what was going on and also when they shipped the toner. I just mentioned that I wanted to try their cellulite scrub and whatta ya know they send me a sample with the toner. AMAZING customer service. Will definitely be purchasing from them again and again. : )</li>
    <li> Very very nice mask. After applying it over the face, your face glows much more. I love sweet sensation all products. Hey do great job.</li>
    <li> Mask/Scrub: Soft, refreshing, super clean, generous portion(long lasting-several months), silky feeling after rinseing, no drying effects what so ever, all healthy/natural product,that does what it says and I believe more.     I have been a big fan of the products offered by Sweetsation Therapy for a year now. When this scrub first came out I knew I would like it but I didn&#x27;t think I would love it as much as I do. The scrub comes in a generous portion that will obviously last for several months. A quarter size really will cover your entire face, although as a Mask I like to use a little more. As a mask, immedietly after applying it my face feels refreshed and it gets better the longer I keep it on. The feeling is amazing, the only words I can use to describe the effect is refreshingly amazing. As a scrub it works just as well, and after rinsing my face feels extremely soft and extrememly clean, just as the mask. The fact that there are no chemicals in this product is why I chose it, I really love the idea that I am using healthy products. This is a product I hope the company never gets rid of. I think it is impossible to be dissapointed with the scrub, and as I said the portion is super generous and there is no wasting money with this purchase. I can not tolerate chemical products, mainly all of those available at walmart or target and even department stores. For that reason I use all of sweetsation products for all my routine, daily needs. After a lot of research this company really has all natural, truly organic, safe, and healthy products. I highly recommend this scrub and I know that there will not be a person out there that will be dissapointed, I just don&#x27;t see how that is possible. Of course nothing is perect, but this product, I really cannot find any faults (and I always look for imperfection). All of sweetsation products I have a hard time finding anything negative to say, and that makes me truly happy. The customer service is so nice--if you have any questions you will get an immediate response, a response that is caring. The owner really cares and I only know one other business oner who cares as much as she does and is not out to make profits. This company and this scrub is amazing, don&#x27;t have any doubts, you will really enjoy the feeling and results.</li>
    <li> Love this light fruity scent and how this cools my skin when I wear it as a masque.</li>
    <li> When I get any items from this company for review, I tend to lose them quickly as the wife is waiting at my side when I open the box to quickly snatch it up.  Sure enough, she grabs this, quickly disappearing, giggling to herself and mumbling something about trying this out.  Most of the observations of the masque and scrub are hers.  What I did get to see of this was that this is a pink mud mask that smells a little like some type of fruit.  I am not crazy about the smell but I will say this smells better than her typical mud masks she has used, which frankly smell bad.  She, on the other hand, likes the berry smell.  I will give this company credit though, as all the products we have tried have had some unique flavors and smells that tend to smell better than other brands products.  In addition, the quality of the items, no matter what we have tried, has been good.  This scrub is good quality as well.  The cream has a nice consistency with a slight bit of exfoliator in it, which we believe is the walnut powder listed on the ingredients list.  We stay away from those products with plastic microbeads and as far as we can tell this has a natural exfoliator.  One small complaint are the instructions and ingredients list on the container is small print and hard to read.  She applies a small amount of this and leaves on for about 10 minutes and then rinses off.  The scrub/mask does a good job at cleaning the skin and pores and moisturizes her skin without drying out or irritating it.  So far with her initial uses, she is pleased with the item.  We will update the review with any long term use observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this in the mail today because the reviews were all so enticing.. I have mature skin, I am over 50 and my skin gets a bit dry. I had to say goodbye to the standard clay cleansing masks because they are just too drying for me. I tried this mask today after steaming for 6 minutes. The mask has a berry color and a smooth consistency with just a tiny bit of grainy-ness. It has a faint, very pleasant and even appetite stimulating scent... you almost want to try a bite. I applied a good amount, and waited about 7 minutes. During this time my skin felt tingly, cool and quite refreshed. I washed it off and noted my skin looked brighter and definetly felt very clean. It has been about 5 hours since mask, and my skin feels so moist and soft! I really like this product, I look forward to using it weekly. I recommend. Oh, and you get a good amount of it, too. I can see it lasting for a few weeks of regular use. So if you take that into consideration, along with the fact that it is organic and is going to be a bit more expensive, it is a pretty good value.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It is very effective in smoothing the dry, sometimes flaky areas of skin on my face. It is so moisturizing that I don&#x27;t feel like I need to apply face moisturizer after using it. I have mild rosacea and this scrub/masque does not irritate my skin at all. As an extra bonus, it highly moisturizes my hands (palms) during the scrubbing process. This is especially nice in the cold fall/winter months, when my hands get so chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product smells really good! I am very particular about scents, but find this one to be very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon my suggestion, my husband has even used this product, for occasional dry areas on his face. He has been happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. It appears I suffered an allergic reaction to this product. Does not feel refreshing. Glad that I did not buy more from this set. Label had numerous spelling and writing errors giving the impression of cheapness. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this scrub as part of my daily routine along with the Sweetsation foaming cleanser, toner and day crème. I love the fresh, smell and the clean, soft way my skin feels after use. I have seen an overall brightening and softening of my skin since using these products. I just ordered the nutriserum and can&#x27;t wait to add it to my regimen!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product on my blog too and I have to say this item is fantastic! I daresay I havent smelled anything better than this! The scent is lovely and the scrub-mask combo is really great for any skin type. It&#x27;s a natural product that will make your skin clean and soft. I have tried more Sweetsation and products from other brands too but this one is my favourite!</li>
    <li> The berry scrub is the best scrub  i ever use. Its light, smell like an icecream, very good moisturizer,after i use it my face is smooth and glowing!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I use it as a scrub and a masque all in one.  Refreshing and full of great ingredients.  My skin feels so refreshed after scrubbing it on and leaving it for 5 minutes.  I literally feel like it removes all the dead skin and leaves a beautiful glow, which is true to all Sweetsation products.</li>
    <li> I had stopped using this for a bit because it always makes me hungry, lol. I normally wash my face then exercise right after work and this was so distracting because it smells so amazing that it was making me want to eat before I exercised which means exercising is then out of the question.  I recently decided to use it again weekly. My face has been super dry for the past month and I&#x27;ve been playing around w/ what I already have. Just put it on this morning and followed up w/ the Cucumber moisturizer. It&#x27;s just what I needed. Hours later and my face feels amazing and very moist. I regret not getting back to using this regularly again sooner.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample with my first order. I was very pleased. It smells soooo wonderful. Its sweet and feels so nice on your skin. Does not feel harsh on my face.  I decided to buy a full size when I placed my second order along with another bottle of their moisturizer which I love.  This product comes with a little spoon and lid as to not get water in the jar. I appreciate that! Definitely feel like Im pampering myself when Im using this product. Thanks again. Cant wait to try your other items.</li>
    <li> This smells sooooooooo incredible!  I&#x27;m a sucker for scented bath products, and this one seriously smells beyond delicious.  I&#x27;d be sold just on that aspect, but it&#x27;s wonderful as a scrub and mask too.  Very gentle and leaves my skin feeling so fresh and so clean.  I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, but gentle scrub that I use twice a day.  It really cleans my skin thoroughly and leaves it fresh and clean feeling.  Very berry nice scent and ingredients!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews generally speaking, but I couldn&#x27;t resist due to the joy these products have brought to my life and the fact that all the company activities are founded and based in United States of America.  I turned 37 this year and my face was beginning to lose its glow...It was quite disappointing  giving that I exercise often and have a very active outdoor life style (as I live in a climate that reflects 75-85 degree weather all year round).  Not to mention, I only eat organic fruits and vegetables (no animals)... Thereby, the immediate results of life and glow I achieved from using a combination of sweesensations products over the past six months have been phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important factors about these products are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  All Natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Made, tested, Manufactured, Owned and Represented in the United States of America (Extremely, important when many jobs are going overseas.  This statement may sound weird from a person who currently resides overseas, as there was little to no career growth for me there in my home of the USA; so I had to outsource my skills.  Thereby, any chance I have to purchase and support American made products, I will)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Customer Service is beyond Excellent (I don&#x27;t like spending money where its not valued)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Shipping overseas is not a drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite Products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Very Berry face Scrub (Such an overwhelming joy to use)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Toner (the best toner ever used, clearly minimises pores)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Face Wash (lovely, simple and plentiful - will last for months on end)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Skin Brightener (Slow, safe and effective)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note I found using the products on my face have also brought a glow to my hands (I also use it on my neck and upper chest area : ) Thereby, they all glow together..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend</li>
    <li> This is another product that I really enjoy from Sweetsation Therapy (my absolute favorites are the YummiTummi Choc Butter, Sun-n-Berry Sunscreen SPF 50 and the ChocoButter Stick).  I have very dry and psoriasis/eczema prone skin, this scrub does not irritate my sensitive skin and it really is a very moisturizing scrub.  My dry skin doesnt necessarily NEED a moisturizer after using this scrub (I&#x27;m a fantatic about moisturizing so I will apply one anyway) and as a mask it&#x27;s really nice as well.  Skin definitely tingles a bit but not in an irritating way (like an acid exfoliator would) it&#x27;s very gentle, soothing and you really notice a smoothness in your skin.  I really like it, it&#x27;s organic, smells amazing with nothing on the label I can&#x27;t pronounce... just another winner.</li>
    <li> No more plastic for me. I&#x27;m done buying things in plastic. Plastic taints the products and the environment. I do LOVE that it is organic and free of gmo&#x27;s that&#x27;s a wonderful thing but can&#x27;t buy again because it is in plastic.</li>
    <li> I like this mask. Very gentle on my skin making it feel so soft. Smells nice, reminds me of something fruity.</li>
    <li> Cheap smell. Would not recommend !</li>
    <li> I think it just smell good. But for the result of mask......en.....just so so. After use it, I could not feel my face to be clean....</li>
    <li> Very*Berry Organic Oxygen Masque &amp; Scrub with Antioxidants,... is good but little bit expensive. i am enjoying it a lot.</li>
    <li> I really love this mask as it feels very gentle on the skin, is quite easy to remove and it really leaves your skin feeling invigorated and refreshed.  I had a cold for the past seven days and my skin was looking quite pale and ashen.  I used this a little more frequently and it really perked up my skin.  It actually helped the reddened area beneath my nose which was not looking too attractive.  I also love that samples are included with every order..which has proven to be quite dangerous as I think I want to order everything now. I have been looking to make the switch to 100% organic prodcts and I finally found my company. Superb customer service.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the scrub, and it made my skin feel very soft. Not too abrasive.</li>
    <li> At first when I got this product, I loved it. Now it sits almost full on my shelf. I should probably toss it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is - it smells great, it /feels/ great, but maybe I&#x27;m the odd one out. I bet it&#x27;s completely wonderful for famished and dry skin, but for Combination skin like I have... what happened is after I started using it it made the oil on my face worse. Whatever berries inside it are actually causing  an increased production of sebum, which worsens the problem. So it&#x27;s a warning to people with similar skin: it may make it worse. But other reviews discuss how well it works for them and their skin types, so I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t a bad product at all, and may just be a personal allergic reaction. It smells amazing. Pity I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> By far one of my fav products. It smells good enough to eat and leaves a shiny, clean and clear look after each use. I will NEVER stop using this product. sweetsations has the best service and products. Worth every penny..and I&#x27;m a penny pincher. Give them a try, let their products speak for themself.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and many others by sweetsation. This scrub/mask has tiny beads that are enough to exfoliate while being extremely delicate. After applying this miracle to my skin my face, neck and lips are amazingly soft and smooth! This product is part of my daily beauty routine along with their LaNouvel Cellular NutriSerum and Q&#x27;Lumiere Organic Day creme with Cucumber &amp; CoQ10. These products leave my skin feeling smooth and moisturized even if I miss a day or two of application. THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> like i wrote with a different product of the same brand, i didn&#x27;t see any effect from using this, whether good or bad. i&#x27;m sure it works well for some and not for others.</li>
    <li> I began using their I*Light eye cream and I now use their Hyaluronic serum and this scrub/mask, too.  I was hooked the first time I tried this!  I love beauty products and have tried a variety of masques and scrubs.  When I first tried this, I could tell instantly that there&#x27;s just something different that gives this product a boost above the rest.  If you are in a hurry, just use this as a scrub and it will leave your skin feeling clean and refreshed.  If you have the time, leave it on and it feels like you&#x27;ve just had a facial.  It&#x27;s a guarantee anyone will fall in love with this the first time they use it.  And it smells amazing!  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I think that the best thing this mask does is cleaning the pores. I do not use it for anything else but to clean my pores and reduce their size. It does a great job. It also smells really good and leaves your skin feeling velvety.</li>
    <li> The most amazing masque and scrub I have ever used. What stood out is that the smell is AMAZING, it made my skin really smooth and didn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> Scrub is excellent. Not only does it smell amazing but it has the right amount of exfoliation when you rub it on. I leave mine on for 30 min or so then rinse. Your face feels like glass after you dry. Incredible. You get a nice little glow as well. Large jar lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> The scrub is really good. It has brightened my face so nice and bright, I simply love it. Thanks Sweetsation.</li>
    <li> This facial scrub not only works great but it also smells great. My skin appears cleaner and brighter after using this product. The dead cells are scrubbed away leaving a younger and healthier face!</li>
    <li> I lije fruity smell n grains in mask work well for massage</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Very Berry Masque! I have purchased this 2 times now and I never want to be without it. I have noticed improvement in my skin-really does seem to be brighter and clearer. I have very sensitive skin, so was concerned when I first purchased. I am glad to say that I did not experience any irritation. I am a huge fan of Sweetsation now and although the masque is a bit pricey, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a month now, it smells delicious, but I cant really see the amazing results I thought I would get. I must say, your skin does look clearer and it has a slight glow after second use. But its ok. Probably wouldn&#x27;t re-buy.</li>
    <li> With all the glowing reviews I expected more. Smells gross and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate very well &amp; breaks me out in tiny red bumps every time I use it. Will stick with eminence dermafoliant.</li>
    <li> This mask was good. I expected a different consistency but it worked well regardless. The smell is not as delicious as it is made out to be, I personally think it smells like flintstones vitamins. However,  it does not overpower you when it is on your face. This took almost all of the redness out of my face. I tend to get red areas on my face due to acne medication and after 10 minutes of this being on, my skin was even colored.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! I like the versatility of using it as a scrub and a mask and it does make my skin feel softer and a little plumper. Other than that I don&#x27;t see any huge changes in the way my skins looks and feels. For that reason I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again. I can buy pretty inexpensive sample masks locally for when I want to pamper myself a little. It&#x27;s not making strides in my overall skincare goals so I wouldn&#x27;t pay the price for it again. Obviously if the organic and natural ingredients are something you look for exclusively this may still be a nice option for you.</li>
    <li> it was waste of money for me. my skin got irritated and covered with red itchy patches. used as directed. i love other sweetsation stuff, but unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I received this wonderful scrub as a sample when I placed an order with Sweetsation last month and also another one with my second order.  I love the way that my face feels after I apply it and my skin looks so clear and soft!  My husband, which never really notices these types of things, even told me tonight how smooth my face looked. :)  I love all of my Sweetsation Therapy&#x27;s products and the way that they have transformed my once dry skin into glowing, healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I like this product so much I bought 2 tubs of it.  I like it because it makes my skin super soft.  I don&#x27;t scrub with it however I do leave the mask on for at least 10+ minutes and then I wash off.  This is a good product!</li>
    <li> Very Berry Organic Oxygen Masque &amp; Scrub because it is the first thing I do in the mornings or one of the first things at night after taking off my makeup or to just clean my face. First I have to say this scrub really smelled good! It was kinda like alot of berries and yogurt all mixed together or at least that is what it smelled like to me. I found out that is also has Vitamin C and the Superberries in it which is a combination of 10 super berry/fruit ingrediants. This is like getting a great exfoliator and a masque (which cleans our pores &amp; draws out the impurities)in one jar! That is why it smelled the way it did when I first opened the jar. All of those vitamins and antioxidants will have your skin looking and feeling great in no time. A high content of Hyaluronic acid will put moisture back where it belongs, while Papaya and Pineapple help to slough off dead skin cells, reviling fresh rosy glow. Vitamin C will help repair and lighten up the sun damage and sun spots. And then the honey they put in helps protect the skin from the sun&#x27;s damaging rays. It helps to absorb impurities from the pores in the skin, making it an ideal cleansing agent and fighter against acne. It does not take much, about a quarter size to spread all over your face, please be careful around the eyes, and leave on for 5-10 minutes and then wash off and follow with your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This very berry mask and scrub is my all time favorite, my day isn&#x27;t complete without using this , it really makes my face and neck really look great , clean, fresh and glowing , I would definitely recommend this product to others, buy it guys u wouldn&#x27;t regret it. , thank u guys..... Hehheheheh</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! Very moisturizing, didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and it smells amazing! Used as mask and face wash.</li>
    <li> As a licensed esthetician I&#x27;m always searching for products to use and recommend. So grateful I came across Sweetsation skincare. This mask is one of my favs - It smells SOOO GOOD! The exfoliating part of the mask is amazing. Your skin feels so clean and smooth afterwards, it&#x27;s like getting a facial exfoliation treatment at the salon. What a great idea to combine the two.. So all you have to do is wash your face, apply the mask, gently rub it in, leave on for 5-10mins and wash off, moisturize and enjoy the beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;I barely ever brag about facial products, since there&#x27;s always something I don&#x27;t 100% love, but this company really stole my heart..</li>
    <li> After using this as a masque, i can feel and see the difference, my skin is smooth and soft and generally looks clean</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 1month and i must say i fell in love with Sweetsation products. This mask does it job wonderfully!!!!</li>
    <li> everything about this masque sounded good, from the components &amp; their actions, to the benefits &amp; the visible results. I liked reading it was charged with super berries, fruits, vitamins &amp; oxidants... that it worked by exfoliating, cleansing pores &amp; drawing out impurities... &amp; that it repaired &amp; protected from further sun damage. I mean, at that point I was like, who wouldn&#x27;t want to try this stuff?    what I didn&#x27;t know, or didn&#x27;t realize, was just how good it would smell - good enough to eat. sure, it states it&#x27;s full of berries, but DAMN! the aroma is addicting! &amp; what&#x27;s great about it? it&#x27;s NOT artifically scented. so here I am, slothing something so naturally sweetened onto my face - waiting for it to dry - &amp; looking forward to my next application, ALL at the same time!    furthermore, it FEELS like it&#x27;s really working. moments into the massage comes a slight cooling sensation - one not too strong, just noticable. that must be why it&#x27;s called an \\&quot;oxygen\\&quot; masque. then as it dries, you experience a very gentle tug. 10 to 15 minutes later you do the wash as directed, &amp; what follows is skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom! my favorite part? you can STILL smell the berries!    all in all, this VERY berry masque is VERY refreshing... &amp; the smell is, well, OMG, I think I&#x27;m in love!    the very berry organic oxygen masque &amp; scrub is, no doubt, one of the BEST skin care products I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of reviewing.</li>
    <li> Another great Sweetsations product!  What I love most about this product is that it makes your skin feel clean and refreshed, but leaves it moisturized instead of dry and red like so many other products do.  As always, a huge selling point for me, besides the fantastic, fresh scent, is that Sweetsations uses the best ingredients!</li>
    <li> Another super product from sweetsation. I am trying to keep away from all chemical laden products for a while now after I developed quite a few allergies. I sure was thankful to find the sunscreen SPF 50, another one of my favorites. Now this berry mask/scrub is so different. First, it has this berry wonderful smell. Then, there is this gentle exfoliator that gets the job done without irritating the skin, and finally the buttery, creamy texture makes your skin feel so soft and smooth that you don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer afterwards. Bottom line. I am very happy with my purchase and would certainly recommend this company and its products to everyone who wants the best for their skin without all the toxic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this creamy mask, it exfoliates and moisturizes, great skin cleanser! I&#x27;ve added it to my permanent routine along with sweetsations aquatica night cream. Part of me likes the scent and part of me thinks it smells like over ripened berries, but I will still continue to use it. One jar has lasted me over 6 months and I still have a quarter left, one of the big reasons why I have added it to my permanent beauty routine, a little scoop goes a long way. I love to lay in the bath with this mask on.</li>
    <li> I found the right scrub! I love the smell and the feeling after washing. I love it so far. I am an aesthetician.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mask from Sweetsation. Let me just start by saying that I have been using Sweetstation Therapy products now for about 6 months and I am in love with every single product I tried.&lt;br /&gt;The mask smells divine and makes my skin feels so refreshed and smooth after I use it. I usually try to use it once week and then I apply the toner and night cream. Since I started using the Sweetsation products my skin has improved so much. It is smoother, brighter and I don&#x27;t breakout at all anymore.</li>
    <li> This scrub is wonderful and never leaves the skin dry.. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this is an organic mask and scrub together and highly recommended.  Great smell and great results&lt;br /&gt;Filled with antioxidants that are great for the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the masque before and loved it so I knew I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. I havnt been using any facial products (just wash with water) for about a year now and I can tell my skin is in need of some TLC - hence why I returned to this amazing product.   I have super sensitive skin and have occasional dryness; therefore I need to watch what products I use. With the masque, the all natural ingredients put my mind to rest and I don&#x27;t need to worry about breaking out or getting irritated. My skin always feels soft and looks refined when using this product. I honestly don&#x27;t know why I stopped using it in the first place!   I rarely, if ever, write product reviews, but I love this product so much that it is well worth the small amount of time. I highly recommend the face masque combined with the cucumber moisturizer! Give it a try and you&#x27;ll never search for another product. I just wish they had a &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; type of masque - like a clay or peel one.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! Every time I use it, it feels like I&#x27;m bathing in berry garden heaven.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for organic, all natural scrub - look no further...this is IT.&lt;br /&gt;After using this Scrub my face feels moisturized, balanced, reborn and brightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it for yourself, you will be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best face scrub I have ever used. It has done wonders to improve my complexion and overall skin texture.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product, love it!!! I was looking for Organic Masque for my face with very sensitive skin, so when I saw VeryBerry I decided to try it....And I fall in Love with this one!! My skin is very sensitive and pale, so I need to be very gentle and careful. But this Masque and Scrub at the same time is always wonderful. Skin feels great, refreshed! And I love to use it at least once a week...Just put it on your face for 10 minutes, and it Smells like Heaven)))) Its really Very Berry!!! Wonderful and amazing product! It&#x27;s second time I order (2 of them this time), and will order this again and again! This is the ONLY masque and Scrub I am using for my face! Also love another product - Cellular NutriSerum, its perfect after the Masque!</li>
    <li> Completely and utterly ah-mazing!!! I cannot wait to try some of the other products! I have been using this mask for about 2.5 mos and love love it!! My pores from dry weather, lack of water intake, and previous smoker were in desperate need of some help.  My face has never been so happy... Pores smaller, moisture retention, no breakouts or oily skin later : )</li>
    <li> I sometimes break out in little bumps on my forehead a couple days after using this. Probably just bringing everything up to the surface before my skin freaks out. Smells delicious! And my skin feels so smooth right after using!</li>
    <li> This is actually 2 products in one it works really well as a exfoliator and scrub and smells great. you can also use it like a masque by leaving it on the face for a short time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very gentle yet will provide you with super berry antioxidants and a boost of vitamin C.It aslo has a list of ingredients in it a mile long and you can be sure that if its Sweetsation therapy its going to be awesome&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> it is like a spa treat in the bathtub. as I&#x27;ve gotten older my face has redness and I don&#x27;t like harsh exfoliants. This is actually super super gentle but it leaves my face very soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s benefiting my skin but it feels really really good.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, and this masque helped to moisturize my skin right away! It&#x27;s not too abrasive, and leaves your skin feeling nice and smooth. The exfoliation is very nice and gentle!</li>
    <li> I swear I notice a big difference in my face every time I use this. It smells delicious!!! And my skin is glowy for a day or two afterwards. Fantastic.</li>
    <li> This is a gift to your priceless face. After using this for 2 months (We uses it every fourth day) the skin feels more refreshing, younger, brighter and glowing. It has also reduced black spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like fruit and its very addictive. You will probably like to eat it as well and I mean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other pluses -&gt; completely natural (NO CHEMICAL), organic, full of Antioxidants (makes skin look younger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its worth a try at least and I will recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best dual purpose beauty products I have ever used!!  The exfoliant particles are plentiful and very fine which give a good, thorough scrub.  Afterwards, i leave it on for 5 minutes and rinse off.  My skin feels smooth and hydrated.  Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I like so much when I put the first time I saw the difference my face softer and more delicate, I recommend everybody to try on great cream.</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times. I discovered it when i was trying to find a solution to help my skin before my wedding. This stuff kept my skin soft, smooth, and helped reduce some of the red that always seems to hang around in my skin. I have recommended it to several friends and they have all loved it as well. I hope they never stop selling it. I have crazy sensitive skin and it has not caused one single problem. It is my go to solution for when my skin needs a little love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but my face looked and felt amazing after the first use. I did not get any breakouts from it, but it may be too soon to tell. The smell is ok, is not like a bath and body works scent but its nice. The consistency looks like yogurt. I was also sent two small samples of eye cream and a serum. Overall Im very happy with this purchase, I think the mask is great!! I definitely would recommend this mask. By the way I have combination skin with large pores that is prone to acne. I feel my pores look smaller and my skin so smooth and bright.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive combination skin and get break-out so easily from what I use.&lt;br /&gt;This is gentle but keeps my skin soft and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Even my aesthetician I see once a month says I have good regime to take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use C*Bella products only and this line is more economical than other organic products I bought from Wholefoods.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this one often enough because I forget but whenever I use it, I see my skin tone gets much clear and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I need to order another jar soon.</li>
    <li> I use this product twice a week (if I don&#x27;t forget).  Every time I feel my skin needs a boost and a good cleanse I turn to my Very Berry scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face first and then apply the scrub on my face and leave it there for the duration of my shower.  I start scrubbing right before I am out.  So it stays there for a while.  You may have a tingling feeling after a couple of minutes.  My skin is not very sensitive so I don&#x27;t mind but for sensitive skin ladies I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to leave it on for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After every use, my skin feels smooth and renewed.  I love this product and will be ordering more for myself and my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I must say that I am extremely happy with the results.This product is a great addition in helping me keep my skin exfoliated and radiant. I especially love the smell and the texture . It&#x27;s almost like scrubbing your face with berry flavored yogurt. A plus, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> What I love about this product is that it is a very good exfoliant and does not leave any residue behind. I like to put it on, massage and leave for a couple of minutes. The result is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Smooth texture and smells great! That is the fourth time I am purchasing this product. I have sent one to my mother as well as it makes  a wonderful gift. She loves it too and also my husband!  Very satisfied with purchase and recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The masque part is very nice but I feel that the scrub is made up of too large of pieces. I use it and like the feel after but only every couple of weeks to minimize the scratchy feel after.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a facial scrub that will really do what the manufacturer claims it would do. I have used other products that were not effective as were described. I used the very berry masque and scrub for a month plus and every time I apply it to my skin and wash off as directed,it feels soft and smooth. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to those who want to use an organic product.</li>
    <li> It smells so good, you want to eat it. Clean your skin so well, and make it so smooth. Not dry. Love this company. Shipping is fast. They also give gifts such as a bag and two more their products. Now I am going to get all my products from thrm.</li>
    <li> So i use this as a mask and the result is softer revived skin. My skin looks and feels so good after using this. It also comes in a good size jar for the money , will last for a long time. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I tried this a few times, and I fell in love with how convenient and how effective it is! This product smells good, like a bowl of berries and the scrub was great too! After using it, I noticed that my pores shrunk, and when I finished using this by washing it off, I also noticed that there was a kind of like film? Not a bad one, more like it was a lotion that was applied to my face, so that when I finished rinsing it off, it was super smooth and my skin felt hydrated! I liked how it did that, since I have dry skin, so it treats my skin well by doing that. The pore shrinking thing I noticed is immediate, because I use rosehip oil, but that can make my pores large sometimes, but when I use the scrub I don&#x27;t have to worry about that. It has shrunk the very next day I look in the mirror. Also, it is very convenient that I could also use this as a mask right after the scrub, because then I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting any other products on for the night. I love this product, and the size is big. You only need a little bit to spread the whole thing, so it actually is a generous size, and it will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> The Very Berry Scrub is only one of the many products I&#x27;ve tried from Sweetsation.  Previously, I was using PTR&#x27;s jojoba scrub with salysylic acid, but I felt that it was too harsh for my skin, and didn&#x27;t really seem to actually help stop any new acne from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first received a sample from the owner when I ordered 2 other products from the company, but didn&#x27;t use it until I went out of town for a couple days since the small container was perfect for travel.  That&#x27;s when I decided I would toss my PTR scrub and just order a full size container of the Very Berry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this scrub! It smells like chocolate and berries (exactly as it should) and the tiny beads help to scrub dead skin efficiently, but still gentle enough to use every other day since it contains no harsh chemicals (my absolute favorite thing about this line).  It leaves your skin feeling super smooth and has a beautiful scent afterwards.  I also use it as a mask about once a week, just to keep up with my regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the container about 2 months ago and I still have a little over half the jar left, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.  Although I haven&#x27;t fully won my battle with acne, I am slowly begininng to control it, and I think it&#x27;s in large due to Sweetsation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this line to anyone who is looking for a natural skin care regimen.  I think the products are suitable for all skin types.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this mask/scrub! It does a really good job of keeping my pores clean. I&#x27;ve also noticed the more I use it, the smaller my pores look, and it does not leave a residue after rinsing. I love the smell...so yummy! It&#x27;s now a staple in my &amp;#34;beauty arsenal&amp;#34;. With all the wonderful organic ingredients, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible!! My skin feels transformed after using it!! I will defiantly buy more from this company!!! You will feel and see immediately</li>
    <li> I must start off by saying i am a product-junkie. i have tried everything under the sun and haven&#x27;t found much that i adore. BUT I love this product! i&#x27;ve been using it religiously for about a week now. i look forward to everyday when i can put it on! it smells delicious and feels wonderful. It&#x27;s kind of like a whipped souffl&amp;eacute; and goes on very smoothly with fine granules for exfoliation. Not too abrasive though. I use it as a mask everyday for about 10 minutes or so. even when it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; it really has just soaked into my skin and i wash off the granules. my face has been so smooth lately and less breakouts! my skin tone has brightened significantly. i&#x27;ve been wearing WAY less makeup and it feels great. i will be trying their other products because this one rocked!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using some products from this company for over 6 months already.&lt;br /&gt; Despite of my long time skin problem like eczema, any products from &amp;#34;Sweetsation Therapy&amp;#34;  never irritates or have any rashes on my face.&lt;br /&gt; I really recommend this product and even other products, like daytime cream,sunscreen and nighttime cream...etc....even more...</li>
    <li> a scrub and a masque in one - love it!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m wary of what cleansers i use. after scouring amazon for the best organic treatments, this seemed a great bet. It is - so far, I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice (first jar lasted about 2 months). I use it on a daily basis, and will definitely order again!&lt;br /&gt;the scrub smells amazing - like a smoothie for your face. creamy, light and clears impurities gently &amp; effectively. my skin is soft, hydrated and radiant after using. while i also apply a light moisturizer after washing my face - out of habit &amp; because I live in the desert, i could probably skip that step if needed.&lt;br /&gt;thank you sweetsation! yay!</li>
    <li> Received shipment within 3 days. Absolutely wonderful organic oxygen masque and scrub product. Leaves skin soft and actually improved the look on my face, chest and neck. Would definitely recommend this product to others. Planning on trying other Sweetsation Therapy products.</li>
    <li> I love all sweetsation products. Yes, I&#x27;ve used them all.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin and dry skin and for that reason it is sensitive. I used and am still using some of conventional masks and the next day I have red breakouts here and there on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Never with Very Berry.&lt;br /&gt;Whenever my nose feel rough and those white head shows I use Very Berry mask and everytime It gives me the same glowing clean, smooth skin again.&lt;br /&gt;I only leave it for 5 min so a lot of times I use the mask in the morning right before putting the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;I try to use mostly organic make-ups and skin care products and Sweetsation is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;Hope more people know about this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I felt like my skin was clearer right away. Def will reorder this product. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gentle scrub to use on my face, and I was excited to find this product.  It can also be used as a mask, and it&#x27;s loaded with wonderful antioxidants.  Whenever I use this product, I exfoliate and then add a little extra to leave on as a mask for 10 minutes.  I can&#x27;t just rinse it right off...I want my skin to get the most out of the wonderful ingredients.  A little bit goes a long way, so this should last a while.  My face feels so soft and refreshed when I use it!  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  Exfoliation is an important part of any beauty routine, and then you can leave it on as a mask and let your skin soak up the natural antioxidants.  It&#x27;s a no brainer, and I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> To talk about this product, I must confess first that I’ve had hormonal problems since I was a teenager. This translates to years of taking medications, dealing with persistent acne and using a lot of skin care products. Unfortunately, I’m used to deal with these problems, but sometimes my skin is so affected that it looks dull, irritated, cracked and greasy at the same time. Whenever this happens, I’m not able to use anything on my skin as it gets worse; I just resign myself to wait a few weeks until my skin gets better by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, one day when I was looking for ‘something’ that could help my skin, I read some of the reviews other women gave to the Sweetsation Therapy products. As this is a natural, organic skincare line, I thought I should give it a try (after all, it could not make my skin look worse). Now that I’ve used this mask several times, I can say that this is the first time I use a product that makes my skin feel GOOD. By this I mean that, not only the surface looks softer. Beneath that, it FEELS better; healthier…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps other women who have similar skin problems as mine to give it a try. I’m glad I did.</li>
    <li> Really made a difference in my face after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it for my friends and everyone.</li>
    <li> I received a sample in my previous purchase of Sweetsation Therapy product.  Tried it and liked it.  Needless to say, ordered one in my second purchase, hope it not only smells great, but works on my skin.</li>
    <li> I was scared to try this since I have acne prone skin and my skin is sensitive.  NO problems here!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now with no issues.  Love how it makes my skin so soft afterwards and I feel refreshed.  Love the smell sooooooo much- I&#x27;ve caught my husband sneaking some while showering... even my 5 year old tells me I smell yummy.  I use this more for a mask than anything else.  It also helps me to destress since the smell is oh so good.  I plan on giving this as a gift to ALL the ladies on my list.  Can&#x27;t wait to try more stuff...</li>
    <li> Works pretty well so far , I like using organic stuff since other face washes with chemicals can dry out your skin and damage the top layer of skin. it makes my face tingle a little ^_^ it smells a little in a way . But worth it !</li>
    <li> So delicious you are tempted to eat it</li>
    <li> This product is something I don&#x27;t want to be without. I have a slight hyper-pigmentation on my forehead and cheeks,and with usage of this masque/scrub it gets lighter every time. It&#x27;s an excellent masque,and it smells wonderful,so relaxing. I highly recommend this product. Thank you</li>
    <li> Finally a facial product that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and leaves it soft. I use this product as a scrub or masque almost daily.  I&#x27;m also not having to use my Clarisonic as much.  Ditto to all the nice comments about this product.</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin feel after I use it, often scrubs don&#x27;t create a moistened feeling. Would highly recommend to others and also doesn&#x27;t cause my acne prone skin to break out. In fact, it works great after heavy work outs, to prevent any breakouts.</li>
    <li> I am a real fan of Sweetsation Therapy products and am always looking forward to new products from them because they work so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub has fine particles and my skin has a really good clean and feels really soft after using it. But the real bonus is that the scrub leaves my skin feeling very moisturised and my skin tone is visibly more even after just one use. And hence this scrub has become essential for me before big parties and events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is lovely. Like a berry burst. And as with all Sweetsation Therapy products, the product is very concentrated and lasts me for a long time.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this masque.</li>
    <li> I love sweetsation&#x27;s skin care line. This paticular scrub is great, it smells wonderful and it does not irritate my sensitive skin. I really like that all of there products are organic and natural. My skin tends to break out and my skin has never been better since i started using their line of products. I love it and i have been using for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I was asked if I would review this product in return for receiving complimentary product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you opened the contained it looked like a berry mousse and smelt great but it made me wonder how it would perform as a masque and scrub.  So myself and my two teenage daughters gave it a try. It wasn&#x27;t too grainy and didn&#x27;t feel like it was scraping my skin off like many other scrubs do. Afterwards my skin felt AMAZING! We kept using it throughout a few weeks and our skin really showed the difference, especially my daughters. Their skin glowed and cleared up. My skin looked like I had been away at a spa in the Bahamas on a month long vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say the only really bad thing about the product is that now I have to buy three bottles for each of us when we run out.</li>
