      <li>More like &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite go to eyebrow maker in my arsenal.</li>

      <li>I have better control when applying.</li>
      <li>i love it more then what i used to use.</li>
      <li>I love the tip of the marker.</li>
      <li>So to me its just ok.</li>

      <li>so I ordered one to see if I would be pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>It does a pretty good job of staying put.</li>
      <li>i have searched and searched and spent more money than i care to admit to find the perfect eyebrow pencil.  </li>
      <li>I thought because of the name that I would love this but found it to act just like the cheap dollar ones at Walmart.</li>
      <li>and you could easily get this at Walgreens.  </li>
      <li>The medium color looks great with my red hair.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great, otherwise, go buy local.</li>
      <li>Would be suited for warm-toned light to medium brunettes.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with NYX eyebrow marker the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I purchased several brands of Eyebrow Markers and NYX was by far the best.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and no weird smudges.</li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s a lot of product in the pen itself as it seems to run out quickly.  </li>
      <li>We had a very hot and humid summer, and throughout the summer, the marker stayed on.</li>
      <li>I have been looking  for a brow marker that works good for a long time, and this is it!</li>
      <li>Great product and lasted for half a year.</li>
      <li>came out with a kind of red tint to it.</li>
      <li>Drawing my eyebrows with a marker, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is a much better way to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is perfect for me as I am blind in one eye, and the fact that it rolls on smoothly and evenly is a boon for me.</li>
      <li>I have medium golden brown colored hair.  </li>
      <li>well, this is worth my time.  </li>
      <li>I like this kind of eyebrow marker, because it seems to last longer than pencil.</li>
      <li>When I first got it worked super.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a dark brown but more of a chestnut color</li>
      <li>color is right.  </li>
      <li>application is smooth (although i must say a steady hand will serve you well).  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to any one in dire need of having their eyebrow filled in, to touch up the color or even the shape.</li>
      <li>They go on with a really natural look and any mishaps are easy to wipe off.</li>
      <li>This is a great invention but knowing the amount of material or liquid left is a total guess...</li>
      <li>Wasnt sure what I was going to think about this product because I normally use a different brand, but this one was way my cost friendly...</li>
      <li>The color is exactly they said.</li>
      <li>Color is more reddish than deep brown.</li>
      <li>I hope they keep it in stock for i would like to buy more at a later date.</li>
      <li>First time I tried to apply this, it wouldn&#x27;t even go on.</li>
      <li>you first put it on</li>
      <li>This eyebrow marker help me to draw my eyebrow exactly.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.....</li>
      <li>Had tried a few other brow pens but this one is the BEST.</li>
      <li>It comes on light not thick and the color absorbs onto the skin making it look natural.</li>
      <li>tried to let it dry after one application, and apply more layers</li>
      <li>i have never written a review, despite the fact that i have always appreciated and in fact depend on those i read.  </li>
      <li>However, when I wash my face at night, it comes off readily.</li>
      <li>with a powdered eyebrow make up made my life so much easier.</li>
      <li>My long-lasting mascara lasts much longer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only liquid brow pencil I have ever found.  It is perfect for me as I am blind in one eye, and the fact that it rolls on smoothly and evenly is a boon for me.</li>
    <li> Applies evenly, but not nearly dark enough. Would be suited for warm-toned light to medium brunettes.</li>
    <li> The first one I sent back because I thought it was just defective, but, the second one was just as bad.  Don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s the biggest waste of money.  It doesn&#x27;t flow at all either time I used it.  I was really disappointed, I was expecting something spectacular. And now  I still haven&#x27;t replaced my brow pencil from Chanel and it&#x27;s getting short, guess I&#x27;ll have to fork out the big bucks.  Who says all cosmetics is the same.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading several good to excellent reviews. I was pretty disappointed after using it. My eyebrows looked completely drawn on (yes I know this is an eyebrow marker) and even after trying to blend I just was not satisfied. I&#x27;ve been doing my eyebrows for several years so I know every technique there is to know. This product just did not work well for the effect I desired. I do enjoy several other Nyx brand products so it&#x27;s not the brand itself, it&#x27;s just this particular product.</li>
    <li> Searched for an eyebrow marker like this long time, Finally found it and ordered 2 of it</li>
    <li> It seemingly is good for people who have allergies, but this is not the case for me.  I am not super sensitive in the sense that I get a rash from it, but oh my goodness within seconds of putting it on I am scratching at my eyebrows like crazy.  This happens each and every time I apply it.  So I am searching for a different product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a dark brown but more of a chestnut color and if it&#x27;s not put on in little strokes it looks almost purple.</li>
    <li> It goes on lighter then I expected. Wish it was darker and stayed on longer! So to me its just ok.</li>
    <li> I found it fairly easy to use small light strokes to color my eyebrows without smearing on my skin. The color works well for my dirty blonde hair and fair complexion. However, I did have hopes that this would last longer. However, when I wash my face at night, it comes off readily. My long-lasting mascara lasts much longer. So as nice as it is, I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a longer-term solution. I don&#x27;t want to have to touch up my eyebrows on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This is a great invention but knowing the amount of material or liquid left is a total guess...you see you will never know before hand when to order your next pen.  For example, i must have used it a total of 5-6 times and the liquid looks as if its on the verge of drying out, a mean i always made sure that the cap is securely place tightly but its in the manufacture hands to devise a plan on the amount of materiel or usage of the product.  However i love the staining power!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this kind of eyebrow marker, because it seems to last longer than pencil. But, its just too dang small for the money. I want something that&#x27;ll be around for more than a month.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Not too dark yet you can see it work! Will never go with out again. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best eyebrow liner I have ever used.  LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Wasnt sure what I was going to think about this product because I normally use a different brand, but this one was way my cost friendly... i love it more then what i used to use.</li>
    <li> Great product and lasted for half a year. The only issue is that sometimes the ink would leak into the cap and when it is applied, it leaves a much darker streak then expected.</li>
    <li> For a couple of years, I had been buying Laura Geller&#x27;s eyebrow marker, which set me back over $25 every time. The last straw was having to spend the money 2 months in a row because the marker didn&#x27;t last, and I&#x27;ve ALWAYS been careful to make sure the marker end pointed down (to keep it from drying up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short term solution: I went back to eyebrow pencils. Which looked okay, but I knew I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In July, I saw the reviews for the NYX eyebrow marker and decided to give it a try. I also decided to get the liquid sealer stuff to make the marker stay on for longer than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both worked extremely well. We had a very hot and humid summer, and throughout the summer, the marker stayed on. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the liquid sealer or what the reason was, but I was very pleased with the results. FWIW, I don&#x27;t have any eyebrows anymore, so drawing them in with a pencil makes them look very fake, and, um, pencilled in. Drawing my eyebrows with a marker, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is a much better way to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you can&#x27;t beat the price. So I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending this to any woman who has eyebrow issues.</li>
    <li> I workout a lot. Have been looking for waterproof makeup. I read the reviews and gave it a try. Was I wrong! I followed the other&#x27;s tips and applied on clean and dry eyebrows.  Went to the gym 30 minutes later, was using a white towel wiping my sweaty face, saw these orange reddish color left on the towel, was wondering where did it come from.  Went to the mirror, and saw these color was dripping from my eyebrows.  I was so embarrassed. Had to lower my head ran to the locker room and fix it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> The color is fine, but it&#x27;s so dried out, it&#x27;s impossible to apply.</li>
    <li> Very good for filler. I have tried other brush on applicators but this allows you to actually paint on hairs as if the real thing. Lasting and not blotchy.</li>
    <li> When I first got it worked super.  But it seems to have run out of product way too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of the NYX brand, I have a set of their lip pencils that I love!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok at coverage but honestly it doesn&#x27;t work like it should. :-/</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to apply, simple and not particularly health concerning ingredients.</li>
    <li> I purchased several brands of Eyebrow Markers and NYX was by far the best. It&#x27;s like painting in hairs.  It seems to stay fresher and last longer than others I&#x27;ve tried.  I will buy this one again!</li>
    <li> Good product.  My husband uses it to fill in sparse areas of his beard.  I use for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> These work great to help me fill in my brows.  They go on with a really natural look and any mishaps are easy to wipe off.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the color does not glide very well and so doesn&#x27;t show up as a &amp;#34;deep brown&amp;#34; at all. I like the retractable mechanism though. I&#x27;ll just have to give it away to one of my blonder friends!</li>
    <li> I used this product one day, and I was in the hot sun, and my eyebrows MELTED AND TURNED GREEN. Not impressed, use in room temperature.</li>
    <li> This NYX Eyebrow Marker has a very fine tip and works well.  The thicker pencil makes it easier to use.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.....great item!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  I&#x27;d buy it again in a darker color and use it as an eye liner</li>
    <li> well, I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t wear off or wipe away. This definitely works and the color is great when I put it on, but it does turn green with time, and for me, turned green after activity due to sweating. I am guessing it&#x27;s a chemical reaction between sweat and the product because ordinarily it&#x27;s brown for 6+ hours, however turns green over night. But with exercise it turned very green after just an hour . I will still use it and just beware of the green effect when considering a work out. Like anything, your skin could be different as we all have different pH levels . Many reviewers say they never experienced the green effect so, worth a try!</li>
    <li> I have used an eyebrow marker for some time now......have been using the Laura Geller one from QVC.  The price on this one got my attention so I ordered one to see if I would be pleased with it.  I was so pleased that I ordered another one to have in reserve.  The price for both of them was less than what one of Laura Geller&#x27;s would cost me.  That made me very happy!  The color of this marker is much better for me than the Geller marker....and so far I&#x27;ve had no problems with it becoming dry.  I store it in a vertical position so that may be helpful.  For the price this marker is very good.</li>
    <li> The marker barely worked when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to let it dry after one application, and apply more layers but it did absolutely nothing for me. I&#x27;m really disappointed. The colour is very very light. I wouldnt call it &amp;#34;deep brown&amp;#34;. More like &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this at all if you looking for something that will fill in or make your eyebrows more defined. I would just stick with ordering their brow pencil. This is the only product from this brand that I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Color is more reddish than deep brown. Once applied, it looks too pale too.</li>
    <li> I love the tip of the marker. it is the right size to go on ,not to wide. It is great.It goes on real smooth. I hope they keep it in stock for i would like to buy more at a later date.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> for as long as i have been buying things from amazon i have never written a review, despite the fact that i have always appreciated and in fact depend on those i read.  well, this is worth my time.  do not hesitiate to buy this.  i have searched and searched and spent more money than i care to admit to find the perfect eyebrow pencil.  voila!  color is right.  application is smooth (although i must say a steady hand will serve you well).  it stays on.  no mess.  no sharpening.  one handy tool to get the job done.  i am a very simple girl so i simply \\&quot;fill in the blanks.\\&quot;  i suppose you could get creative if you wanted.  finally...you know the feeling girls...finally, no more searching.</li>
    <li> I thought because of the name that I would love this but found it to act just like the cheap dollar ones at Walmart. every time I would try to use it I would have to go back over the sight several times because its like it wasnt getting any of the color onto the felt part so it was like a dried up marker.</li>
    <li> Had tried a few other brow pens but this one is the BEST. Got some on EBAY that were DRIED up. Will order more, Happy with all nyxx products.</li>
    <li> I, also, used to get my eyebrow marker from Laura Geller, sold by QVC.  It is at least twice the price there, and this product is equally as good if not better.  I like the dark brown color very much . . .when you first put it on it&#x27;s not that dark, but if you want it darker just let the first application dry a bit and add some more.  Very long wearing, I put it on and don&#x27;t worry about it all day.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants natural looking eyebrows at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Gosh, used only three times!  And now it is empty?  Not right, just plain wrong!</li>
    <li> Not as brown as I thought and you could easily get this at Walgreens.  Shipping took forever.  If you&#x27;re home bound it&#x27;s great, otherwise, go buy local.</li>
    <li> The black removal bezel rhinestones around the removable bezel rhinestones were lose when it arrived. The rose god removable was great. To late to send back to get in time. Here is my email address burns.lucretia@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> Great eyebrow marker, makes brows look real, not drawn like with a pencil. The ends of my brows are thin and this marker makes them match my fuller brows, it has staying power, looks real! I have tried pencils, powders and found this one to be the best for me!</li>
    <li> I have med.-dark brown hair. This blends perfectly on my eyebrows and I&#x27;m happy with the application/feel.</li>
    <li> This brow marker is excellent! It definitely lasts pretty much all day. You just have to apply it BEFORE your moisturizer. But it stopped working after about 3 uses. I even stored it upside from the day I opened it, but it didn&#x27;t matter. I just bought another from my local Ulta to see if that one will last longer as opposed to the one ordered here online. If not, I&#x27;ll be able to return it. Also I wish there was a shade darker than this to match me perfectly as it&#x27;s just a tad light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The markers purchased from my local Ulta have yet to dry out, so I suggest buying from a store like that that keeps fresh stock of this product to decrease your chances of getting an older product that may be drying out.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It fills in your sparse brows perfectly and stays on until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and no weird smudges. The medium color looks great with my red hair.  This is my favorite go to eyebrow maker in my arsenal.</li>
    <li> came out with a kind of red tint to it. kind of works, wish the tip was more fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but too dark and too brown for me.  Giving it to my cleaning woman.</li>
    <li> it is too harsh and it changing color, when I apply it is kind of brown but after it went dry is is like dark ash.. total disappointment..</li>
    <li> Make now mistake - this is a BROWN pen.  But even if you have black/dark eyebrows, it makes a nice base if you need something to last.  It does a pretty good job of staying put.</li>
    <li> Used to use Stila....this works just as good and goes on just as easy. Much less expensive than Stila or Makeup Forever.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow marker help me to draw my eyebrow exactly. The color is exactly they said. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not a good quality eyebrow marker, will not buy again...</li>
    <li> does not work well on oily skin</li>
    <li> First time I tried to apply this, it wouldn&#x27;t even go on. Awful waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have very sparse eyebrows, and as I&#x27;ve gone prematurely grey/white, my eyebrows have too.  It&#x27;s so annoying.  I&#x27;ve tried brow pencils, waxes, and powders and finally heard of brow markers.  They&#x27;re hard to find;  I&#x27;ve seen a couple prestige brands that are outrageously priced.  I have medium golden brown colored hair.  I use the deep color marker to &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; extra &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; using the finer point.  Then I use a lighter brown powder (Lorac) over the entire brow to add a little color and depth.  I then set them with a touch of wax to hold.  On the down-side, this product doesn&#x27;t have a lot of staying power.  I&#x27;ve noticed it fades as the day wears on and sometimes needs touch-ups.  Also, I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s a lot of product in the pen itself as it seems to run out quickly.  But for the price, I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible permanent brow done and every day I had to reshape my brow with eyebrow pencil. I fell in love with NYX eyebrow marker the first time I used it. It does not smear nor melt off my face like most eyebrow pencil. It comes on light not thick and the color absorbs onto the skin making it look natural. With it&#x27;s pointy tip you can&#x27;t go wrong defining that brow. I highly recommend this product to any one in dire need of having their eyebrow filled in, to touch up the color or even the shape. This is one of my must have all the time product that I can not go with out.</li>
    <li> Goes on like an eyeliner ,almost gives a painted on look. Health Magazine recommended it as great but I would say it&#x27;s just okay. Almost looks reddish brown in color which is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> This does not work it is all dried up, it will work for a second then stops. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product worked for a few days then turned my eyebrow area a weird greenish color!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutley love this. I have been looking  for a brow marker that works good for a long time, and this is it! Arrived on time. Ordered another one today!!</li>
    <li> Just wanted to let you know that I tried both shades of this, love the brush, ease of application, but by the end of&lt;br /&gt;the day I had green eyebrows, and the skin underneath was also green.  Must be something reacting with my skin, which&lt;br /&gt;was clean, dry and no cleansers, lotion, etc... under.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but the tip dries out easily after a few uses. I&#x27;ve come to realize that I like pencil more than I do felt tip.</li>
    <li> The dark brown is too light for my complexion but, it lasted longer than any other product I ever used before.</li>
    <li> Hardly ever do reviews but had to for this one. Product smeared and would not come out of dispenser. It dried within one week, waste of money.</li>
    <li> This goes on nice and easy. I have better control when applying. I would like to add, I have T zone oiliness. So, at the end of my day and it&#x27;s still there. This is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;This with a powdered eyebrow make up made my life so much easier.</li>
    <li> Seems like an expensive dry magic marker.  Would have given no stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This is an alright product- I use it in combo with the elf palette.  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The color is a watery medium brown.  I gave it to a family member as it does not work for dark brown hair.</li>
