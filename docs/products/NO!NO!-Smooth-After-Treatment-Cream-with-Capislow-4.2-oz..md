    <li> Love this stuff! Really works!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Works EXACTLY as expected.  Had my underarms waxed, applied the lotion daily and have not had to have them waxed again for more than 8 weeks. Not using this product meant a standing 6 wk appointment.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get it at first when I bought my nono. Then bought it on Amazon.  Only used it a short time, but it is a nice moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> There is something nicely different about this lotion. It is a must after using no no, especially on ths face!</li>
    <li> I did not keep my NoNo but I did keep this lotion. It really does make the hair not grow in so fast and when it does it is much sparser.</li>
    <li> as described and timely shipped</li>
    <li> Great for razor burn also.</li>
    <li> Had my doubts, but this stuff works!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> Use with NO NO after treatment.  Helps makes face feel cool and smooth.  Used up original treatment cream and this was much better&lt;br /&gt;price.</li>
    <li> It does slow hair growth some, great for after shaved areas, and smooths burns. I probably would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Good product, but the photo showed a tube.  I ordered several bottles and wanted one tube for travel, but I got another bottle.</li>
    <li> The No NO doesn&#x27;t seem to work as advertised. Have used it on my friend for almost a year now. Not any success. False advertising. would love to return for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I use this as needed to maintain. Find it helpful.</li>
    <li> As soon as I put this on my skin after using the nono, it instantly feels better and cooler.</li>
