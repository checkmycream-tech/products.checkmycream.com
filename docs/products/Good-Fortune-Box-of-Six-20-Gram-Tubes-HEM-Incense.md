      <li>Still waiting for my good fortune</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe I am saying this, but we DO think it deserves the name good fortune.</li>

      <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my buy.</li>
      <li>Still waiting on my good fortune lol, but it does smell clean.</li>
      <li>Omg this is my absolute favorite incense just ordered more it smells so good!</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because I like an earthier, spicier scent, but if you like a more &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; scent, you&#x27;ll probably like this just sfine.</li>
      <li>, it made me think of magic, and that disney cartoon &amp;#34;the sorcerer&#x27;s apprentice&amp;#34; (Mickey mouse).</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this incense.  </li>
      <li>Love the scent and how it lingers for a time after it burns out.</li>
      <li>enjoy it i will be ordering more because i love using it.</li>
      <li>I love it is great for get together and parties and social events</li>
      <li>Well, this scent is not the best smelling product made by HEM, so we decided we didn&#x27;t want to burn it in but one part of the house, placing it on the other side of the door in the front entry where the mail comes in.  </li>
      <li>Not bad at all!</li>
      <li>The incense was shipped and arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>This does have a strong fragrance</li>
      <li>I think this smell is very nice and not necessarily the Saturday Market hippy smell :)</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this product; its cheap</li>
      <li>The scent is medium strong and burns clean.</li>
      <li>Kind of like a unisex cologne but not over powerful just right fresh smelling!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I ever used this product, but I love.</li>
      <li>My family has had a considerably good year financially.</li>
      <li>It smells great and has a slight lingering fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>when you clean your house, the few days it smells good and clean.</li>
      <li>Seconds later the smell came and it smelt amazing</li>
      <li>Not great, not as good as the HEM Cedar incense, but nice.</li>
      <li>but I just make sure I light it in an open room or leave up high.</li>
      <li>try using it at a pirate event first.</li>
      <li>Will definitely order more when this is gone</li>
      <li>The gas you waste and the pollution you add to the environment make this a good purchase.  </li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>but I am enjoying this clean fresh scent in the mean time!</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m not rich yet, or even a little more flush, but the incense smells nice.</li>
      <li>I love this type and it is hard for me to drive around and find it.  </li>
      <li>Hard to say for sure</li>
      <li>it smells like a mix of nag champa, cologne, lemon, and a slight hint of super hit.</li>
      <li>It has a slight smell of men&#x27;s cologne at first, but that gives way to a richer smell.</li>

<li> Seems weird to say but it smells like a rich well designed men&#x27;s cologne to me.</li>
<li> The HEM&#x27;s money drawing incense has the same metallic, harsh scent.</li>
<li> Instead, they have a harsh, metallic smell to them which ruins my desire to use them at all.</li>
<li> At first when I got my package I opened it and smelt the box, the box smelt bad, so I opened the box and pulled out a tube, I grabbed a stick, lit it, and waited for the smell.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, it stinks, and I&#x27;m not the only one in the house who thinks so.</li>
<li> Sorry to be the only bad review</li>
<li> Bad batch?</li>

    <li> I love it is great for get together and parties and social events try using it at a pirate event first. enjoy it i will be ordering more because i love using it.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and how it lingers for a time after it burns out. It is destined to become one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m not rich yet, or even a little more flush, but the incense smells nice. Not great, not as good as the HEM Cedar incense, but nice.

    <li> Omg this is my absolute favorite incense just ordered more it smells so good! Kind of like a unisex cologne but not over powerful just right fresh smelling! I&#x27;m an incense a holic and trust me when I tell you this stuff is divine!</li>
    <li> Awesome scent, I love it</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this incense.  It smells great and has a slight lingering fragrance.  Will definitely order more when this is gone, the price was great, too.</li>
    <li> A great scent!  Not bad at all!</li>

    <li> This incense is great it smells like a mix of nag champa, cologne, lemon, and a slight hint of super hit. It comes in a box with 6 octagon incense tubes inside. Each tubes comes with 20 incense sticks. At first when I got my package I opened it and smelt the box, the box smelt bad, so I opened the box and pulled out a tube, I grabbed a stick, lit it, and waited for the smell. Seconds later the smell came and it smelt amazing, it made me think of magic, and that disney cartoon &amp;#34;the sorcerer&#x27;s apprentice&amp;#34; (Mickey mouse). The scent is medium strong and burns clean. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my buy. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Seems weird to say but it smells like a rich well designed men&#x27;s cologne to me. I get compliments on the smell of my apartment from everyone women and men a like. This does have a strong fragrance but I just make sure I light it in an open room or leave up high.</li>
    <li> Very NICE product. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> My family has had a considerably good year financially. Was it this incense? Hard to say for sure but I do feel like it has contributed.</li>
    <li> I love this type and it is hard for me to drive around and find it.  Sometimes I have gone to 4 or 5 stores looking for this or Dragon&#x27;s blood incense.  The gas you waste and the pollution you add to the environment make this a good purchase.  The order got to me before they said it would and it was fresh(had not been sitting ) .  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Still waiting for my good fortune haha but I am enjoying this clean fresh scent in the mean time!</li>
    <li> Based on the good reviews, I thought these would smell great. Instead, they have a harsh, metallic smell to them which ruins my desire to use them at all. Bad batch? The HEM&#x27;s money drawing incense has the same metallic, harsh scent. I wanted to like this product; its cheap and it might even bring good fortune(?). Unfortunately, it stinks, and I&#x27;m not the only one in the house who thinks so. Sorry to be the only bad review but oh well.</li>
    <li> We used it before leaving for Las Wages. My wife &amp; I came home winners! Was it the incense or did we just have some luck &amp; skill?</li>
    <li> The incense was shipped and arrived very quickly. Very good smell and burns excellent. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I think this smell is very nice and not necessarily the Saturday Market hippy smell :)</li>
    <li> Excellent scent. This is the first time I ever used this product, but I love. And, I  will purchase it again.</li>
