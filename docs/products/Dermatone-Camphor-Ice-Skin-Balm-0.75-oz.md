      <li>It is a fantastic product!</li>
      <li>I used to use this product many years ago when it was made by Vaseline.</li>
      <li>love it reliable as always</li>
      <li>But this skin balm was able to do what many prescribed ointments have not been able to do.</li>
      <li>I love it for a night time lip area balm.</li>
      <li>Its like lip balm for your chapped hands...Not greasy and easy to apply by rolling it on.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve used this Camphor Ice Balm  on my lips to prevent chapping since high school  - a good 50 years</li>

      <li>It took a couple days of constant use for it to really start to show the results but it works great...</li>

      <li>exactly what my mom used 20 years ago</li>
      <li>Heals cracked skin fast!</li>
      <li>It is perfect for snowy cold days or bed time.</li>
      <li>Its basically used for spot treatments of really chapped skin..</li>
      <li>/&gt;during the day. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s much better than any other lip product I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Used it a few times so far, and its looking good, like the old stuff.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s consulted her doctor and tried so many different products, but this is the only thing that she says works for her.  </li>
      <li>Top lip gets a little swollen reddish, prickly feeling and chapped the bottom lip somewhat also.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...</li>
      <li>Keep stick clear of germs.</li>
      <li>I am now 62 years old.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only one that really works for me</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 90 year old Mom who uses it on her cracked fingers.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I have used the intensive neova lip repair for my lips, that worked, but be prepared for your lips to feel worse before they get better.</li>

<li> Some things are useless, they dry them more.</li>
<li> long time ago.  </li>
<li> in the winter, her fingers get so dry that the skin cracks and bleeds.  </li>
<li> Just like Eucerin cures cracked dry skin, hands, fingers, Camphor Ice cures chapped, cracked lips and mouth.</li>
<li> She puts it on and says within seconds the pain subsides and after using a few days the skin softens enough to heal.  </li>
<li> Not meant to go over make up as it is heavy, not really made for day time use as lip balms today.</li>
<li> It stays on my lips longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
<li> My husband used this years ago and for a long time we have been unable to find it locally.  </li>
<li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.  </li>
<li> Have used this product for years to heal small cuts, skinned areas and bites.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if the wrong item was sent as they both look alike.</li>
<li> Caution to not use directly on cold sores as you would re infect yourself.  </li>
<li> I am shocked.</li>
<li> I was disappointed it did nothing for my lips.</li>
<li> Heals the worst chapped skin almost overnight.  </li>

    <li> exactly what my mom used 20 years ago</li>
    <li> Works well for my deep chapped skin...Its like lip balm for your chapped hands...Not greasy and easy to apply by rolling it on. It took a couple days of constant use for it to really start to show the results but it works great...Its basically used for spot treatments of really chapped skin..I use it in concert with a great lotion to keep my hands moisturized during the winter months when I wash my hands all the time.</li>
    <li> great for chapped lips great for dry skin and  eczema</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!  Heals the worst chapped skin almost overnight.  Discovered this about 10 years ago and keep it on hand for necessity when colds happen.  Caution to not use directly on cold sores as you would re infect yourself.  Apply to clean area or use Q tip or cotton swab otherwise.  Keep stick clear of germs.</li>
    <li> best ever, without compare. accept no substitutes.  ever</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. Been using it since my grandfather recommend it years ago. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great on dry and cracked &amp;#34;winter hands&amp;#34;.  My husband used this years ago and for a long time we have been unable to find it locally.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon.  It does not leave a greasy feel on hands, absorbs quickly, and does a great job healing roughness and tiny weather related cracks on hands.</li>
    <li> Great product! Heals cracked skin fast! It&#x27;s the only one that really works for me</li>
    <li> This product was referred to me by my sister in law. It is a fantastic product! My son had a habit of licking his lips in the winter and ends up with a &amp;#34;red ring&amp;#34; around his mouth. Just after 2 uses it cleared up.</li>
    <li> I bought these to refill my antique Vaseline Lip Balm tins. I haven&#x27;t done it yet... but should be awesome.. old tins.. new product inside! Perfect!!</li>
    <li> best treatment for chapped hands</li>
    <li> I cannot get through life without this product which I have been buying since I was a teenager and it cost 25 cents.  I am now 62 years old.  My lips would be chapped and cracked without it.  My grandfather used this product as well.  It must be a heredity thing.  Please don&#x27;t stop making camphor ice.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this Camphor Ice Balm  on my lips to prevent chapping since high school  - a good 50 years</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 90 year old Mom who uses it on her cracked fingers.  in the winter, her fingers get so dry that the skin cracks and bleeds.  She&#x27;s consulted her doctor and tried so many different products, but this is the only thing that she says works for her.  She puts it on and says within seconds the pain subsides and after using a few days the skin softens enough to heal.  She used to buy it over the counter in that pharmacy, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years to heal small cuts, skinned areas and bites.</li>
    <li> My grandmother used to use Camphor Ice always; so I thought I&#x27;d see if it was still around. My lips have been bugging me for&lt;br /&gt;several yrs. now off and on over and over.Top lip gets a little swollen reddish, prickly feeling and chapped the bottom lip somewhat also.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...they have been great ever sense I started using this product. Coat your lips when you go to bed; and a couple of times&lt;br /&gt;during the day. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s much better than any other lip product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried a lot...of them too!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for my lips, I have severe psoriasis on my lips. I was disappointed it did nothing for my lips. I have used the intensive neova lip repair for my lips, that worked, but be prepared for your lips to feel worse before they get better. But I did give this 5 stars for my hand. I had psoriasis on my finger for the last 20 years of my life, have been prescribed many ointments along with some expensive dertmatologist visits. But this skin balm was able to do what many prescribed ointments have not been able to do. My hand has never looked this great. It takes some weeks for it to heal, but my hand is actually healing. I am shocked.</li>
    <li> If you have chapped lips, this is the product you need - PERIOD.  I have used for decades, don&#x27;t know of anything else like it.  It CURES, not just moistens when you have it on like chapstick.  Just like Eucerin cures cracked dry skin, hands, fingers, Camphor Ice cures chapped, cracked lips and mouth.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for 30 years do I need to say more!</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered camphor ice skin balm, but this is derma tone sun block in the same blue tube. Not the same item at all. I don&#x27;t know if the wrong item was sent as they both look alike.</li>
    <li> I have been using Camphor Ice since I was a child...long time ago.  It was originally made by Ponds I think.  I love it for a night time lip area balm. Not meant to go over make up as it is heavy, not really made for day time use as lip balms today. It is perfect for snowy cold days or bed time.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried everything for chapped lips. Some things are useless, they dry them more. Some of the Blistex and Chap-Stick products do work. But this works better. It is more solid so it does not evaporate quickly. Virtually no scent. Dermatone appears to be the only company still making this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using camphor ice to prevent chapped lips for 50 years.  When it was no longer made by Vaseline or Chesebrough Ponds, I was dismayed!  So I&#x27;m glad Dermatone now has it.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm made, I think. It stays on my lips longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.  MY POP NEVER WENT ANYWHERE WITHOUT HIS&lt;br /&gt;TIN TUBE OF CAMPHOR ICE AND NEITHER DO I.</li>
    <li> love it reliable as always</li>
    <li> I used to use this product many years ago when it was made by Vaseline. But I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere at the stores. So, I goggled it and found out it was now made by Dermatone. Used it a few times so far, and its looking good, like the old stuff.</li>
    <li> My parents use to bring this home from Florida every year because you couldn&#x27;t buy it around here. So happy we have Amazon to buy it from now. Works great!</li>
