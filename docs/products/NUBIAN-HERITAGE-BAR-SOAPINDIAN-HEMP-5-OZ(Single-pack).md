    <li> If you want a soap that enriches your skin with healthy moisture, smells great, and DOESN&#x27;T melt in your shower these are the soaps for you.  All of the soaps have a shea butter base that is great for your skin.  My wife and I like a light exfolient in our soap and have found Indian Hemp and there Olive Oil with tea leaf soaps to be our favorites.  We both use.  The aroma is very nice but natural enough for a man or woman.  They have many other great &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; for one or the other sex.</li>

It&#x27;s now the only bar soap we use in the house.</li>
