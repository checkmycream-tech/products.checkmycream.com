<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If I could only take one toiletry item on a trip, it would be a bar of this soap.  The lather is rich and feels amazing.  The scent is great for a little pick-me-up.  Not too much essential oil to cause skin or respiratory irritation.  Don&#x27;t even have to bother with lotion because this soap doesn&#x27;t dry like commercial soaps.</li>
    <li> Lovely castille soap. The intense peppermint smell may be too much depending on how much you like peppermint.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The smell is invigorating.</li>
    <li> love this soap always uses only liquid &amp; a friend told me she loved the bars &amp; I bought from here us both some, love them</li>
    <li> I never thought I would buy &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; type soap.  But I bought this on the sworn recommendation of a friend and haven&#x27;t looked back since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this soap.  Leaves a clean feeling and scent.  Maybe 1.5 times as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip though, these were not meant for your face or eyes.  They are great on your body, especially in the nether regions, but they are a bit too strong for your face/eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap for sensitive skin, no reaction.  I wish the price was more reasonable.  Would love to pick up lots of soap on a deal because I believe this is THE soap for me.</li>
    <li> The best!&lt;br /&gt;Does dry out skin a bit</li>
    <li> Can leave your skin a little dry but this is the best soap out there.I also use it to shave.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap. I found it at Target a while ago and although it was very expensive there (about $5 a bar), I scooped up three and couldn&#x27;t wait to get back to campus to take a shower. Right away I knew I would love the scent- it&#x27;s a luxuriously calming peppermint scent that just smells natural and fresh. I was drawn to it immediately. I love the fact that the soap is vegan and the company does not test on animals. All of their products are great but this bar soap really takes the cake. It lathers very well and my skin always feels clean, refreshed, and smooth after I use it. I&#x27;ve found better deals at places other than Target (like at Trader Joe&#x27;s for example, where it sells for about $2 a bar), but would love to order from Amazon. Anyone who still insists brands like Dove or Irish Spring are worth washing their skin with should use Bronner&#x27;s soaps. Also, they got a wonderfully low score on cosmeticdatabase.com! Overall, I love this soap and it is very much worth a try. :&gt;</li>
    <li> As expected, this product is great. The scent is nice, yet subtle and not overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like your standard bar soaps do and best of all it&#x27;s as natural as you can get.</li>
    <li> Peppermint smells excellent, the bar produces a creamy lather very quickly and rinses off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use Bronners to make vegan detergent with washing soda and borax! All natural and 100% vegan!</li>
    <li> Been usin&#x27; this stuff since my hippie days! Oh, wait! They&#x27;re not over with yet! Ye-ha!</li>
    <li> We use this soap for both making laundry detergent and on ourselves.  Our family is allergic to heavy perfumes, dyes, and chemicals.  We have never had a problem with allergic reactions since switching to this soap.  This is my go-to soap.  Love it and will use it always.</li>
    <li> I am a lover of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid peppermint soap but do not love the bar.  The lather was not as rich and the scent was much milder than I was used to.  I will not re-purchase the bar soap.  I can suggest this to those who found the liquid soap too strong.</li>
    <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  She loved it and so did I.  It does not dry out your skin and it cleans thoroughly.  It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy from companies that test on animals so it leaves me limited since SO many companies test on animals. I thought I&#x27;d give Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap a try because I&#x27;ve heard how great their products are and I am a fan! It works well and it lasts a long time. Great product and I love that it&#x27;s good for the environment and for me! Give it a try. You&#x27;ll agree with me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for a couple of years now.  It has a great scent.  Right size for the hands.  The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as some soaps.  Overall, I recommend it and will continue buying.</li>
    <li> While I love that this product is eco and animal friendly, this is NOT for ladies that might have sensitive skin or are prone to imbalance \\&quot;down there\\&quot;.  The stuff is way harsh and can mess up your sensitve balance even if not used directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a warning to all the Ladies. I&#x27;ve found soaps like Aubrey Organics Herbal Liquid Everyday Body Soap are a much better alternative.</li>
    <li> I love all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap scents, this one included.  Really great for the morning because the peppermint makes your skin tingle and makes your shower that much more eye opening.  A word of caution, awesome in the summer, but makes me too cold in the winter!  Suds well, smells awesome, doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. The bars are large and rectangular so they are easy to grip. They&#x27;re also bigger than I expected, so a single bar will last me nearly a month even when showering 1-2 times per day and not substituting it with any body wash or whatever. I&#x27;ve only tried two flavors so far, but both have been lovely. The peppermint produces a wonderful &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation on more sensitive areas like the face and around your eyes. Some folks may not like that, but I find it to be super refreshing, and taking a few breaths with the soap lathered on your face is a great way to clear your sinuses. The citrus scent will leave you smelling like an orange Popsicle, which is a huge plus. Overall this has become the only soap I use in my shower and I don&#x27;t plan on changing to another brand, I still have a lot of scents to try out.</li>
    <li> nice smell and doesnt dry out skin</li>
    <li> Love this soap. I buy it all the time and will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I love the peppermint scent!  If i had to pick one soap for the rest of my life this would be it.</li>
    <li> Been using this soap for years.  Very good product.  The price is getting a bit high but worth the extra bucks &amp;#34;now&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a normal guy with normal skin and grew up using Ivory soap.  We were visiting friends and they had this soap and I really liked the smell and the way it lathered so we bought some.  I&#x27;ve found it last longer than a bar of Ivory and my wife says it doesn&#x27;t dry her out like Ivory would in the dry winter.  I just like the smell and it gets me clean.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I refreshing smell is wonderful. Castile soaps are naturally anti-bacterial. I have been using Dr. Bonner products for years and so far this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Since I discovered Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps, it&#x27;s become the only soap I imagine I&#x27;ll ever use again! I appreciate the philosophy and business practices of the company. But the products themselves are wonderful. The pure castile soap is fairly long lasting, has a wonderful peppermint aroma that wakes me up in the morning and is also very stimulating to the skin. It rinses off seemingly without leaving any residue and my skin feels squeaky clean but without chemical harshness or stripping natural oils. If you&#x27;ve never tried these soaps, do yourself a favor and buy a bar. I buy the six packs now so I don&#x27;t get caught in short supply.</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells clean, lathers exceptionally well, and is clearing my skin. It&#x27;s not a harsh peppermint but you do feel a cooling effect when you get out of the shower. Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out like most bar soaps do. I was using Burt&#x27;s bees soap for men, but I feel like this is a much better clean. I&#x27;m converted and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be willing to try anything else for a long time. It is that good. I&#x27;m finding that one bar lasts me about 2 weeks using it twice a day. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soap!  Can be drying, but since I slather on the lotion after showering I havn&#x27;t had too many issues with the dry skin.  When you first start using it, be aware, it can be very...ummm...invigorating...on your lady parts.</li>
    <li> Cleans like a wonder.  Smells great.  Our family has used Dr B&#x27;s soap, in one form or another, for about 10 years though it has been on the market since the 60s (?).  The 6 pack available on Amazon is a good value.</li>
    <li> I have tried millions of natural soaps, most of which are OKAY. But Bronner&#x27;s has something that most other soaps dont, it stays extremely sudsy and soapy down to the last bit. It lathers very well, has a nice scent, and cleans skin wonderfully. I recommend the peppermint or baby soap. Definitely worth the money. Be kind to your skin and use organic soap. NO SLS!!</li>
    <li> Bronners makes wonderful soap.  You don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re washing yourself in a chemical bath when showering like the off-the-rack supermarket soaps.  You feel clean and good after using them.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous different smells, I like the peppermint but they the lavender is also nice.  Nice to buy them in a six pack from Amazon.com to save money.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This little bar of soap is pepperminty-fantastic.  It smells great, and it seems to keep the mosquitos away more effectively than other soaps (believe it or not).  Still - for you ladies - it makes your privates tingle.  That can certainly be great in some instances, but in this one, it just make you feel the need to go to the bathroom more often.  So - now I&#x27;m a two soap household.  The Dr. Bronner for all my non-lady-bits.  Know what I mean?</li>
    <li> Use it as my shampoo. Lasts a long time and no plastic bottle. I use it with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s conditioner or ACV.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap from Whole Foods since I have extremely dry skin &amp; prone to eczema outbreaks.  I have the liquid almond and the peppermint bar.  I was a little skeptical about using the peppermint on my sensitive skin.  Overall, I&#x27;m impressed, there was tons of lather.  The soap rinsed very cleanly.  I do have a water softener so I will give some credit to it for helping with my dry skin.  I have just one minor hang up with this soap, it did cause a slight tingle with my lady parts.  I did like the slight tingle except in the the southern region.  Overall, I give four stars because of the tingle, but I really love this soap.  I didn&#x27;t have an issue with the soap melting too quickly but my bar was incredibly hard.  I even bought another brand of castile liquid soap \\&quot;kiss my face\\&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t come close to this one.  Hopefully, it doesn&#x27;t get too expensive.</li>
    <li> Always great soaps as i have purchased this many times. Expensive but so good as i am hooked</li>
    <li> My 93 year old mother loves this soap.  Bought this for her for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Great for people with sensitive skin.  No itchiness or irritation from chemicals.</li>
    <li> Our whole household loves this soap. It leaves your skin feeling less dry and the peppermint brand has a soft tingle to it that just feels nice. We refuse to use any other kind of bar soap.</li>
    <li> Combined with removing dairy from my diet, this stuff actually did change me from an acne ridden teen to someone with almost flawless skin. I recommend it to anyone, but especially those trying to get rid of acne.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite soap. It smells really good, and is real soap, not a \\&quot;body bar\\&quot; or beauty bar\\&quot; You cant hardly find real soap in a grocery store anymore. It does not have the usual junk found in most bars these days. It is well worth the $10 or so a month I spend on it, I plan to use this soap for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I use it for everything in the shower. Face, body, hair. It&#x27;s got a fresh feeling as its peppermint and as such, kind of mentholated. Love it!</li>
    <li> Always the best soaps!</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner works miracles, his products are top notch. I used this product in a liquid form years ago, and then sort of forgot about it. Then on a fishing trip to Alaska I saw the guides on several boats we fished from using it to clean their hands and knives after cleaning fish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works around the house as well as on a boat. The smell is pleasant and leaves you feeling great.</li>
    <li> The only soap I use. I love this soap</li>
    <li> Great Products ! Actually Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is supporting non GMO and price is reasonable. As I use this for body and face, its great!!</li>
    <li> Feels good. Dont know if it takes all the oil out of your skin&lt;br /&gt;Still use regular soap on tough areas.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great. Doesnt leave the smell on your skin&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt dry you out</li>
    <li> Smells great, it&#x27;s pure and it makes my skin really soft. Because it has real peppermint oil in it, it leaves a cold sensation on your skin while your using it but I like it. Makes me feel awake and rejuvenated! Oh and the bars are huge compared to other brands of bar soap which of course is a big plus! Wish I would of found these products sooner, I plan on using them for a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bar soap at walgreens for only 2 bucks and I do not regret it one bit! I used it once and noticed a huge difference the next day with my acne and blemishes that were on my face, I am acne-prone so having a good but gentle soap helps tremendously! I have been searching years and been through tons of products and have finally found something that works! Thank God for the genius who created this soap! Definitely worth purchasing! :)</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and is all natural. The peppermint is my favorite. Leaves a nice tingly feeling on your skin after showering. I love this soap so much, that I buy it in bulk.</li>
    <li> This is good for all skin types, gets the job done, safe, I would recommend.  They have all different scent and types too!</li>
    <li> This is a great soap product, if a bit highly priced. Buying it in bulk packs of 6 to 10 bars helps with the overall price. Peppermint is the best.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin but I have always been able to use Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soaps because they use natural ingredients and extracts. In a pinch if you are traveling it can cover all your soap needs and you can even use it in your hair if you need too. Great product, I have used it for a long time and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I wanted a natural soap since I&#x27;m tired of exposing myself to a bunch of chemicals. Saw this and decided to try. Smells nice and minty but not too strong. First time I used it, saw what people meant about it burning sensitive areas a bit, but with subsequent uses it happens less and less.&lt;br /&gt;Now  love it and the lather and the way it leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.</li>
    <li> Umm...is anyone really on the fence regarding this product? Seems like if you&#x27;ve already made it this far, you&#x27;re pretty much gonna buy this amazing soap, and are just looking for validation from like-minded folks. Well, consider yourself validated, as this stuff is really, really bad. And by &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; I mean &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;, as the kids today are so fond of saying. And hey: The children are the future. Or so Dionne Warwick once told me.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Takes only a little soap to develop a great lather.  The peppermint scent is refreshing!  No film left behind after rinsing soap off.  No dry feeling either. This is amazing soap!</li>
    <li> I was always a fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps 18-In-1 Pure-Castile Soap, Hemp Peppermint, but don&#x27;t like bath sponges or loofa&#x27;s so I ordered this and love it.</li>
    <li> The peppermint is a great fragrance for the skin. It is subtle yet refreshing. It makes my bathroom smell great after my shower too.</li>
    <li> My wife and I just started using this soap a little over a month and a half ago, and by far, is the best soap we have used! We don&#x27;t have to worry about what goes into our skin with this soap because it is all natural.  I use Dr. Bronners soap for not only washing my skin and hair, BUT, I use it to shave my face with! YES, you can do that! It does not leave my face irritated at all!  My wife uses it to shave her legs with.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Cleans my body, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin, like the peppermint feeling, and like that it&#x27;s all organic.      Cons:  Price...but a bar does seem to last a pretty long time.  I guess I wonder why Dove, or the other soap companies don&#x27;t copy and mass produce a soap like this...</li>
    <li> Love this soap, when you first open a bar it can be rather strong smelling, but after a day or so of being open it calms down and doesn&#x27;t overpower a room.</li>
    <li> This soap is so good that I literally burst into tears as soon as the suds hit my body.  The peppermint scent coupled with the rich lather took me to an emotional level I haven&#x27;t felt since the first time I watched the Notebook.  I concur with the product title, this soap is truly magical.  It cast a spell of cleanliness on my nubile, cherub like figure causing me to sing out in glee.  &amp;#34;I&#x27;m off to Never-Never Land&amp;#34; I sung as a gently washed myself.  I can&#x27;t wait to expand my Dr. Bronner catalog by trying his other products.</li>
    <li> Love it! Keeps skin soft and fresh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for a very long time and the quality has always remained very high. Very good product.</li>
    <li> We really enjoy this soap and it always smells great and feels refreshing.  But the soap is expensive, so I&#x27;m not sure how often we will purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the invigorating feel of this peppermint soap--it&#x27;s great to wake you up in the morning.  The later is very creamy, and it doesn&#x27;t feel at all harsh.</li>
    <li> I LOVED Dr Bronner&#x27;s tea tree oil soap when I tried it out this year when I saw it in a small gourmet market.  It&#x27;s totally organic without cheap toxic synthetic chemicals.  Its lathering action is the best I&#x27;ve seen in a long time in organic soaps and I&#x27;ve tried so many different types of soaps out there. It lasts a long time even while it&#x27;s organic.  Of course, it does NOT last long FOR ME because I&#x27;ll soap myself 2 or 3 times in one bath with it because it&#x27;s soooo good to bathe with, such a botanical fragrant peppermint scent that kills bacteria, especially for odor-focused sweaty body parts like the underarms and feet, and it lathers well.  With synthetic soaps, my skin tightens up and you can FEEL you&#x27;re not clean, but with Dr Bronner soaps, you can FEEL you&#x27;re clean and my skin doesn&#x27;t tighten up.  The package doesn&#x27;t look very appealing, but the product itself is a diamond in the rough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely great for aromatherapy, great for those who really want to clean and not just put lather &amp; bubbles &amp; aroma on their body, great for those wanting organic products, great for people with sensitive skin, and great as an everyday soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001ET77P2 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, All-One Hemp Tea Tree, 5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)]] is also great to bathe with, with a strong botanical fragrance and tea tree oil which is a strong odor fighter and is a powerful bacteria killer.</li>
    <li> I have a friend who used Doc Bronners soap for years, and I just recently tried it.  Since trying I have become a big fan.  Scented from natural oils, not perfumed.  It cleans well, and leaves a nice scent.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These soap bar are just great, leave you feeling very clean and actually create a very enjoyable bathing experience. The peppermint is really nice, just watch out if you have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed about using these organic soaps is that my skin does not dry out or peel the way it does sometimes with other soaps bars . Great product all in all</li>
    <li> Better price than buying them at Whole Foods!</li>
    <li> This soap has a very nice smell. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best bar soap I have ever used for a body wash!  I have sensitive skin and am allergic to various chemicals in other soaps and shampoos.  It lathers well and cleans great.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner may seem a bit wacky, but he makes really, really good soaps. I have used the liquid soaps for years  and recently began using his bar soaps.  They smell great, lather extremely well and rinse well too.  The peppermint scent is strong and soothing, but doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a peppermint candy. It rinses well and is mild enough that I can even wash my hair with it, something I wouldn&#x27;t do with any other bar soap. The difference with other bar soaps is these bars of soap go fast, two of us would use a bar in less than a week!  By compassion, the same size of Ivory last easily twice as long. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is worth it to me though. It is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on reading the reviews. I have been a Caress (daily silk) user for years. I wanted to switch to something natural &amp; decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the packaging I noticed a strong aroma of peppermint. I was a bit hesitant because I do not want to smell like peppermint all day or have it clash with my perfume. What I found was the complete opposite. While the peppermint scent was strong upon application, the scent fades quickly after drying off. The best part is that it leaves your skin feeling tingly &amp; your senses invigorated. It makes a great wake-up soap to start out  your day. Although it has Olive Oil, Hemp Oil, Jojoba Oil &amp; Peppermint Oil, I did not notice my skin to be soft after use. This was disappointing but honestly, the invigorating tingle &amp; natural ingredients made up for it.&lt;br /&gt;I found it first at my local Target store for $4.79 a bar. Once I had tried it &amp; decided to make it my new bar soap, I purchased a 6 pack on Amazon for $24.30 ($4.05 a bar) so I am pleased with the slight discount.&lt;br /&gt;The other bonus to this soap (versus store brands) is that it doesn&#x27;t get soft &amp; mushy when stored in a plastic soap case. I find it to be a very long lasting soap so the higher price compared to mass market soaps is worth it.</li>
    <li> I chose to switch to Castille soaps because I&#x27;m trying to limit the amount of chemicals soaking into my skin.  I am fond of peppermint, and this soap holds the fragrance nicely until there is only about 1/4 of the bar left.  For some reason the strong peppermint fragrance tends to leave the soap towards the end, although the soap still lathers and performs nicely. Not sure if this is true with all the Dr. Bronner soap fragrances.</li>
    <li> This soap smells delicious! I geared it to make my own laundry detergent and it keeps the laundry area smelling good and my clothes nice and crisp .</li>
    <li> My husband loves the tingle on his private parts. Not quite sure what he is doing in there 😳 smells very refreshing, but scent does not last.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap by Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  I have found other scents tend to fall apart in the shower but the peppermint holds up to the very end.  Has a nice clean feel as well.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap, I love the peppermint! A little drying but still very good. I love dr. Bronners!</li>
    <li> I have had skin dryness and dandruff problems my whole life. After trying everything I could find, a friend recommended this to me. I know it might sound like I&#x27;m being extreme here, but this product has actually changed my quality of life. Dandruff and dry skin are gone forever. I believe in this product so much that I frequently buy 6-packs or 12-packs to give away to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I like the bundle offer and the soap smells nice. Been using it for laundry detergent with borax and washing soda.</li>
    <li> Makes great smelling laundry detergent!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  Yes, it tingles in a refreshing invigorating tantalizing way.  It lathers, cleans, and rinses great.  My favorite is to lather away from the shower and let the soap sit on my skin for a few seconds!  It feels tingly and cool on my skin.  Yes it tingles the lady parts but I think it feels great!  It&#x27;s not the burn others have stated.  I love both the liquid &amp; the bar... I use both!  Eucalyptus &amp; Lavendar are also great.  Worth every penny &amp; hubby agrees!</li>
    <li> I love this soap! Comes in a pack of six, couldn&#x27;t be happier with the smell and how clean you feel afterwards. Also added plus... Makes your bits feel tingly</li>
    <li> I just LOVE this soap.  It smells great.  I first used the soap in Hawaii on a trip and when I got home I made sure to order some more as I loved it so much.  I highly recommend this soap.  I love the peppermint scent.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of if not the best soap I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned the way of natural products many moons ago and successfully became a Gee-Eco (Gee-Ko) or Eco Geek. I am a hardcore tech geek that turned Eco-head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way this soap makes your skin tingle and it really feels clean after. The neatest thing is you can use it to brush your teeth... BUT realize it is smarter to use a 2nd bar and not the same bar you are washing your body with :-D...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it costs more then Dove but once you try it you&#x27;ll see where the money goes...</li>
    <li> This is the only soap my husband can use. It doesn&#x27;t have any perfume but uses natural oils and doesn&#x27;t disintegrate quickly. We have used both the liquid and the solid. I prefer the liquid but hubby likes the good ole bar. We have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for many years and every so often try something else, but always return quickly. There are a variety of scents that are available so you can choose your mood. Love the packaging. If you have a magnifying glass you can read it, but it is amusing.</li>
    <li> This might be a weird thing to think about, but this is definitely my favorite soap. Smells good, forms suds really well, and outlasts most of my other soaps! But let&#x27;s break it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the peppermint smell is great, and this is coming from a guy who considers himself fairly masculine - I stay away from the fruit-smelling stuff. But the peppermint just smells refreshing and clean, and leaves a nice, clean-feeling tingle to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I love how it makes excellent, high-volume suds. It really foams up making for a powerful clean without forceful scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it outlasts all other soaps I&#x27;ve used. A tip: unpacking and letting a bar hit air for a while before using it helps it last even longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it keeps me clean, smelling nice, and lasts a while making for a great value. If you&#x27;re not using it, you&#x27;re missing out!</li>
    <li> We used these soaps in California at our daughter&#x27;s, and we loved them.  They are hard surfaced so they last a bit,  and the scent is lovely.</li>
    <li> Such a great soap and smells divine.. even makes our restroom smell like peppermint. What else can you ask for?</li>
    <li> great customer service, item as described</li>
    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve used this soap in different &amp;#34;flavours&amp;#34;, I like it a lot, and it seems to last for quite a while without just melting away. The peppermint one smells curiously of gasoline, but that&#x27;s okay with me, because I&#x27;ve always liked the smell of petrol!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff as an all-in-one for bathing and washing my hair.  I even tried brushing my teeth with it once just for kicks.  It was gross, but I didn&#x27;t die.  Anyway, the reason I gave this two stars is because you can get this cheaper by the bar at Trader Joe&#x27;s (at least where I live).</li>
    <li> I love these bar soaps neat as much as the liquid version. The only issue I&#x27;ve found is that they don&#x27;t last incredibly long. So there is a trade off there, but it&#x27;s worth it to me. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great soap!!!  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over a year, purchasing it at the store.  I&#x27;ve been giving it to family and they love as well.&lt;br /&gt;First time I&#x27;ve ordered it online to save a little.  Hope the price will come down somewhat.  Would love to send shipments to family for Christmas!  It truly is great for face and entire body!!!  You&#x27;ve got to try this one!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Dr. Bronner!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap ~ all of it....but I use Peppermint in my homemade laundry soap.  I&#x27;ve tried others and have found that this works the best.  The smell is wonderful when wet, the soap cleans extremely well, and in the end, my laundry just smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; without any scent remaining or soapy residue.  I will buy this again and again...LOVE DR. BRONNER&#x27;S.</li>
    <li> We only use this soap for everything :)  including shampoo :)  I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this from amazon as often as it&#x27;s available</li>
    <li> The peppermint bar version of this soap is good soap.  It lathers well, and gets the job done.  The peppermint smell is nice.  That said, the stuff is not worth even 50% of the asking price.  As far as soap goes, most cheaper bar soaps do the job just as well.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap. It&#x27;s cool and refreshing,and lathers really well. Perfect in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin (eczema), and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves me fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Allergic.  Dont recommend for eczema sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Oh you have never showered until you shower with this soap it leaves one tingling and  alive from head to toe and all those sensual crevises.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that I spent so many years using the horrible big brand name soaps loaded with so much chemicals and junk (Dial, Olay, Dove, Lever2000). I know this brand is a bit more expensive than the basic junk soaps, but DR Bronners products are very concentrated so their soaps actually last longer. If you&#x27;re looking for an all natural soap with organic ingredients that&#x27;s better for you and the environment this is it! By the way, I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances so I always buy the unscented mild and its wonderful.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this soap. It has a great lather and smells wonderful. The peppermint has a tingle feeling-- which I really like and makes me feel extra clean. It rinses very clean and does not seem to leave much soap scum in our tub. All this and it has very pure ingredients. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This peppermint soap is great. I recommend everyone to use it. It smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling fantastic. No soapy film left on my skin at all after each use. My husband has eczema and says this soap helps his skin to look and feel better. He loves it too! Amazing product! I don&#x27;t think I ever want to use anything else on my skin again, nothing but this peppermint soap. :)</li>
    <li> good value and fast shipping</li>
    <li> We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps!  They are so mild and environmentally friendly!</li>
    <li> Excellent soap!  I&#x27;ve been on a bar soap kick lately, for whatever reason, and this is the best bar I&#x27;ve used yet.  I only use it at the sink.  It lathers up quicker, richer, and easier than anything else, and doesn&#x27;t dry my hands out much at all compared to other bars.  Rinses away quickly and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely on the expensive side for a single bar of soap, but it&#x27;s a thick bar, and lasts a long time (I think I&#x27;ve had mine for about six months now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are hugely multi-purpose, and can be used as a substitute cleanser for just about anything (hair, teeth, laundry, dishes, household cleaning, etc.)  I use the liquid equivalent for dishes and laundry, and figure it&#x27;s an easier application than the bar would provide.  The bar also smells identical to the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the scent... Before buying, decide on whether or not you want your bathroom to smell like hippies and candy canes all the time, because it&#x27;s gonna.  Joking aside, it smells great.  If you like mint, you&#x27;ll love the smell.</li>
    <li> I rate Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps as Excellent because they are! I like the peppermint because it smells good, clean, and healthy -- peppermint oil is good for people.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. Im the person that has 4 or 5 soaps in rotation, I&#x27;m finicky like that. I have had a hard time switching from this over the last month. I guess I will have to get the different scents of this.</li>
    <li> Great soap.  Good price.</li>
    <li> No zing. After trying out the peppermint bar soap I decided to reorder the liquid.  I was trying to be ecologically responsible and reduce my use of plastic bottles. I live in a very hot place and the liquid peppermint soap has a real zing to it that drastically cools the skin. The bar soap does not do that at all. I&#x27;ll use the bar soap for winter.</li>
    <li> love this soap! recommended by daughter and daughter in law... amazing .....</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Grew up with it back when there were only 2 or 3 soaps to pick from.  My wife says it makes me smell like her grand-pa.  At 45 I kinda like that, better than an Axe boy with no taste or class at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps. I used the liquid peppermint for the longest time and used to mix it half water, half soap for bathing. I think it would dilute even more for longer use, but the liquid always seemed to go too fast and seemed to be more costly than I would prefer. I gave the bars a shot and I am quite impressed. The bar doesn&#x27;t have quite the same intensity of the &amp;#34;peppermint tingle&amp;#34; but it lathers well and really goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Bought my first bar at Target for a test run and now i&#x27;m addicted! Get the clean feeling every time i use the soap. Even gets motor oil grease off easily, unlike my other soaps.</li>
    <li> You know those soap commercials where they try to make the soap look really refreshing and stimulating? Well this soap really does that.     Its like taking a shower in liquid peppermint. You can smell the peppermint and it actually cools(not chills) your skin. Its also good if you are allergic to perfumes in many soaps.    And it seems to last a good while unlike some soaps that seem to intentionally melt away quickly so you have to buy more.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this and the Eucalyptus bar soap, I&#x27;m not sure where, but I&#x27;ll guess bath and body. The bar soaps SUCK! I don&#x27;t feel anything, NOTHING AT ALL! There&#x27;s no scent, it&#x27;s just a block of white soap!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap known to man. I get it, there is some hippie stuff on the label that may rub people the wrong way, but for real this soap gets the job done and gets it done RIGHT</li>
    <li> Always a great buy. Natural and great scent! No film left on my skin like so many other soaps.</li>
    <li> Best soap to remove men&#x27;s BO. My boy&#x27;s play basketball and this soap cleans the sport smell off of them. We all love the peppermint smell and like that it&#x27;s not putting any harmful ingredients on our skin.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how long these bars last just sitting in the shower. The peppermint is very strong.</li>
    <li> Gotta love that peppermint tingle.</li>
    <li> I have been using the peppermint bar soap for approximately 3 weeks now. I have used cetaphil bar soap for years to remove my makeup and to wash my face but noticed in the last few years, I developed small raised bumps on my cheeks. Sine I&#x27;ve switched to dr. Bronners, the bumps have disappeared. I am in love with these soaps and will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite Dr. Bronner soap.  We use it in the shower/bath and also to make laundry detergent.  It&#x27;s the one scent we all agree on!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Makes my skin smell great.</li>
    <li> I was searching for tooth soap and I came across this on the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;For tooth brushing, apply a drop or two of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap (I prefer the peppermint) to a wet toothbrush. Brush as you normally would, rinsing accordingly. Be careful about using more than a couple drops of soap, as you might start foaming at the mouth (last time I checked \\&quot;rabid chic\\&quot; was not hip). Many people with sensitive or softer teeth like to use our soap as toothpaste because it lacks abrasives.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the liquid soap but it was too soapy for me so I decided to try shredding the peppermint bar soap on my cheese grater and have been using only this product on my teeth for about 6 weeks. I use the directions for the other tooth soap shreds found on this site. Using tooth soap instead of toothpaste takes some getting used to but I am hooked.  Due to the lack of abrasives, I do use baking soda along with the tooth soap once a week to keep my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have periodontal disease and have to go every three months to the dentist for scaling/cleaning.  Last night at I had my quarterly appointment at the dental office my hygienist was pleasantly surprised that she did not have to do hardly any scaling, my gums did not bleed at all, my gums are firmer than before (they take readings) and I had very little sensitivity. Less time in the dentist&#x27;s chair, WOOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the liquid peppermint soap in the shower (tingly lady bits and all) and for my laundry and I will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 6 pack seems like a good deal here as I usually have to pay 6 dollars a bar.  One bar would shred into about a year supply of tooth soap though. Economical even at 6 dollars if you compare it to toothpaste. If you compare it to tooth soap shreds found here it is even more economical as one jar of tooth shreds is about 20 bucks and probably about the same amount as a quarter of a bar of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Castile soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s just my opinion :)</li>
    <li> best soap I have ever used, it is so hard to find in the store that I had to go to the source to insure I didn&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> The Soap is great but the price is a ripoff cvs has it for way cheaper</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. There are no weird ingredients of environmental concern and the scent is a great pick-me-up. You do not step out of the shower smelling like a stick of peppermint, either. It lathers nicely and two of us can go through a bar faster than other types of soap but it&#x27;s worth the price to support a clean product. I&#x27;m glad to be able to order it from Amazon in a multi-pack.</li>
    <li> Love it....only thing, if ur a girl, be prepared to be cautious when washing the vagina area....the peppermint burns/tingles.  Takes getting used to.  Lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;foofy\\&quot; kind of guy. The heavy perfume soaps are not my style. The peppermint and tea tree soaps both smell good without being \\&quot;foofy\\&quot;. They rinse off clean, don&#x27;t contain a lot of chemicals, and aren&#x27;t harsh on the skin.</li>
    <li> This peppermint soap is wonderful, have been using for awhile.  This is the first purchase he and was at an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Favorite soap!  I used to swear by liquid soap, but I have been converted!  It lathers really well and lasts a relatively long time, so I do not mind the price.  I have sensitive skin and this soap (peppermint) works great for me!</li>
    <li> this is the best soap period.</li>
    <li> I purchase these soaps for my 12 year old because he goes through liquid soap like its going out of style and because I feel the least amount of ingredients in a product the better it is for you and the organic factor doesnt hurt either. The bar soap just like the liquid version is a bit drying, not too bad on the body skin but he was also washing his hair with it (which your supposed to be able to do) and it caused his scalp to be extra extra dry and flaky (which we saw evidence of after cutting his hair - fading it). Please note that some of the dryness could be from product not being rinsed well from the scalp - we are talking about a 12 year old who thinks the faster things are done the faster he can get back to doing nothing. I would purchase this product again just because of the simplicity of the ingredient list - i just feel more comfortable using products that have ingredients I can pronounce. If your not using it as a full body its ok just make sure you lotion or oil up afterward.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks this is the best soap.  I like it also.  Yes, I will be placing an order again for it.  I do use it for other things beside in the shower.  It works great for cleaning and I even tried it for the brushing the teeth like someone said.  Not to bad.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Have used all kinds of expensive all natural soaps. Very pleased with this one. A little tingle in the private areas but not harsh at all. Last a lot longer than other natural soaps which tend to dissolve as soon as they are exposed to water. One bar has lasted me over a month.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps are all great.  Natural ingredients with added bonus of aromatherapy aspects.  I love the Peppermint because it is refreshing.  I have also used all the other scents like Eucalyptus, Rose, Lavender.  They are all nice.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Many soaps has animal fat as the main ingredient. Most soaps have artificial chemicals for binders, perfumes, surfactants, this, that, and the other. This soap is none of these things. Natural ingredients that smell good, work well, and don&#x27;t support the trashing of the planet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on this soap ever since I received it as a gift from a gracious couch surfer host. it smells great and lathers really well,and I can use it to wash my face and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. no residue, feel super clean after my shower! best bar soap I have ever used by far. Bronner may have been crazy, but he made some damn good soap.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever! Never felt any cleaner :-)</li>
    <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but if you can afford it regularly, it&#x27;s worth EVERY penny.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that my husband and son use. They love it. I love that it is natural and the smell is fabulous. And that my 9yo will actually use it! :)</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and great lather.</li>
    <li> The Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, All-One Hemp Peppermint gives you the nice fresh feeling. This product is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Peppermint soap smells pleasant before use and soaps up on a sponge or wash cloth with ease.  The trouble begins when you start to wash your skin, at least on much of mine.  Almost immediately after the first application, my skin began to burn like fire, especially on my face and groin area.  It was so painful that I had to use another soap and a lot of water to get the residue off as soon as possible.  Even then it burned for a few more minutes before going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading all of the other compliments posted here for the product, I notice one other commenter that barely mentioned this problem.  This is totally baffling.  For me, it meant throwing the stuff out.  I was so annoyed that I didn&#x27;t even save it for something where it might work well, like a flea bath for the dog.  Maybe without the peppermint it would be O.K., but I&#x27;ll never know, because I&#x27;ll never buy any more of it.</li>
    <li> I would like to preface this review by saying that this is for the  PEPPERMINT scented soap ONLY.This peppermint soap,although extremely pleasant scented,is a bit too irritating to the skin. The peppermint gives a burning sensation to the the sensitive areas of the body as well. I  also believe  it may also create an itchiness to skin .That being said however, I do like the other aspects of the soap, I believe I will try another scent other than peppermint.</li>
    <li> Love the soap. It&#x27;s a good soap. My family been using it for a little while now. And we will buy it again...</li>
    <li> Purchased based on other reviews. I purchased mostly for travel use. Instead of packing a bunch of 3-1-1- shampoos, body soaps, laundry soaps, etc. I pack this bar and use it for bathing, shampooing, and also in the sink to wash out clothing. Peppermint smell is great, however, I was disappointed it does not last thru the entire bar. Very strong in the beginning, then weakens til almost no smell at all when your at the end. Very gentle even on color treated hair, would recommend to travelers as a all-in-one soap that they can pack without 3-1-1 worries.</li>
    <li> used this over 20 years- great stuff solid or liquid- strange man great soap</li>
    <li> A friend turned me on to this soap a few years ago. I was looking for a more natural soap that would remove my makeup as some of the other products on the market are harsh on my skin, not to mention expensive. This has a great subtle peppermint smell, and lasts a good long time which makes up for the fact that I&#x27;ve found it cheaper elsewhere...and much more expensive!). Great gentle cleanser for my skin. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was using another brand of castile soap for the last few years and saw this Pepperment stuff and wanted to give it a try.  I love it!  It not only lathers up nicely with a hand cloth, but smells good, too. And, you can feel it is cleaning really well by its ever so slight sting in certain areas of your body that really need cleaning, LOL!  Anyway, this is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m sticking with it!!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This brand is an excellent soap.  I highly recommend it.  It works well for me.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soap. It is refreshing and can be used for many things. It is true that you can brush your teeth with it. It doesn&#x27;t taste or feel bad. I also use it to wash bras and underwear by hand. I love the smell and so did my grand kids. I am hooked on this soap. Once you try it you won&#x27;t want the regular kinds.</li>
    <li> ONLY SOAP WE USE! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Great soap.  I use this bar soap to make liquid soap.  This soap is gentle on your hands and does an AMAZING job of removing oil/dirt if you&#x27;ve been doing vehicle maintenance or outside work.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It is refreshingly peppermint-scented but not too intense. It leaves a light tingly feeling and rinses off well. I like the fact that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> love this soap.  it is great.  one of the few natural soaps that makes me feel clean.  great smell too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for quite a while and thought that these would be a good buy because of the price.  The bars either have a very faint scent or no scent at all.  Very disappointing and it makes me question if they may be knock offs.  I&#x27;ve had great results with Dr. B&#x27;s in the past but this shipment was terrible.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed the liquid version of this soap before, but have started using the bars, which are convenient for travel and shower use.  The bars are the same safe stuff that the liquid is, including use as a toothpaste substitute.  Of course, that limits its usefulness for soap in the mouth from parents.  I would have loved to had this when a youth, as Ivory and Lifebuoy were definitely not my preferred mouthwash (thanks, Mom!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have allergies to darn near everything, and find this to be a great soap for the whole body.  Much better than the Aveeno bars, with little to no drying out of my skin afterward.  For those with sensitive skin, I recommend this soap.  Not cheap, but safety has a price and the multipack sizes from Amazon can save more in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the peppermint is not overpoweriing, and it cleans and rinses well.  I like that it is relatively safe, compared to other soaps, something I appreciate for my children&#x27;s sake.  Even strong enough to deodorize active teenage boys.  Great for prepping the beard before shaving, too.  A word of warning for the ladies, however, as the peppermint may be a bit too strong for the more intimate areas, as my wife let me know the one time she tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> THE SOAP: It&#x27;s gentle and cleans my hyper-sensitive skin thoroughly but without triggering rashes. I never have that tight, dry feeling after using this soap that I do with so many other harsher cleansers. And this peppermint scent is heaven in a closed, hot shower. I will buy this scent again, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SELLER: While the item arrived in time, the bars of soap were secured together using clear plastic tape, so when I tried to take them apart all of the paper wrapping on the soap ripped off. Lame. Now storing the soap—keeping it dust-, lint-, and hair-free—is an annoyance &#x27;til I can use them all. I won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and it seems to be a good, natural soap.  The peppermint scent is really refreshing.  The soap doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin or irritate it, which is important to me.</li>
    <li> Excellent value buying in bulk, love Dr Bonners.</li>
    <li> Best soap gets you really clean, but too expensive, so I gave it  4 stars</li>
    <li> I enjoy Dr. Bronner&#x27;s hard soaps a lot - I used the Lavender scented bar for a three month trip across Europe and Asia, and it works like a dream! You can wash clothes, hair, and body with this soap. It lathers extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one rather large issue that I have is with the Peppermint soap itself; every female I know who has also used the peppermint hard soap complains about using the soap on private parts! They all say it gives a burning sensation &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; that is not quite comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will stick with the Lavender for now.</li>
    <li> I stopped using all other soaps and body washes and now exclusively use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure-Castile Bar Soap b/c its so gentle and moisturizing. In a pinch sometimes I even use it to wash my face which is nice and refreshing due to the peppermint. This bar lathers really well and feels so silky on my skin and I never feel that film or stickiness some other bar soaps can leave. The Peppermint scent is my favorite as it is subtle and not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap to everyone!</li>
    <li> Seriously, if you&#x27;ve never used this soap, order a bar right now. You can use it to bath with, clean your laundry, wash your hands, hair, face, feet and just about anything else in between. For winter use the peppermint can be kind of cold when you step out of the shower though. Still it&#x27;s amazing and changed our soap use habits completely.</li>
    <li> I love the peppermint soap. The lathers beautifully, smells wonderful and most importantly has replaced the need for me to have a seperate body and face soap. A bar lasts me about a month as I make sure I keep it in the dry end of the shower so it doesnt melt or get funky like other soaps have been known to do, splitting before they get used up. I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 months. My preteen daughter also uses it on her oily face. For face washing only her bar has lasted about 2 months and works better than Proactive when used 2x day. I will be buying it in liquid form next to convert my body-wash-addicted husband. The seller on here is selling it for about 2x you&#x27;d pay in the store however, even in the multipack so shop wisely!</li>
    <li> I use this to make laundry detergent.</li>
    <li> Nothing better on a hot Summer day, then a shower with peppermint soap. Smells great, and leaves you feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> We like this soap very much.  This is our second order for the soap.  The delivery was quick.  I am very pleased with the order process, as well as the soap.</li>
    <li> OK, a guy is not supposed to think about soap.  Comes in a bar, you use it in the shower.  But I had an uncle who used to always buy the liquid form of this peppermint stuff and leave it at our family vacation house.  So, I don&#x27;t know if the soap just brings back good memories of being on vacation, but I really like the smell of it and this stuff doesn&#x27;t have the chemical kind of feel that regular soap has.  As a rule, I&#x27;m not one to be really sensitive to organic this and that, but I do like this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works for me.</li>
    <li> very good quality soap, can clean just about everything.</li>
    <li> Great soap, like the tingling feeling the Peppermint gives when you wash with it.  Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the texture of the product. Leaves skin feeling great as well as a person feeling refreshed. Only problem and it&#x27;s a big one considering the  price is that it doesn&#x27;t last at all. I thought the 6 bars I bought would last 6 months. I was wrong getting about 2 weeks a bar.  Will probably go back to L&#x27;occitane..</li>
    <li> We just got sick and tired of grabbing a bar of soap from our soap dish and grabbing a handful of goo.&lt;br /&gt;I had gone to Walmart and found an old standby..Castille White for something like $4 for three bars. It was as I remembered.&lt;br /&gt;However it got me to thinking that maybe it would be in bulk and cheaper at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;That got me reviewing all the soap options I never knew existed.&lt;br /&gt;After looking at tons of product and reviews of product, we took a flyer and ordered DR Bonners Peppermint bar soap and a jug of the liquid ( 32 oz ).&lt;br /&gt;We have had it for a week now and will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;The bar soap in the shower is fantastic. You dont smell like a candy cane when done, but man o man do you feel clean. Their is no after soap scum like from the big name, big bulk soaps. It lathers well, It comes off easy. It lasts and by that I mean it does not sit there and ooze in the soap dish. Wipe the bar off in water and its a hard bar of soap when you come back to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;We put the liquid in one of the old foam making soap dispensers we had been using ( something from one of the mall soap stores). It spits out a nice creamy foam soap that again goes on easy, comes off easy, cuts through kitchen grease ( making hamburger patties by hand if you get my drift ), and even smells good as it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;This is one product that does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;One strange glitch and that is the label on the liquid bottle. You have to see it to believe it. Thats all I will say.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. Costs...but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap for your body, but I do not recommend using it as a face soap! The peppermint in particular burns your eyes. I have used the unscented versions of this soap on my face with no issue.</li>
    <li> First of all, I really like Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps. The two main reasons: First, I do not smell like the soap all day long and they rinse clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I have purchased the Peppermint soap from an online source and BOTH times, the scent is NOT peppermint. The scent is closer to Tea Tree. Maybe the bars sat in a warehouse next to something and absorbed the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather and rinsing is still good, so I am not going to return the bars. I will just purchase locally, where I can smell the bars before I pay for them.</li>
    <li> Bars are kinda big but easily cut into smaller sizes for your vanities, etc.; and the castile and peppermint oil is NOT gonna be beat!!</li>
    <li> We use this soap all of the time and we love it. We like using products that are organic and natural.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Smells fantastic, cleans without leaving a film on your skin and the peppermint is invigorating.</li>
    <li> Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, plain and simple.  Using this peppermint castile soap to make my own peppermint scented laundry soap :)</li>
    <li> This is the greatest soap I&#x27;ve ever used. The smell is amazing and does not sustain much longer than the shower. It makes my skin super soft and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry when I get out of the shower. I am officially a lifelong customer.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps my body clean! The almond and the hemp scents are also some of my favorites as well.</li>
    <li> Great soup, love the smell. Pepermint is the best Bronner soup in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Solid soap.  Scent is nice, doesn&#x27;t last as long as they claim but that&#x27;s not a real big deal.  Well comparing it price wise to some milder soaps I use I would say this runs up their a bit.</li>
    <li> nice scent, helps with the rough alligator elbows that come from regular soap use. Will look into other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap products.</li>
    <li> Get ready for an eye opening shower with this soap. This scent is great and pretty strong but does not stay on your skin long. As for the soap part, it works very well even after gardening and walking barefoot in dirt and grass. Just be sure to rinse quickly on your more sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The soap is nice because it is natural. The smell was wonderful when I opened the package but when I used it in the shower, it didn&#x27;t smell at all, felt like i was rubbing animal fat on my body, NOT clean feeling at all and no scent. Kept them to use around my bathrooms to release scent but horrible option for cleansing.</li>
    <li> The bars have a great lather and smell wonderful.  I shower in the AM and the strong peppermint scent works well to get me going.  I have a fragrance allergy so I really appreciate the natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The bar does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels pretty dry after a good lather.</li>
    <li> I have been on a soap kick for the last three months trying out several soaps from all over the World including Speick &amp; LaToja.&lt;br /&gt;I was recommened Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender soap and after using it I was very impressed with it for not only my body, but it worked great in my hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;I recently was on a weekend trip in Vermont and noticed the local store had Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint in stock so I picked up a bar.&lt;br /&gt;It lathered just as well as the Lavender but when I got to my \\&quot;Man Parts\\&quot; it stung like Hell!&lt;br /&gt;My Wife also used it and said it stung her \\&quot;Lady Parts\\&quot; as well.&lt;br /&gt;To the trash it shall go...</li>
    <li> I will only use organic products on my body. Bronners magic soaps are one of the best!This is the best priced of all the stores on line,and in person I have found.</li>
    <li> This soap was originally suggested to me by my physician a few years ago.  It&#x27;s the only soap I have used ever since.  Love the smell, and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
    <li> This soap will wake you up in the morning. It&#x27;ll give you quite a sensation on your nether regions, too! Cleanses good, rinses free, and leaves your skin fresh and fragrant. It even tastes good! Your kids may start swearing just to get their mouths washed out.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used. Shipped and arrived as expected. Will order again!</li>
    <li> product arrived on time,as advertised and in perfect condition.since i got it i use it every day in the shower and to wash my hands.it smells great and feels great on the skin.also, the bar is big meaning it&#x27;ll last a long time.overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap. What can I say? It smells great, not too strong. Cleans my skin without drying it out. Now my whole family uses it. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The closet soap I&#x27;ve found to homemade and I love the added tingle from the peppermint.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap ever.  Love the ingredients and it works great (even as shampoo).</li>
    <li> I always feel refreshed and very CLEAN when I wash my face and body with it. I especially love it after my morning run. Not only is my mind clear but I feel more enlightened after lathering up with my Peppermint Castile. I am a fan I used the Regular, no fragrance for my daughter with eczema and severe allergies. Was a God send.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> absolutely love this soap. I have hard water and this does well. I really like the scent and you can feel the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; in your neither region :)</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I use this to make my own detergent. This is cheaper here than at Whole foods so I will continue to get it here :)</li>
    <li> I am working on turning our home into an all natural products home.  I have used this as a bath soap and even to wash my hair.  I love the fragrance and the way it feels.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I always keep this soap on hand, even if I trade off using other soap.  Love the smell and the clean feel.</li>
    <li> Aside from the fact that this soap is 100% organic, it has a cooling effect that is most welcome in a humid and hot environment.  No other soap gives such a clean feeling after using it such as this one does.  If you live in an area where your grandparents could wear white after labor day when those poor northerners could not (traditionally below the 30th parallel) you must try this astounding product---you just might turn the air conditioning off for a little while too!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this bar of soap at Trader Joes but still wanted to sing my praises on here. I decided to go \\&quot;shampoo-less\\&quot; in early February for various reasons, mostly because no chemically laden commercial products were working for me. There was a rough transition period for me where my hair felt disgusting, greasy and heavy from the olive oil soap and baking soda I tried to use as shampoo. Finally I decided to try Dr. Bronner&#x27;s because some people complained it was too drying for their hair. I figured since my hair got greasy so fast and easily, that it would work perfectly for me. After using this soap I FINALLY have nice, clean, soft hair! Cool thing is, I can go longer without shampooing my hair now. My scalp is no longer irritated by chemicals so there is no need for my pores to excrete excess oil. I use the soap to wash my feet, as well. I just love the peppermint smell!</li>
    <li> I am a guy, this soap is great lathers nice i us it in my shaving mug nice mint smell, also shower with it it leaves NO soapy film after you shower .... YES TRY THIS soap .... I will never use another soap again</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, does not dry-out skin. Feeling of cleanliness w/out any film or residue.  Small bars are easy to handle when wet.</li>
    <li> Like it but can sting because it&#x27;s peppermint. Be careful with sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  Smells great, good clean product.  Tingles.  Bar version is great, liquid version is equally great!  Love everything from this company</li>
    <li> Nothing is better on a hot summer day than a cool shower and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap! The tingle is cool and refreshing and the aromatics help to open my allergy-stuffy sinuses! The online price is a full dollar less per bar than the same product from local retailers.</li>
    <li> Best soap you can buy for your skin!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive Irish skin. If I shave, my face will be red and sore all day. If I wash my face, it&#x27;d red and sore for half the day, and usually my face will be peeling everywhere; If I open my mouth to talk or eat, skin would literally shed.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp was always super dry on the right side, and would flake endlessly when I ran a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;My beard and mustache looked dull and I could never get the hair to sit flat or in the direction I wanted. If I combed it too close to my skin, I&#x27;d get beard-druff everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoo&#x27;s, face washes, essential oils, moisturizers, completely organic products, etc over the years; nothing has ever helped my incredibly dry, irritated skin until Dr Bronners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been reading on beard forums about Dr Bronners being this miracle soap that has not only helped them achieve awesome facial hair, but also was their \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; face/hair/body wash routine. Dr Bronners name kept popping up everywhere on these forums, so after 2 years I finally decided to seek some out and try it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using Dr Bronners Peppermint bar soap for 2 weeks on my body, face, beard, and hair(aka everywhere!), and my skin looks awesome. No more redness, itchiness, or flaking on my face. My face has peeled unpredictably off and on for years, at least 4 days a week, so I&#x27;m really happy that so far this is doing amazing things for my skin. I&#x27;m hoping my skin wont get bored of this stuff and suddenly decide it wants to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is a couple of shades lighter now, and the dandruff is almost completely gone. It&#x27;s hard to explain the effect it has on my super thin, receding, naturally oily dark brown hair; it feels squeaky clean and looks soft with a little bit of shine. It has a dry clean look,not an \\&quot;oh man, this stuff is too dry and eating up all my natural oils\\&quot; type of thing like I read in some reviews. It has more volume, looks and feels weightless, and just looks waydifferent and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard/mustache no longer get beard-druff, and my facial hair looks thicker, healthier, and easily combs in the directions I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; sensation like so many of my friends and reviewers brag about(they said it&#x27;s especially noticeable and nice \\&quot;down there\\&quot;), or much of a scent, but that&#x27;s not important.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lathers so well on your hands or a wash cloth, that all it takes is rubbing it for 2 seconds between your hands, and I have enough soap to lather my whole body, face, and head. It significantly cut down on my showering time, so I guess it&#x27;ll save me money on my water bill...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Which leads me to one of the only cons I can think of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: This stuff is about $3.80 a bar on Amazon, $4.75 at my local Target. Most people are use to paying about 50cents a bar for department store soaps like Irish Spring, so this can be an overwhelming leap in price. Reviews mention it being a rip-off. Is it? Who knows. I don&#x27;t make soap for a living. Maybe the world is so accustomed to buying soap made with low quality ingredients, churned out in massive factories where employee&#x27;s aren&#x27;t making a living wage, and corners are being cut at every turn. Maybe Dr Bronners isnt expensive - maybe the other stuff is underpriced.&lt;br /&gt;All I know is for people like me with unpredictable, sensitive, irritated skin, this stuff seems to work. If I have to spend more money to finally get healthy skin and confidence, then so be it.&lt;br /&gt;If you dont have skin problems and are doing just fine with your current products and routine, then I honestly see no point in using this soap, unless you think your skin has a little bit of room for improvement, or you&#x27;re very curious what the fuss is about.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it&#x27;s been a world of difference, so I&#x27;ll keep using it and telling all my bearded friends about it.</li>
    <li> Gift for father - loves it.  I use the liquid - both have great peppermint fresh scent. Came in a group of bars that would likely last over a year! Good price for the pack of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap since 1970. Since then I&#x27;ve tried many, many different kinds but nothing compares - including the other ones that Dr. Bronner&#x27;s makes.</li>
    <li> Not only does the soap smell good but it does not have any nasty crap in it that most products have these days.  I just wish it was more affordable.</li>
    <li> Luxurious and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Helps my husband with his eczema and I with my chronic dandruff. Perfect for all skin types. Especially sensitive akin!!</li>
    <li> I have no idea as to how it works, but peppermint soap makes showers exhilarating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Burt&#x27;s Bees discontinued making their peppermint soap, I turned to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s which is more than ample.</li>
    <li> Smells good, cleans amazing. I will continue to use this product. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean with no skin diseases to report.</li>
    <li> Probably 99.9% pure. Works well, and smells good.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and this peppermint soap is one of my favorites.  It makes me feel clean and tingly after every shower, without the harmful effects of SLS.  I will continue to purchase this item for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It has a refreshing smell, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. It smells refreshing, and rinses off nicely.</li>
    <li> This soap is all natural and organic.  I realized after a few days of using it that my skin felt like silk.  It&#x27;s really nourishing.  Plus, it&#x27;s peppermint so when you use it in the morning and your half asleep it helps wake you up my making your skin tingle!  One bar lasts my husband and I about 7 full days.</li>
    <li> best soap. great smelling.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it as body and facial soap and it cleared up my bumpy (not acne) skin.</li>
    <li> Amazon is a great place to stock up on long term sustainable products.  We have seen power outages, roads blocked and heavy storms.  Backing up supplies only makes sense.  This was meant for our back up storage.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t go a day without it. Cleans thoroughly while the peppermint provides a wake me up!  Gives skin on face and body radiance and firmness.</li>
    <li> Best soap - money can buy.</li>
    <li> I could care less about whether soap is organic, tested on animals, or saves the ozone layer. I still like this soap, the way it feels, the way it cleans, and the way it lasts. The peppermint smell is just right - a whiff, not cloying or choking as so many scented soaps are. When I use Irish Spring or Dial, I wish I could shower wearing a gas mask. But the best thing is, you lather up, rinse off, and you know you are done - no need to repeat just to be sure. It is somewhat expensive, but if you aren&#x27;t worth a bit extra, that&#x27;s OK. I and my family are worth it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this because I didn&#x27;t want to smell like a human candy cane, but I do like the smell of mint during my morning shower. This soap does smell heavily of mint, but does not make you smell like mint after rinsing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself is very \\&quot;classic\\&quot; feeling. It makes the floor of my tub so slippery that I&#x27;ve since bought a mat to prevent slipping. It lathers up easily and plentifully, and washes off cleanly and without making your skin feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried lots of soaps throughout the years, but I will certainly be sticking with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for a while. I look forward to trying the different \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;, as well.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash everything from hair on my head to toes. I love the organic, pure nature of this product and also use the liquid soap and the Sal Suds for household cleaning! Great comany (Dr. Bronners) and quick shipping from this seller. Great price too!</li>
