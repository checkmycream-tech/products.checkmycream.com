<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> BEST butt stuff ever!</li>
    <li> It has worked well for both of our boys.  It is nice to find a good cream without perfume. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product sucks! If you like having a white tint on your skin all day then this is for you. I thought it would help with skin issues but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was born in Germany and naturally, I grew up with Penaten. It&#x27;s in my opinion the best creme, not only for babies, but even for myself - I use it for example for my face in the winter, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out from the coldness. It also keeps my face warm in the winter. This is an excellent creme! I can only recommend it.</li>
    <li> It must have been hot on the delivery truck because when we opened the package the heat had apparently expanded the product to the point that it popped the lid open and was leaking out the sides a bit.</li>
    <li> My aunt sent me 3 tins of this miracle cream when I was about 6 months pregnant -- it was the first gift we received for the baby! To be honest, I thought it was pretty silly how my aunt went on and on about this stuff. But now I understand! This stuff is amazing! Clears up even the toughest rashes overnight. The absolute only thing I don&#x27;t like about this cream is that I don&#x27;t trust it on my cloth diapers. It is THICK so I worry it will be difficult to wash out, so I just pop kiddo in a disposable and 9 times out of 10 the rash is gone by the next diaper change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the tins last forever! Kiddo is almost 2 years old now and we&#x27;ve only had to open one of the 3 tins (and there is still plenty left in the first tin). A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A friend of my mom from Germany used to bring this back all the time when I was a young girl and now I am using it for my baby its a very good product and shipping was fast didn&#x27;t take as long as they expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Arrived as indicated.</li>
    <li> I was born and raised in Germany and know all too well about Penaten Cream. It is the best cream ever!!! I use it for skin irritations, rashes, zits, cuts a.s.o. I am dissapointed that it isn&#x27;t sold here in the US, however one tin lasts forever since this cream need only to be applied sparingly. I still have the one tin I purchased years ago when on a trip back home to Germany.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for diaper rashes....better than any other products I tried on my baby. A little goes a long way so it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I cant even begin to tell you how much I adore this product. I got this as a gift 13 yrs ago when my son was born.I will never forget the look on the Germany born Pediatricians face when he insisted I didnt have the best product. I showed him my can of penaten and he smiled and said, oh you DO have the best there is. Use it for everything. And I have. I NEVER had any issues with Diaper rash. I still use it for other things. But purhaps the biggest reason we love it is for burns. My son has had some serious burns. One time boiling oil splashed all over his face and arms. 31 burns in all. We put penaten on and it took away the burning, also healed it very quickly with no scarring. Just recently he burned his face with boiling hot wax and immediately pulled off the wax and his skin with it! He applied penaten and within a couple of days new skin formed and you would hardly know there was a serious burn. Not to mention taking away the pain almost immediately. I love this product sooooo much that I will never go without.</li>
    <li> My mom told me about this cream a long time ago- that her German neighbor brought this home for her to use on me since she was having such a hard time keeping my diaper rashes under control.  Fast forward a few years now to me having my own little girl and we were having a really hard time getting rid of her diaper rash.  I remembered about the cream my mom told me and sure enough she kept the old tin she had and I was able to find it on Amazon!  It came the day I was about to make her a Dr appointment and after about 2 days of applying it after each diaper change it cleared up!  We still use it as a prevenative and will continue to use it on her while she still is wearing diapers.  Thank you Amazon for carrying a product that I thought was going to be impossible to find!</li>
    <li> My mom was living overseas &amp; sent me a tin of this when my first baby was born- I&#x27;ve had 2 more since and every time, I had an order in for 2 or 3 tins to come my way!  Like others have said, I would use this on a regular basis, just to keep their bottoms clear.  It is thick, so you only need a slight dab, but it truly is a miracle cream.  Anyone who has used my changing table has asked about it &amp; then proceeded to track some down.  Wish is was easier to get my hands on...thank goodness for amazon!</li>
    <li> No other American cream can compare!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this for our youngest baby. She has sensitive skin and this THICK great works wonders</li>
    <li> I USED THIS WITH MY BABIES MY AUNT SENT IT TO ME FROM GERMANY.  SO WHEN THE GRANDCHILD BROKE OUT IN BLISTERING DIAPER RASH LIKE HIS MOTHER...IT WAS THE FIRST THING I WENT LOOKING FOR.  WITHIN 24HRS. ALL CLEAR AND WE NOW USE IT DAILY TO PREVENT THE REOCCURANCE.</li>
    <li> This is the original German cream I used for my children 50 year ago.  It is still the very best I have ever used for sore bottoms or that under chin rash.  The only downside is that it a little difficult to wash off; but the healing and protection it provides is well worth the extra care.  I frequently give it as a gift to new moms.</li>
    <li> This is the best diaper creme EVER! My parents used it for us and I am using it now on my children. Penaten ist not just for diaper rashes great but for little sores and cuts as well.... it helps to speed up the healing process.  I can only recommend this product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> We read that baby creme with zinc oxide was also a fly repellant. We are happy to report that it works as such until the puppies lick it off or it rubs off.</li>
    <li> My grandma had her sister in Germany send this to us for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive diaper area, and it is amazing! It takes care of her diaper rashes literally overnight. I&#x27;m happy to see it is for sale on Amazon so that we don&#x27;t have to get it from Germany now! I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s cheaper this way. :)</li>
    <li> I first used this stuff on my oldest son when my husband and I were stationed in Germany. It cleared up my son&#x27;s HORRIBLE diaper rash within 2 days...and he had skin lesions it was so bad. When we came back stateside and had son number 2, the first thing I did was try to find that creme here in the U.S.. At the time no one carried it, not even Amazon, so I ordered it direct from a German version of \\&quot;Walgreens\\&quot;. Still the best stuff EVER. I had tried the other brands of bebe creme, but, none of them ever stacked up to the Penaten brand. They also make really great lotions, soaps, and wet wipes. I actually had a friend stationed in Germany buy for me and send a HUGE crate of the wet wipes lol. They are MUCH softer than even the best ones here and my boys never developed irritations with their brand.</li>
    <li> We were traveling in Canada and some issues with heat rashes. FOund this in a small apothecary there and it saved the day! Pleasant smell and thick consistency. Bought some form Amazon because we feared we had lost it during the trip. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> could wait to get it and here is what i finally got: CREAM ALL OVER UPS BOX. thats pretty much it!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading other reviews, and I must say the stuff is amazing. It cleared up some nasty diaper rash on our new born in 2 applications. I then tried it on a small patch if rashy skin that I have had for years, and have tried every lotion under the sun to get did of it. After 3 days my rash was finally gone, simply amazing, I have been recommending it to everyone I know. I will definitely be using this for a long time</li>
    <li> All I can say, this product is awesome! I think I can leave it on my WILL. That&#x27;s right, this lasts long and long. I am thinking I will have enough to leave it for my grand kids.. he he..  Pros - Best smell ever. Long lasting. Works.  Cons - None.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  I tried honest company and California baby for diaper rash.  I always go back to this.  Now with my second, this is the only cream I buy!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  We&#x27;ve been using it for our kids for 5 years and it gets rid of diaper rashes just like that. It&#x27;s a geat deal and delivered fast.</li>
    <li> I have been doing research on skin products and better stuff. It seems all the things I found were not made here. THis cream I bought because I am going to have a baby in the future and my two little boys are in need of a rash cream just to have on hand. The smell is wonderful. It is the perfect baby scent. It smells natural and not artificial. J&amp;J products made for the USA is pure garbage I am more learning. I did not use it with my boys when they were babies. I wonder why would it be so bad to have penaten sold in the USA or an equivelant. Its sickning. I will be buying 5 at a time. A product this good should be stocked. BUY BUY BUY It will not disappoint. bubchen is great too nade by nestle germany.</li>
    <li> Very good to use.  My wife is bedridden and it does a very good job of preventing bed sores.  A little greasy and hard to clean up.</li>
    <li> After using this while in Germany, I was so excited to find a place to buy it stateside! It is a very thick creme but has worked miracles on my baby&#x27;s diaper rash! The zinc oxide combined with witch hazel is a nice combo.</li>
    <li> We tried everything for our newborn&#x27;s diaper rash...desatin, aquaphor, vasaline, herbal creams, etc but nothing worked and some of the products made it worse. Penaten healed the skin immediatly. Love this product.</li>
    <li> My grandmother used this on me when I was a kid and now I use it on my child and it helps keep diaper rash away.</li>
    <li> This cream is practically unusable.  It is impossibly thick. I cannot imagine how one would be able to apply the cream to an infant or toddler because it would take a very hard time just to get it to smooth out on the child&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> We discovered this product fro German relatives 40 years ago. Our children are now using it on our grand children as needed.</li>
    <li> My mother is German  and moved to Canada in the 60&#x27;s.  This cream is German and was a  staple in her house for all things ( cuts,  minor burns,  diaper rash,  etc) I  was born in Canada,  where it is readily sold,  so it was a  staple in our house too.  Though I grew up in the states,  we always had this on hand,  imported from  Canadian relatives,  cuz nothing beats it. I  have 2  of my own children now and it is the same in my household.... used for everything.  and fantastic on all bum  problems!!!  It&#x27;s a  must have in every house!</li>
    <li> I can only say that this product is true to the concept of German quality and perfection. My mom used this cream and now it is my turn to go back to the classic for my little one. It works after first application, and diaper rash is completely gone. I even applied on the folding behind the ears and on my baby neck, and the redness and rash was gone in a day or so. Yes, it is a bit messy, even when the cream dries, but that&#x27;s perfectly normal for this type of creams. I&#x27;d say this product is a must for every mom, who wants to make sure that diaper rash is gone and stays this way all the time.</li>
    <li> A good product for the whole family, pets included. Odorless and quite efficient. Inexpensive. Not greasy, which is quite important.</li>
    <li> A miracle for any skin problems and for any butt or anus problems.  I don&#x27;t know why it is so much better than similar products, but it is.  Not just for babies.  This is even good for pimples.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream since my mom smeared it on my booty when I was a kid. Now I use it on my babies booties, and when I got a cold, on my own nose. It is a different kind of booty cream, than generally sold. The basic premise of this cream is not to fix the booty rash with chemicals and other questionable substances, but this cream uses a thick chamomile agent, to separate the rash skin from the exposure of the irritants and therefore allows the soothing of the chamomile to help the skin help itself. A share for every evenvironmental conscious mom.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, nothing compares!</li>
    <li> Works for whats it needed for. been in are family for generations.</li>
    <li> I used this on my kids when they were babies, and now using for my grandchildren. This is an excellent skin product and arrived within days.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! The best for baby rash but also put this stuff on a sunburn and go to bed.....next day you are cured! No kidding! I am a redhead and burn very easily. This is the only product I have used that soothes the burn as fast as the very next morning. Just amazing stuff. If I could eat it to cure my acid reflux I would.</li>
    <li> it all started with my husband&#x27;s grandmother who used this cream as a remedy for everything.  apparently it is especially helpful with \\&quot;swamp ass.\\&quot;  i&#x27;ll say no more.</li>
    <li> I also couldn&#x27;t wait to receive that cream. When I got it...cream all over the box. There was no packaging inside the box. I was very unhappy. I know that Penaten is great so I will order it again and hopefully with better luck.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream three generations of our family will use! We recommend for babies and adults alike.We depend on Amazon to order it.</li>
    <li> It is very creamy and smells nice. It definitely does the job!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! My dog had an allergy rash and this stuff had it cleared up in just a couple of days. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This cr&amp;egrave;me is not just a diaper cr&amp;egrave;me, I use it if I get a bad cold and my nose is raw from using tissues.  Just put some on your nose at bedtime and your nose is completely healed by the morning.  No more red nose!  I&#x27;ve bought this for a few friends and they are all hooked on it.  Also it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Penaten is the best diaper rash product I have used.  We lost our tube moving and tried other products but nothing works like this.  It clears to diaper rash up and makes my daughters skin soft</li>
    <li> My husbands mom used this cream when he was a child- as an adult we bought some while in Germany - thankfully we have been able to find more via internet. It is great for a variety of skin issues.</li>
    <li> Seems like it is a used one or returned by someone else which is not brand new.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I just keep it and am not going to return.</li>
    <li> If someone harnessed the power of the gods and put it into a diaper creme, Penaten is the result.</li>
    <li> first  product I have bought from amazon I am disappointed with.  I could have bought a larger amount at a cheaper price.  This was my fault for not really looking at what I was buying</li>
    <li> The best diaper creme we ever used. Before the internet, we could only get this stuff via international mail from my sister-in-law who lived overseas. Recently, I&#x27;ve been able to get it special-ordered from a local store, but as I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, my Prime account makes it so easy to order it here. We now buy it for friends and families with little ones. Penaten has never been inexpensive, but the quality of the product is not cheap. Great at quickly clearing a rash, better as a preventative.</li>
    <li> I bought this after doing some research about an ailment my german shepard was having.  It was very difficult to put on my dog because it was his gum area but it did seem to help.  I&#x27;ve used it on my daughter&#x27;s bottom for a diaper rash and it works fantastic! Smells great too!</li>
    <li> First used this in West Germany in 1981 for my newborn.  My wife insisted on this cream.  Her mother used it for her.  Being German they knew all about Penaten Cream.  Great cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream on all 7 of my grandkids and recommends it to ANY &amp; ALL parents &amp; grandparents my mother bought me my first can and I have absolutely not one bad thing to say about this cream it&#x27;s better then any product out there.......he&#x27;s a happy baby with what&#x27;s left of his rash</li>
    <li> I was given a tin of Penaten for my newborn son when we lived in Germany nearly 40 years ago.  Today, I buy it for my grandson.  Wonderful product that works when others fail.  Little to no fragrance and provides effective skin protection as well as acts as a healing agent when needed. Nice to be able to order it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> We have 9 months old and this is the only Cream that works. His skin is perfect. We used other cremes and the rush would not go away from wearing diaper. I am just ordering another 2 and just wanted to share with you that for me it is the best prodcut. My Mom used that on me(when I was a baby) when we lived in Europe. I don&#x27;t know why it is not available in USA.</li>
    <li> Nothing work better to rid of diaper rash.  So happy Amazon has this as no local store seems to carry it.  Better than any paste or other cream on the market.</li>
    <li> Best stuff we have found in four generations of tender diaper wearing behinds.</li>
    <li> This stuff works like magic. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the smoothness of the cream, and the subtle, clean smell.  Goes on evenly, smoothly and should work well.  I prefer this cream to the stronger, medicine smell of Calmoseptine although that cream works very well and protects the skin against moisture exceptionally well.  I expect the same from this cream.</li>
    <li> We alwayd use it when our baby has a diaper rash. We can see work almost right away on the diaper rash.</li>
    <li> This cream for my granddaughter is the best stuff ever!! She gets a rash so easy from any medications, strawberries, oranges, juices, tons of stuff, and this is the ONLY thing that helps her. We tried everything and nothing worked till we found this! I would recommend this to everyone. I know for our other kids when they have babies this will be in their shower gifts before baby even gets here!</li>
    <li> I started using this because a friend gave it to me to try...first off, this tin container comes with a lot of cream, way more than a tube of desitin, so its worth the money...on top of that its a really great product and keeps babys bottom from getting diaper rashes.  I even took it to my pediatrician and he said it had great ingredients.</li>
    <li> Best diaper cream ever</li>
    <li> My mother used this on my sister about 27 years ago while we were stationed in Germany.  This is a very thick cream.  I love it!  It&#x27;s the best diaper rash cream on the market in my opinion.  Worth the money.  I buy 2 and have one in my diaper bag and one in the room.  I have a 2 1/2 month old and it&#x27;s worked great for her.</li>
    <li> I used to bring this stuff back with me from Germany (the huge jar) it was the only cream that would help my poor lil baby girls behinds. This is the best cream in the world.</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders: rashes, skin irritations, even GSD lip pyroderma.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying it and buy this! It works.</li>
    <li> This product is the only thing that works on my son. He was born with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream!  Fixed our GSD&#x27;s lip issues she got from one of her bones.  Cleared it up in a few days</li>
    <li> A bit messy but definitely soothing.  I used for acne and it helped to heal.</li>
    <li> Love this product, old family doctor told us about it, after trying everything else, that didn&#x27;t work.  Every mother with babies especially should have this.  Once you try it you will be sold.  It works.</li>
    <li> We have been battling some mild diaper rash and this cream has been really good at drying out the skin. Also smells great! Nothing like it in the U.S. Totally worth the extra $ to get it shipped the next day.</li>
    <li> Best cream for weathered hands ever. It is very thick and takes awhile to being absorbed by your hands but it work. If you deal often with cracked skin like I do get this cream. Don&#x27;t know how works on babies lol.</li>
    <li> Great to prevent sunburn</li>
    <li> Are there any therapeutic effects for the lumps of mosquito？</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I first used it on my baby over 26 years ago and she never had diaper rash ever. It also works great dor chapped nose when you get a cold. Also great currently as a skin protectant when you have to wash a lot while working.</li>
    <li> works awesome! !! great to prevent diaper rash i would tell everyone about this stuff.</li>
    <li> After two girls and their after-poop rashes, we&#x27;d tried every cream out there. The ones with the words butt or cream or itin and ex in the names, all of them. None compare to Penaten. Rashes clear up over night (literally). Even bad, bumpy, red painful ones. This stuff is amazing and lasts for a long time. If you have trouble getting it out (on your fingers), it has probably dried out somehow and you should return it. I have noticed it get thicker the longer we use it but it doesn&#x27;t hamper its effectiveness or our ability to apply it. We&#x27;ll never need to use another product again!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended on several German Shepherd websites for a common problem that the dogs get with chapped and cracked corners of their lips.  I had tried many products and this is a true healing product.  It is a solid white cream and looks a little funny on his black face, but it is worth it to keep his lips soft and supple.  He does not try to lick it off either.&lt;br /&gt;I also used some on a very severe abrasion from a skate board accident on my daughter and it really helped the healing by keeping the sores moist and protected.  She also said that it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.  This is my new &#x27;go-to&#x27; cream for skin problems.  I keep a tin on a shelf in my kitchen and use it fairly regularly.</li>
    <li> I have a Boston Terrier.  Sometimes the folds on her face get red and irritated.  I read about this product on an online forum.  Wow!  It works!</li>
    <li> This is great!  My family has been using Penaten cream since 1966, while stationed in Berlin, Germany.  It is really good for rashes on the children (and many other issues) .  I&#x27;m glad that we can continue using it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, one of THE BEST ointments you&#x27;ll find. Most often used in Europe in the way Desitin is used in the US (for babies, diaper rash etc), it&#x27;s equally helpful for adults. It works for a variety of skin ailments, but beware that it&#x27;s VERY thick and will take some time to absorb into skin. Personally, I would only buy this in Europe because it can dry out if it&#x27;s old, but this is definitely worth every penny and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This baby cream is the best I have found for my little one. I recieved some as a baby shower gift for my first baby and now I&#x27;m back for more. The cream is really thick and has a lite clean smell. This is great for your little one who is still in diapers.</li>
    <li> BEST.  BABY.  PRODUCT.  EVER.</li>
    <li> I know this is suppose to be baby rash and what not but honestly it works for adult rash too. it works fast we love it. my family practically swears by it.</li>
    <li> my family has been usng the product of 20 plus years. i was so very excited when i found it on this website. I cleared my babys rash up very quickly with no staining of mess. Best EVR</li>
    <li> Not just for those precious baby butts.  I use it in the winter when my hands and face get chapped.  Put it on at night and the next morning its completely healed.</li>
    <li> This is the best diaper creme out there. Have never had an issue with diaper rash. My mom used it on all of her kids and will say the same thing. Amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the best rash cream I have ever used, it workes much better than the usual options available at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;I got it based on the reviews and I agree solidly, its the best out there.</li>
    <li> This is the best creme available on the market hands down. I have twins and they never had diaper rash for more than 1 day! This stuff rocks!!!</li>
    <li> Healed my puppy&#x27;s lip in a week. Now his lip is healed and back to normal. Saved a visit to the vet. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Works great for the German Shepherd we have.  She has chapped lips - in the corners of her mouth and this product cures that quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the best diaper cream we have ever found. Wish they would sell it in stores here in the states, we have provided it for all our grandchildren and friends over the last 14 yrs and have had good results with all of them.</li>
    <li> Really helps for skin protection</li>
    <li> Glad this is still around use it on my babies now bought it for my son&#x27;s son and helps itchy patches on my old skin too</li>
    <li> My son was born in a German hospital and they used it for his circumcision 23 years ago.  I had never heard of it before.  They sent me home with a can, and I truly think it helped with the pain.  While I was in Germany I bought it regularly (and cheaply) from the neighborhood market.  It&#x27;s expensive to buy it here in the U.S., but it&#x27;s totally worth it!  This stuff works like magic!</li>
    <li> This baby cream is the most wonderful stuff on the planet.  I used it 30 years ago on my daughter when we lived in Germany and remembered it when my newborn granddaughter got a little diaper rash.  I went hunting for it on the internet on the outside chance I might be able to find it.  Lucky me!  I ordered 4 of them to be sure we don&#x27;t run out any time soon.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It is the best baby cream I ever can recommend. Been using the product on our daughters when their were small and now continue to use it on our grand daughter. So glad Penaten Baby Cream is available for purchase in the States.</li>
    <li> My grandma used this on us kiddos when we were little ones growing up in the 80&#x27;s.  Every little scratch, rash or scrape would get a little bit of this along with some good old fashioned TLC and we were better because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this on my children after discovering it&#x27;s still being made in Germany!  Opening the metal tin, peeling off the protective paper and smelling the scent was so therapeutic.  Brought back fond memories of my childhood!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff still works just as well as it did 30+ years ago!  And it&#x27;s fun to hear our toddler says that she would like the \\&quot;nah-ten\\&quot; cream when she wants it!</li>
    <li> Good for dogs&#x27; lip pyoderma.  Or at least that&#x27;s what the internet told me.  Seems to be helping so far.</li>
    <li> My dog gets chapped dry crusty lips every now and then during the winter.  After researching various dog owner sites, many owners recommend this as a remedy.  Sure enough when I apply this to my dog&#x27;s lips, his lips stay supple and moist during the winter season.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for healing skin</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous cream. A most exceptional product with many uses. My Grand-Mumzy has a can of this cream which was purchased over 48 years ago overseas. It has not spoiled, nor has it changed in any manner. Therefore, my Mumzy was quite happy when she found out that it was indeed possible to purchase the cream via internet. How very blessed we are to be able to find Penaten products via Amazon. Thank you Amazon! You are purr-fect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ko-Ko the Cat</li>
    <li> I rarely wax on so poetically about a product I truly love. Penaten is this product. I&#x27;ve been using it since I was a child and my own siblings babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fieriest diaper rashes and worst prickly heat have a silver bullet: Penaten cream. Take it from a mom with sensitive skin, this thick, white cream is next to magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why this wonder solution isn&#x27;t available in the United States is beyond me, but I make a pilgrimage to Canada every few weeks to buy another two tins for my son and my personal use. Though widely marketed in Canada and Europe as a baby cream, Penaten serves multiple purposes: to soften calluses, moisturize deeply cracked skin, protect cuticles and blisters formed by sandal straps, and so much more. Its formula tackles the worst skin irritation, cuts, and chafing. My sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t flare up thanks to a lack of excessive additives and perfumes found in other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penaten comes out extremely thick. A little goes a long way; just a dab will do for all but the toughest jobs. When dealing with diaper rash, I apply a light coating to the affected area and then more directly onto the diaper itself. The cream soothes and immediately relieves itchiness, then continues to moisturize for several hours. When nothing else works, Penaten gets results. Bleeding, raw rashes respond effectively. We use this religiously in my household when baby&#x27;s bottom starts to look red or feel hot. For extra effectiveness, we put extra on him for his overnight diaper. Every morning, the redness is substantially diminished if not completely gone. For my own cracked hands, slathering on the cream on the affected area and wrapping my hands in warm washcloths does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A&amp;D ointment and Desitin don&#x27;t hold a candle to Penaten for me, and I&#x27;ve used them as well as other samples. Penaten is far creamer and smoother in texture, mildly scented, and far more effective on all fronts. To each their own, but I wouldn&#x27;t travel five feet from the house without a small tin in the diaper bag. Consider it an essential.rom the house without a small tin in the diaper bag. Consider it an essential.</li>
    <li> While stationed in Germany 35 years ago our daughter had a diaper rash nothing would fix.  A friend mentioned Penaten Cream.  I was desperate and  purchased a small tin.  It is thick and can be difficult to spread but it was perfect.  Well, now my granddaughter gets diaper rashes that crack, bleed and are very painful.  It worked once and was worth trying on her.  Ordered the cream, sent it to our daughter and our granddaughter now has a healthy bottom.  If nothing else works for a diaper rash - try Penaten Creme.</li>
    <li> Works better than any lotion I have ever used</li>
    <li> Penaten baby cream can also works on cuts, scrapes and blisters.  Protects the cuts and helps them to heal faster.</li>
    <li> There are comments of this cream being magical and I believe it is. Not only for babies, but for any irritation of the skin, even helps when the intimate parts of the body are irritated, relieves and prevents.</li>
    <li> I love this diaper rash cream!! We started using this when living overseas and when we moved back and had more kids, I had a friend send it from Germany!</li>
    <li> I had read on some dog forums that this cream worked great for rashes, etc on dogs.  So I tried it on our boxer dog who always has rashes and some kind of issue and it worked great.  It cleared it up in a few days.  The challenge was keeping him from licking it off, but you have that with most things.  I know this would work great with diaper rash and keeping baby bottoms dry and irritation free.</li>
    <li> This is the best diaper rash cream I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. It&#x27;s thick and stays where it&#x27;s put. Heals the redness well. I&#x27;ve bough several now.</li>
    <li> Works nicely but I am always leery of products that you can&#x27;t read. Everything is written in German. Oh well.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME!  I saw reviews on this to help with crusty lips on German Shepherds.  After a few days, my pup Freddy was all healed.  I would recommend this to any one.</li>
    <li> This diaper cream is amazing!  Heals irritation in one application! My baby went from screaming with the application of other creams to happy when I used this product! I recommend it to everyone and we use it exclusivly now!</li>
    <li> My Diesel had severe lip fold pyoderma. His gowls were swollen and bleeding. This product is amazing!! Within a few days his gowls started healing! I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied! Penaten is a miracle!</li>
    <li> After having tried nearly every diaper cream out there, Penaten is the ONLY one that works. My daughter rarely gets rashes, but when she does, they get back quick. I was desperate and gave this one a shot. The active ingredient, panthenol seems to be the trick (you can buy pure panthenol sold as a burn cream on Amazon as well - again highly recommended for severe rashes).  Cannot say enough about this cream!</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than I expected and is working great! I would recommend this to anyone! No complaints at all, everything was perfect! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I actually used Penaten for a bad, itchy skin rash I had. It was very soothing.It is quite waterproof and somewhat difficult to wash off but I&#x27;m sure it would make a great diaper rash cream too! Pleasant fragrance, very light.</li>
    <li> When my  mother was bedridden she got bedsores and I introduced this to the nurses taking care of her. They were all amazed how quickly the creme went to work. They ordered the creme and started using it. It is also great to treat burns. No scars No blisters</li>
    <li> We have used this cream for everything for years! Heals skin irritation/ diaper rash fast! Very thick and does not come off fast.</li>
    <li> My baby has got some rash in his neck folds, I applied this cream for two days the rash was completely gone!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell(when will brands realize that adding fragrance to a diaper rash cream can actually HARM and WORSEN the rash?!  Come on!!!)and it did absolutely nothing for my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash.  What a waste!!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve read some of my other reviews on skin care products you&#x27;ll know my daughter struggled with eczema and is now dealing with red skin syndrome/topical steroid withdrawal (for more info, see the ITSAN website). As a result, her skin often splits in the back of the knees, the elbow crooks, and on her neck. Penaten is the best cream we have found to protect those areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The cream is thick, so it can be put on as heavily and wide as you need (applying it can actually be a bit painful if the skin is very sensitive, but what are you going to do?), also, it is white and will be very noticeable&lt;br /&gt;2. The cream is slow to absorb or wear off, so it provides many hours of protection even under clothing - long enough for the school day and even beyond&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s soothing and even a little moisturizing (though for serious moisturizing, look for unrefined shea butter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for something to protect your damaged skin, I can think of nothing better.</li>
    <li> Great to have on hand.  Great for baby diaper rash.  It was also recommended for my dog that had a rash.  Worked great.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best diaper rash cream in the world. You will not be disappointed. Fantastic for sensitive skin and mild to severe diaper rash. Clears up over night/during nap time. Worth the money as you need to use very little compared to other brands. It is a bit har to get off your hands because of the water barrier properties but just use a wipe and it comes off fine.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream on my daughter back in 1981 when she was a baby. She had the most sensitive skin and this product soothed her skin immediately and healed her rashes. Fast forward to 2015 and her son has the same sensitive skin. I was elated to find this product here on Amazon. I highly recommend this product . It works and heals rashes faster than any product on the market.It is well worth the price .</li>
    <li> Penaten - Great cream for babaies&#x27; diaper rash but it&#x27;s not just for babies! Great for females! I also use it when biking long distances - very soothing!</li>
    <li> This cream really helps with extreme skin conditions.  It&#x27;s like &amp;#34;comfort food&amp;#34; for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;So happy my friend introduced me to this.</li>
    <li> When my daughter was born we wanted to go all natural.  We used cloth diapers and stayed away from any creams.  The only thing we would use was Vaseline on occasion.  Everything was great until she started crawling.  I noticed that she began to get diaper rash.  I believe it was due to the cloth diaper constantly rubbing against her bum.  This was when we finally gave in and started to use creams.  Of course we turned to the usual creams found in stores, Desitin, Boudreaux’s Butt Paste, and Balmex.  These creams worked at first but the diaper rash came back within a few days and would get worse.  Her diaper rash got to the point where they were now raw sores and bleeding.  It’s heartbreaking to see your child in plain but you can&#x27;t do anything about it.  While searching online for natural remedies I came across Penaten.  I read several great reviews about it and bought it right away with rush delivery.  The diaper rash went away the very next morning!  Now when her bum looks slightly red I use the Penaten and the next morning it is gone.  She hasn&#x27;t even had a diaper rash for months now.  I use it for almost every diaper change.  The one container last a pretty long time too, about 1-1.5 months for me and the for the price of $15-$18, it is well worth it.  We also stopped using cloth diapers.  I am all for cloth diapers but my little one is a big mover and is difficult to change already.  I would recommend Penaten to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and helped with rash</li>
    <li> This was given to me by my German friend with a note saying &amp;#34;BEST BUTT CREAM&amp;#34; for our newborn and it seriously is.  My son is now 2 and his diapers are just now causing rashes and this stuff clears it up in 24 hrs!!!  Highly recommended!  Better than &amp;#34;Butt Paste&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Grandma Ell&#x27;s&amp;#34; and Destine.  Its magic!</li>
    <li> Luv this product. It really helped my newborns diaper rash go away in a matter of days and does not stick on clothes or hands. It actually helped my dry hands as well</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well for a long standing skin problem.  Recommended by my doctor who heard about it from another of her patients.  Very satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> Years ago you could only purchase this product in Canada.  My daughter who is now 19 had severe diaper rash and eczema.  She was uncomfortable and cried all the time.  The doctors would perscribe cortizone which wouldn&#x27;t help at all.  A friend gave me this and after one day of use all her problems were resolved. Fast forward a few years.  She still uses this for her eczema and my dad who is 72 suffers skin problems which penaten has resolved.  This time around I accidenty ordered the baby creme but the original cream smell clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Got rid of his chapped lips in about 4 days. Yes he looked silly with diaper cream on his lips but it really worked. I found a GSD web site and one of the bloggers swore by Penaten cream. I do, too! Worth the price....tin was huge.</li>
    <li> Need I say more? If you suffer from chronic skin irritation or itch this product is worth every penny and more.</li>
    <li> My parents used to buy this at a old German Deli in Southern California when I was a baby. My dad has always said it is the best you can buy for rashes. So I took to the internet and found it, and I will have to say...Dad was right!! Clears even the littlest bit of redness up over night.</li>
    <li> I used this on my son in Germany 23 years ago. It was the best stuff ever. I am so happy that I am now able to treat my grandchildren to this soothing cream. Heals diaper rash like magic.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need much of this stuff to get the benefits. My son has never had diaper rash of any kind. And he loves to play with the tin lid while I change him.    Update: my son is now 2.5 years old. And a little less than a quarter is left in the tin. This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a great diaper cream. I absolutely love this product. It&#x27;s a thicker cream upon applying but turns somewhat powdery after a while. My baby hasn&#x27;t really had much diaper rashes. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Great cream!  No diaper rashes ever since we started using this on our baby girl.</li>
    <li> We bought this because my husband is German and this is what he used as a baby and he was excited to get it for his own kids. I&#x27;m not crazy about it though- it does work to prevent diaper rash I will give it that. I reeeaalllly dislike how sticky it is though. It sticks to the hands and doesn&#x27;t rub well on the baby butt. I also hate the packaging- it comes in a tin which you have to dip your hands in meaning that you invariably:&lt;br /&gt; 1) Take too much out&lt;br /&gt; 2) Not Hygienic after you&#x27;ve been wiping a poopy butt to dip your hands into a container&lt;br /&gt;3) The container doesn&#x27;t screw or pop on so if you turn it upside down the lid falls off which means it&#x27;s not transportable in a diaper bag unless you use a rubber band or you like living dangerously.&lt;br /&gt;4) Since it&#x27;s so easy to open a two year old can open it and paint butt cream all over their body and face like a powdery commando.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Baby Cream- Just as effective, not as sticky, easy peasy squeeze bottle container that I can throw in my diaper bag.</li>
    <li> I have two kids who use cloth diapers.  When they have a diaper rash, this cream seals out the future urine moisture in the diaper allowing the skin to stay dry and heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for three years now and am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream you can buy anywhere.  It&#x27;s hard to find unless you go to Amazon.  Raised three babies on it and now that they are older, I give it to them for their kids.  Good for what ails adults too.</li>
    <li> This is the best to use on even the slightest sign of redness on babies! It works almostr immediately and we used it with both of our children!!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest cream not only for babies diaper rash (which is fantastic) but continues to heal rashes and skin problems even later.  Recently I went to Germany and bought 3 &#x27;tins&#x27; of the crème for my niece who has been using it for 20+ years....since it is difficult to purchase in the USA, and almost triple the price on my favorite &#x27;AMAZON&#x27;......I purchased 3 of the 150mi for 3.99Euros and then to my disbelief the customs confiscated the crème ?????? saying it exceeded the &#x27;liquid limit&#x27;.  Who would of thought Penaten crème would be a &#x27;terrorist&#x27; threat.....I was very upset.....but thanks to AMAZON.....I ordered and sent to my niece....from the Good Ole&#x27; USA.....The Best Country ever to live in.....God Bless the USA!</li>
    <li> I have really bad weather relate breaks in my fingers and this has helped a lot.  I am very well pleased with this product</li>
