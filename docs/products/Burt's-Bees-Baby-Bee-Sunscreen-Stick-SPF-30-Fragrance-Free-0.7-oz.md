### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for sticking in a purse or backpack on those days you need sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Best sunscreen ever!!</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is great for getting on those toddler faces!</li>
      <li>Its a great sunscreen that you don&#x27;t have to worry about once applied.</li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>i really happy to buy this item</li>
      <li>Works great and smells great.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>I am sure it is a great product, but either the distributor is the issue on this occasion or maybe I just received a product that had been returned before.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>It takes warm water, soap, and persistence.</li>
      <li>even though it&#x27;s good stuff, I have been searching for more of this and will be getting it from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easy, and rubs in fairly well.</li>
      <li>Thanks for a great product</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I love the sun and am in it all day.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product that doesn&#x27;t go on really easily but is portable, not messy, and you feel good about it.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a natural, effective sunscreen and aren&#x27;t scared of products whose main purpose is NOT to make you look like a model under the sun, then this is perfect for you.</li>
      <li>Great product for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Love this - wasn&#x27;t sure I would as I thought the stick was too small to get good coverage quickly on an antsy child; however, it works well</li>
      <li>The scent is pretty neutral, and it is not oily, which is great because when my kids rub water out of their eyes the sunscreen does not run into their eyes or make them red or irritated.  </li>
      <li>For people wanting true protection from the suns rays</li>
      <li>- you can see the full list of ingredients from Burt Bees&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>The California Baby stick is also great and doesn&#x27;t break her out, but this one tends to be a little cheaper.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected  Good service</li>
      <li>My only tip is that after applying the stick over the face, use your fingers to spread it around more evenly.</li>
      <li>Also, the cap constantly falls off so that dries it out/hardens it even more....</li>
      <li>and she suddenly started enjoying the application of sunblock when we started using it.  </li>
      <li>She has gotten more cooperative about letting me put sunblock on her, but I definitely found the stick application was easiest for her face</li>
      <li>The most recent bottle of Badger seems to clog pores on her face, so</li>
      <li>I want to like this because of the ingredient list and convenience, but it&#x27;s really kind of too thick to go on well and easily.</li>
      <li>If you do some research you can find that certain sunscreens actually can cause more damage to your skin than just not wearing any at all.</li>
      <li>Loved this one for my little man!</li>
      <li>I needed this for a large scar and as long as I re-apply at least every hour, it works superbly.  </li>
      <li>So I dug out the sunscreen &amp; found a fairly large diameter plastic post that the stick is mounted onto.</li>
      <li>I believe it will take a foundation over it, but I cannot be certain as I do not use foundation.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works very well.  </li>
      <li>and she really does not like having a residue on her ears.</li>
      <li>My cat has lost much of her hair where I applied it</li>
      <li>So it is very impractical.</li>
      <li>Found this on a list that says this has adequate sun protection and lasts pretty long from some scientists (I don&#x27;t remember the study).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Once you take a couple of minutes to rub it in, you&#x27;ll realize the waxy feeling goes away, no white residue is left, and you run no risk of the sunscreen rubbing of from sweating, swimming or light towelling.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy to apply if you only need a small amount</li>
      <li>but when once I got under the top coat, it was firm but OK to apply on my face as one would with a hard lipstick.  </li>
      <li>This is so easy to wipe over there little faces that even my 3 year old puts it on herself!</li>
      <li>I have tried a number of sunblocks for my daughter, almost 2 years old.  </li>
      <li>like that it has no smell whatsoever and is 100% natural</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of Badger and California Baby on her since she was 6 months old.  </li>
      <li>Works great, but very difficult to rub in.  </li>
      <li>We live in Florida so keeping the kids protected from the sun, especially in the summer is critical.</li>

<li> only cause it goes on a little thick</li>
<li> It has a slight sticky feel</li>
<li> I bet there would be a lot less skin cancer...</li>
<li> But it won&#x27;t give you cancer, disrupt your endocrine system, impact your reproductive system or mess with your health in any way.</li>
<li> The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t apply easily, as the stick is very hard, and it is very difficult to get it off their ears afterwards.</li>
<li> My intent is not to use it as a sunscreen while sunbathing at the beach/outdoors but rather as an everyday use while going about my business indoors and outdoors.</li>
<li> I apply only a thin layer.  </li>
<li> I like that it had relatively few chemicals in it though.</li>
<li> So convenient in a little stick!</li>
<li> No comments on its intended use for babies except that, as I said, the stick is very hard at room temps of about 70 degrees F.</li>
<li> I did not take it out of the box as the seal on the stick was already visibly broken.</li>
<li> Seems to be a bad batch I received.</li>
<li> HATE to get the spray sunscreen on their face</li>

    <li> I did not take it out of the box as the seal on the stick was already visibly broken. The packaging looked weathered and it appeared to have been opened already. I am sure it is a great product, but either the distributor is the issue on this occasion or maybe I just received a product that had been returned before. I will now be returning it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Works great and smells great. We have a pool and my kids HATE to get the spray sunscreen on their face so I spray their bodies and use this stick on their faces. Perfect for sticking in a purse or backpack on those days you need sunscreen. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy to apply if you only need a small amount</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! We live in Florida so keeping the kids protected from the sun, especially in the summer is critical. This is so easy to wipe over there little faces that even my 3 year old puts it on herself! It lasts quite a while before needing to be re applied</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a natural, effective sunscreen and aren&#x27;t scared of products whose main purpose is NOT to make you look like a model under the sun, then this is perfect for you. Its a great sunscreen that you don&#x27;t have to worry about once applied. It goes on with resistance and will leave a white residue INITIALLY. Once you take a couple of minutes to rub it in, you&#x27;ll realize the waxy feeling goes away, no white residue is left, and you run no risk of the sunscreen rubbing of from sweating, swimming or light towelling. Your face will be thoroughly protected and won&#x27;t require constant reapplication. No breakouts. No burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t shimmer, it won&#x27;t look like you just applied moroccan oil all over for a photoshoot. But it won&#x27;t give you cancer, disrupt your endocrine system, impact your reproductive system or mess with your health in any way.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of sunblocks for my daughter, almost 2 years old.  She has gotten more cooperative about letting me put sunblock on her, but I definitely found the stick application was easiest for her face and she suddenly started enjoying the application of sunblock when we started using it.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of Badger and California Baby on her since she was 6 months old.  The most recent bottle of Badger seems to clog pores on her face, so even though it&#x27;s good stuff, I have been searching for more of this and will be getting it from Amazon.  The California Baby stick is also great and doesn&#x27;t break her out, but this one tends to be a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> For people wanting true protection from the suns rays this is what you should be using. If the world would eliminate every other sunscreen and just use this one I bet there would be a lot less skin cancer...etc. In the world. If you do some research you can find that certain sunscreens actually can cause more damage to your skin than just not wearing any at all. These ingredients are legit. If anybody can find me a bigger size than this little tube plz let me know</li>
    <li> Finally found a sunscreen to use on my child!  He has had an allergic reaction to everything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> Found this on a list that says this has adequate sun protection and lasts pretty long from some scientists (I don&#x27;t remember the study). I use it for my tattoos only cause it goes on a little thick and I don&#x27;t like the feeling on my face</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well.

    <li> I want to like this because of the ingredient list and convenience, but it&#x27;s really kind of too thick to go on well and easily. Also, the cap constantly falls off so that dries it out/hardens it even more....</li>
    <li> I needed this for a large scar and as long as I re-apply at least every hour, it works superbly.  I love the sun and am in it all day.  Thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> This left a white residue that was hard to rub in! I like that it had relatively few chemicals in it though.</li>
    <li> Works great, but very difficult to rub in.  Leaves quite a chalky appearance on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great. i really happy to buy this item</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great for getting on those toddler faces! It goes on easy, and rubs in fairly well. It didn&#x27;t seep into her eyes when she sweats like other sunscreens have.</li>
    <li> There have been suggestions for using this on cats as a sunscreen because it is non-toxic for them. The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t apply easily, as the stick is very hard, and it is very difficult to get it off their ears afterwards. It takes warm water, soap, and persistence. So it is very impractical. My cat has lost much of her hair where I applied it and she really does not like having a residue on her ears. On to the next product. No comments on its intended use for babies except that, as I said, the stick is very hard at room temps of about 70 degrees F.</li>
    <li> I use it for myself (rather than baby) to prevent future formation of dark spots on my face as I had some removed earlier.  My intent is not to use it as a sunscreen while sunbathing at the beach/outdoors but rather as an everyday use while going about my business indoors and outdoors. It was quite hard when when I first opened it but when once I got under the top coat, it was firm but OK to apply on my face as one would with a hard lipstick.  It is white but smooths out well and does not make me appear ghostly even  though I have a brown complexion (think Pacific islander).  I apply only a thin layer.  It has a slight sticky feel but I do mind as I as used to using oils like jojoba, almond, etc. as a moisturizer anyway.  I believe it will take a foundation over it, but I cannot be certain as I do not use foundation.  I cannot attest to its potency to prevent burns as I do not sunbath.  I  like that it has no smell whatsoever and is 100% natural - you can see the full list of ingredients from Burt Bees&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year. This is probably my 5th stick to try &amp; after a couple of uses something inside the stick started scratching my skin. I thought it might just be a filament or some manufacturing artifact, so I tried to pull it out with tweezers. It wouldn&#x27;t budge. So I dug out the sunscreen &amp; found a fairly large diameter plastic post that the stick is mounted onto. Seems to be longer than desired &amp; the end is quite sharp. Sharp enough to draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Past return window, but seems that since it&#x27;s a defective product I should get a reimbursement for the cost. I only paid $4.99 so maybe they were getting rid of defective products at a firesale price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited:&lt;br /&gt;Opened 3rd stick of 5 ordered &amp; it also has the plastic post defect. Seems to be a bad batch I received.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that doesn&#x27;t go on really easily but is portable, not messy, and you feel good about it.</li>
    <li> Loved this one for my little man! Not greasy at all!</li>
