    <li> I bought these ashes after hearing good things about red cherry. I originally had the Ardell wispies (which I ended up ruined when I washed them; don&#x27;t do that, I had to throw out ALL 4 of my pairs), but I had finally learned to put on lashes, so I wanted to be adventurous. These lashes are very nice, but they are a bit wide! When I mean wide, I mean they literally go from the corner of the eye to the outside corner. This is easily fixed by doing a wing with your liner! I recommend these lashes!</li>

    <li> So easy to put on, I had problems with other brands because they weren&#x27;t rounded enough (these are perfect for big round eyes like mine) and the strip itself is very thin so you never feel like they&#x27;re on, perfect since I wear them everyday at work.</li>

    <li> Eh, they are alright, I had to double stack them, but personally I love ridiculously long lashes.</li>
    <li> Love it! Red cherry has now become my favorite brand for false lashes</li>
    <li> Awesome only ones I will.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these lashes, as of lately I been obsessed with lashes.  I heard about Red Cherry lashes and decided to give them a try.  I did a nice smokey eye with these.

    <li> Love the lashes! They are full enough for me! A bit long for a more dramatic look. I love the red cherry brand. I&#x27;m still using my 1st pair &amp; it&#x27;s been like 4 days.</li>

    <li> Very pretty eyelashes. I love make up and I just started wearing eyelashes. These are natural looking but pretty long which make them dramatic. However, love them. They&#x27;re very soft and I love the thin clear band. You do not need eyeliner to cover the band which is great. Would order them again, just wish they weren&#x27;t so long!</li>

    <li> Very good quality. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Definetly longer than expected ,but really nice lashes will give them a try .</li>
    <li> Everything is wonderful</li>
    <li> I was so pleased with the results of these eyelashes! They are amazing, they have a very lightweight feeling to them you can barely feel you even got falsies on. They last all day without getting lose or anything &amp; they bring out great volume to your lashes, since they are more natural looking I do wear it on a day to day basis. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase &amp; would recommend this to anyone! Shipping was pretty fast as well!</li>
    <li> I ordered a whole bunch of red cherry lashes one night and never regretted the purchase. They came within the time lapse given for there arrival and they are beautiful. I&#x27;ve used the #415 and #43 lashes already and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> The 415s are my FAVORITE everyday lash. It looks very natural and people never ask if I&#x27;m wearing falsies. I also love the brand Red Cherry (and Ardell) because of how their bands adhere so well to my lash line, and how they&#x27;re reusable for up to a month if you clean and care for them diligently :)</li>
    <li> These lashes are beautiful and slightly dramatic which I like a lot.  They are a little stiff and easy to damage but I love the look.</li>
    <li> As far as false lashes go, these are some of the best. I love that they are made of real hair. They are light and can be worn all day without giving my sensitive eyes any problems. I have to cut these a little bit to make them fit my eyes. Most of the time I don&#x27;t have to cut the end of false lash strips but after that, they fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Love the glamorous look!</li>
    <li> This is my second order from this seller and I absolutely love the promptness of my order! The quality of the eyelashes is great!</li>
    <li> Nice lashes but too long for everyday wear. Could also be thicker.</li>
    <li> This is just what i wanted and expected from these Red Cherry False Eyelashes i would sure get some more Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite eyelashes. Everyone always compliments me when I have them on. Definitely a must!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE! Omg. Ok so red cherry has been my fav lash brand for a while. I went out on a limb and bought the 415s to take a break from my 43s and I like these just as much..or more! Fantastic. I love that they don&#x27;t flare out as much on the end as the 43s cause it&#x27;s a more natural look. Beautiful with winged liner or without.</li>
    <li> Fantastic lashes! They look pretty on almost all eye shapes and sizes and the silicone band means a good, solid adhesion every time with no lifting.</li>
