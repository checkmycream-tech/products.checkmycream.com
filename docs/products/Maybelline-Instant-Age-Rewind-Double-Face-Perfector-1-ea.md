      <li>This highlighter concealer duo works great for me.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a nice portable size also.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to blend</li>
      <li>I think the fair color was spot-on for my light skin.</li>
      <li>This has always been the perfect concealer as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>

      <li>My favorite is the highlighter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using the highlighter to work my magic</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite concealers.</li>
      <li>I love the concealer on one end</li>
      <li>One more thing...</li>
      <li>The highlighter side appears (visually)  to be more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; of product.</li>
      <li>I am no longer able to get this.</li>
      <li>1/17/2016 Still my favorite.</li>
      <li>but I really love the highlighter.</li>
      <li>This is a unique product!</li>
      <li>I love how the consistency is light</li>
      <li>Saw this concealer rated as one of the best products on Paula&#x27;s Choice website, and had to purchase it due to the affordable price.</li>
      <li>Packs easily.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and the color is easily blended in.</li>
      <li>It gives average coverage, but the highlighter is great!</li>
      <li>It is a creamy formula and does not sink into my fine lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>but I found that I have to moisturize well before using this under my eyes, or it will emphasize fine lines.</li>
      <li>I use this as an highlighter and not a concealer because it is light for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>This is FAR superior.</li>
      <li>had to give it a five, is very creamy and easy to apply and it hides mostly everything.</li>
      <li>I ordered Light 710, and it was light enough for my fair skin.</li>
      <li>It is very lightweight and applies very smooth and shear, which is what I prefer.</li>
      <li>so I was surprised how much I liked this.</li>
      <li>I dot it on sparingly, and then use a fine brush to place it exactly where needed.</li>
      <li>It was fine the first couple of uses but now it seems like the concealer has run out.</li>
      <li>Quick transaction.  </li>
      <li>This does an adequate job of concealing</li>
      <li>This is a great cover up...age spots, spider veins and dark circles disappear without cakiness.</li>
      <li>Conceals my dark under eye circles greatly.</li>
      <li>Sadly it&#x27;s no longer available in stores because it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best product I have ever used for dark under eye circles.</li>
      <li>Really fast delivery and just what I wanted!!</li>
      <li>Many are off as far as color or coverage or cakiness.  </li>
      <li>If you like a lot of coverage, this probably isn&#x27;t for you, but if you prefer a more natural look, you will probably like it.</li>
      <li>The concealer is just the right shade and works great for the light dark circles I occasionally get, and</li>
      <li>I love the Maybeline instant age rewind line of goods..</li>
      <li>It is unfortunate Maybelline stopped producing this- one of the best concealers out there.</li>
      <li>This dries very fast and it blends very well.</li>
      <li>It lasts pretty much all day.</li>
      <li>It just takes a small amount, and does a good job of highlighting.</li>
      <li>It really does exceed expectations.</li>
      <li>It is very affordable and you can find it in any store.</li>
      <li>I really like how this product works.</li>
      <li>I do think it&#x27;s better to blend this in with a wet beauty blender and not a brush.  </li>
      <li>This one not so much.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that there seems to be far more highlighter than concealer...</li>
      <li>I use it for special occasions only</li>
      <li>Most concealers that do cover the dark circles, will settle into creases.</li>
      <li>I have tried 30+ brands, including high end ones for $35+ per tube.</li>
      <li>It does it&#x27;s job of concealing extremely well without being thick and dry-looking like the kind of concealers that tend to exaggerate the fine lines under the eye area.</li>
      <li>Unlike other concealers, it doesn&#x27;t collect in the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>This double face perfector lets me blend concealer with highlighter to get just the right shade and coverage.</li>
      <li>the highlighter on the other end is fantastic-</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s nice enough to use everyday as well.</li>
      <li>Goes on thin, and creamy smooth, and turns into a smooth silky powdery finish.</li>
      <li>They obviously don&#x27;t make it anymore and the stuff I got must have been sitting in a hot warehouse for years.</li>
      <li>I am near 30, and noticing a few fine lines under my eyes.</li>
      <li>No heavy, cakey feel, or look.</li>
      <li>I am extremely fair skinned and it&#x27;s hard to find a concealer that will cover my blemishes without looking too dark for my skin.  </li>
      <li>It has two different brushes, a spongy one for the concealer and a normal stranded brush for the highlighter.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this highlighter and concealer particularly for dark circles under the eyes.</li>
      <li>For the record I am very fair-skinned, with pink undertones and those darn undereye circles which I guess are a genetic gift, since I&#x27;ve had them since I was a child and no amount of sleep or exercise or water will rid me of them.</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is that you really don&#x27;t get much product for your money.</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone, particularly if you are suffering with dark under eye circles.</li>
      <li>This stuff works quite well, but there isn&#x27;t as much product in the little bottle ends as I would have hoped.</li>

    <li> This highlighter concealer duo works great for me. I&#x27;m on my third tube. It is very lightweight and applies very smooth and shear, which is what I prefer. If you like a lot of coverage, this probably isn&#x27;t for you, but if you prefer a more natural look, you will probably like it. The highlighter works well as a &amp;#34;eye brightener&amp;#34; and/or an eye shadow base. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that there seems to be far more highlighter than concealer...I always run out of concealer long before the highlighter is empty, even though I feel like I am using equal amounts of each. The highlighter side appears (visually)  to be more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; of product.</li>
    <li> Love this concealer/high lighter! They don&#x27;t sell these in drug stores anymore but I&#x27;ve been using this for years! However the price has gone up recently from when I last purchased it :(</li>
    <li> Love this product - and it looks like manufacturer does not sell anymore - was so happy to have found.  Quick transaction.  thank you.</li>
    <li> I am extremely fair skinned and it&#x27;s hard to find a concealer that will cover my blemishes without looking too dark for my skin.  This double face perfector lets me blend concealer with highlighter to get just the right shade and coverage. Perfect for under-eye circles.  The only complaint I have is that you really don&#x27;t get much product for your money.</li>
    <li> I found this product very disappointing.  Difficult to figure out how to get any cream out of the device and once I did, it did not cover well at all.  I&#x27;ll go back to my other, less expensive product.</li>
    <li> It was great to find this discontinued item at a very reasonable price.  Shipping was good, no issues at all.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Conceals perfectly, and I love that it has the concealer and highlighter because they both work great! Conceals my dark under eye circles greatly.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to help highlight my face and conceal under eye darkness with bags using some makeup tricks. It was fine the first couple of uses but now it seems like the concealer has run out. I only used it about 4 times. I&#x27;m using the highlighter to work my magic but I will not buy the Mabelline Instant Age Rewind Face Perfector again. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had bought this product previously locally, but it has been replaced by Maybelline.  I was thankful to find it on amazon.  It is a great eye hi-lighter.  Helps bring out the eyes and lighten dark shadows.</li>
    <li> This is a great cover up...age spots, spider veins and dark circles disappear without cakiness. It lasts pretty much all day. I wish it would go back into production. It&#x27;s the best product for coverage that I have found. I also like the highlighter, but use the concealer daily. My only complaint is that there is such a small amount of product in each pkg., however, still well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I use this as an highlighter and not a concealer because it is light for my skin tone. This dries very fast and it blends very well. I do think it&#x27;s better to blend this in with a wet beauty blender and not a brush.  It is very affordable and you can find it in any store.</li>
    <li> I love the Maybeline instant age rewind line of goods.. This one not so much. You get very little in each bottle and it applies very cake like. Thick! Too thick. Sets into creases and makes them worse.. Also not ideal for application on any dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite concealers. I like that it has a light and darker shade, so I can use which works best on the areas of kmy eyes and face.</li>
    <li> Sadly, this has been discontinued, but I love it. The concealer is just the right shade and works great for the light dark circles I occasionally get, and the highlighter on the other end is fantastic- it makes me glow as opposed to sparkle.</li>
    <li> This does an adequate job of concealing but I found that I have to moisturize well before using this under my eyes, or it will emphasize fine lines. I dot it on sparingly, and then use a fine brush to place it exactly where needed. I then place a tiny bit of the highlighter over the concealer. I would have given three stars to the concealer, but because of the highlighter, gave it four stars.</li>
    <li> I like the consistency of this concealer.  It&#x27;s very easy to blend and it also does a good job of hiding imperfections.  I have a neutral feeling about the highlighting portion of the product.  I&#x27;ve tried it a few times, but I&#x27;m not sure I really noticed any \\&quot;highlighting\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I never wear makeup, not even eyeliner or mascara (I&#x27;m 18) so I was surprised how much I liked this. I use it for special occasions only but it&#x27;s nice enough to use everyday as well. The concealer works well but I really love the highlighter. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> the concealer got kind of dry and weird, while the highlighter remained useless, as it didn&#x27;t show up at all.</li>
    <li> Really fast delivery and just what I wanted!! Thank you for making great products like this  this affordable and for such superior service!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it under my eyes as a concealer/brightner.  Unlike other concealers, it doesn&#x27;t collect in the fine lines under my eyes. Perfect for the \\&quot;mature\\&quot; under eye area.</li>
    <li> It is unfortunate Maybelline stopped producing this- one of the best concealers out there.</li>
    <li> I used the concealer, and the highlighter. The concealer is thin, but covers smoothly. It has decent coverage for going on thin. No heavy, cakey feel, or look. My favorite is the highlighter. It just takes a small amount, and does a good job of highlighting. When you use either one, just use a tiny, tiny amount...a little goes a long way. Not a great concealer, but it works well for aging skin. If you want to brighten any part of your face, it works great. Goes on thin, and creamy smooth, and turns into a smooth silky powdery finish. The reason for 4 stars, instead of 5, is the concealer. It gives average coverage, but the highlighter is great! One more thing...the color was just how i expected it to be. I ordered Light 710, and it was light enough for my fair skin.</li>
    <li> This concealer and highlighter duo does the job and it does it well. It&#x27;s so convenient that they included a highlighter color as well for an extra pop when applied under the eyes. It is a creamy formula and does not sink into my fine lines under my eyes. It has two different brushes, a spongy one for the concealer and a normal stranded brush for the highlighter. It&#x27;s a nice portable size also. It conceals so well, I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> had to give it a five, is very creamy and easy to apply and it hides mostly everything. Personally i have dark circles under my eyes and nothing has ever managed to cover it up untill now that is. Already recommended it to a close friend who deals with the s as me delema.</li>
    <li> i loved it&lt;br /&gt;i liked the fact that it has a lighter and a concelar&lt;br /&gt;it covers really good&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s nothing to dislike about this product</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  When I put it on it worked great.  Packaging was also excellent.  I would highly recommend this highlighter and concealer particularly for dark circles under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I think the fair color was spot-on for my light skin. I like the fact that it comes with a highlighter and concealer. Both last long and show little wear throughout the day. My only complaint is that the concealer does not entirely cover my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Saw this concealer rated as one of the best products on Paula&#x27;s Choice website, and had to purchase it due to the affordable price. I just love it! It really does exceed expectations. I recommend it to anyone, particularly if you are suffering with dark under eye circles.</li>
    <li> I really like how this product works. It is easy to use and the color is easily blended in. This product does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;I had trouble finding it at the big name stores so I looked  on amazon and found it there, I bought a few of them to stock up</li>
    <li> The product is great! I love how the consistency is light and you cant feel it while wearing it. Also a great price. Skin tone matched it well, and it does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a unique product! I love the concealer on one end&lt;br /&gt;and highlighter brush on the other end. It is a quality product.</li>
    <li> They obviously don&#x27;t make it anymore and the stuff I got must have been sitting in a hot warehouse for years.</li>
    <li> I rely on Maybelline products. I use this concealer and highlighter every day. Brushes don&#x27;t wear out. Packs easily. Long-lasting.</li>
    <li> This stuff works quite well, but there isn&#x27;t as much product in the little bottle ends as I would have hoped. I ran out of the concealer long before the highlighter.</li>
    <li> This has always been the perfect concealer as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Sadly it&#x27;s no longer available in stores because it&#x27;s been discontinued. It does it&#x27;s job of concealing extremely well without being thick and dry-looking like the kind of concealers that tend to exaggerate the fine lines under the eye area. At one end of the tube is a tiny soft brush with a slightly thinner formula in a lighter color for the delicate under-eye area, and at the other end of the tube, as an added bonus, is a foam-tipped wand with a warmer-toned concealer in a slightly heavier consistency that matches your skin tone (to even out any marks or slight discolorations on the rest of the face). I bought several tubes from Amazon to  stock up for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I wish this were still available locally :( This is by far the best product I have ever used for dark under eye circles. It matches my skin perfectly, doesn&#x27;t smear or melt or crease. I have tried 30+ brands, including high end ones for $35+ per tube. This is FAR superior. Nothing comes close to how well it works. I will be heartbroken when the day comes it is no longer available!! For the record I am very fair-skinned, with pink undertones and those darn undereye circles which I guess are a genetic gift, since I&#x27;ve had them since I was a child and no amount of sleep or exercise or water will rid me of them. At least this concealer (I don&#x27;t use the highlighter or care about, the concealer alone is worth the cost) solves the problem. There&#x27;s not much but a little goes a long way as it is quite thick and opaque yet not clumpy or sticky.  Updated: 1/17/2016 Still my favorite. I have continued to test other brands in case someday I am no longer able to get this. However, none of them (including the newest Maybelline updates, strangely) work as well. I am near 30, and noticing a few fine lines under my eyes. Most concealers that do cover the dark circles, will settle into creases. Many are off as far as color or coverage or cakiness.  I&#x27;ve never had any issues with this product. It&#x27;s gold, and I wish they would still mass market it!!</li>
    <li> Everything went fine!</li>
