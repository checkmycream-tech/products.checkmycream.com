      <li>All in all, a great product and definitely worth the couple of bucks!!</li>
      <li>If they don&#x27;t break outright they stretch and lose elasticity - you&#x27;d be better off with a piece of string!</li>

      <li>I was able to tie up my pony-tail and use each for a while.  </li>
      <li>Most of the 2mm ones break or stretch unreasonably before being wrapped around my hair.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s better than them asking for state assistance.</li>
      <li>but they are ok</li>
      <li>I bought these for my wife because this is her favorite brand.</li>
      <li>She likes the thicker ones more than the thinner</li>
      <li>They are just ok -</li>
      <li>but most of them are durable.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A few of these arrived already broken. Not enough to return it, but I don&#x27;t expect them to last too long.  :(</li>
    <li> Just as advertised.  Doesn&#x27;t tear out hair or tangle. Plus, they make great cat toys between uses :)</li>
    <li> great product -  more hairties come in the pack than in any of the ones i buy in the store.  this will definitely last me a long time.  the quality has also been great so far - none have stretched out too much yet. note: teh pack has mutliple hairtie sizes and some are thicker than others. this is not what i was expecting but i do like the variety.</li>
    <li> The hairbands are very sloppily glued at the back. The glue is hard and snags hair. Very poor manufacturing. They label reads \\&quot;no damage\\&quot; but the poor glue job is very damaging.</li>
    <li> Good hair ties. A little bit tight if you have long / thick hair.</li>
    <li> These are great--they are thin but durable and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught on them, which has been a problem with other brands because of that hard glue that some brands use.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my lady, because she would always ask me where her hair tie was as if I was keeping track of it or moved it personally. I bought her these, she was super happy and now I never have to hear her ask again, until she loses them all. Hooray hair ties!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using those for the past 2 years, they are really NO damage and they last for a long time, except for the fact that I keep losing them! That&#x27;s why I keep re-ordering them! Oh and my cats love to steal them and play with them too!</li>
    <li> Works great in the hair.  I tend to lose them often so the bulk package is perfect.</li>
    <li> These are one use hair bands. They stretch to 3x their original size and lose all elasticity after first use, but they do give you a bunch.</li>
    <li> Many of these broke rather quickly.</li>
    <li> They do the job. Yes, they stretch out. But rubberbands stretch out too. The difference is these take a few uses before they stretch out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they break. That&#x27;s why there a million in here. I just keep a few on my wrist at all times and life is good. I have noticed that the no-damage hair ties break faster than the ones with the silver band but the silver band gets caught in my hair. No matter what complaint you have, these do not get caught in your hair which means you will be happy. And for less than 4 bucks, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> The thick bands are OK, but could use more elastice in them.  I won&#x27;t even use the thin bands unless I run out of other bands.  This is my first time purchasing this product and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again, not good for thick hair.  Would probably work fine for thin hair.</li>
    <li> Good for one or two uses.  Too stretchy to begin with and they stretch out so b adly that each subsequent wear requires an additional wrap.  I found a pack of old hair elastics in a drawer that are probably 5 years old and they are far superior.  One lasted over a month before I lost it.  I can see their philosophy, poor quality &#x3D; consumer buys more.</li>
    <li> great product. fast shipping</li>
    <li> One in four broke the first time I tried to use them.  Simply tying the broken ends worked fine, however it shortens the scrunci considerably.</li>
    <li> These Scruncis&#x27; are amazing. There are so many, that whenever you loose them, you don&#x27;t really care because you have so many more. They hold my hair great and I love this brand.</li>
    <li> scunci is a good brand for hair ties they don&#x27;t break easily</li>
    <li> I had purchased other Scunci products.  Didn&#x27;t notice (if it was there), the 2-4mm notice.  The previous products were apparently all 4mm products and were fine.  I was able to tie up my pony-tail and use each for a while.  Most of the 2mm ones break or stretch unreasonably before being wrapped around my hair.  The nice thing is the difference is obvious, I just wished I had been warned about this difference.  I have recently ordered a large lot of 4mm onlies, so hopefully I will be able to give them a great rating.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite hair ties.</li>
    <li> I bought this basically because it&#x27;s cheap. I guess you get what you pay for. They are fairly okay but Goody is still the best. A single Goody elastic would last me a year..this only did last up to a week.</li>
    <li> Although it is clearly stated, I didn&#x27;t notice until these arrived that they are a mixture of two different sizes.  There are half &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; ties, like we&#x27;d use for ponytails, and half &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; ties, like we&#x27;d use for the ends of braids.  This works perfectly for my long haired children.  The best part is we haven&#x27;t had a single band break!</li>
    <li> The project did not meet my expectation AT ALL. However, I am able to return the product at no cost successfully. But I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to tie my hair!</li>
    <li> From the picture, I thought these were the regular thick size, but these are the skinny ones - more like a rubber band than a hair tie.  These are harder on your hair because you have to wrap them several times. I prefer the thicker ones, but these work.</li>
    <li> I know that it advertises as No-damage elastics.  However, after using a few of them for a very short period of time (I just got these), they have already started falling apart.  Once they fall apart, they start pulling at your hair.  To avoid accidentally snagging your hair, be sure to change them often.  Otherwise, it holds well.</li>
    <li> I was excited to find an inexpensive elastic product on Amazon since these get lost in my household like a pair of socks. Unfortunately, it was not the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; that I usually buy at Target or Walgreens. It&#x27;s thin. It&#x27;s the Grande version of Starbucks coffee for elastics. If I had thin hair or tiny baby hair then it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem but my Amazonian hair needed 3-4 of these to keep it up.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t break like some of the ones in the past have. Good product, and they arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t really the best.. Do not recommend for thick hair at all!</li>
    <li> They still pull hair out but far less than the small coated elastic bands</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife and she was constantly breaking them. She hates them and threw the rest out after breaking half of them in just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Various sizes are larger then expected.</li>
    <li> Too many of the smaller sizes.&lt;br /&gt;However, they are good quality and last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and worry that the elastics will break, but have not so far.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, the 2 different sizes are perfect and they hold up really well.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate the variety of thickness of bands. The bands do not rip hair and they don&#x27;t get snagged. I have a lot of hair and the thin bands can hold my hair in place just fine. I would purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Several break with thick hair. But still best I&#x27;ve found for not ripping hair out.</li>
    <li> You will lose these, buy a lot!</li>
    <li> Item was just as described and serves the purpose (keeping my hair out of my face) that it is intended for.</li>
    <li> very thin bands.... no likey</li>
    <li> very strong better than ones from walmart about the same as ones from salon price is good for quanty A+</li>
    <li> Perfect for an add on item</li>
    <li> the thinner ones are very, very thin and very,very large. And the thicker ones only last one wearing.a big disappointment</li>
    <li> Great product.holds thick hair all day</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t good. The rubber doesn&#x27;t have very good memory. The thread coating splits open and exposes the elastic.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy these if you expect quality. I was really disappointed, they are very thin and when I tried one on and took it back off, the band already stretched out. These are very bad quality I don&#x27;t understand how so many people actually like them.</li>
    <li> POS!  They all broke when taking them out of the wrapper. RETURNED</li>
    <li> Nice mix of sizes of bands</li>
    <li> These are fine as cheap scrunchies and I haven&#x27;t had them pull out my hair if I take them out properly, but they tend to snap after more than a few wearings - especially if they&#x27;re thin and you have to double loop them. Still, they&#x27;re cheap and each pack comes with a ton of them, so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife because this is her favorite brand. She likes the thicker ones more than the thinner but they both seem to work for her.</li>
    <li> Bought these as an add on item.  They are just ok - but I have others that are thicker that I reach for before I grab these.  I have thick hair, so the smaller thickness of the band doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place as well.  If you have a small girl that needs the occasional pig tail - these might be for you.</li>
    <li> Great product and at great price, what more can you ask for. Will definitely purchase again for family and friends</li>
    <li> Nice variety between thicker and thinner bands. Could use more &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; thick ones, I usually use 2 of the thick ones for my hair. I wish it had the rubber grips, will eventually slip out of hair while I run.</li>
    <li> These are the only hair ties that can handle my thick hair. I just love them.</li>
    <li> They are ok, If putting your hair in too thick of a hairdo, it will burst. But ok for small updos</li>
    <li> Total Junk! 80% of the band only good fo one use - if that. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these hair ties and they are very cheap one time use bands.  Once you use it, it does not stretch back to its original state, it stays stretched out. Cheap and a waste.</li>
    <li> This product is great for thicker hair. I typically put my hair back and feel like this product works well.</li>
    <li> These are great elastics but make sure you catch they come in two sizes.  I didn&#x27;t and we don&#x27;t like the 2mm size</li>
    <li> Great hair tie. I wear ponytails all the time and I tie lasts for quite some time. Plus, no damage to my shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Quality not what I purchased the first time. The bands keep snapping and I don&#x27;t eben have a lot of hair</li>
    <li> They work well.  Not as sturdy as their other bands but they get the job done. Will try the other size next time.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am a man. I wear a pony tail and these hair ties are excellent. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with them catching or pulling out my hair. Over time they do degrade and loose their elasticity--the melted connection which loops them together degrades. Even so, these are excellent. I will buy these over and over again so long as they are still made.</li>
    <li> Not too weak, holds my hair ok</li>
    <li> The elastics are normally purchased were cheap and seemed to pull on my hair, luckily these are much better for ponytails. So far none have broken or popped for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with these on my fine to medium hair. I love that there are different widths and that you get so many. I keep them everywhere, car, purse, work, so I can always put my hair up when I want to.</li>
    <li> Work great.  I have thick hair and have not broken one yet! Even the thin ones which I had always been skeptical about!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. Varying sizes of thickness. The thin bands break very easily.guess that&#x27;s what I deserve for not getting my butt off the couch and actually buying them</li>
    <li> they are bit thinner than what i expected but they are ok i guess, I dont particularly recommend this product if you have a lot of hair like me.</li>
    <li> Not what I was trying to order, good product but much too large of a size for thin hair</li>
    <li> Love these for keeping my hair up. The other elastics pull out my hair but this is perfect and does not stretch out like the others.</li>
    <li> These are a good quality hair band and hold up for a few months of daily use before breaking.  They don&#x27;t tear at the hair at all.  The do the job and are just what I needed.</li>
    <li> a good product for a good price.  the colors are nice, they seem to hold up well, everything you need from a hair band.</li>
    <li> These scrunchies are ok, but I failed to notice they were different sizes.</li>
    <li> Like most reviews say, there is nothing phenomenal about these but you get so many its nice to have. Not much more to say, wish there were a few extra colors, oh well.</li>
    <li> These hair ties have not lost any of their elasticity over time.  Each one still works just as they did when they were new.  They don&#x27;t pull at the hair awkwardly since there are no metal clasps.</li>
    <li> I was a little taken back that the hair bands were of all different sizes. Even the &amp;#34;thickest&amp;#34; size was still not strong enough for my hair. Would definitely not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using these type and brand of hair bands for a few years now.  I like that they don&#x27;t catch or pull on my hair and are relatively clean going on and off.</li>
    <li> I love these hair bands! They were durable and worked great for me, and I have lots of very thick hair! The smaller ones were not as durable, but they worked fine, too. Overall, I liked them, but would rather only buy the 4MM next time. However, if you have thin or normal hair, these will proabbly work great for you!</li>
    <li> arrived on time, worked as expected. good quality, pricey though.</li>
    <li> Great bargain. I keep losing my hair ties. The good quantity will makes sure I keep my hair tied for a good long while.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my sister and she said they do not have any elasticity at all after only one use.</li>
    <li> They work like they should and do not tangle up in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They get four stars only because they are not uniform diameter. Some are thin while others seem to be twice the diameter of the thin ones. They still work fine, but the technique to install them is slightly different, which catches the attention when they are installed every day, sometimes multiple times per day.</li>
    <li> Only buying these from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a Good value, and the fast service, a very good product, it works as advertised.  Seems to last</li>
    <li> I have very thick curly hair, so I wanted to order the Large ponytail holders to hold back my giant mane. I wish I had paid closer attention to the description. These are a mix of 50% thin bands and 50% of the thicker bands that I really wanted. I can wrap both around my hair 2-3 times depending on whether it&#x27;s in a bun or ponytail. The thicker ones are more stable. I&#x27;ve never found holders that don&#x27;t eventually stretch out in my giant hair, and these are no different. After five or six wears, the white elastic is exposed and it&#x27;s less grippy. I don&#x27;t blame the product- it&#x27;s just life with big hair. These are no worse than other brands. I like that there is no metal to snag on my hair. Next time, I&#x27;ll pay attention and be sure that I get a sheet of all-thick bands.</li>
    <li> I bought these for myself, and I don&#x27;t have long hair.  Here are some uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- To keep shoelace loops from flopping, weave these into the lattice of laces instead of tucking the loops under the front span of shoelace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Velcro seals on cell phone holsters will grow weak over time.  These will keep them from falling open while not greatly impeding access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nite-Ize phone holsters have a flat pocket behind the main holster pouch, between it and the rotating clip.  This pocket is sized for a phone battery, but doesn&#x27;t have any way to prevent the battery from slipping out.  A small daisy-chain of these will do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Clip-on bike tail lights will fall off when clipped to backpacks, messenger bags, etc.  These make great lanyards to keep them from falling completely off.</li>
    <li> I love that this pack came with different thicknesses of bands. With 3 girls in the house, all with different thicknesses of hair, this variety pack was great for us.</li>
    <li> This works great for thick hair. Also does not lead to breaking of hair. I have used it for my outdoor activities (running and hiking) and it stays in place.</li>
    <li> Nice covered rubber bands, great for cables</li>
    <li> Bought them for my cat. She loves em</li>
    <li> Quality not good. Many break.</li>
    <li> So far, with daily use, no popped ones at all yet.  They retain their elasticity well and don&#x27;t pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a good basic hair tie.</li>
    <li> some thin some thick...</li>
    <li> Useable, but the bands are all different thicknesses. Very inconsistent. The thinner ones break pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Good price. Even if one breaks, you have like a million more!</li>
    <li> These are too thin for my thick hair, they are not strong enough.</li>
    <li> Horrible, after using these twice it stretch out. They  wouldn&#x27;t be able to hold my hair since the elastic stretch out so much.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair so finding hair ties is difficult for me.  These snap and break as soon as I stretch them out to made a double knot.  I think that even if I had thinner hair it would still be a problem!</li>
    <li> These rubber bands are good in that they don&#x27;t break, but being no damage essentially means that they always fall out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I like these, but the balance of the thin to the thick holders was not was I was expecting.  I&#x27;d estimate that 80% of the holders are the thin ones, not a 50/50 ratio like i was hoping.  They still work quite well though.</li>
    <li> Weren&#x27;t very stretchy</li>
    <li> These hair ties make my fine hair look limp when in a ponytail. I agree with another reviewer, that these are all about quantity over quality. The elastics stretch out way too fast.</li>
    <li> In general, I find that these no-damage elastics don&#x27;t have a long life-span.  They stretch incredibly easily.  Given that knowledge, these come in large quantities, so just keep buying them.  They do the job, and these are one of those elastics that you&#x27;ll just keep using.</li>
    <li> I have achieved effortless beauty thanks to this product</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work very well for my hair. I wasn&#x27;t able to wrap them around my hair 3 times and they broke very quickly. The thicker ones are MUCH better.</li>
    <li> Good hair ties and like it. :)</li>
    <li> Every Scunci product we&#x27;ve ever bought has been a disappointment - avoid their crappy products if you can. Their hairbands typically last less than a month and often fail on the first use. If they don&#x27;t break outright they stretch and lose elasticity - you&#x27;d be better off with a piece of string!</li>
    <li> Great, delivered on time</li>
    <li> I recommend going to the local pharmacy and purchasing there. The package looks like it is a combination of leftover elastics. The sizing is variable and the packaging disorganized. They are cheaper and higher quality at the local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> Less painful than most.</li>
    <li> I like this elastics because they don&#x27;t pull on my hair like the other ones and they don&#x27;t break as easy.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  The first seven broke when my daughters stretched them to put on their hair.</li>
    <li> The elastics are all different sizes/thicknesses, so half of them werent usable for me.</li>
    <li> Scunci has always been a great brand.  These are no exception.</li>
    <li> A little thin, but so far none have broken.  They lose their stretchiness.  Which is why you buy a pack, to keep working thru them.  Sigh...</li>
    <li> These are great because they don&#x27;t tear and pull at the hair. They come out smoothly and don&#x27;t tangle.</li>
    <li> Did the job, worked just fine. I think I need to buy more. Hmmm, which reminds me I found some for a buck at the dollar&lt;br /&gt;tree for hub to put in my stocking and I think he lost them, lol!</li>
    <li> Well, this is my fault...I didn&#x27;t read reviews before purchasing. I just said &amp;#34;hey good deal!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;But these aren&#x27;t a deal. After wearing your hair pulled back (in a LOOSE) ponytail TWICE one of these bad boys is done for.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest opting out of buying these. Really aren&#x27;t worth the $3.99</li>
    <li> Low price for a reason. Bunch of different sizes on here, many so thin I can&#x27;t use them. Larger ones stretch out really fast. Spend a couple more bucks and get something that will last.</li>
    <li> I had thick hair , they don&#x27;t work well , also  looks cheap !</li>
    <li> I have NO CLUE how anyone could give this item even just 1 star (I guess because it&#x27;s not possible to give no stars ...?). As soon as you pull them to put your hair in a pony tail, they break. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s my review. Save yourself a few bucks and do not buy these cheap, worthless hair bands.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thick, mostly straight hair. These are my favorite hair ties, but they wear out after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Inexpensive. A dollar a dozen, hard to beat that!&lt;br /&gt; - No metal parts to tug on your hair&lt;br /&gt; - Good color for dark hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - After a few uses the hair tie starts to stretch to the point of having little elasticity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair in a pony tail or bun nearly every day, and I like my hair pulled back tight. I try to wrap the tie around my ponytail at least 4 times, and my ponytail is almost 2 inches in diameter. So I usually alternate between four different ties over a month or so. Giving a break between uses seems to extend their lives.</li>
    <li> These are not very stretchy at all. Hard to double over on my daughters thick ponytail and harder to triple on my thinner ponytail.</li>
    <li> I love these, having thick hair its hard to find ties that don&#x27;t break immediately.</li>
    <li> I always love using these product since before...I bought some new ones cuz my old ones are wearing out... Love it...</li>
    <li> I only bought this so I could buy another item that was an add on. I mean the add on program is good but annoying at the same time cuz u have to spend more money. I didn&#x27;t realize that it was assorted sizes until I opened the box. the thin ones break so easy but the thicker ones are just fine.  shipping was quick and free</li>
    <li> Really hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair, which is all I wanted out of this product.</li>
    <li> OK for the price my daughter has plenty of thick hair to its hard a right band.</li>
    <li> The band are 2 different thickness</li>
    <li> They hold hair in place.</li>
    <li> Horrible, they keep snapping</li>
    <li> Lots of these snapped before I even wore them. Thought they were all large when I ordered but more than half of them are skinny. No good for my big hair!</li>
    <li> What can you say about a scunci? They&#x27;re okay. They work. My daughter can wear a ponytail without ripping her hair. That&#x27;s all folks.</li>
    <li> they pull apart and break easier than same brand bought in store&lt;br /&gt;they pull apart and break easier than same brand bought in store</li>
    <li> These are pretty good hair ties.  I&#x27;ve been using them for at least 10 years.  Someone posted they felt these broke easier than the ones purchased in store.  I felt they are exactly the same quality.  They do stretch out with use over time, but not any more so than any other typical hair tie.  Once they&#x27;re stretched out, if you use 2 of them it will work better to hold back you hair.  They don&#x27;t pull out my hair ever and they don&#x27;t have the annoying metal piece.  Yes occasionally they snap and break but that&#x27;s pretty rare.  Overall a good product and I will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> decent product, skinnier than expected. will hold thin hair fairly well</li>
    <li> Decent hair tie. They break regularly, but less often than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> They hold my hair back. Kinda a lame job. But it&#x27;s their job and they do it well. It&#x27;s better than them asking for state assistance. A job is a job. Don&#x27;t judge.</li>
    <li> When I got these I was expecting LARGE hair ties in thickness, what I got was skinny hair ties. However they shipped on time. As for the product itself they hold up well for thin hair, I just double and triple up for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for myself and my twins&#x27; and each time,I&#x27;ve been required to cut them out of our hair because the hair gets caught and I&#x27;m very particular about my hair so this isn&#x27;t good. Some of my hair has been broken due to wearing these elastics.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I bought this in the 100 count considering the really low price and with most other elastics, I stretch them, they break. I was quite surprised though because with these (even though they&#x27;re thin), I stretch them, and they seem to still have stretch left in them!! So, I give these 5 stars because they&#x27;re durable, they don&#x27;t have that little silver thing I hate, they don&#x27;t get caught up in my hair (even though they&#x27;re thin) and they don&#x27;t leave those marks in my hair like some of the thicker elastics. All in all, a great product and definitely worth the couple of bucks!!</li>
    <li> There are so many hair ties in this bunch. I&#x27;ve lost over ten and there are still many more. The thinner ones seem to snap and break, though. Still, it&#x27;s a great deal and they don&#x27;t damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I made a quick purchase of these because the product page described them as &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34;.  You only get 12 large, the rest are small and very poor quality.  They break and do not hold your hair after the second time you try to use them.  Terrible.</li>
    <li> Works well and is a large pack.</li>
    <li> Works great, for the price you cant beat it. No metal parts so it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that doesn&#x27;t like to be held back, but I love using these hair ties. They last forever which means I don&#x27;t have to constantly keep buying more. I keep them in my purse and my bathroom because I never know when I&#x27;m going to need one! They do snap after being used and stretched out like a million times.</li>
    <li> my daughters use these everyday, no complaints :). i also use them when i want to contain my hair under a ski mask.</li>
    <li> Some of them were broken before I opened the package</li>
    <li> I always buy these ones because they don&#x27;t damage my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and I guess they are too cheap. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have medium texture hair - not too thin, not too thick. So, I thought these would be PERFECT for me! WRONG. They are RUBBER, and when you take them out, it hurts like crap. Would not recommend these to anyone, especially those with medium/thin hair ...</li>
    <li> Use them everyday at work, like that they are all the same color - black, not different colors - my hair color doesn&#x27;t change every day.</li>
    <li> So far every other on of these breaks before I even get it on. Not sure if it&#x27;s perhaps because they are old dead stock and starting to dry rot? No idea. They break right where they are glued together. Disappointing. Never had this happen to the ones I buy in the store.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair.  These bands  break too easily when trying to stretch around a ponytail.  The glue  does not seem very effective</li>
    <li> What more can you say this brand is great, No problems at all!</li>
    <li> I love these. I will never buy another kind</li>
    <li> Got these for my girlfriend. She says that her hair just falls out of them and that they have little to no elasticity. She gets &amp;#34;maybe one wear before elasticity is completely shot. Looping it around the ponytail multiple times so the hair would stay in place causes them to break&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> These are great. They are a variety pack of thick and thin black rubber bands. They have no metal peice to get caught in your hair. I have very curly hair and these go in and out easily without ripping out my hair. They are sturdy and not the ones that rip when you stretch them.</li>
    <li> Scunci Effortless Beauty Large No-damage Elastics, 2 Mm/ 4 Mm Is working great for my grand daughter&#x27;s hair. It is very heavy and the Scunci holds it well without damage.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with these elastic bands ... they are very poor quality. I mean so bad it&#x27;s laughable. I wouldn&#x27;t even give one star if it wasn&#x27;t required.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, they keep breaking.  Next time I&#x27;ll just buy them local and get quality.</li>
    <li> Nice assortment of Scunci hair elastics not available in my local stores.</li>
    <li> Yes, these are good covered hair elastics. They don&#x27;t break the hair when I pull it back. Secure, good quality. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> i have thick hair and these hold it tight and stay in place all day.  These are my go to</li>
    <li> I never had a problem with the Scunci brand and I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Durable and last a long time. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not ideal for thick hair. They stretch out and break.</li>
    <li> great fof keeping up hair</li>
    <li> What I expected, good for the price.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This has saved me from wasting time looking for another hair band and comes in handy.  I am halfway through it and it&#x27;s been over half a year already.  I break some of them off the bat when I&#x27;m trying to tie a ponytail but most of them are durable.  I like how they have different widths so I can modify and pick and choose which I need (ponytail v. an end of a braid).</li>
    <li> Some are thicker some are thinner. Plenty of them. Would have given a better review if they all were thick the way I like them.  A bit dismayed but not enough to return.</li>
    <li> Product is of great quality and as described.</li>
    <li> Nice hair bands. They dont pull on our hair. No breakage of the bands yet.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say: these ponytail holders  may not have metal but the glue,or whatever it is that holds them together, is sharp-edged and still causes breakage and damages hair.</li>
    <li> It says they are large, but they are not.  They are the smaller, skinnier hair ties that don&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair these break!!!</li>
    <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve had a use for Scunci with a lot of my gear as it&#x27;s EXTREMELY durable. It&#x27;s uses has varied from tie-downs to retention straps for smaller or medium-sized items. My wife can&#x27;t complain too much either, for it has plenty of uses for her beautification needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: Durable. Low-profile. Effortless use in donning and doffing. Long-lasting elasticity. Comfortable when worn on the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: May be made fun of for wearing hair-ties. Masculinity alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: If you are a man in need of some useful tie-downs, DON&#x27;T HESITATE TO TRY! These things are endlessly useful for me. For the Women consumers out there, you won&#x27;t have an issue with comfort at all!</li>
    <li> The ends are glued together which means if you have thick hair they end up breaking very easily. I&#x27;ve already gone through half of them.</li>
    <li> Cheap cheap cheap and so thin. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch but compared to my other ones (same brand) they are 1/4 of the width and feel like they will snap quick</li>
    <li> best twisties, been using for years</li>
    <li> These hair ties are the best I have found so far. They are durable and great for really thick hair</li>
    <li> I keep my long-ish hair in a ponytail often and these holders are great!  Very sturdy, and they don&#x27;t pull on my hair.  I even sleep in them (not a tight ponytail, but a loose one) and they stay in all night without a problem and without pulling on my hair.  They keep my hair from tangling while I sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought these in the store and they&#x27;ve been okay.  But there seem to be a number of hair ties that are too lose.  Not sure what happened.  But some of them already don&#x27;t have any elasticity.</li>
    <li> Perfect to hold hair up, no tangles</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about! They get the job done! Not too small and they do really hold my hair in the way I would like.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair out of my face. Would give 5 stars, but I can&#x27;t see myself &amp;#34;Loving&amp;#34; hair-ties; I&#x27;m not ready for that level of commitment.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years, but recently picked up another brand that was on sale.  Big mistake!  They didn&#x27;t last 2 months before they started snapping.  These are tried-and-true.  They don&#x27;t pull your hair, don&#x27;t run out of stretch, and don&#x27;t break!  If only I could keep track of them better.</li>
    <li> My cats chew on hair bands and carry them around the house, and eventually they end up under the stove and couches.  Thanks to these, Wiggle and Simon will never run out.    They also work well for hair</li>
    <li> If I have no other hair ties, I will use these, but the &amp;#34;no damage&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t quite correct. Where the two ends meet is rough on the hair and hurts. The elastic also wasn&#x27;t as stretchy as I was hoping. Still on the search for the perfect hair elastic.</li>
    <li> These are not the seamless, cut panty hose version I expected them to be. They work just fine.</li>
    <li> I am glad I found these on here. I needed thin elastics that wouldn&#x27;t leave a strong bend in my hair. These are soft and perfect and I can get quite a few wears out of each one.</li>
    <li> I was afraid, from reading some reviews, that these elastics would be very weak. But they are very strong and they work fine. Great! I had them for a couple of month, and I use them everyday. None broke so far.</li>
    <li> They work great. But they are thin and thick bands. I didn&#x27;t realize that when I ordered them.</li>
    <li> These are way thinner and less elastic than Goody.  I need to use two at a time and my hair isn&#x27;t especially thick.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find Goody brand at the store, picked up Scunci instead. It was a mistake. They&#x27;re alright in a tight pinch, but the elastic feels a bit thinner, and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold tight&amp;#34; to my hair at all. I&#x27;ve got long hair (I&#x27;m about 1 year away from being able to sit on it, as it is right now my hair gets caught between my lower back and chair backs when I leave it down), and it&#x27;s quite thick, so I need elastics that are strong and won&#x27;t let my hair droop or stray. I find that I go through the Scunci ones much more quickly than my preferred brand, either due to them snapping or just losing their elasticity. In part I suppose the thickness of my hair makes for an awkward fit - there&#x27;s enough give for half another wrap around my pony tail which makes for a very loose fit and means my pony tail is sagging the moment I stop holding it. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again unless I&#x27;m out of options. It&#x27;s a bit upsetting as Scunci seems to be the brand more popular to carry in the stores I visit.</li>
    <li> The thin elastics are useless for me. The thick one are very nice so far. can&#x27;t blame or call it good.</li>
</ol>
