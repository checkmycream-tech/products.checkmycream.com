<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pros:Smells great. Lasts long. It is the best deodorant I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Difficult to get off. White smear.</li>
    <li> one of the lids was broken when it was shipped.  Good thing there are two as I&#x27;ll use the non-broken one on the second one.</li>
    <li> As far as I am concerned, this is the absolute best anti-antiperspirant out there for women.  Lasts all day, smells great, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and Degree works better than any of them.</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant that smells fresh and keeps you dry throughout the day. I&#x27;ve tried on a multitude of deodorant products in the past, but this is probably one of the best. It isn&#x27;t oily, caky, and doesn&#x27;t wear off over the course of the day. I love the Shower Clean fragrance since it isn&#x27;t too strong but smells AMAZING. Would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even last 12hrs.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant, lasts long and smells great.</li>
    <li> I only have to apply this once every two days. I don&#x27;t smell, ever. I don&#x27;t sweat all over the place. I&#x27;ve tried soooooooooooo many types of deodorant, even men&#x27;s, and nothing has ever worked this well. I use to have to apply it twice a day just to keep the sweat under control, but this stuff is magic. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works well! I wouldn&#x27;t call it 48 hour protection, but definitely for the day!</li>
    <li> A standard scent but a great deal.  Degree is the best deodorant on the market, in my opinion.  Just wish deals had better scent options.</li>
    <li> I received Degree Motion Sense free to try from Influenster.  This is my 1st Voxbox and I was so excited to try something I&#x27;d actually use.  The deodorant smells great and lasts all day and through a good workout at the gym!  This is a product I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant. Last all day, smells great. I use it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different deodorants brands and by far Degree Motionsense AntiPerspirant Deodorant Invisible Solid&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing. I received this from influenster (free) product opinions and reviews.</li>
    <li> I never knew there was a difference between deodorant and anti perspirant...now I do. This works great for my husband who is in and out of his delivery truck, all day long, in this humid, sticky, miserable heat in Savannah Ga. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> The top is short and makes it hard to pop off. This bugs me because my hand always touches the deodorant.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is great. It lasts all day. This one stick lasted me for a month which is good because I run throw deodorant like nobody&#x27;s business</li>
    <li> this is the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve EVER USED! It turned the armpit of my shirts blue! I&#x27;ve had to throw away about 10 tops thanks to this stuff. I tell people ALL THE TIME buy any other deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Degree when it comes to my deoderant. I however prefered a certain type of packaging that Degree only used for a short period of time and then did away with. Also a scent that I prefered that was actually meant for men that was also done away with. But still Degree is the only deoderant that I can apply once and feel like I have all day protection. So I was happy when I got this one in the mail and it was a scent that I can enjoy. Just hope it sticks around. Seems every time I find a new scent that I like they get rid of it. I recommend Degree above all deoderants and MotionSense is a nice scent. Because I do not to smell like powder which is why I&#x27;m so picky about my scents. This one is very nice and I think this will be the scent that I use from now on.</li>
    <li> I must say, I am so in love with this deodorant. I had never used degree products until one day I ran out of deodorant and my boyfriend had a stockpile and told me to just use his. After I used that all up, I (thankfully) decided to try out motionsense for women, and am in love. I do a lot of physical labor, work in a high stress job, and work out. This has yet to disappoint me!!</li>
    <li> I was using one of those natural deodorant stones for a while, when suddenly it seemed to stop working. One thing I have no tolerance for is body odor, especially my own. I decided to revert back to using regular old deodorant and found this Degree with Motionsense. Seemed to be another marketing scam, but I was willing to be had. I just needed something that works. Living on a sunny Caribbean island means that sweating is not optional.I have two choices as I see it: I can move back to Canada and use a less powerful deodorant OR I can stay in the Caribbean and enjoy the weather and use Degree with Motionsense. Guess what I chose? I&#x27;m not moving. This stuff works all day long! Even when I go to take a shower after work I still smell great! The scent is not my favorite (Linen Dry) but neither is it offensive so I still give this product 5 stars. Give it a try, bet you&#x27;ll be impressed.</li>
