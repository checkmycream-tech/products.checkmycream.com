<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased a different style a few months ago for my lenovo flex 2 15. I loved the design and it seemed to have good reviews. 2 months later, the zipper broke so that the little ridges no longer lined up anymore. I emailed amazon and they gave me compensation right away. I decided to order another one (this style) since the reviews were so good, I figured I just had a fluke. I ordered this one, and about a month later, the zipper handle broke again. Very dissatisfied with the product, considering the great reviews, but extremely pleased with the customer service amazon provided. Will not bother amazon again with another complaint and will simply invest in a better case from elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Very Classy Makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> Very nice laptop cover that is exactly as presented.  This item was well worth the cost, which was a good value from the start.</li>
    <li> The sleeve is really pretty and very well made. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and stylish!  Fits my laptop perfectly.</li>
    <li> Beautiful case. Designed with both durability, style and most of all designed to protect any laptop. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> The laptop sleeve is super cute :) My 15.6 inch laptop fits perfectly and it just makes it all the cuter :)</li>
    <li> The slip cover is very nice for the price i paid. It fits my laptop perfectly and looks awesome. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a little bit of protection and style.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would make this the absolute BEST is if there was a strap that was attached and a place to hold the charger but its great love the design and inside.</li>
    <li> The colors are definitely more vibrant in person, but beautiful nonetheless. I got this for my Macbook Pro 15&amp;#34; retina model and it fits well, although not the snuggest. It has about an inch on the top and side but I don&#x27;t see this being an issue really. There&#x27;s protection from the zippers. Has a good amount of padding, not too cushioned but enough to protect it while I have it out and in my backpack. I was also happy to receive this in about a week when it said it would be delivered in 3 initially. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! :)</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves it for her laptop.</li>
    <li> I came really quick, it looks exactly like the picture, and it fits my MacBook Pro 15 inch (2012 version I think) very well. It has some extra room, maybe a centimeter or two, but it doesn&#x27;t pose a problem and it&#x27;s be great for if you have a case.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this laptop case! The colors are brilliant, everyone compliments me on it. The padding is good as well. Overall VERY nice quality at a price that is amazing! It&#x27;s a must have for your laptop :)</li>
    <li> Just as I expected! Love the design! Felt type material on the inside is sure to keep from scratching my laptop.</li>
    <li> Fits my laptop perfectly. I love it and I always get compliments on it!</li>
    <li> Even though the one I received does not have the exact pattern in the picture (that I originally ordered from), the laptop cover is extremely well made, sturdy, and fits the laptop wonderfully!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful case and very colorful! I wish the case had more padding to protect my laptop. I&#x27;ll be carrying it in my backpack so it will have more cushioning aside from the case anyway. I have a MacBook Pro 15 inch (mid-2012/Non-Retina) and it fits well with about half an inch of room left in the case. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like this case. My 15 inch laptop fits nicely in it. The colors and pattern is accurate. The lining is this furry material. Overall I am satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> It came quickly, holds a 15.6 screen laptop nicely, and I can put the cord in too. Love the pattern. With the padding it should work very well for travel in my carry on.</li>
    <li> quick ship, product as described, daughter using for college</li>
    <li> Very cute and good protection for Mac Book Pro. It does add an inch or two of width thus making computer too big for my bag but very cute case. Colors are vibrant!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT sleeve in every way, from the attractive yet durable outside material to the plush interior lining, and the double closure zipper is incredibly strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 14\\&quot; sleeve because I wanted a snug sleeve for my Dell Inspiron 15Z notebook. Other sleeves designed for 15\\&quot; laptops have proved too large and the device slides around when I carry it to class. With notebook dimensions of 14 7/8\\&quot; x 10\\&quot;, I decided to purchase the 14\\&quot; sleeve as the listed dimensions are 15\\&quot; x 10\\&quot;. Be advised: THE SIZE DIMENSIONS OF SLEEVES ARE CORRECT! I can squeeeeeze the Dell 15z into the 14\\&quot; sleeve and actually zip it up with determined effort, but each of the dozen times I&#x27;ve managed to cram it in I&#x27;ve been sure it was going to break. It hasn&#x27;t yet, and while I&#x27;ve been hoping that the sleeve would stretch just a skosh it has retained its size perfectly: It&#x27;s just as hard to put it in today as it was the day I receive it, which is a good thing for most people, just not for me (and sadly, I have no one to blame but myself as I chose to keep the sleeve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I considered returning the 14\\&quot; sleeve for the 15\\&quot; sleeve but decided to keep it as I REALLY want a snug sleeve. I&#x27;m beginning to think I erred in my determination and hope that it would stretch, and will most likely buy the 15\\&quot; sleeve and give up on my obsessiveness as it moves around a little (giving the 14\\&quot; sleeve to my son, unless the zipper finally gives up, which it should have by now: it&#x27;s a terrific closure!). That I would re-purchase it says a lot about the sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size issue is 100% my &#x27;fault&#x27; and my comments are made only to provide potential customers will size perspective on the 14\\&quot; and 15\\&quot; sleeves. I LOVE the sleeve and recommend it (in the appropriate size) to anyone considering the product.</li>
    <li> The colors are great and it takes up very little room. I wish there was room for the power cord.</li>
    <li> I am able to bring my computer around with me and no worry abt scratches because its in a case</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my granddaughter. She loves it. It fits her laptop perfectly. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Came fast, but it&#x27;s really ugly in person.  Looks cheap, though the quality is good.  Just not the sleeve I thought it would be.  Maybe it&#x27;d look better in canvas.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and cute too. Well cushioned and great price.</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with my new laptop case. the colors are so vivid and nice. The quality is very good and I already adviced my friend to buy one. I like it :)</li>
    <li> i got 15-15&#x27;6 one but it is bigger than my laptop. (my laptop is samsung series9 15&#x27;) but i like the design,</li>
    <li> First of all, this item was shipped fast, which was nice because I needed this case rather quickly, eventhough I was willing to wait for it.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, The exterior material is really good though I&#x27;m a little bit dubious about the zipper handlers because they&#x27;re made of a metal and I&#x27;m afraid it will detach in the future (I really hope it doesn&#x27;t). Previously I had one made of neoprene and all-plastic zipper for about two and a half years, and it&#x27;s still in almost perfect conditions (now it belongs to my mother).&lt;br /&gt;Though in the image above the colors are dimmed comparing with the actual thing (too bright for my taste, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to get used to it), the inside material is actually perfect for my laptop, it&#x27;s top layer is soft kind of like fur, and under it is a neoprene layer wich is expected of this type os sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it is worth the price and I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice cover ! Don&#x27;t hesitate to order</li>
    <li> Love it so far! Zipper and materials inside and out are great quality and the colors were exactly as shown. In fact, I think it&#x27;s even prettier in person! It fits my 15&amp;#34; laptop perfectly. I wish I had ordered this sooner!</li>
    <li> Very different from any laptop case I have seen in a store. The color alone gets me many compliments! It only unzips from side to side and not all the way around, but so far so good. The inside is very soft and the outside is hard and tough. I love it.</li>
    <li> excellent product and the print is beautiful</li>
    <li> Amazing bag I brought two month ago. It has a beautiful velvety interior, and lovely pattern exterior. HIgh quality leather zipper is another thing I high recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased this canvas laptop sleeve for my MacBook Pro 15 inch laptop. I saw the reviews and they only talked about the 13inch sleeve but I assumed that the 15inch would be the same. When it came in the mail I was completely satisfied with the look of it. It is really cute and the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s a little big for my laptop. It&#x27;s about one inch too wide. It slides around a little. I was planning on getting a hard shell to put on my laptop as well so that might add thickness to it and make it less loose.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too big of a deal to me though. The price is super reasonable and the design is adorable. This will give my laptop enough protection to enable me to slip it in my book bag when going to class. I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Pretty case, nice soft lining. Good deal especially for the price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it to go for my laptop and makes it look stylish. Its a great case to protect my computer.</li>
    <li> Really happy with the case&lt;br /&gt;Fit my 15 inch MacBook Pro&lt;br /&gt;Nice padding when my computer is in my backpack</li>
    <li> The laptop case is very colorful and I love it. It is very useful and its handy to use everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> I love the colors on the case! I receive tons of compliments on it. Yes, there is a chemical smell, but nothing a little airing out can&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> The fabric is not what I was expecting at all.  I never use it, whish I would have returned it when I had the chance.</li>
    <li> Nicely made, better quality than I expected so far</li>
    <li> My wife loved this case for her 15 inch MBP. Excellent quality materials and craftsmanship make this a no-brainer for anyone looking for a unique case for a 15-inch laptop.</li>
    <li> Fit my laptop perfectly. Durable</li>
    <li> Came quickly, great quality.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great quality materials. Fiting it&#x27;s a bit loose, that could turn into an advantage if you are also using a hard case on a Mac. The product should have more foam on the edges, in case someone drops the computer inside of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design it&#x27;s as shown, so no surprises ;)</li>
    <li> This case exceeded my expectations.  It is so vibrant and unique while also being sturdy.  Plus, it has nice padding and easily fits my Toshiba 15.6 touchscreen laptop...it also easily fits the power cord and a wireless mouse.  I like that the zipper has two pulls and the material is thick and it is well constructed.  This is really a great product!</li>
    <li> this laptop case is wonderful.  even better than I thought it would be.  has a super soft interior and the outside has really good colors ;)</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, worth the price and I especially love the material inside of the sleeve. Thank you for an outstanding product worth my twenty bucks.</li>
    <li> Great pattern, quality, and price !</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected...LOVE!!</li>
    <li> It smelled a little strange at first, but I aired it out. Protects my laptop well (fits great) and is such a cute, unique design. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> We purchased this for an HP 15.5 laptop. It fits snug like a glove. Would recommend it.. Has thin padding and soft on the inside so no scratching of surface.. Happy!</li>
    <li> Fit Lenovo laptop like a glove 15.6 inch. Love the print. Very different from the average sleeves. Nice padding. Will protect laptop nicely. Great price</li>
    <li> I love everything about this laptop case.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s colorful, soft on the inside, heavy canvas on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t have been made better.</li>
    <li> This sleeve case for my computer is a bit tight and barely fits it but it is sturdy material and has an exceptionally soft, plush lining.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on the laptop case. The pattern is exactly as it was depicted in the image. I like the thickness and also it leaves a little room around the edges of my laptop.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She really likes the lined inside. Was really impressed overall! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great laptop sleeve.</li>
    <li> Zipper stuck a bit upon opening at first, but is just fine now. Colors are bright and it appears to be of good quality!</li>
    <li> I got this case before the deadline that they had, I got 2 days earlier!!! At first when looked at it looked small, but it fit my laptop cooling pad+ Charger!!! A little on the pricey side but was a good investment of my money!!!</li>
    <li> This is even cuter in person than in the picture. The item is well made and has a good cushion in it so it will protect your computer.</li>
    <li> ordered it as a last thought for a Christmas gift (it was on her wish list). Not only did it come in quickly, it was exactly what she had in mind!</li>
    <li> This was such a beautiful cover, exactly the same as the picture with even more vibrant colors. In the reviews I read that these might not fit the 15.6 inch laptops and I was worried it would be so tight, but it isn&#x27;t and fits mine perfectly. I guess if you have Game Laptops which are double thicker than usual laptops, then it might not fit very well. For mine, this is just the thing I wanted, thank you guys! :)</li>
    <li> very disappointed after mosisco---way too big the computer</li>
    <li> I thought my first review was very much appropriate. Anyway I LOVE THE ITEM. BYE.</li>
    <li> This is a BEAUTIFUL laptop sleeve!!! The quality is amazing! This is NOT a thin piece of neoprene material, but rather a thicker quality material with beautiful stitching all over the outside. The fabric design is stunning! The interior of the bag is thick and velvety soft! My 15.6in Samsung ATIV Book 8 fits perfectly inside, with just a small gap of space at the top. I feel very comfortable carrying my laptop around in this bag/sleeve, as I know it is well protected! I highly recommend this bag, in fact I&#x27;m buying another for my Mom!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s water resistant and has proved to work, I love the pattern and the colors are as bright in person as they are online.</li>
    <li> This is a nice protective case, but is relatively slippery and easy to drop.  It would be perfect if it had a light duty clip-on shoulder strap or a clip on handle that could be removed if not wanted.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Thick zipper and fabric. My Mac Bk Pro isnt squished inside so its easy to slide in n out, even with my external drive and long cord inside. Fabric is not slippery so the grip is great, plus is well padded. There&#x27;s no handle but I prefer placing it within another container with a handle so its all the more secure. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The product is beautiful and I had no problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;The inside is delicate and I loved it. It fits my computer perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fits my laptop well and holds the power cord! I was nervous since there was a lot of whining that it didn&#x27;t fit other laptops. I have a15.6 inch Toshiba satellite c55-a. It&#x27;s nice and and keeps my laptop safe, plus it&#x27;s cute! Only downfall is the color isn&#x27;t as bright as it appears in the picture.  Good deal all around.</li>
    <li> This case is very &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;.  It gives me a little extra padding for my laptop.  It fits nicely into my laptop bag&#x27;s sleeve for added support.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  It has a canvas outside and a soft microfiber inside.  I like that it is different than what you will find on the shelf at the store.</li>
    <li> This case is absolutely lovely, colors are bright and true to the picture. Interior is nice and soft to protect my new laptop. Totally recommend, just be sure to measure your laptop before you purchase a sleeve!</li>
    <li> I bought two of these bags, and although they were very cute, within a month the zippers broke on both. Poorly made.</li>
    <li> very good, but a little bit bigger than my Mac 15.6</li>
    <li> Last week I gave this laptop case to my wife and she loved it. Looks really nice indeed. I recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a canvassy material, the colors are great too. I loved it!</li>
    <li> This is a really cute and durable laptop cover. I have a Gateway 15.6&amp;#34; and it fits snuggly but can still zip it closed nicely. I can see this lasting a long time. Can&#x27;t wait to start taking it to school this fall.</li>
    <li> Fits my 15 1/2 inch Toshiba Laptop perfectly. Good quality and nice cool a as pictured.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. I love the colors and whatnot. It works great. The inside is super soft. It fits my laptop (15.6inch) w/room to spare. I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> Colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant and it&#x27;s a little too big for my 15 inch sony vaio. But I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so cute! Very BoHo.</li>
    <li> Adorable laptop sleeve.  Sturdy &amp; well-constructed.  Like the plush interior.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, COLOR IS AWESOME, FIX PERFECT MY TOSHIBA LAPTOP AND I AM ALREADY GETTING GREAT COMPLEMENT, I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IT IS PERFECT.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my sister and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fit&#x27;s her 15.6 inch Laptop perfectly, plus she likes how it looks.</li>
    <li> It get so many compliments on this case! It is great protection for my macbook when taking it in my backpack.</li>
    <li> Very nice and sturdy product for the computer</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Good protection plus a dash of color. This is my second. I also have one for my Macbook Air. Good quality for the money!</li>
    <li> Good buy! Will definitely get from it again</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described and quick delivery time</li>
    <li> Very nice quality product. The case has a nice soft interior, thick like denim exterior and strong zipper. The product came sealed in a nice bag as well. It is not neoprene so it does not have that strong smell some sleeves have. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love the print on this sleeve, and the inside is so soft, so as not to scratch my laptop. It&#x27;s the perfect fit for an ASUS laptop, but only the laptop. I wish it was a little bigger so I could fit the charger and other accessories in it as well, or if it had an outside pocket to store those, that would be awesome, but overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. The price (plus free Amazon Prime shipping) is a lot lower than what I had seen in the brick-and-mortar stores, and it saved me money and time by ordering this online. A++!!!</li>
    <li> Very pretty design. If you have a 15.6in laptop as I do I would get a size bigger. My laptop just barely fits, its very snug.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, very nice looking and my laptop fits perfectly in it. Thank you !</li>
