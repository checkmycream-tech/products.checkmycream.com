      <li>so far, so good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to have it.</li>
      <li>I heard that Red Raspberry Seed oil was really good for moisturizing, so I ordered some.</li>
      <li>This oil is just what I needed to make my own natural sunscreen.  </li>

      <li>So I decided it would be fun to give it a try.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good buy.. Need more actually...</li>
    <li> I love this, will buy again</li>
    <li> good natural sunscreen, good lip protection.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moO8MYL7M3PUDA]]I used it and I loved it. Very nice quality (Virgin &amp; Unrefined) with a natural scent. Great for my skin!</li>
    <li> it does not have the right consistency and makes me suspect that it is not genuine raspberry seed oil.</li>
    <li> Used it in my sunscreen recipe (wellnessmama recipe), love it. I like using it straight on my face and hair as well.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use for my lip balm!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It smells amazing, is nice and thick, and is a perfect addition to lip balms and lotions. The pump works like a charm too.</li>
    <li> Shipping of this product was swift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my skin is too sensitive to Red Raspberry Seed oil.  My skin doesn&#x27;t like it.  I had red /dried / cracked skin near my mouth a few hours after applying the oil as is.  The rest of my face felt as if I had a thick layer of dead skin (which came off by scrubbing about 2 days after applying the oil out of the bottle).  Oil application on arms and shoulders seemed ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I diluted it in grape seed oil (20% red raspberry seed oil, 80% grape seed oil) to use as a general moisturizer for hands/arms with low SPF protection.  But that takes out the said-almost-SPF 40 completely.  After applying the diluted oil on my arms, my skin started to burn about 10 mins after being under the sun.  I used this dluted mix on my face.  I regretted it!  Although I did not get the red and drying skin, it clogged my pores, I think it&#x27;s because of the grape seed oil in the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend getting this oil if you have sensitive skin, particularly in the face area.</li>
    <li> Ii did not like because of the scent. So hard to find natural oils that are not already beginning to spoil.</li>
    <li> First, you need to understand that I live in the inner circle of hell. Going outside is like stepping into a convection oven and it sucks every bit of moisture from your skin. I heard that Red Raspberry Seed oil was really good for moisturizing, so I ordered some. I expected a sweet, raspberry scent, but I was surprised to find that there was no sweet scent at all. There is an oily scent, similar to vegetable oil, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant. Not really sure what to expect, I only used the oil on the back of one hand twice a day for five days, using the other as control. The hand I uses the oil on has noticeable softer, more pliant skin. It tears far less easily as well. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my results and plan to get more as soon as possible.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> regular purchaser...love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Including this in my face and body creams helps insure the SPF coverage--what wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> My bottle smelled rancid. So I wasn&#x27;t going to use it as a SPF - tried using it as a moisturizer, but gave me a red bumpy rash. Threw it out.</li>
    <li> smell... but other than that I am happy.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this as it naturally has an spf of over 20.  When I received it and started to use it the oil smelled like fish.  I really do not think that raspberries smell that way.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, nice product for making lotions.</li>
    <li> Love my raspberry oil. Good product .</li>
    <li> It has an earthy smell similar to carrot seed oil but, it is so amazing on my face. All I have to do is use one drop and it moisturizes my face and gives me a healthy glow. After reading some other reviews I will keep it in my refrigerator just as precaution. I have been using this as my moisturizer and grapefruit seed oil in water as my toner. I really can&#x27;t see myself going back to another skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> LOVE ESSENTIAL OILS!!!!</li>
    <li> only has faint raspberry scent.</li>
    <li> All sunscreens, even physical blocks, irritate my skin so I was really excited about trying this product out as I read that it could have a natural SPF between 30 and 50. Well, I burned so either it doesn&#x27;t stay on very well or it just doesn&#x27;t work well as a sunscreen. I gave it 3 stars b/c it is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Found bottle sealed and packing was sufficient. Very pleased with product. I have already used in my lotion sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I like that I can use this as a sun screen and it does work.  The only problem is that it is such a small bottle for a lot of money.  It has no smell that I notice.  If I had more then enough money I would buy a case.</li>
    <li> This oil is just what I needed to make my own natural sunscreen.  Product came just as pictured. I&#x27;m excited to have it.</li>
    <li> Awesome oil. I love it. The seller was prompt and I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Great for DIY sunscreen. Has a neutral smell, too, which I like.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is natural but has a really bad smell to it....I feel personally doesn&#x27;t do much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I purchased red raspberry seed oil to use in my own lotions but tried it straight on to my skin before going in the pool,nice smell, not to heavy, made my skin feel good. Will purchase again. Good price too</li>
    <li> first time uses, and applied to my facial creamer that I make myself. I love it. I expected more of a raspberry smell, but I am loivng this product</li>
    <li> I use this as sun screen blocker for my 3 pound Chihuahua dog.  He likes it! I love it...</li>
    <li> Over the summer in DC I used this to replace a lotion-type sunblock because of the humidity, and with under 4 hours of direct sunlight a day. When I used it for a day of beach-rollerblading in CA? Not only did I burn but I developed a terrible rash.</li>
    <li> good stuff for refreshing</li>
    <li> I purchased this so I could make my own sunscreen.  It seems to work well.  No overt smell.  Sometimes I add it to my facial oils also.</li>
    <li> This started smelling rancid shortly after purchasing. It is supposed to have a long shelf life, but the smell will just cause me to throw it away. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> It is suspiciously silky, and so far no irritation on my insanely sensitive skin. My first impression upon smelling the oil was that it was rancid but after further investigation I realized it&#x27;s the natural scent. It is 100 times less smelly than carrot seed oil, which for me is unbearable. The &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; aroma, as they like to call it, dissipates after a short while leaving a sweeter scent. And of course keep any carrier oils in the refrigerator. For what it&#x27;s worth, the expiration on my bottle says 2016.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a theory that some people are more sensitive to the smell of certain seed oils. Some people LIKE the scent of carrot seed oil. To me it is horrifying and lingers for WEEKS. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m just more sensitive, like some people are more sensitive to vegetables with oxalate and cilantro, for example. The chemical in that stuff is super amplified for some.</li>
    <li> This is what it says it is.  I think there are better quality oils out there.  Nothing wrong with this, just not my fav.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. I mixed it with some other kind of moisturizer. I wanted to try red raspberry seed oil and now I have. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my complextion</li>
    <li> I will be using this in a natural sunscreen preparation and was excited to get it.</li>
    <li> This oil does miracles! Soften the skin, doesn’t leave an oily shine – raspberry oil is a mattifier. It absorbs perfectly and has a neutral odor (resembling seeds sort of). A little goes a long way. Very true, 1 drop is enough to apply for the whole face. I also like to add raspberry seed oil to my body lotion it makes my skin feel velvety like. I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I&#x27;ve used this in homemade suntan lotion recently and will be using it in some other homemade beauty products soon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it after needling, and it works great at helping my skin cells rejuvenate.</li>
    <li> It smelled nice and worked wonderfully in my sun screen.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27; t work very well for me as a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this natural oil, serves me well in hot Sunshine State climate - as a daily moisturizer and a natural sunscreen. I&#x27;ll have to order more, soon.</li>
    <li> Great way to add SPF protection to DIY face cream and body lotion recipies!</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would be beneficial to use for sun block, but it did not meet my expectations. The seller was great, product came quickly and the price was about the best I could find.</li>
    <li> best product for any price! a must have for Crunchy parenting. it is great to use in organic sun screen.</li>
    <li> I used this as part of a home formula sun screen, the screen worked in 90 degree sun of Florida. There was a burn on a portion of skin that was untreated. But the treated area was unscathed! Good poop.</li>
    <li> To Heidi: Essential oils are designed be used on the skin and can even be taken internally as well, if they have the FDA food label on them.&lt;br /&gt;My concern in the labeling of this product is that is has &amp;#34;carrier oil&amp;#34; in the product.  I don&#x27;t want filler,carrier oils. I&#x27;m looking for 100%&lt;br /&gt;raspberry seed oil.  This bottle doesn&#x27;t state that, very misleading!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of very mixed feelings about this stuff, and I think I need to test another brand of red raspberry seed oil in order to know if this is par for the course. The smell is not at all pleasant, almost like fish oil, and the problem is I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s rancid or supposed to smell like this. The reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is that the oil makes my skin feel really nice, and this may well be what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like. I don&#x27;t want to mark down a product without knowing what I&#x27;m talking about. If I get some frame of reference, I&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Oily&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Very soft and NOT oily; incredibly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: Amber glass bottle with glass squeeze dropper&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* No visible changes but skin feels amazingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Get ye to google. This oil is supposed to be incredibly good for your skin. I would use this as a carrier oil for some essential oils that are also good for your skin and have a home-made powerhouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> This product was everything that was stated.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love essential oils and I use them everyday for just about everything. I never owned red raspberry seed oil but I am glad I did purchase this oil. The oil comes in a amber color plastic bottle with a pump dispenser.to me this oil does not have anboverpowering smell so that means it will blend nicely with other oils/products i like to use red raspberry seed oil with my moisturizer to help me achieve that youthful glow. Which that it does a amazing job at giving. Overall this is a great oil to add to your collection of oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DISCLAIMER I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, came quickly with no hassle. After longer use, however, the pump does leak causing some issue. No other problems I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Seems fine. Arrived without issue.</li>
    <li> My son hates anything on his skin.  He tolerated the red raspberry seed oil.  I used it on him and my nephew when they were at the pool with me for 6 hours.  Neither burned and I live in Florida.  My son has the pale, Scottish complexion and didn&#x27;t really tan much either.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase . will order again</li>
    <li> It supposedly blocks UVA and UVB. so far, so good - I used it in my sunblock that has zinc oxide, carrot oil, and red raspberry seed oil. I&#x27;m tanned but definitely not burning.</li>
    <li> Works great as a sunscreen and has a very mild smell.</li>
    <li> Let me say that I am a totally &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; when it comes to beauty care and loved the way this oil preformed in my natural sunscreen recipe.  The oil performs better than a brand I had been using that was more costly. Having said that, I would never trust raspberry seed oil alone as a sunscreen in the summer sun!</li>
    <li> The fragrance of the oil put me off a little at first. I quickly grew to like it. This oil leaves the skin so soft, for HOURS!</li>
    <li> it was so concentrated that it needed to be diluted, but its still retain its SPF properties. great product to keep the rays of the sun at bay</li>
    <li> I love essential oils, but I had never heard of red raspberry seed oil in general (as a carrier oil) So I decided it would be fun to give it a try. I immediately used it on my face and noticed that my skin is much softer and helped a breakout I had (that time of the month can be oh so much fun) I used a couple drops of tea tree oil to help with the breakout and the raspberry oil took care of the rest. I am so glad I tried it!  I prefer it as my carrier oil over some of the others I have tried in the past. The bottle is small, but you don&#x27;t need much. A few drops did my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
    <li> Use it in my homemade sunblock. No-one burns- nice tan</li>
    <li> Used it in a sunscreen recipe with coconut oil and carrot seed oil. This product arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. The oil smelled nice and had a nice consistency. I will definitely order more in the future!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for general skin care and with the intention of making homemade sunscreen as raspberry seed oil contains some SPF. I have used it on dry patches of skin as well as on a sunburn that I acquired prior to making my sunscreen. It helped with making the sunscreen go away sooner with no peeling.</li>
    <li> I have very, very dry skin especially during the winter time, my girlfriend recommended me to try those oils, and I gave it a try. Raspberry seed oil I tried on my face at night, and in the morning almost forgot to apply my moisturizer. My skin was soft and alive for the first time in years. Thanks for a fast shipping and I will most definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I got this only for the oil&#x27;s spf properties. I have only used it twice and it&#x27;s been great (not used in the sun yet) but just after cleansing.</li>
    <li> Very Satisfied with this product.  Shipping was super fast too!  I am planning on using it in my natural sunscreen that I am making this summer.</li>
    <li> I received my Red Raspberry seed oil about 1 weeks ago. I mixed shea butter with Raspberry oil and applied on my skin. And now my skin looks incredible! It is tight, brighter, smoother, and very soft. I also use this on my nails, feet, elbows, and crow&#x27;s feet. Amazing Results!!!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009M97Q0C RED RASPBERRY SEED OIL 100% Pure / Natural / Virgin. Cold Pressed / Undiluted Carrier Oil.
