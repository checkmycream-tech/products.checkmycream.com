      <li>The bottle is a different color, not grey like it shows.  </li>
      <li>Lastly, the shape of the new bottle makes it difficult to fit on a bathroom ledge, so we often put this on the shower floor.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great shampoo. No over powering odor. Keeps hair shinny and soft but does not leave it limp. I have used only this shampoo for 25 years.</li>
    <li> It hard to give this a rating because the I love the shampoo but the company who&#x27;s selling it keeps sending me a different type of shampoo.  Since we can&#x27;t send this item back, I&#x27;m stuck with two bottles of shampoo I don&#x27;t like.  In fact, the color of this bottle is a grayish color and the one they keep sending me is dark navy blue.  I don&#x27;t understand why they keep making this mistake.  I&#x27;m now looking for a different retailer to buy from</li>
    <li> I did NOT receive the product shown here, I ordered from amazon and received the \\&quot;Shampoo Revitalisant\\&quot; in the purple bottle, which strips my hair of shine and makes it feel course. I&#x27;ve used Kerpro for 20 years. The greatest advantage is that is saves me both time and money, because the conditioner and shampoo are combined in one product. It adds body and shine to my hair in one step. My disappointment is that my local stores charge $10 more than the Amazon price, and it&#x27;s very hard to find where I live. My second disappointment is the name change and new \\&quot;color coded\\&quot; bottles. Many of the salespeople at the beauty supply stores have no idea which product is Kerpro. Lastly, the shape of the new bottle makes it difficult to fit on a bathroom ledge, so we often put this on the shower floor. The Kerpro is excellent, the marketing (name change, bottle design, difficult to find locally) is a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> Been using this conditioner for decades and still love it. Never found a better conditioner for my soft, fine, wavy hair. Not too heavy like most conditioners, and I use it every day...</li>
    <li> I have lots of allergies to many shampoos. I can use this one without any problem. The price of it is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> The smell I can neither tell if it is fruity or floral but it&#x27;s light and I really like it. I have a very, very, very, sensitive scalp and most times immediately break out after using most shampoos. This product has yet left me with dandruff or hair loss. Also when I use it I almost do not feel the need for conditioner. It makes my natural hair very shiny and silky even though I have a full head of hair and sometimes it can look ashy.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and very dry hair. This product was recommended by hairstylist and love the way it leaves hair smooth and manageable.</li>
    <li> Used this Shampoo for years and is still the Best. New packaging but same product! Had a little problem with the way it was pack but all good.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this again because I don&#x27;t really care for the smell and there are other shampoos I would buy over this one.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not for me.  Sort of has a hint of ripe banana, actually smells more like those cheap candy marshmallows that look peanuts made of styrofoam.  The consistency is a little off - it&#x27;s obviously shampoo, it&#x27;s just different.  I can&#x27;t explain it, it&#x27;s OK, I would not get it again.  Unfortunately I bought a big bottle and had to use it up,  :(</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t aggrevate my ultra sensative scalp so that is a plus..it is because of the low PH. Ever since I had extensions, went to Atlantis and fried my scalp etc etc my scalp is super sensitive and have to be super careful. I also use &amp;#34;Enjoy&amp;#34; and love that too.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Quality product.  Highly recommend. A+++++</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I bought the large container and it came witha pump which is so easy to use in the shower. It is gentle on my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Bubbles are made by detergent, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t have a lot of that.  I have been using this for about 25 years, back when it was called Kerapro...still love it.  Everyday great shampoo the only thing that consistently cleans my hair with no build up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and it is a good product.  I want to point out a couple of things.  The product I got is in the blue bottle, not the gray one as is pictured.  I don&#x27;t know the difference between the blue and gray formulas, if any.  The bottle came wrapped in a plastic bag, and it had leaked an ounce or two during shipment.  Not enough of a problem to cause me to return it, however.  Also, note that this is the daily care conditioning shampoo, not the daily care balancing shampoo which is colorless.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> 5 stars. It&#x27;s great for thin fine hair and can be used every day. It won&#x27;t dry your hair out.</li>
    <li> Before using this shampoo, my hair was shedding seriously. After using this shampoo for 3 days, I noticed that I was not shedding as much. I felt like 70% reduction in my hair loss! The scent is kind of weird (to me, it smells like banana), but it is OK. It has paraben and other chemicals that I wish it didn&#x27;t have, but it works for me.</li>
    <li> I must admit that this is a fantastic shampoo.  In fact, Joico shampoos are good in general.  I have tried Bumble and Bumble, Kerastase, Pureology, etc. and this is the one that I always return too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as moisturizing for my hair as a friend had suggested.  I won&#x27;t reorder and will stick w. Nexxus.</li>
    <li> I noticed it has a different smell.  I don&#x27;t like the new smell but I like the product.  I am getting use to it.  It is ok but I wish it was the old smell.  The bottle is a different color, not grey like it shows.  What I found out they changed it to a different color.  So what I thought I was getting was not correct.  They should show the correct bottle color which is purple when they are selling a product.</li>
    <li> We have used this shampoo for many years for the whole family.  It leaves hair soft and manageable and doesn&#x27;t have a residue buildup.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only brands I am not allergic to. I love the smell and that it works so well.</li>
