<li> I only use it as a base and top coat when I get my weekly manicures</li>

<li> Less breakage &amp; less cracking</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve use this product for at less 5 years.  </li>
<li> I had to use it a few weeks before I started to see results</li>
<li> so I can&#x27;t see How that can help my weak nails which this product states to do.</li>
<li> However my nails were ruined, weak, splitting and breaking.</li>
<li> I have weak nails that tend to peel and split.</li>
<li> --I just probably shouldn&#x27;t have put anything on my nails to start with since they&#x27;re so thin.</li>
<li> I have had thin brittle nails for 55 years.  </li>
<li> This nail Polish has strengthened my nails and prevented them from breaking even during the difficult winter months.</li>
<li> Even expensive things.</li>
<li> I was really disappointed with this product.</li>

    <li> This product is wonderful!  I have had thin brittle nails for 55 years.  A nail technician told me about this product, so I had to try.  She told me to put on a coat each day for a week and on the seventh day remove all layers and start over.  My nails began to get harder with and two weeks.  I actually need to file my nails now because of their length.  Also, once your nails are stronger you can cut back the need to layer this product to every other day or every third day.</li>
    <li> Great polish I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> It was very easy to apply, and had very few bubbles.  I love the matte finish; now I don&#x27;t see a reflection of my face!.</li>
    <li> still using - helps nails to grow</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my nails had been splitting and chipping and I wanted to protect them from splitting more.  My nails were protected as they grew out, and it kept the peeling down.  Now they&#x27;re strong and healthy, would recommend this!</li>
    <li> My nails are better than ever! They were paper thin and now they are strong and great. Shipped on time.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working!!!  Yeah!!!!</li>
    <li> Really good for helping keep strong healthy nails.</li>
    <li> like it better than the other one clear nail polish</li>
    <li> much &amp;#34;weaker&amp;#34; strengthening than product I previously used...but cheaper so I should have known. Guess I should not have bought 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> It worked beautifully and continues to do so.  It was the best and most consistent I&#x27;ve ever used. One a coat a day for a week and remove it and start again.</li>
    <li> My sister gave me the product some time ago. After using it, I became addicted.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to find you on the internet. I was delighted to easily obtain the Rejuvacote. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product for at less 5 years.  Grow long strong nails. I apply Stickey then rejuvacote then polish, now using it as a top coat.  Apply everyday help keep the polish look great, and nails strong.</li>
    <li> If u want nails, this is the product to get those beautiful nails.</li>
    <li> since I only been using it for short time my nails seem to be getting stronger . so far so good</li>
    <li> 2nd time ordering so must really like this product</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this product. It came highly recommended by a friend, and yet I found it to be no different than any other top coat or clear polish I&#x27;ve used in the past. Plus my nails became ultra brittle after a couple of days and some of them broke off. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s due to this particular brand--I just probably shouldn&#x27;t have put anything on my nails to start with since they&#x27;re so thin.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps my nails grow</li>
    <li> I recommend this product especially if you are trying to recover your nail health after using gels or acrylics for long periods of time. Be sure to use it daily, even over polish, to get the results you want.</li>
    <li> I had been using another product for years and this was recommended by my manicurist. I only use it as a base and top coat when I get my weekly manicures and it seems to be working. I have weak nails that tend to peel and split. It looks like they are improving after only a few weeks. It keeps the manicure fresh for longer as well.</li>
    <li> Rejuvacote Nail Growth System is great. I have been using it for about a year and I am pleased with the results. I had to use it a few weeks before I started to see results but it really works. I won&amp;#34;t be without it.</li>
    <li> MY FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT THIS PRODUCT FOR PROBLEM NAILS. I TRIED IT AND IT REALLY WORKS MY NAILS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG.</li>
    <li> I was using it to help grow my nails faster and stronger after acrylics. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Sally Hansen 4-in-1 is better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I absouletly love this product. My co-worker told me about this prodcut and I have not stopped using it. It makes my nails really strong &amp; hard. I have been using this product over 7 years. Invest people to obain strong healthy nails.!!!</li>
    <li> This nail Polish has strengthened my nails and prevented them from breaking even during the difficult winter months. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is what I wanted but mine arrived with a more pink color not a clear color.  I like clear better.</li>
    <li> Best nail growth system I have used. Better than anything I have used. Even expensive things.It really works. I have used it for many years.</li>
    <li> This nail growth system seems to be the real deal.  So far, my nails seem to have improved.  May be too soon to say for sure, but the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, seem to have strengthened my nails.  Less breakage &amp; less cracking &amp; I&#x27;ve been diabetic for 30 years, so they needed some help!</li>
    <li> I was a nail tech for years and always used it. I love it and it really does make your nail stronger. I sold other more expensive product and never got the good results I got with Rejuvacote. It is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I had been having problems with my nails after using shellac nails - this product helped to get my nails back in shape.</li>
    <li> Great for restore weak nails love it!!!will order again been using long time nails grow stronger and healthy !!! Nice</li>
    <li> I had years of acrylic, gel, etc. nail treatment and I decided I had enough. However my nails were ruined, weak, splitting and breaking. My manicurist recommended Rejuvacote. I have been using it according to directions since March. My nails are now strong, don&#x27;t break and every once in a while I have to cut them, since they get long. I don&#x27;t remember the last time my nails were in this good shape. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It peels off my nails within a day or two so I can&#x27;t see How that can help my weak nails which this product states to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a while and really helps my nails strenthen!! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  Cannot purchase in the stores.</li>
    <li> A great nail strengthener and natural look. The best product on the market.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not doing anything so far.  I was hoping this would be better than Sally H.  But nothing yet.  I&#x27;ll keep going at it.  Maybe another two weeks.  We&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> I have been telling others about this product. I use the nail grow product and I have seen excellent results for my nails.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It works. My nails have grown and become stronger and looked like never before</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works very well!</li>
    <li> This product is 100% what it says it is - when used as instructed nails will strengthen, grow, and it is reasonably priced for the end result &amp; dries quickly.</li>
