      <li>I really love Special Effects.</li>
      <li>Came out fantastic.</li>
      <li>AND it is cruelty free.</li>
      <li>This is great for making your color last with longer hair, as re-coloring it from scratch is a pricey pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>To get an orange-er look at first I tried manic panic wildfire, but it was cool toned!!</li>
      <li>Special Effects is one of the better known hair dyes for the fun colors.</li>
      <li>It lasts forever and you will be soooo excited about it, I swear.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I got this color that I didn&#x27;t do that and threw caution to the wind and ended up dying my hands as well.</li>
      <li>This is the second color I have purchased and it works great at keeping my dyed hair looking fresh.</li>
      <li>The napalm orange came out exactly the color in the picture, and has lasted already through two shampoos at original color!  </li>
      <li>After bleaching/dyeing with Special Effects</li>
      <li>I decided that Special Effects seemed to be the winner.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>After bleaching/dyeing with Special Effects</li>
      <li>I was going for bright orange and it came out fire truck red.</li>
      <li>Really bright especially after bleaching hair.</li>
      <li>(taking good care of it, I got my color to last for almost two months... not kidding.</li>
      <li>It turned my hair super orange and lasted about a month before fading and about six weeks before it was all the way washed out.  </li>
      <li>but the results are extraordinary,</li>
      <li>and it has the most vivid color.</li>
      <li>WOW!!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair any sort of fun</li>
      <li>This color comes out to be a completely obnoxious road-cone orange, and I love it.</li>
      <li>who&#x27;s hair is just a touch less bright than mine.</li>
      <li>You will not beet to lift to almost white for this, I was barely yellow and had great results.</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s a bit pricey for how small the bottles are, but truthfully you&#x27;re getting more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s a bit pricey for how small the bottles are, but truthfully you&#x27;re getting more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a really pretty orange, it&#x27;s just not neon anymore.</li>
      <li>My haircut style was fairly goofy but I only had it in for 3 days</li>
      <li>When I wana push more to the red side</li>
      <li>if I do a more orangey or red red use a semi on top for added oomph.</li>
      <li>Napalm Orange is a personal favorite of mine.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s obvious if you have darker hair, but even if you have lighter brown/blonde hair it will take up the color a lot better with bleaching.</li>
      <li>Not that I wish to cause injury, but that is a pretty good testament to the fact that you will not go unnoticed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously though, every time someone says they&#x27;re going to go to Hot Topic and buy hair dye I yell at them.</li>
      <li>I use either ion brights red or one of manic panic&#x27;s many reds.</li>
      <li>So I was hesitant but this product worked exactly like it said.  </li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t lighten your hair without you bleaching it first</li>
      <li>it looked exactly like it did on the bottle when i bought it...</li>
      <li>It also looks good as it fades, it just goes from a more pale orange to a yellow.</li>
      <li>Fresh full applications over a well-lifted bleach will be an intensely rich safety-orange color not far off from the color in-bottle.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this dye in more than a year and even using conditioner every day my hair now, in it&#x27;s natural state, is not as soft as it is after I had dyed it.     </li>

    <li> even thought this is temp color it last for quite a long time i love all the special effects colors</li>
    <li> her hair looks like it&#x27;s literally on fire. Great coverage and a very nice effect. Would definitely recommend it to my crazy friends.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve used similar stuff like Manic Panic before and that turned out disastrous, but this product is so much better. It holds its color really well and actually comes out the correct color, unlike Manic Panic. Just remember to buy a tinting brush and gloves because its just the tube of color. I was so excited when I got this color that I didn&#x27;t do that and threw caution to the wind and ended up dying my hands as well. But everyone got a good laugh at that and so did I. Also, it comes out much nicer if you bleached your hair previously.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this multiple times and have never been disappointed. It lasts FOREVER compared to most dyes (taking good care of it, I got my color to last for almost two months... not kidding. Yes it was various shades of orange, but still orange after all that time. After that it was just yellow, which was weird looking as my roots came in but not a bad color). It also looks good as it fades, it just goes from a more pale orange to a yellow. Yes it is an obnoxious color, but it&#x27;s also gorgeous IMO. The way it soaked in was really natural - by that I just mean, it had highlights and lowlights just like regular hair, it wasn&#x27;t all just the same color, and the variation was particularly interesting in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that it comes in incredibly small bottles and I have super thick hair, so it almost always takes more than a bottle to cover my whole head and my hair isn&#x27;t even long. The price of it has gone up a LOT since I started using it - when I originally bought it, it was a flat $8 from Amphigory for one bottle, so it cost about $20 to dye my hair - not unreasonable. I&#x27;m glad I found this page because Amphigory&#x27;s prices, as well as the rest of the prices on Amazon and from individual sellers on Ebay, are now close to $13/bottle if not more. These are TINY, tiny bottles of dye. Much smaller than what you get from boxed/natural hair dyes. If you&#x27;re really careful you can make it stretch a long way (when I&#x27;ve had shorter hair I managed to do just one bottle), but I recommend getting two bottles just in case - then if you don&#x27;t use them both, you have one to do touch ups later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely do recommend bleaching your hair before you do this though. That&#x27;s obvious if you have darker hair, but even if you have lighter brown/blonde hair it will take up the color a lot better with bleaching. I also have to say that when they advertise this as \\&quot;conditioning,\\&quot; they&#x27;re not kidding. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with regular brands before (even natural colors) and bleaching it beforehand FRIED my hair, made it this awful texture that I couldn&#x27;t do anything with and didn&#x27;t want to touch. After bleaching/dyeing with Special Effects my hair is super soft. I haven&#x27;t used this dye in more than a year and even using conditioner every day my hair now, in it&#x27;s natural state, is not as soft as it is after I had dyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, every time someone says they&#x27;re going to go to Hot Topic and buy hair dye I yell at them. USE THIS BRAND. Yes it&#x27;s a bit pricey for how small the bottles are, but truthfully you&#x27;re getting more than your money&#x27;s worth. It lasts forever and you will be soooo excited about it, I swear. :)ching it beforehand FRIED my hair, made it this awful texture that I couldn&#x27;t do anything with and didn&#x27;t want to touch.

    <li> Special Effects hair colors are brilliant semi-perm dyes. The brand is fantastic for your alternative coloring needs! Napalm Orange is a personal favorite of mine. Fresh full applications over a well-lifted bleach will be an intensely rich safety-orange color not far off from the color in-bottle. After 8-12 washes it fades to a soft apricot blonde, which is very pretty but feels like straw. To avoid this, I mix 2 parts conditioner (I use Ion Color Defense Intense Moisture) to 1 part Napalm Orange and apply like normal. 20-30 mins will refresh the color to a vivid orange that&#x27;s a about where it was after 2-3 washes as well as condition the heck out of it. This is great for making your color last with longer hair, as re-coloring it from scratch is a pricey pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner dilution with any other SFX colors, but I can&#x27;t imagine it not working across the brand. I&#x27;m anxious to try it after a fresh bleach, actually. You can get wonderful pastels with SFX and conditioner dilution!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different colors in my hair and all different brands of dye to achieve those colors.  By far, the Special Effects line of semi-permanent dye is the best I&#x27;ve found yet!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so vibrant and long-lasting, and even throughout the fading process I get compliments on how great it looks!  The more you bleach your hair before application, the better it turns out.&lt;br /&gt;Every other dye I&#x27;ve used begins fading within the first week and needs to be re-applied way too frequently.  This is definitely not true of Special Effects.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend going to your stylist and having them put in the dye, because when you sit under the heated dryer the color comes out even brighter and bolder!</li>
    <li> What else can I say...............WOW!!!!! this is the best ever, I used this during the carnival season and it was brilliant orange. I was truly pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> After using manic panic \\&quot;electric tiger lily\\&quot; dye, I was very disappointed in it&#x27;s color and staying power and decided to try Special Effects. This dye lasts approximately 2 weeks in my bleached hair with no special care and daily washing/conditioning. The color is very vibrant to start with a continues to look good even as it fades. If you want BRIGHT ORANGE hair, this is the dye for you. I am very happy with this product and plan to buy from Special Effects if I ever need hair dye again.</li>
    <li> This comes out a nice brilliant orange, and doesn&#x27;t fade too quickly. Lasts several days at full intensity, and is faded-looking after 4-5 weeks. It&#x27;s my favorite SE color that I&#x27;ve tried so far, definitely a lot of color punch!</li>
    <li> The color is incredible! Last so much! Its a little hard to spread it on but the results are extraordinary,</li>
    <li> My hair is very tricky to dye. It took about four months of bleaching to get it blonde. So I was hesitant but this product worked exactly like it said.  It turned my hair super orange and lasted about a month before fading and about six weeks before it was all the way washed out.  I am excited to try other colors by special effects. I really liked how fast it arrived and how it came packaged too. :)</li>
    <li> The product was amazing. It came out a neon orange and it faded down a little bit within two weeks. It&#x27;s still a really pretty orange, it&#x27;s just not neon anymore.</li>
    <li> I really love Special Effects. This is the second color I have purchased and it works great at keeping my dyed hair looking fresh. I actually did not purchase this too dye my hair Napalm Orange. My hair is currently dyed a copper red color an to keep it from fading quickly in between dyes, I mix a little bit of the Napalm Orange in with my conditioner each time I shower, leave it on for 5 - 10 minutes and then rinse. By doing this it keeps my hair from fading super quickly, so it always looks as great as it did when I first dyed it.</li>
    <li> This color comes out to be a completely obnoxious road-cone orange, and I love it. It faded slowly on my hair, lasting for over a month. A good color if you want to turn heads or be easily found in a crowd of people.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this orange alot more then the hi octane one i got before   this one is so much brighter</li>
    <li> Great orangey-red hair color.  This is not orange orange, but RED orange.  If you are looking for that, you will like this!</li>
    <li> I love special fx hair colors!! they work better and last longer than any other stain ive tried... the orange comes out really bright just as described and pictured.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on my hair all the time, especially outdoors where the sun is shining. For me, it&#x27;s a color that instantly lifts the spirits. It&#x27;s nice because, although I&#x27;d definitely recommend bleaching your hair prior to applying this dye... you at least don&#x27;t have to worry about getting your hair lighter than that awkward yellow stage... it just adds to the base of the orange.&lt;br /&gt;As an extra perk, I&#x27;m planning on going the easy route this Halloween and going as Leeloo from the movie Fifth Element, who&#x27;s hair is just a touch less bright than mine.</li>
    <li> Loved my neon orange hair! This product is the best bright color product that I have ever used so far!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome bright orange, it looks somewhat red at first but once it fades alittle it is still a beautiful orange color.</li>
    <li> I was going for bright orange and it came out fire truck red. I don&#x27;t care either way but if you want real orange go with the splat fireballs dye kit. it comes with bleach and the orange is not red.</li>
    <li> beautiful color, I have used it before and the brand is the best on the market, and believe me I have used many many colors. But it doesn&#x27;t stay in the tips of my hair for more than a few days, but I think that has more to do with how dead the tips of my hair is now, so i highly recommend this one, it is the best orange dye on the market.</li>
    <li> The napalm orange came out exactly the color in the picture, and has lasted already through two shampoos at original color!  Will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I used Napalm Orange hair dye for my 10th Tough Mudder. [...]  Wish I could attach a photo. My haircut style was fairly goofy but I only had it in for 3 days and I shaved it all off</li>
    <li> Kept my dull red hair a vibrant orangey color, it&#x27;s not too messy, and lasts longer than other alternatives in my opinion. Extremely satisfied</li>
    <li> please ship this to Canada i love this product and i would love to be able to buy it in bulk instead of one or two at a time.</li>
    <li> LOVE this color! I discovered it on accident a few years ago in a local beauty shop where the shop advertised it as a deep red, which was a big surprise when i washed out the dye! this orange is one of my FAVORITE colors and i come back for it again and again! so vibrant!</li>
    <li> this color was very vibrant. it looked exactly like it did on the bottle when i bought it... the color lasted more that 3 weeks and 10 washes later it is still looking great. it actually washed out to look like a natural red head type of color. i will definetly buy this color again. i recomend mixing it with a red if u dont want tiger like color but its a great base for a natural looking red color after wash out.</li>
    <li> Used this as an added base to the nuclear red color. Came out fantastic. Really bright especially after bleaching hair.</li>
    <li> The perfect shade of orange AND it is cruelty free. Perfection in a bottle. You will not beet to lift to almost white for this, I was barely yellow and had great results. It lasted with upkeep of cold water rinses and sealer in the shower about 4 months and only then needed a slight touch up. I will definitely be using napalm again in the future.</li>
    <li> Excellent vibrant orange color, and lasts a decent amount of time before having to re-dye it (~4 weeks). Also doesn&#x27;t stain much other than your hair. Really love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair any sort of fun colour before - after doing a good deal of research on the colour I wanted (orange) I decided that Special Effects seemed to be the winner.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been over a month now since I&#x27;ve used it, and I wash my hair at least twice a week in cold water.. and my colour is STILL super bold and barely faded. I LOVE this stuff! My ends didn&#x27;t bleach as well, so they were a little darker and over processed, but the colour still looks ridiculously nice, and I get nothing but compliments on it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want orange hair, try this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing. But if you have white tile, prepare to clean your shower a lot, because it leaves a gigantic, pumpkiny mess everywhere when you wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note: If you have thick, curly hair (like I do) and it&#x27;s past shoulder length, buy THREE bottles. Everywhere says two will cover it, but it BARELY will, and you&#x27;ll be stretching out the dye. Buy three, and just use a little extra from the third bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this color on my hair without bleaching it first and it is still dark red/dark orange.  It won&#x27;t lighten your hair without you bleaching it first so keep that in mind.  When I bleach my hair first it is crazy bright dark orange and fades to a pale orange.</li>
    <li> I love dyeing my hair many colors and this is one I have not done yet can&#x27;t wait to do it!</li>
    <li> i have a convoluted way of dyeing: I first use l&#x27;oreal hicolor in either copper or red (the hilights not the all-over dye, but I use it all over), then I do a little henna gloss to eliminate any damage from the hicolor, then depending on if I do a more orangey or red red use a semi on top for added oomph. This is my go-to for Orange/copper! It&#x27;s just gorgeous and lasts forever. It&#x27;s not traffic-cone orange on me cause I&#x27;m not starting with a bleached base. It&#x27;s far from natural though. On my base it&#x27;s an extremely bright red/orange. Perfect! When I wana push more to the red side I use either ion brights red or one of manic panic&#x27;s many reds. To get an orange-er look at first I tried manic panic wildfire, but it was cool toned!! It&#x27;s not supposed to be. I wash with a sulfate shampoo no conditioner blow dry and keep this on for a minimum of 30 minutes. More if I can. Then I rinse and use ion color sealing conditioner. People who complain about their reds fading should try my trick... My reds never fade til I want them to so I can change the tone up a bit!</li>
    <li> Amazon keeps telling me my package was delivered, but I&#x27;ve been on the phone with the delivery service \\&quot;Lasership\\&quot; for two days. I ordered one day delivery on Monday and it&#x27;s now Friday. I&#x27;m sitting here with a bleached head waiting to use my dye but woops, it&#x27;s still not here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had realized that ordering one day service off of an amazon prime seller meant wasting my time waiting around for some piece of crap delivery service (instead of the USPS or UPS, why?) I never would have ordered from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s hoping I finally get my hair dye before I have to go to work all weekend looking like a complete idiot.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as expected and quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair for over ten years, using every sort of color and brand. Special Effects is the best brand out there. It stays on longer than most (approx. 3 weeks to a month and still bright) and it has the most vivid color. This Napalm Orange is so bright, I&#x27;ve seen people trip or run into poles while checking my hair out. Not that I wish to cause injury, but that is a pretty good testament to the fact that you will not go unnoticed. If you are going for a nice orange to match Halloween or your favorite sports team, this is it. Other brands can do reds and blues easily enough, but have a hard time achieving the pure color of oranges and pinks. Special Effects has none of that dull, lifeless color that comes from other brands. Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re just going for a tint. This is color that wishes to be noticed.</li>
    <li> Special Effects is one of the better known hair dyes for the fun colors. Compared to most shades of Manic Panic, this has held better in my hair. I mix this with a bit of conditioner upon application so I don&#x27;t have to use as much dye every time I touch up. In the past, I have also mixed it in the actual conditioner bottle to use in the shower. I have heard this helps refresh your color, but personally, I haven&#x27;t noticed it to be of any significant help. Only caution: wherever you apply this, be careful of the surrounding area, and lay down towels/rags/etc. You might also want to wear a trash bag. It can be pretty messy until you really get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to achieve a very good glow from this. It was also hard to tell that the brown hair had taken an orange tinge to it until viewed under sunlight.</li>
