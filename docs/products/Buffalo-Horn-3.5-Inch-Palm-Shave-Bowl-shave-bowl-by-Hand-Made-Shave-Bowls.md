      <li>Looks good on the counter.</li>
      <li>It was good while it lasted, though.</li>
      <li>Perfect size and fairly light</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the gorgeous pattern depicted.</li>
      <li>you can see the bubbles and therefore get a really good lather on the brush (not in the bowl, by the way).  </li>
      <li>I write this review in shame that I was duped by the idea that a 3.5 inch Buffalo horn bowl was a good idea at 15 bucks.</li>
      <li>That works well for me as it does not overpower the weight of my brush and lather, so that I get a good feel for my lather quality.  </li>
      <li>how well it works, and to be fair</li>
      <li>Good bowl, I don&#x27;t notice the smell others have mentioned.  </li>
      <li>I suspect a drop or travel will not do the bowl much good.  </li>
      <li>Beautifully made and quite elegant.</li>
      <li>The bowl is beautiful in appearance, light and a perfect fit for the palm of your hand.  </li>
      <li>Its a very sexy bowl.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good size and looks nice.</li>
      <li>The shaving bowl is very handsome, is lightweight and fits nicely in the palm of the hand.  </li>
      <li>They are so unique and beautiful, the veins match with my silver tip badger brush.</li>
      <li>Believe me this bowl is perfect for building lather if you do it a certain way.  </li>
      <li>But probably as important for my purposes, it&#x27;s attractive and well made.</li>
      <li>And it floats in the sink&#x27;s warm water, keeping the soap warm.  </li>
      <li>It seems like a nice bowl, but I cannot deal with this smell.</li>
      <li>Really nice hand made bowl.</li>
      <li>And the bowl I received doesn&#x27;t have as nice a finish as the bowl in</li>
      <li>My bowl is nicely colored and aesthetically pleasing from afar.</li>
      <li>Really nice.</li>
      <li>The curve of the bowl does allow for a really nice feel in the hand, although I have not used it myself while mixing shave lather.</li>
      <li>I would not purchase another for shaving, but it is a nice decorative bowl or pocket change holder.</li>
      <li>I have to say I ordered this along with a nice ceramic bowl....</li>
      <li>It gets better, it&#x27;s a really good shaving bowl.</li>
      <li>Another advantage of it being a horn bowl is that it can float in the sink, so you could fill it with warm water to rinse your razor, and also have this bowl floating in order to keep your foam warm.</li>
      <li>Is that kind of things you don&#x27;t wanna share</li>
      <li>Nice purchase.</li>
      <li>nice item but</li>
      <li>This is no buffalo horn, or any kind of horn material.</li>
      <li>purpose of this is to get a nice warm lather.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size, shape, and looks great, but it did not last.</li>
      <li>Works wells and fits nicely into your palm.  </li>
      <li>It has a scent of it&#x27;s own that enhances the shaving experience.&lt;br</li>
      <li>He quickly replaced the cracked bowl with one that looked beautiful and was sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because it was unique and attractive.  </li>
      <li>Pros: Light, attractive, good fit.  </li>
      <li>Cosmetically appealing and nice and while it does smell funky it makes for a nice piece on the bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>That said, it&#x27;s a beautiful bowl, extraordinarily well made and has a nice and easy heft to it.  </li>
      <li>But the colors are spectacular, much better than the one in the phot.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautifully crafted and exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I received this as a very thoughtful gift.</li>
      <li>Very nice at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>However, it is very comfortable in my hand as I build the lather with my brush.</li>
      <li>Fits my hand nicely and looks really cool!</li>
      <li>The bowl was made well and nicely polished, and size was fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s larger than I was anticipating, fits perfectly in my palm!</li>
      <li>really love this bowl</li>
      <li>This horn may have a better use than a soap bowl.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love my buffalo horn shave bowl.  </li>
      <li>Then, I bought a pottery bowl, which I love for the heft.  </li>
      <li>After a couple of months the color has shown some more lightening, areas are coming out and is giving it more character.</li>
      <li>You will be able to see their size and determine if the bowl is wright for you.</li>
      <li>Seems more decorative than practical in that regard.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Came with a bad smell but it went away over time. Doesn&#x27;t give that much greater of a lather compared to other bowls. I would go with something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read comments from reviewers about this bowl being too small.  That is simply not true.  The bowl is beautiful in appearance, light and a perfect fit for the palm of your hand.  My brushes produce excellent lather with little effort.  I use a Simpson Chubby #1 Best Badger or a Semogue #620 Boar with the bowl and there are excellent results.  Don&#x27;t worry about the size, it is exactly large enough for a rich, smooth lather.  If you know how to use a palm bowl, there will be no problem.  Cream is easier to work for the novice but loading a brush from a soap puck takes a little experience.  The palm bowl is simply the next and final step in working a lather to the right consistency. Also, the amount of water you allow to cling to the brush makes a world of difference in the results. This bowl makes a great gift for the wet shaver.</li>
    <li> Got this for mix my shaving cream and even though it look nice is a bit hard to use. Since is a bowl when you leave the brush it wil fall side ways. I replaced with a ceramic mug.</li>
    <li> The bowl I got was perfect.  Yes, it&#x27;s small.  But the colors are spectacular, much better than the one in the phot.  Mine has rich creamy whites throughout.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love love this bowl, it really set off the whole shaving set! It looks and feels amazing, but when my boyfriend went to use it - he subjected to the most terrible smell! I am researching if there is any way to get rid of this smell, and will update this review if I find anything. So beautiful though!</li>
    <li> Works ok but the bowl is a little to small to work up a good lather.</li>
    <li> this thing is tiny and smaller than the palm of my hand... should have been $.99 not what i paid.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift, and was well received.  The one I got was darker than the one in the picture, but variations in color and pattern are to be expected with natural crafted items.  The curve of the bowl does allow for a really nice feel in the hand, although I have not used it myself while mixing shave lather.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt about the quality here....it&#x27;s PLASTIC.  I did not spend $15 in order to get a horn bowl made of plastic.  Shame on me.  I now plan to pony up the money for the legit horn bowl on classic shaving.  At best, this was a disappointing birthday gift for my husband.</li>
    <li> The bowl felt cheap like plastic and looked like plastic.  It was so light weight that I couldn&#x27;t set a brush in it without it tipping. In my palm it worked pretty well, though shave cream spilled over the sides as I wipped it. I used it for a few weeks. Then, I bought a pottery bowl, which I love for the heft.  I&#x27;ll use the horn bowl for paperclips.</li>
    <li> This bowl is far far too small to produce an effective lather. Complete waste of money for even a casual shaver.</li>
    <li> I just wasn&#x27;t expecting a cheap plastic bowl. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fits my hand nicely and looks really cool!</li>
    <li> Although the bowl has the dimension posted, due to how shallow the bowl is it seems uncomfortably small.  There is not much room to lather, especially if you have a larger brush.  I understand that this is a natural product so the finish varies, but mine is basically straight black with some slight hues of white on the bottom side.  Overall it does work to create a lather, but sadly I will likely replace this in the near future.</li>
    <li> Dose it smell bad? Yes, but the smell went a way after a short time. The initial smell is the only reason it&#x27;s not getting a 5 star rating  Is it plastic? No, it is real horn. Mine even has slight flaws that always occur in a natural product. The reviews stating that it is plastic are either lying or just simply can&#x27;t tell the difference between horn and plastic.  This is not a shaving mug and is NOT for use with a shaving soap. It is used for shaving cream. I have no problem using it.</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail less than an hour ago. The item is cracked right down the middle (pic posted for your viewing). This thing was well protected in it&#x27;s packaging as well, which makes me wonder how on Earth it can get damaged so badly. Did the seller sent the defective item as is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, onto the item itself: this thing is straight up plastic. This is no buffalo horn, or any kind of horn material. It&#x27;s plastic!!</li>
    <li> This bowl came to me exactly as promised.  Yes it is authentically made from buffalo horn and not plastic like others have stated.  It fits comfortably in the palm of my hand and allows me to build a nice later.  I must warn you that when new and water is added to the bowl to heat it up there is a terrible smell but rest assured over time and use like maybe a month or less the smell completely dissipates.  Not much else to say about it except each bowl will be uniquely different for obvious reasons some have a great color variation and others may be completel a dark brown color.  Mine fell somewhere in between but either way it would not have bothered me one bit.</li>
    <li> I certainly thought it would be wider than what I received. Makes for a very messy shave for even smaller shaving brushes.</li>
    <li> Cosmetically appealing and nice and while it does smell funky it makes for a nice piece on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> The handmade really threw me off. I thought it would be made of wood with someone taking pride in making this bowl. It is made of plastic.</li>
    <li> Bought this bowl for shaving. It changes the color when in contact with water. Until now, no major complain though. Maybe a bit expensive for a piece of horn ... That&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> NOPE. I don&#x27;t know what is pictured here, but what I received was a 16 dollar PIECE OF BLACK PLASTIC BOWL. Returning immediately.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought it was too small, but it is strong, light and easily held while brushing on lather. You can&#x27;t easily do that with ceramic mugs. It holds shaving soap well, except the extra large soaps.  I like different things and this is different.</li>
    <li> I really have no right to complain because the description states the size of the item.  but I don&#x27;t know why anyone would even consider making a shaving bowl this small.  It barely holds a cake of shaving soap and it is impossible to later-up the soap without splashing it all over the bathroom.  I used it twice and gave it away.</li>
    <li> if you check my past reviews you will see that i dont like to post bad reviews. i would rather just not post at all. but this is bad, this thing actually stinks. it smells so bad when you get it wet it almost made me gag. i am not exagerating. and it looks and feels like plastic. i am throwing it away. i should have listened to the other reviewers.</li>
    <li> I mean it&#x27;s a bowl.. It&#x27;s good size and looks nice. But it actually seems to have taken water damage or something. It is all cracked and shriveled and dried out. Basically ruined and I got it a week ago. Used it three times. Kinda bummed. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My bowl is completely black and could be mistaken for plastic if you don&#x27;t look close for the grain.  It works well.  Seems to be a bit on the small side.  I do fear it falling apart as one one part of the lip appears to be delaminating.  I like the smell of it.  It&#x27;s like a hoof you&#x27;d give a dog.</li>
    <li> First let me say it is a nice bowl, and unique.  It had a sulfur like smell for the first couple of weeks when I would get it wet, but that was likely the natural smell of the horn.  The issues I found were 1 - it is so light and has such a small bottom surface that when I would put my brush back in after lathering my face, it would tip the bowl over and not sit straight up.  Not a major issue, but kind of annoying.  Worse is that, after a couple of weeks, I found the surface of the bowl cracking and peeling in the inside.  This may be due to the moisture/drying of use but since that is what it was designed to do . . .seems like its not very well suited.  As a shaving bowl alone, I would give it 1 maybe 2 stars.  That being said, it if you used it for something else, its a neat little bowl.</li>
    <li> works very well with Harry&#x27;s gel and the Parker&#x27;s brush</li>
    <li> bowl is much lighter than expected, but seems very durable - accidentally dropped it twice and not a chip or mark on it.  I expect to use it for years</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this shaving bowl when it first arrived. However, I soon noticed that it left a weird smell after being used. However, the smell went away after using for it for about a month. 6 months later, the layers are beginning to separate at the bottom of the bowl. I was hoping this bowl would last me several years, but now I will need to turn to either ceramic or stainless steel for my next shaving bowl.</li>
    <li> But I still USE IT! It&#x27;s way too damn small, the shaving creme foams off the edges getting on your hands, just a mess and I feel I am wasting my shaving creme product.</li>
    <li> Works wells and fits nicely into your palm.  I didn&#x27;t like the color of my bowl that I received because it was almost completely black.  After a couple of months the color has shown some more lightening, areas are coming out and is giving it more character.</li>
    <li> When I got this bowl I was really disappointed, it is extremely small.  I know the description says 3.5 inches so I should have expected that, but it really is small.  As someone who has wet shaved for many years and used multiple bowls I can tell you this isn&#x27;t big enough to contain your soap or creme if you build up a proper amount of lather.  I am also not sure it is actually buffalo horn, it feels like very thin plastic, although it does smell bad when you get it wet, so from what others described that must be real.  Once you included the cost of shipping, it wasn&#x27;t worth trying to send back, but I was not happy with the product overall.</li>
    <li> The bowl was made well and nicely polished, and size was fine. I have not been able to get over the smell of the natural horn when wet, even after using scented shaving soap.  This horn may have a better use than a soap bowl.  Erwin Jagger makes a nice stainless bowl for shave soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was unique and attractive.  When I received it in the mail I was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> The bowl cracked all over. Layers has come apart. Has not been dropped or hit. I live in a very dry place but not enough to dry a horn.</li>
    <li> Yes its a bowl.  Not much else to say about it.  The workmanship looks god on it. I droped it and it didn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Read the top reviews, they will tell you a lot about the bowl and its proper use.  My bowl has a brilliant polish and gloss, the grain is attractive with striation  and marbling.  It is appears small and fits my hands nicely, If you have big hands, maybe a bigger palm bowl is better for you.  It is very thin, but uniform.  That works well for me as it does not overpower the weight of my brush and lather, so that I get a good feel for my lather quality.  I suspect a drop or travel will not do the bowl much good.  If your proven shave cream doesn&#x27;t seem to lather fast, try knocking off some of the interior polish with fine sand paper.  I have found it gives slippery cream a little &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; and allows the brush to impart air faster.  Pros: Light, attractive, good fit.  Cons: price, fragile</li>
    <li> Received the bowl yesterday and have to admit that I chuckled a bit because it is very small.  Yes, it says 3.5\\&quot; and I should have known how small, but in real life, it&#x27;s even smaller than I expected.  That said, it&#x27;s a beautiful bowl, extraordinarily well made and has a nice and easy heft to it.  If it were offered in a 5\\&quot; size, I&#x27;d buy it instantly.  Alas, I have to dock a couple stars because I just don&#x27;t know how it could really be used for shaving.  Seems more decorative than practical in that regard.</li>
    <li> I have owned this bowl for quite a while now and every time I use it, I am reminded of my dislike for it. My bowl is nicely colored and aesthetically pleasing from afar. Upon closer inspection and after light use, however, it has lost its shine and is beginning to fall apart. My biggest gripe with this product is its small size. In my opinion, it provides no more convenience than simply building lather directly in the palm of your hand. Because this bowl is so small, it is impossible to build lather inside of without losing it out the sides and between your fingers. Prior to purchasing this bowl, I used an oversized glass mug with a handle and will likely move back to this setup moving forward.</li>
    <li> The only down side is that mine arrived solid black, not two-tone like the picture. But, that&#x27;s the risk you take when you buy a product hand made of natural material sight unseen, so I won&#x27;t hold it against them. I&#x27;d have used a picture of my nicest bowl too were I in their place lol. At any rate, solid black doesn&#x27;t look bad and it serves it&#x27;s intended purpose. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> You think something stating it is hand made buffalo horn would be, not a worse than a cheap tupperware bowl. would never by another product from &amp;#34;Hand Made Shave Bowls&amp;#34; again!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice bowl made from horn, its quite pretty but I have found it too small for real use as a shaving/lathering bowl. i purchased it for use during wet shaving with a straight razor but found that I am better off using a ceramic soap dish that comes with soap or a shaving mug. The horn bowl is light weight and pretty, but the foam easily comes out of the bow and over the edges. Perhaps, it is just my technique. I would not purchase another for shaving, but it is a nice decorative bowl or pocket change holder.</li>
    <li> Very nice at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all. Stinks when wet (even if a drop or two is left in it overnight), too light to hold a brush without tipping over.</li>
    <li> Yes this is a tad smaller than you&#x27;d think but the listing does say 3.5 inches and in all honesty, unless you are incredibly uncoordinated, its not even slightly difficult to work up a lather in, provided you are using shaving cream. I could see it being an issue if you&#x27;re using a shaving soap or something that takes some effort to work up. But if you&#x27;re using something like Proraso you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the topic of the \\&quot;bad smell\\&quot;, while it does have a funky burnt rubber-esque smell that isn&#x27;t necessarily pleasant, it only happens when its wet. When the bowl is dry its completely scent free. The smell is also really mild. The only way you&#x27;ll really smell it is if you straight up press your nose up against it and its easily overpowered by the scent of the shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful bowl. Beautifully made and quite elegant. For the people who complain that it is too small or that soap doesn&#x27;t fit in it, the bowl is made for the palm of your hand and to be used with a cream that comes out of a tube like toothpaste. I run hot water into the sink and warm the bowl before putting the cream into it. I truly like this bowl a great deal!</li>
    <li> This was my second bowl replacement due to flaws on the original order. Well this one also has a flaw in the material. Not sure If another replacement would be any better... My confidense level is very low regarding this item.</li>
    <li> looks cool, not as cool as image though. barely big enough to lather with. I use it for sample bars only.</li>
    <li> How cool is that! It gets better, it&#x27;s a really good shaving bowl. Perfect size and fairly light so it floats well. Works better than my stainless bowl.</li>
    <li> Good bowl, I don&#x27;t notice the smell others have mentioned.  Mine has good color variations, and you can tell it&#x27;s handmade due to the somewhat misshapen sides.  Works great for lathering, though, and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deceivingly small w/o something in the picture as a size reference?  This bowl is about the size of the palm of my hand just a tad smaller cuz I wear XXL gloves.  It&#x27;s also quite shallow and very, very plastic looking.  I&#x27;m amazed that I spent this much $ on this little bowl. I write this review in shame that I was duped by the idea that a 3.5 inch Buffalo horn bowl was a good idea at 15 bucks. I&#x27;ll have to give the shrug and walk of shame if any of my friends find out.  Cuz I&#x27;m not about to defend it&#x27;s Buffalo Horn etiology.  It looks cool in the pic but it&#x27;s not so much in real life. Even at 1.50 you may experience this same feeling. Please . . . if you buy it, come back and tell us of your tale of woe or pride.</li>
    <li> I received this as a very thoughtful gift. I have no problems with the size of the bowl or how well it works, and to be fair, I knew that of course color could vary, but the bowl I received was almost entirely black. Just a tad disappointed.</li>
    <li> The bowl looks nice, but it is really small.  Really too small to be of use to me.  I also like to soak my brush in hot water prior to using and I cannot do that with this little bowl.  The smooth bottom is not very conducive to creating a good lather either.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this bowl</li>
    <li> Was a gift but he seemed to really like it.</li>
    <li> The shaving bowl is very handsome, is lightweight and fits nicely in the palm of the hand.  However, the bone composite layers began coming apart after 3 months of use in a standard bathroom environment.  The bowl was totally unusable after 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with stainless steel instead.</li>
    <li> It took a second to realize this wasn&#x27;t just plastic. ..but if you hold it to a light, you can see the beauty.  Nice purchase.</li>
    <li> I have to say I ordered this along with a nice ceramic bowl....and I am using this one every day!! Nothing against ceramic, but that other bowl is just a little too small. This one is not only the right size, but because of the contours of the bowl, it sits nicely in the hand, while you make magic with the shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the finish fades a bit and quickly, but they warned about that, so no complaints there. Plus, I didnt buy it to have it in my living room as a conversation piece!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this palm bowl.  It is a great size and shape to produce a good lather with a brush.  I&#x27;ve had a lot more success with this than with my previous (and now broken) porcelain apothecary shave mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address some of the comments made in other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;1) This bowl is not plastic.  At a glance, it may resemble plastic, but it is definitely a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;2) There was a noticeable smell from it the first few times it was hit with warm water.  To me, it was somewhat like the smell produced from a hairdryer.  Not exactly pleasant, but not a reason to avoid it.  Sooner or later, it mostly smells like shaving cream anyway.&lt;br /&gt;3) After about 2 months of use, it did begin to split at the edge.  I dropped in a few drops of super glue early on, and so far that has stopped any further splitting.&lt;br /&gt;4) It is not too small.  If you use a lot of shaving cream, it might go over the edge, but it&#x27;s easy to keep it contained.&lt;br /&gt;5) If you intend to use shaving soap, you&#x27;ll have to load your brush before use.  It is a totally curved bowl, so it won&#x27;t hold a puck of soap very well.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of old fashioned class, I highly recommend making this part of your shaving set!!</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful product from a great company.  I love the way it looks and feels.  The big problem is that it is way too small for me to use when I lather.  I have tried it a few times.  It does okay but lather is constantly coming up over the sides.  Maybe people with a better technique and a smaller brush will have luck with it.  Right now it is under my sink with the rest of my unused shaving products.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bowl and for those that say its too small you are pry using excess amounts of shaving cream. Fits perfectly in the hand</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for. It looks fantastic, similar to the picture in the description. It did give off a weird odor at first, but that went away after a few uses. Guess that&#x27;s how you tell its real horn. Ha!</li>
    <li> Looks good on the counter. Just about the right size to develop a good foam for shaving. Would recommend and definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The bowl really is too small to make a good lather.  I had read some reviews saying it was too small, but went ahead and purchased it anyway. Bad choice.  All of the soap spills out.  The bowl is also much thinner than I expected, it some parts I can actually see through it.</li>
    <li> Its a very sexy bowl.  Got it match a buffalo horn handled shaving brush  for my husband.  It arrived safely but I would have packaged it differently.  Can&#x27;t wait to see his face!</li>
    <li> You can not build a lather with this bowl. I have even tried a hot lather by floating the bowl with the cream in hot bath for the sink. Do not buy one its a waste of money just use your hand. You can build a lather easier because you can form your hand to make the most foam as you are building the lather in your hand.</li>
    <li> The bowl is beautifully fashioned and artfully crafted, however it is a little small. . .</li>
    <li> Really nice hand made bowl. Beautiful to look at.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of negative reviews for this product which appear to be made by people that don&#x27;t understand how to use a palm bowl. Here is a rundown on how to use a palm bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You need to use a tube cream like Proraso shaving cream. This cream comes in a tube like toothpaste which can be used to build lather directly out of your hand or within this fine bowl. I note that some consumers have this bowl confused with a shaving mug built for shaving bars that are also used to build lather. You are using the bowl wrong as again, it is a palm bowl, not a shaving mug.&lt;br /&gt;2. Squeeze some shaving cream into the mug then fill your sink with enough hot water to float the bowl in. Once the bowl is in the sink put your shaving brush into the sink with the hot water so it can soften up.&lt;br /&gt;3. After you shower your cream and brush should be ready. Take them out of the sink, knock off the extra water from your brush and start to build lather in the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of this is to get a nice warm lather. You can build the lather by simply using the palm of your hand but the lather tends to get between your fingers so building it in this bowl will get the lather warm (if you let it soak properly) and contain it within the bowl.</li>
    <li> This bowl looks amazing!!! I use it to hold my shaving soap. Its a perfect accent to the rest of my western decor and is actually quite useful as a soap holder. It is quite small though not quite as full of my palm, maybe 3-3.5 inches in diameter. Subsequently i had to slice my soap disc in half to make it thinner. Still a great little bowl.</li>
    <li> It seems cool, but it smells really bad. Not sure if its the material or the shipper or what, but it&#x27;s awful. Like a pile of poop awful. I&#x27;ve tried a number of ways to make it smell better (soak in warm water, dishwash, clean with multi-purpose cleaner), and it still smells awful. It seems like a nice bowl, but I cannot deal with this smell.</li>
    <li> I love my buffalo horn shave bowl.  It&#x27;s beautifully crafted and exactly as advertised.  And for $20 (including shipping) it&#x27;s a real bargain.  It fits right in the palm of my hand so I can build my lather on my brush and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to shavers: This lather bowl is for building lather, not holding shaving soap.  This bowl is neither large enough nor designed to hold a cake of soap but is large enough to work up a lather on your brush.  You can use this bowl to build a lather AFTER loading your brush with soap from another container.  Put your cream in the bowl and work it with the wet brush to build your lather.  Piece of cake (no pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine did not have a sticker on it, so no problem there.  This is the coolest thing in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some info on building lather that might help.  Believe me this bowl is perfect for building lather if you do it a certain way.  There may be other ways, but this one works great for me.  I use Proraso shave cream in the tube and use it as directed (1/2\\&quot; - 3/4\\&quot; bead in the bowl).  With a damp (not dripping wet) brush work the cream with a decent speed.  If there are big bubbles slow down gradually until the bubbles become so tiny you can barely see them.  You can push down slightly on the brush to work the lather deeper into the brush so it will last for multiple passes.  When you use the brush apply the cream vigorously to the beard.  That&#x27;s it.  Simple and works for me every time.  And there is more than enough room to stir the brush around a little.  The beauty of it is A) that it fits in the palm of your hand and B) you can see the bubbles and therefore get a really good lather on the brush (not in the bowl, by the way).  Leisureguy&#x27;s Guide to Gourmet Shaving is a great book with advice I find to be excellent.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised. This fits in the palm of my hand, floats in a basin of water, holds a good amount of shaving lather, and interestingly enough the scent blends with the badger brush  smell.  Let&#x27;s face it, you&#x27;re part of your shaving kit now contains buffalo horn. How manly are you?!?! If only you had crafted it yourself......</li>
    <li> I received a fantastic little bowl that helps me produce a much better lather than I did in a shaving mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does look and feel like plastic, the translucency of the lighter part of the horn and, more important, the horrible smell of an overflowing septic tank when wet shows it to be actual horn.  The only way I could be happier with it is if my bowl had more lighter spots.  The one I received is almost completely black, but that&#x27;s all part of receiving a natural product.</li>
    <li> Nice shape and size  would have loved more color variation but natural product doesn&#x27;t always allow. Would recommend to anyone who wants a little western flair in their shaving repertoire</li>
    <li> nice item but the odor reminds me of out back of the dairy farm  .  when i gets warmer it gets more noticeable</li>
    <li> This broke the first time I dropped it. It was maybe three feet off the ground, and it shattered in two. Whatever, it&#x27;s not like I really cared. Oh wait, I did, and this postponed my glorious transition into safety razors by close to four days. It was good while it lasted, though.</li>
    <li> I like this bowl, but I don&#x27;t use it to lather with. I use it to soak by brush in hot water before I shave, and I use it to rinse my brush after. I prefer to work a lather up on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can attest to the fact that it is real horn as well. My wife dropped it the other day, and it chipped, thus making it easy to see that it was real. The only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t look as cool as the one pictured.</li>
    <li> Nice bowl! Sturdy! feels and sounds like plastic..dropped it when first arrived on ceramic tile, it bounced around a few times but did not break or get damaged.  Smells like a zoo for the first few times it gets wet in hot water (guess thats how you can tell its really made of Buffalo Horn rather than plastic!) but that will go away with use.</li>
    <li> The description states &amp;#34;3.5 Inch&amp;#34; bowl and while it is referred to as a palm shave bowl, you will not be able to fit a soap disc inside since most of them are around 3&amp;#34;. Three and a half inches is about the size of the center of your palm so I understand the description, but I&#x27;d more likely call it a soaking bowl for your brush - which is how I have repurposed the bowl. Also, when finished rinsing, I use it as a brush stand and keep it on the counter because it is a very nice piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t quite use it as a shaving bowl, but overall I&#x27;m glad I bought it because I&#x27;ve found a new purpose for it.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 one for me one for a friend. Is that kind of things you don&#x27;t wanna share so I kept them both. They are so unique and beautiful, the veins match with my silver tip badger brush. I must have for a shaver and alpha male :)</li>
    <li> I bought this bowl because I recently started shaving with a double edge razor kit my wife bought on Amazon, that came with a Conk brand metal bowl that seems too small for whipping lather (but I&#x27;m new to this and my skills may be at fault).  In any case, this bowl, or at least the one they sent me, looks like the picture however the widest diameter is a lot larger than 3.5&amp;#34;.  Seems more like 5&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;It works great.  I can whip my brush in this bowl much easier and create lather unlike the kit bowl.  After exposure to warm water for a while I did not notice much odor coming off the bowl as I rinsed it.  Perhaps a non offensive agricultural smell (and that&#x27;s a big perhaps) but it was too faint to be consistent. In short, my bowl does not smell like buffalo poo.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this bowl and it&#x27;s a handsome addition to my man-grooming area.  In fact I leave it out, it looks so good there on the counter next to my other man-beauty accessories.</li>
    <li> Looks great, I did notice the smell issue referenced by other reviewers, did not mind that. The bowl is too small for me. I am using it right now to store loose DE blades. I suggest that if you are looking to buy this bowl check out the videos from Smallflower in youtube. You will be able to see their size and determine if the bowl is wright for you.</li>
    <li> Looks fine on the counter without giving it a western look.  Husband likes the cup shape and design.  Polished just right, not too shiny or dull.  I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> The only problem is the SMELL!&lt;br /&gt;It does smell like dead animal. Used it only twice, Hope the smell will fade.</li>
    <li> I bought this small bowl to complete my first double-edged straight razor shaving set and like it quite alot. It is compact in size, but large enough for me to work my Proraso shaving soap into a lather. It&#x27;s none too large for this purpose, though. But probably as important for my purposes, it&#x27;s attractive and well made. I would possibly get this again, but can&#x27;t say for sure until I try some other options.</li>
    <li> Despite other reviews, I have found this bowl to be the perfect size for shaving.  I have used it everytime I&#x27;ve shaved over the past year, and it fits perfectly in the palm of my hand while using my brush in the other to create foam.  If you are finding it too small, you are using too much shaving cream or creating too much foam.  Another advantage of it being a horn bowl is that it can float in the sink, so you could fill it with warm water to rinse your razor, and also have this bowl floating in order to keep your foam warm.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this bowl. It looks pretty, but I&#x27;ve had issues. The first one I ordered was a good looking bowl, and it fit nicely in my hand for building lather. Unfortunately it had some tool marks through the finish. It still looked alright but I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with the natural horn exposed rather than sealed. Tried to return it only to find this was not possible using the traditional method (came up as unreturnable). A call to amazon straightened that out, and I ordered another one thinking the tool marks an anomaly. The second bowl was a drastically different size. Far too small to build any lather in. Once again it came up as non-returnable and required a call to Amazon to straighten out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend due to quality issues and inconsistency of product.</li>
    <li> Bowl is black plastic and not bone.</li>
    <li> It looks great, mine is completely black. I found it a bit smaller than how I expected it when I received it. However, it is very comfortable in my hand as I build the lather with my brush.</li>
    <li> Bowl is perfect size and shape.&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased it had some cracks on the edge inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months of use and the cracks opened up and the bowl started to split.&lt;br /&gt;It is now useless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted the seller, and they said &amp;#34;not our problem&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It is a natural product, so I understand internal flaws.  The reason why I thought the initial cracks were typical.</li>
    <li> Perfect sized. Works great. Just takes a few uses to get rid of &amp;#34;buffalo&amp;#34; smell. Would buy again</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I thought it would be but I still love it.  It is a beautiful piece.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> This bowl works well, but I&#x27;m not sure of its longevity.</li>
    <li> idk if its real buffalo horn, looks convincing enough and when you more closely examine it youll see intricacies that lead you to believe its real horn. like knots in different places and certain areas are nearly see through. highly polished. perfect size, fit in had well. i enjoy it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait for my husband to open it on christmas day! The bowl we received was all black with a single tiny white spot on it but it&#x27;s wonderfully made and i&#x27;m sure will still be a big hit.</li>
    <li> What a beautiful, decorative buffalo horn shaving bowl. the craftsmanship is solid and it feels good in my hand and is a good fit. the coloration of course will vary but mine matches my horn brush perfectly and looks pretty much like the one pictured. I have no problem using this bowl with my brush and the combination produces a generous lather. I am very happy with this product and have no problem recommending it. The lord has spoken.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a buffalo horn bowl. Instead, I ended up with a (stainless?) steel bowl. I&#x27;ll be looking for a refund.</li>
    <li> this bowl is tiny looks nice but too small for me and its not deep enough</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size that I was looking for.  I was hoping mine would have a bit more color, however mine is mostly black with a few white patches and a fair amount of dark gray ghost stripes that look good when you look closely, but otherwise don&#x27;t stand out that much.  Theres a couple very small chips in the bowl, deformities of some sort from forming i&#x27;m assuming, but overall none of the cracks and large chips missing that some of the other reviewers have gotten.  I&#x27;m happy with it, realizing that obviously the horn dictates the bowl you get and its luck of the draw.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Light weight , expensive look, good size palm bowl, easy to make foam for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Chip easily if handle carelessly.&lt;br /&gt;* Stand well on its own but cannot balance with the heavy badger shaving brush in it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing piece of art! Mine has streeks of grey in it. It&#x27;s larger than I was anticipating, fits perfectly in my palm! This bowl allows me to make a rich lather and apply it conviently! Definitely get one!</li>
    <li> The first bowl we received had a small crack in it.  We contacted the seller, who immediately got back in touch with us.  He quickly replaced the cracked bowl with one that looked beautiful and was sturdy.  And it floats in the sink&#x27;s warm water, keeping the soap warm.  Absolutely would do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bowl. Fits my hand perfectly.</li>
    <li> unfortunately, i have not had this for very long and it is starting to peel and crack. i swear i only put water and shave cream into it. i havent dropped it, but it does sit upside down to dry after i shave. this is my only real complaint about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on small pet peeves, i may have expected too much. i also admit i may be dumb. i was disappointed this didnt have much density to it. it is very lightweight. i hunt and deer horns seem denser to me and that is what i anticipated. maybe buffalo really have less dense horns or maybe this is just the way it was made. again, this is my personal pet peeve, not a complaint. also, the bowl doesnt retain heat well. i presoak the bowl to get it warmer while i shower. i was hoping to have a warmer shave. however, this is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, i just wasnt happy i made this purchase. i liked the color, but that is as far as it went. sorry to be so critical, but you guys asked me for my review. normally, i just do the stars and move on, but i wanted to explain my low rating of this product. please note i am not asking for my money back because that is not fair to the seller. i was sold the product i asked for and i used it. until i buy a new shave bowl, i will continue to use it. i dont believe it is fair to ask for my money back for something i just was not happy about in the long term. i will just not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This bowl is the perfect size and depth for building my lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an odd smell the first two or three times you use it, it seemed to be brought out more by heat than being wet, but it goes away entirely very soon and starts to simply smell like your own shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every day for several months and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I love how it looks, the light parts are partially translucent and the fact that it&#x27;s made from a horn just feels right. Some people say it starts to wear out but mine is as good as new so far. Here&#x27;s hoping it lasts!</li>
    <li> I lather on my hand. This bowl is a bit too smooth for me. Practice makes perfect I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the description says colors and such may vary but the picture is way misleading. The black is extremely dark and the tan/white is dimmed down to a point that you&#x27;ll need a bright light to see it. And the bowl I received doesn&#x27;t have as nice a finish as the bowl in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does fit nicely in the hand but is a little slippery. A textured underside or some type of grip would have been great.</li>
    <li> I purchased five products as a group after being less than enamored with the offerings from local stores, that included a high-dollar N-brand electric razor with goop that stopped being supported a year after purchase, and a gazillion-bladed KoRazor that cost as much for replacement blades that drag on your face like a boat anchor.  I initially dug out my grandfather’s 50 year old spice mug, brush and cheap disposable razors, but when the soap was gone, I knew I liked the ceremony and results of the way of my ancestors.  So I looked to Amazon for the Heavyweight All Metal Chrome Trac II razor, Escali Pure Badger brush, a Buffalo Horn 3.5 in Palm Shave Bowl, and TOBS Sandalwood Hard Shaving Soap.  The results are a simple elegance that I want to share with every man and the woman who are ready for a cheaper and easier way of grooming.  The icing was finding 100-packs Personna TwinII for a third less than a 10-pack at my local grocery.  I can’t say enough good about the entire experience. It’s a great feeling to start the morning ablution with this group of excellent products.</li>
    <li> This is the most pointless thing i have every spent money on. It is way to small to soak a brush or build a lather in. I don&#x27;t understand how anyone can find this bowl useful. It doesn&#x27;t even look good like in the picture, the one i got is basically just black. 0/5 stars</li>
    <li> I love the bowl but as another review mentioned it is very small and difficult to use as a shave bowl.  Besides it&#x27;s size, I was bothered by the sticky tag the seller put on the bottom of the bowl.  I had to use a adhesive remover to remove it.</li>
    <li> this is a shave bowl that I can use forever and is very nice and I love the color. thank you!</li>
    <li> Cracked in pieces in the middle</li>
    <li> The bowl is in great condition and arrived on time. I was just a little disappointed that my bowl is solid with almost no variation in color like to one shown. But other than that it is great.</li>
    <li> It close classy and works really well with my safety razor kit. It has a scent of it&#x27;s own that enhances the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely fragile so handle with care. Wash before first use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months now. I like it. I can work up a great, thick lather in this bowl without a lot of effort. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5, is mine is all black. It doesn&#x27;t have the gorgeous pattern depicted. It&#x27;s natural horn, so you get what you get. But I was still just a touch disappointed with the coloring.</li>
    <li> I thought I needed a new shaving bowl, so my wife could use one of our service bowls again. I saw this and though cool, its buffalo horn, how manly. No one told me when buffalo horn gets wet, it smells like wet dog. Not the best way to start the morning, smearing ode de wet dog on my face, and the smell lasts in the bathroom for hours. The bowl is also too small. I read other complaints on the same, but thought I would be ok since I just use bowl to work the lather. I grossly underestimated the size of this bowl. I can&#x27;t keep the cream in the bowl while whipping, and the bowl doesn&#x27;t have enough weight, so it always tips over when not in use. I like the seller, and would shop with them again. But I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. 2 weeks of use, and I&#x27;ve already ordered a different bowl.</li>
    <li> Just received this Yesterday.  Bowl Arrived Cracked.  When i got it wet to use it, the bowl really started to Stink.  Not sure if this is because it be a Buffalo Horn but smell really bothered me.  Besides all that  i got a excellent Lather out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Please note this bowl is only for Building your Lather, not for Soap Pucks.</li>
    <li> Looks very nice but smells like buffalo $hi! when wet. Also slippery and too small to do much with. I throw my loose change in it now.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this gift! He has been wanting the whole set up for quite a while now. I got him everything. Straightedge and all!</li>
    <li> This started to delaminate after a few months of use. It&#x27;s the perfect size, shape, and looks great, but it did not last.</li>
    <li> Beautiful tools. We purchased for a family member, who seems to like it and uses it frequently. So I&#x27;d say a great product.</li>
    <li> I had no idea that buffalo horns were made of plastic. Other than that it serves it&#x27;s purpose as a perfect sized shaving bowl.</li>
    <li> Really nice. Real buffalo horn. You can see the small imperfections in the horn on the bowl. Kinda like growth rings in a tree. A little smaller than I expected but really nice.</li>
    <li> The bowl is nice but it looks absolutely nothing like the picture. Granted it says that they can look different but mine is just black. I bought this to match my buffalo horn razor stand and brush but sadly it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
