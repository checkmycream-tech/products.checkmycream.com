      <li>I did buy this for my husband ,he looked for it all over and could not find it.he found in at Amazon ,and I love it on hom</li>
      <li>I have been using the Cologne and Spray Cologne from Royal Copenhagen for over thirty years, as with most guys, once you find something you like, you stick with it, so this has been my signature scent if you will for all of that time.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Have been using this cologne for 10 years or more.</li>
      <li>I do know that this product is unlike most men&#x27;s colognes.  </li>
      <li>and I feel the makers of ROYAL COPENHAGEN have missed the boat by not advertising it more.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I am so glad to find it on line...</li>
      <li>Of course my favorite</li>
      <li>I like this product, it is refreshing after shaving.</li>

      <li>They love it and</li>
      <li>get more comments on this stuff.</li>
      <li>The women love it.  </li>
      <li>Royal Copenhagen has been a part of our family for many years.  </li>
      <li>I love this cologne</li>
      <li>I started using Royal Copenhagen Colone in 1971, and it gas been my favorite ever since.</li>
      <li>Hubby has been using it for years and can&#x27;t even find it most of the time.</li>
      <li>I bought it for a coworker of mine who had used Royal Copenhagen for many many many years and he was excited to see it online.</li>
      <li>Great old fashioned fragrance that I have been wearing for 35 years.  </li>
      <li>is not so strong that you smell it from a block away.</li>
      <li>Not too strong.</li>
      <li>Definitely a favorite for wintertime and cool evenings out.</li>
      <li>Smells so fine.</li>
      <li>Scents are so individualized and what smells great on one person may turn to vinegar on another and what scents we enjoy are also a matter of personal preference.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s an after-smell that gives the scent a cheap effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the Powdery Fresh Scent....</li>
      <li>Now my husband has the same great smell.</li>
      <li>Turns into this light almost baby powder smell.  </li>
      <li>NOT STRONG EATHER JUST REAL PLEASANT</li>
      <li>The rich, sweet, and slightly musky fragrance is best worn in colder, arid climates and seasons, as it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I believe that since the product is now licensed\\&quot; to be produced in the US that somehow, someone has changed the original formula.  </li>
      <li>so I&amp;#34;m not a &amp;#34;sweater&amp;#34; the Women I work with Love it  ;-)</li>
      <li>My Dad loves this stuff, and I always find a good price on amazon for Fathers Day or Birthday present.</li>
      <li>Favorite Cologne,  Reasonable price.</li>
      <li>A mild reduction in cost would be helpful.</li>
      <li>I was able to find a cologne my husband used to use thirty years ago when we were first married.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it is not sold at the main fragrance counters any more.  </li>
      <li>It works for me and has become my distinct &amp;quot;scent&amp;quot;.</li>
      <li>the price is right several people that smelled this after shave on me liked it</li>
      <li>must say that , out of many other colognes this one gets the  most favorable comments.</li>
      <li>It was right on time.</li>
      <li>Once I got it home and unwrapped, a sample of it revealed immediately that this is NOT the original scent, the one that I have used and loved for the past 30 plus years.  </li>
      <li>The best soap to use with fragrance stays quite long time on shirts or other meterial.</li>
      <li>It was reasonable and was delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>Not only do I love the scent</li>
      <li>Item received was as exactly described.</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>There are many different bottles, products, suppliers, quantities.  </li>
      <li>but it is very different than most mainstream colognes now</li>
      <li>i never ever buy this again; it smelled so cheap; waste of money; i am surprised seeing  some good comments on this cologne</li>
      <li>Bought my first bottle in 1971 when leaving Ft. Gordon.</li>
      <li>has changed the procedures used to make it but whatever it is - the change was definitely not for the better.  </li>
      <li>I think that pretty much sells the product for me.</li>
      <li>and people really notice it&#x27;s gentle air.  </li>
      <li>so you know for $17.95 today it is not the real stuff -</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I always have to search the Internet for this product.  Unavailable at retail stores???  I do know that this product is unlike most men&#x27;s colognes.  I find the fragrance most pleasing. It&#x27;s HIS favorite and mine!</li>
    <li> The items arrived on time as scheduled.  This is a favorite from the past.  Wore it when I was in high school in 1970 and still like it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the smell of this cologne.  I knew someone who wore this cologne &amp; was great on him.  Maybe he had an old bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow the cologne came well packed &amp; timely in delivery.  Just don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells so nice.  Turns into this light almost baby powder smell.  Not too strong.</li>
    <li> not at all what it used to be in the  i970 s  lost a lot of its fragrance not at all what i expected i&#x27;ll go back tp paul sab. as soon as possable</li>
    <li> I love this cologne I buy it for my husband all the time. It&#x27;s wonderful to smell. He gets compliments from all the women. He loves all the female attention.</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for nearly 40 years. Best smelling fragrance ever !!  I appreciate the price and timely shipping. For those of you who think Stetson smells good, you should try this one.</li>
    <li> Best smelling men&#x27;s cologne on the market. I love it. My husband has been wearing it for at least 25 years because I won&#x27;t let him wear anything else. I hate that it is so hard to find now. So glad I could get it from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Scents are so individualized and what smells great on one person may turn to vinegar on another and what scents we enjoy are also a matter of personal preference.  My husband has worn this for over 20 years and the prices here on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells terrible and I cannot return it. The brand logo is a sticker. I have a hard time believing this is authentic RC cologne.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Rayal Copenhagen for at least 28 year&#x27;s - the last time I was able to purchase the \\&quot;Real\\&quot; Royal Copenhagen was in 1994 - $48.00 for 3 oz. so you know for $17.95 today it is not the real stuff - Ok - the Royal Copenhagen made by the Five Star Colonge Co. has always been very close to the old, real, Royal Copenhagen, this last bottle is the first \\&quot;batch\\&quot; that there is a very big difference. At fist use one can tell it&#x27;s off by quite a ways - but as it wears for a while it comes closer - so \\&quot;it&#x27;s just OK\\&quot; - For $17.95 I am not going to send it back. I just hope this is the last time a \\&quot;batch\\&quot; is this far off from the original scent.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed. The scent is not what I am used to for royal Copenhagen.  I have been using this brand for over 25 years and this is the first time I have been disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product, but the order arrived wrong, Two bottles of Royal Copenhagen colonge, is what I ordered, and received two different Royal Copenhagen products. I contacted the dealer and returned the wrong colonge, and was advised that it had been received and would be inspected, and then was informed that I was correct and that they would be sending me the corrected order, It is now Dec. 1st and I am still waiting for my order to be completed, can some one help speed the process?  Thank you,  Malcolm Lax</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT, FRAGRANCE</li>
    <li> A friend of mines husband always smelled so nice.  Finally after years I asked him what it was and he said Copenhagan. Not the chew kind, Royal Copenhagan. Now my husband has the same great smell.</li>
    <li> I find this product very good. I also send this product to  my relatives you have been using it for years. A mild reduction in cost would be helpful.</li>
    <li> Of course my favorite</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.  There are many different bottles, products, suppliers, quantities.  A few different words on the bottle of the Royal Copenhagen cologne and you may not get what you think you&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
    <li> Impossible to find this at retail outlets.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Fragrance not as long lasting as I remember&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> The best soap to use with fragrance stays quite long time on shirts or other meterial.</li>
    <li> my favorite colgne and aftershave; very hard to get except on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Received as promised!!</li>
    <li> Item received was as exactly described. I used to purchase this cologne for my hubby at JC Penney, who no longer carries the brand. I found the same brand/size cologne spray at Sears, which retails around $45. I definitely received excellent value for the price paid by making the purchase from Amazon - about 50% savings!</li>
    <li> I was able to find a cologne my husband used to use thirty years ago when we were first married. It was reasonable and was delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> great product have used for 30 years.</li>
    <li> Have been using this cologne for 10 years or more. Most other brands on the market are too feminine for me. This is a manly cologne and I feel the makers of ROYAL COPENHAGEN have missed the boat by not advertising it more. I may be out of the loop, but I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen it advertised. But then I am 75 years old and don&#x27;t get around much. My suggestion is try it and you will like it.</li>
    <li> Bought my first bottle in 1971 when leaving Ft. Gordon. Have used them all, up to $150 for 2 oz. This is a bargain compared to most.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that , out of many other colognes this one gets the  most favorable comments.</li>
    <li> Good price for a product I have been using for over forty years. All colognes are different depending on the man that it is using a product. I have tried others but I have continually been complimented by women of many ages on my scent. It works for me and has become my distinct &amp;quot;scent&amp;quot;.</li>
    <li> get compliments everywhere constantly, at a competitive price delivered undamaged. did I mention all the compliments haha. Well I will continue to buy it</li>
    <li> Nice scent; arrived in good condition</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND HAS USED ROYAL COPEN FOR YEARS,  HAVE BOUGHT THIS FROM AMAZON BEFORE HAVE ALWAYS LOVED&lt;br /&gt;IT BEFORE, THIS TIME  IT SMELLED  LIKE GASOLINE. I TOLD MY HUSBAND NOT TO USE IT . I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN HAD.&lt;br /&gt;BOOTLEG.  CAN&#x27;T BELIVE AMAZON COULD DEAL WITH A CO. LIKE THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  SANDY WAUHOP</li>
    <li> Only cologne that I want my husband to use.</li>
    <li> This been my faver cologne for years thi is one cologne that i will never stop using  as long i can get it.</li>
    <li> I always used this cologne. I have 5 differentes colognes which i use and belive it oor not this is the cheapest one but also the one the ladies love! and here i found for 17.99 the lowest price ive ever seen this.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected it to be at very little cost.  You would spend 4 to 5 times more in the big stores such as J.C. Penney, Sears, etc.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 40 years. I like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I love it</li>
    <li> I like it.  The women love it.  It was right on time.</li>
    <li> Hubby has been using it for years and can&#x27;t even find it most of the time.</li>
    <li> My Dad loves this stuff, and I always find a good price on amazon for Fathers Day or Birthday present.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this and it was the best price I could find.  It came in time for his gift...</li>
    <li> I love this cologne and a little goes a long long way .  Its scent is mildly delicious and its my favorite cologne.  The price is reasonable and I would recommend it to any classy male.</li>
    <li> Great old fashioned fragrance that I have been wearing for 35 years.  Price is half of the normal price in big box stores.  Can&#x27;t beat this product and price.</li>
    <li> BEEN USEING THIS SINCE I WAS 20 NOW 70PLUS AND MEN EVER TIME WITH OUT FAIL TOLD HOW GREAT IT SMELLS ..NOT STRONG EATHER JUST REAL PLEASANT</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the service I got from this seller, great communication and quick delivery, and I would buy from them again.  But that being said, I was disappointed in the product itself.  I have been using the Cologne and Spray Cologne from Royal Copenhagen for over thirty years, as with most guys, once you find something you like, you stick with it, so this has been my signature scent if you will for all of that time.  I was running low on Royal Copenhagen, so I went to local men&#x27;s store where I have purchased it in the past.  Once I got it home and unwrapped, a sample of it revealed immediately that this is NOT the original scent, the one that I have used and loved for the past 30 plus years.  Fearing I had gotten a bad product, I returned to the store, but they could not do a refund because I had opened the product. Upon returning home  I ordered two separate bottles from different sellers to see if the product was bad, or somehow changed.  Both of the bottles that I got on line came quickly from very pleasant and efficient sellers.  But all three bottles of the Royal Copenhagen Cologne that I have now smell the same, and the scent is NOT the original.  I believe that since the product is now licensed\\&quot; to be produced in the US that somehow, someone has changed the original formula.  Didn&#x27;t anyone learn a lesson with Coca Cola a few years back???  I am very disappointed and don&#x27;t know what to do the rectify the problem.  I want the \\&quot;old\\&quot; scent back and don&#x27;t know where to go to get it.  Disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> This was a Fathers Day gift and the person that received it, he absolutely  loves it. This fragrance has been around for a long time.</li>
    <li> Not so impressed by this product. I bought it for a coworker of mine who had used Royal Copenhagen for many many many years and he was excited to see it online. When it arrived, we could tell immediately that it was different. For one thing, the Royal Copenhagen that he has is a dark blue liquid color whereas this one is more light blue. The scent is also off - it&#x27;s not the same as the one he already has. We ended up returning it and he is in the market for a different scent. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve changed the formula or the manufacturing company has changed the procedures used to make it but whatever it is - the change was definitely not for the better.  It&#x27;s okay smelling and is a nice scent but it&#x27;s not the same as what it&#x27;s been in the past so for someone that has used this particular cologne in the past - it would be a let down.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but find it hard to get last few years in local stores. is not so strong that you smell it from a block away.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find this anywhere.  My husband has been using this brand forever.  Great to have it available here.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> Love the Powdery Fresh Scent.... Last&#x27;s through the day, as I work in an office setting so I&amp;#34;m not a &amp;#34;sweater&amp;#34; the Women I work with Love it  ;-)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t take all smells because of COPD problems but this cologne I can tolerate most of the time and I really like to smell it on my hubby.  Also bought for my adult son so he wont wear the harsh smelling stuff that gags a maggot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for over 20 years now because it&#x27;s the one my father used.  Not only do I love the scent but it is very different than most mainstream colognes now and people really notice it&#x27;s gentle air.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> I started using Royal Copenhagen Colone in 1971, and it gas been my favorite ever since. Unfortunately, it is getting hard to find  localy, but in five minutes I had two bottles ordered and in a few hours on their way.</li>
    <li> This colonge has a very subtle aroma. Every woman that I&#x27;ve come in contact with while wearing this fragrance enjoys that it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm them.</li>
    <li> The Best Cologne in the market today, nothing better.&lt;br /&gt;I get more comments on this stuff. AWESOME, GREAT, PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;okay</li>
    <li> Good cologne It have a baby powder scent....</li>
    <li> The wife likes it. I think that pretty much sells the product for me. I like the smell as well, but it&#x27;s her nose that has to approve!</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this fragrance for years and we&#x27;ve been unable to find it at any of our department stores for quite some time now.  We were thrilled to find it here and the price could not be beat!</li>
    <li> Favorite Cologne,  Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Purchased for someone else.</li>
    <li> It may not be for you if you like buying expensive name brand colognes but if on a tight budget this will not let you down around attractive ladies.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, I bought this for my husband.</li>
    <li> I did buy this for my husband ,he looked for it all over and could not find it.he found in at Amazon ,and I love it on hom</li>
    <li> I like this product, it is refreshing after shaving. the price is right several people that smelled this after shave on me liked it</li>
    <li> Been a favorite for years!</li>
    <li> Royal Copenhagen has been a part of our family for many years.  I became  acquainted with it as a child when my father used it every day, and I continue to make it my own because every time I use it, I think of him.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for years and everyone including strangers ask  what cologne it is.  They love it and so don&#x27;t I.</li>
    <li> I have been using for 40 yrs</li>
    <li> i never ever buy this again; it smelled so cheap; waste of money; i am surprised seeing  some good comments on this cologne</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over thirty years, and love it! allways complimented on it fragrance. I travel to many of the location they say where you can buy it, but they are usually out of it. I am so glad to find it on line...</li>
    <li> All of the men in my family wear this fragrance.  Unfortunately it is not sold at the main fragrance counters any more.  So happy to find it on Amazon.  Love the price too!</li>
    <li> I like the clean traditional scent.  It is something I started using when my kids were young and it&#x27;s hod s fond association for them and my wife.</li>
    <li> Bought for my hubby for Valentines Day!  We both love the smell!  Great value!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this before.  He was about out and I couldn&#x27;t find it anyplace except in a set.  He didn&#x27;t want that.</li>
    <li> This cologne doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrance of the Royal C. I&#x27;ve used for years...There&#x27;s an after-smell that gives the scent a cheap effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a credit for my purchase...</li>
    <li> Very good purchased I am old school. Take it from me, its GOOD. You cant wrong on the price. (old School)</li>
    <li> Smells so fine. All men should wear it</li>
    <li> Best price around!!!!</li>
    <li> Royal Copenhagen exudes timeless European class and elegance. Not exactly as delicate or heady as most French creations, this men&#x27;s fragrance with a Scandinavian heritage (Copenhagen being in Denmark) shows the usual austerity and restraint of that part of the world with it&#x27;s brisk opening notes and understated afterglow. The rich, sweet, and slightly musky fragrance is best worn in colder, arid climates and seasons, as it&#x27;s formulation is a bit heavy for warmer and more humid temperatures. Definitely a favorite for wintertime and cool evenings out.</li>
