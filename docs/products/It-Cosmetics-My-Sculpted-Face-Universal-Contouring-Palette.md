      <li>It holds its own.</li>
      <li>Very easy to follow</li>
      <li>I am usually a huge fan of finding great products on Amazon for great deals, but I will say this really unimpressed me.</li>
      <li>People can&#x27;t tell you have it on, it looks natural on your face as if your face is naturally perfect.</li>

      <li>Love the It cosmetics and it works like it said it would.  </li>

      <li>I love this palette</li>
      <li>This product is ok....</li>

      <li>I love all of it cosmetics.</li>
      <li>Love it more than my Anastasia kit I bought from Nordstroms.</li>

      <li>and I love how I look.</li>
      <li>Love Love this palette :)</li>
      <li>Great and fast shipping</li>
      <li>I apply it like powder on top of my concealer.</li>
      <li>and I love the shades and the matte highlighter</li>
      <li>Quality of the powders are finely milled,easy to blend,also you receive how to instructions.</li>
      <li>the attached guide is very helpful and the colors blend nicely together.</li>
      <li>the light colors in the pallet don&#x27;t show up that well...</li>
      <li>some more images on how to apply it should come, in different type of face.. but the product is really good</li>
      <li>The top two white colors (one matte and one shimmer) are good</li>
      <li>Good staying power, very blendable, works well with all skin tones and looks natural.</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s an okay product, but for the price, I think you could find something better.</li>
      <li>Much better than fancy high priced name brands</li>
      <li>I got this compliment from my husband, &amp;#34; You look exceptionally pretty today!</li>
      <li>I can put it on without adding any other make up and my face looks great and people think I don&#x27;t have any make up on and still look pretty.</li>
      <li>It worth the price, but also you can use any eyeshadow to do the job.</li>
      <li>The colors are nice but definitely for a person with a darker skin</li>
      <li>Other than that I really loved it.</li>
      <li>Lots of shades to choose from to find what&#x27;s right for you.  </li>
      <li>Great for sculpting if you&#x27;re not really sure where to start.  </li>
      <li>They are all soft focus powders that allow you to contour your face and provide a nice soft glow.</li>
      <li>But its a decent kit, specially if you&#x27;re learning.</li>
      <li>This sculpting kit is very helpful!</li>
      <li>Has great long lasting effect.</li>
      <li>Sculpted Face Palette\\&quot; that its a waterproof and I test it ;)</li>
      <li>IT cosmetics consistently delivers.</li>
      <li>The first tine I used it</li>
      <li>Sticks pretty</li>
      <li>I bought this as one of my first contouring kits.</li>
      <li>I suggest to use liquid contour colors first than to set everything to use this pallete</li>
      <li>first off 38$ for this..</li>
      <li>First off I am male and I use this product to make my jaw structure more feminine.</li>
      <li>My absolute fav contour kit!</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
      <li>If you You Tube &amp;#34;Goss make up artist&amp;#34; he has amazing videos on contouring and other make up tips.</li>
      <li>I love this contouring kit so much, this is my second one to purchase.....!</li>
      <li>This is my very first sculpting kit and I&#x27;m very amazed on how it can sculpt my face so naturally, with or without foundation.</li>
      <li>I have olive skin tone and the highlights don&#x27;t show on my skin type, the glitter is very glittery.</li>
      <li>I did not know that you could enhance you looks so much by contour.</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily and this item takes care of it too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of other ones and NONE COME CLOSE to the quality and have as many shades.</li>
      <li>The colors are great and do well at looking very subtle.</li>
      <li>Come to find out, this handy sculpting palette does in fact come with a small guide but was somehow removed from my kit.</li>
      <li>I am new to contouring so this paint by number explanation really helped.  </li>
      <li>Essentially, a good alternative to Shany products, which are usually bad, but relied upon for learning by many.  </li>
      <li>I mainly use the bottom two, but also the matte highlighter.</li>
      <li>The dark colors don&#x27;t blend as easily and they are very pigmented.</li>
      <li>highly recommend for anyone wanting to try sculpting without a ton of liquid products caked on the face.</li>
      <li>It suet every skin color, can be very creative with this small sized shades ... its a bit larger than a mac eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>I usually never write reviews, but I have to for this product,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it seems to work pretty well.  </li>
      <li>It is so simple and it really enhances your natural beauty.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a powered contour palette that gives you a natural contour look</li>
      <li>it gives me a natural look</li>
      <li>It works for any skin types and it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I really only like the highlighter in the upper right corner</li>
      <li>But in my opinion there are too many shades, one person only needs two shades (a light to highlight and a dark to contour), and I think it is a waste to spend the money when you only use 1/3 of the product.</li>
      <li>I need to play with it a little more and get used to it, but I think it will definitely be part of my regular routine.</li>
      <li>I rarely ever use the middle two colors because they have pink undertones</li>
      <li>You can make your forehead bigger or smaller just by using light or dark shades.</li>
      <li>If you are paying full price for something new, you at least hope to get what you payed for.</li>
      <li>However, it did not cause my face to break out (acne prone) and represents decent value as a starter / learner type kit before going on to more expensive product.  </li>
      <li>First of all they do not go on too dark or pasty white.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does.  I have NO complaints! Even my clients ask me where I found this little miracle at.  I also ordered the It Cosmetics HD finishing powder, I&#x27;ll let everyone know how it turns out! My only disappointment is that its smaller than I assumed.  But, on the flipside, a little product goes a looooong way.  Happy experiementing everyone!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or time. This is a powder. It also doesn&#x27;t work. Two thumbs down.</li>
    <li> To like this product, you will need to like powder (micro) applications.  The consistency was odd, I had issues blending, and the powder did not seem to stay.  However, it did not cause my face to break out (acne prone) and represents decent value as a starter / learner type kit before going on to more expensive product.  Essentially, a good alternative to Shany products, which are usually bad, but relied upon for learning by many.  Beware that the price changes drastically at times.</li>
    <li> Good staying power, very blendable, works well with all skin tones and looks natural. It cosmetics never disappoints!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this item in store a year ago and still have it and been using it every day. I apply it with a big brush as it&#x27;s seen in the picture.. darker colors on bigger bones like cheek bones and eyebrow bones and lighter colors on my small nose and small chin... It changes my face for better really great. I apply it like powder on top of my concealer. It stays on all day long. Has great long lasting effect. People can&#x27;t tell you have it on, it looks natural on your face as if your face is naturally perfect. It&#x27;s like a plastic surgery without going through actual surgery and you can \\&quot;make different face\\&quot; every day. You can make your forehead bigger or smaller just by using light or dark shades. I love this item. I don&#x27;t go anywhere wthout it. My skin is very oily and this item takes care of it too. It works for any skin types and it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin. I can put it on without adding any other make up and my face looks great and people think I don&#x27;t have any make up on and still look pretty.</li>
    <li> Wonderful as always.. IT cosmetics consistently delivers.</li>
    <li> I really only like the highlighter in the upper right corner, i probably will not repurchase especially for the price.</li>
    <li> the palette is smaller than appears in pic. the colors are great, but i don&#x27;t think this is a must have... unless you have money to burn for what you can get with a matte bronzer.</li>
    <li> Always appears a bit heavy looking.</li>
    <li> This product arrived fully packaged but with no instructions for use, no color charts as the description said it does. It is way too expensive for six powder shaded of contour. The colors are nice but definitely for a person with a darker skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;It opens like a book with six shades of makeup and two tiny mirrors. This is a complete waste!</li>
    <li> I got this product after having the coastal scents contouring palette. I got rid of that because it gave me awful acne. This product still breaks me out, but not as badly. I think the coastal scents palette did a better job of contouring. This product gives an alright contour, and I like the guide that comes with it. But in my opinion there are too many shades, one person only needs two shades (a light to highlight and a dark to contour), and I think it is a waste to spend the money when you only use 1/3 of the product. Overall it&#x27;s an okay product, but for the price, I think you could find something better.</li>
    <li> I bought this as one of my first contouring kits. It holds its own. I have olive skin tone and the highlights don&#x27;t show on my skin type, the glitter is very glittery. The dark colors don&#x27;t blend as easily and they are very pigmented. But its a decent kit, specially if you&#x27;re learning. I haven&#x27;t broken out with this product, and I find that unbelievable. So it&#x27;s great for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I am new to contouring so this paint by number explanation really helped.  The first tine I used it I got this compliment from my husband, &amp;#34; You look exceptionally pretty today! &amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was looking around for a good contour kit since Anastasia is always sold out. I was stunned by the $69 price tag here because it&#x27;s $38 at Ulta.com. I haven&#x27;t tried this kit yet; just wanted to give everyone a heads up about the pricing.</li>
    <li> First off I am male and I use this product to make my jaw structure more feminine. It works flawlessly, real easy to blend with and easy to work with. Highlight what you like and darken what you dont :)</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and she loves it! Much better than fancy high priced name brands</li>
    <li> Broken powder instead of the actual pallet. Very disappointed about the shipping. Also, too dry and powdery it doesn&#x27;t stay and difficult to spread and apply.</li>
    <li> some more images on how to apply it should come, in different type of face.. but the product is really good</li>
    <li> Received it with broken powders! WILL NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> this is a great kit for learning how to sculpt. the attached guide is very helpful and the colors blend nicely together. great investment for any makeup lover!</li>
    <li> This sculpting kit is very helpful! The colors are great and do well at looking very subtle. However, I was disappointed with Amazon and their standards as I was not even given the full length directions included in the actual sculpting kit. When I first recieved the kit I was rather confused that it came with no tips or how-to&#x27;s. Come to find out, this handy sculpting palette does in fact come with a small guide but was somehow removed from my kit. I am usually a huge fan of finding great products on Amazon for great deals, but I will say this really unimpressed me. If you are paying full price for something new, you at least hope to get what you payed for.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken and fell to the &amp;#34;pressed powder&amp;#34; just fell to the floor when I opened package.  I was so disappointed as I wanted to love this product but it&#x27;s useless after shipping.</li>
    <li> Received the product looks okey . Kind of a painting feel ... Not happy I did not receive the chart like the others wrote aswell . Sticks pretty we&#x27;ll.</li>
    <li> This kit is very handy, compact, and easy to use for contouring and highlighting. They are all micro-powders with no glitter and shimmer. All but one are matte finish. There are two white powders- one matte and one with a bit of shimmer. First of all they do not go on too dark or pasty white. They are all soft focus powders that allow you to contour your face and provide a nice soft glow.</li>
    <li> Love the It cosmetics and it works like it said it would.  When I use it on my neck, my neck does looks slimer.  It has no odor it it.  That is a plus in my book.  I would recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> Loved the makeup. I am a beginner but it comes with a little picture to help guide you. It&#x27;s powder, I thought it was cream.</li>
    <li> Contains peanut oil!!! Don&#x27;t use if you&#x27;re allergic!!</li>
    <li> This product is ok.... the light colors in the pallet don&#x27;t show up that well...</li>
    <li> Great for sculpting if you&#x27;re not really sure where to start.  Lots of shades to choose from to find what&#x27;s right for you.  Makeup lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
    <li> Love Love this palette :)</li>
    <li> Great and fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;This product is a miracle&lt;br /&gt;Yes small, but a little goes along way&lt;br /&gt;BUT... Instructions are missing?&lt;br /&gt;I have experience with contouring. But if you don&#x27;t you might be a bit lost.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product.I love all of it cosmetics.This kit contains every shade you would need to sculpt your face.Quality of the powders are finely milled,easy to blend,also you receive how to instructions.</li>
    <li> Best sculpting kit! Nothing compares!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s powder and doesn&#x27;t stay on once you put your foundation on.  No directions or tips just a picture of a face all sculpted which is not what everyone needs.  Some may just want nose or chin anyways not what I thought it would be at all!!!!</li>
    <li> first off 38$ for this.. omg i swear its like nothing in the little thingy n i tought it was cream not powder &amp;#62;:( ugh</li>
    <li> It suet every skin color, can be very creative with this small sized shades ... its a bit larger than a mac eyeshadow. Anyway, this is just perfect for a makeup artiest, or a normal playing women with many faces to do. It worth the price, but also you can use any eyeshadow to do the job. The turn ON in \\&quot;My Sculpted Face Palette\\&quot; that its a waterproof and I test it ;)</li>
    <li> I rarely ever use the middle two colors because they have pink undertones and I have yellow undertones. I often use the bottom two colors and hope I can order them separately once I hit pan. They are the best for contouring and they stay on all day! The top two white colors (one matte and one shimmer) are good highlighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moderately acne prone skin and this did not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am usually a MAC NC40-42 and have combination/oily skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but it seems to work pretty well.  I need to play with it a little more and get used to it, but I think it will definitely be part of my regular routine.</li>
    <li> this is for my granddaughters for Christmas. I did not know that you could enhance you looks so much by contour.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a powered contour palette that gives you a natural contour look but if your looking for a Kim k contour look this isn&#x27;t a palette to do that type of look I suggest to use liquid contour colors first than to set everything to use this pallete I love this palette it gives me a natural look</li>
    <li> Great product. Very easy to follow</li>
    <li> I usually never write reviews, but I have to for this product,  It is so simple and it really enhances your natural beauty.  I use it regularly, whether it&#x27;s for work, a night out or day out and about.  You can work with the palette to make it as subtle or drastic as you please.  Will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> great conturing set! I mainly use the bottom two, but also the matte highlighter. The other is too shiny for me...</li>
    <li> Exactly the same product that they sell at local retailers but a little less on cost. Daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> My absolute fav contour kit! I use it almost everyday. Love it more than my Anastasia kit I bought from Nordstroms.</li>
    <li> The instructions are just a picture of someone (with a really thin face that doesn&#x27;t really need contouring). It would be better if the instructions included dealing with problematic areas rather than just one picture. But, I&#x27;ve kinda figured it out by trial and error and I love the shades and the matte highlighter (don&#x27;t like the shimmery one). I would recommend this contouring kit to anyone looking to do so - I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of other ones and NONE COME CLOSE to the quality and have as many shades.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time however I am sending it back as the make was all broken when I opened it.</li>
    <li> I love this palette! it was so great that I ordered another one for my daughter in law! she loves it an well. highly recommend for anyone wanting to try sculpting without a ton of liquid products caked on the face. this powder set is amazing! love it!!!!</li>
    <li> The colors look great in the package, but they are invisible on my face. I even tried adding a little water to make them show up. Didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> i was really happy to get my product but the packaging was bad and ruined one of the shadows :(</li>
    <li> HIGHLY disappointed.  The colors, the texture, every part of it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive directions and some of the product was broken apart. Thankfully it was a color I didn&#x27;t use. Other than that I really loved it. If you You Tube &amp;#34;Goss make up artist&amp;#34; he has amazing videos on contouring and other make up tips. I learned how to do it from his videos and I love how I look. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments.</li>
    <li> I love this contouring kit so much, this is my second one to purchase.....!</li>
    <li> This palette has 6 colors but I only use 3. It was a misnomer to suggest that it came with instructions- it comes with a picture diagram. However it does what it says. Im taking away a star because of price and the about of product that can&#x27;t be used, and one for the \\&quot;instructions\\&quot; or lack thereof.</li>
    <li> This is my very first sculpting kit and I&#x27;m very amazed on how it can sculpt my face so naturally, with or without foundation. It instantly became a part of my daily must haves from the moment I got it.</li>
