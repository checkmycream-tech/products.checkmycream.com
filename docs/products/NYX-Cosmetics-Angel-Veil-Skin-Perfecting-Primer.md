<li> I have normal skin, and get oily in the t zone throughout the day, it helped a little bit, but wasn&#x27;t any miracle.</li>
<li> it does have a white cast which, on my dark skin, leaves my skin looking a bit ashy and my foundation a tad bit lighter than my skin tone.</li>
<li> The next day, I tried it again, but using less of the angel veil.</li>
<li> and it gives you a matte finish which last all day well at least for me.</li>
<li> so I mix a little of NYX</li>
<li> It does do is job for a little, but makes no noticeable difference in foundation application.</li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s so hard to get.</li>
<li> It made me look patchy in texture and dull.</li>
<li> It was so disappointing.  </li>
<li> and this was a very disappointing.</li>
<li> Terrible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product applies smoothly and a little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t keep the shine away all day though so I mix a little of NYX shine free with this primer and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this Angel Veil so hard, but it was NOT to be. I had looked at this product for quite a while. I think it&#x27;s a dupe of a Smashbox product. Anyway, I read the reviews and it sounded like JUST what I wanted. The best part is the texture. It has a nice, creamy feel. It goes on smoothly and feels divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it left me w/ a whitecast. Kind of like I put on white foundation. :/ That was even putting my makeup on top of it. The next day, I tried it again, but using less of the angel veil. Nope, I still looked like Casper the Ghost. This is the first cosmetic I have EVER returned (I have bought a lot!). There is no way I could use this. I don&#x27;t know how anyone who is darker than an albino could use it either, but it gets rave reviews. It just didn&#x27;t work well w/ me.</li>
    <li> This product &amp;#34;may contain&amp;#34; Titanium Dioxide..  as appear in the label, this means, that contain ( for sure...) I would like to know this information before my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my face look so smooth</li>
    <li> It was so disappointing.  I wish I can refund. Please let me know if I can save my money.</li>
    <li> Great dupe for hourglass mineral veil primer!</li>
    <li> First time trying it and it has been by far the best primer I&#x27;ve used. Easy to apply and it gives you a matte finish which last all day well at least for me. Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Its so smooth and so far I have not broken out because of this product</li>
    <li> I actually seen this at this store and sampled it and loved how it felt but didn&#x27;t buy it.. So I bought it off here..Its thee best primer out of the primers I use, it leaves your face feeling so soft and non greasy which is nice! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> I could&#x27;ve went without it. It does do is job for a little, but makes no noticeable difference in foundation application. It has a white cast, so for all those darker skinned people out there keep that in mind.  Does nothing for pores, but I was prepared for that because it&#x27;s not a pore product. I have normal skin, and get oily in the t zone throughout the day, it helped a little bit, but wasn&#x27;t any miracle. Worth a shot of you have oily skin and are in a buget.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product (definitely meant for light skinned women, as it is white), but the first time i got it the bottle had exploded in the package. I contacted the seller and they answered me within an hour apologizing, saying that they would ship another immediately! I greatly appreciate this caliber of customer service, and am so happy they fixed the problem since I do love this product and ordering it online is so much easier for me.  The foundation is soft, not oily at all, and while tinted white it seems to blend into my medium skin fine to be layered with foundation. Highly recommend and will keep updated on the sellers second attempt to deliver!</li>
    <li> Definitely would reorder</li>
    <li> I love this primer but it&#x27;s so hard to get. I if you see it get right the way because I believe it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    <li> i just buy for my freind</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in the longevity or the finish of my makeup while using this...it does have a white cast which, on my dark skin, leaves my skin looking a bit ashy and my foundation a tad bit lighter than my skin tone. For that reason I don&#x27;t use much of it. It does have a beautiful creamy soft feel though.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this out so decided to buy it on here wasnt sure if it was going to work for my skin type. I got it in 3 days, and I loved it!! Will buy it again</li>
    <li> Not very good, does nothing tho smooth our the makeup. It made me look patchy in texture and dull. I was excited about this primer and this was a very disappointing.</li>
