<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect for my 2 year olds hair.  Easy to use, not too loud. My son isn&#x27;t scared of these.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really purchase this product for myself....the trimmer was a gift for a hair stylist.  Since she hasn&#x27;t told me they work great or that they don&#x27;t serve her needs in her trade I cannot give it a high mark.</li>
    <li> Works great for facial hair, but not strong enought for headhair.</li>
    <li> This AA battery clipper is not powerful enough to cut hair, It pulled on my Grandsons hair as we were trying to cut it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have used a Wahl corded Peanut for ages now.  For both hair buzzing and beard trimming.  I bought the cordless model for travel and well, just to not have a cord.  Well, for beard trimming, it works just as good as the corded model, but for hair buzzing, it&#x27;s just not powerful enough.  It gets bogged down in my hair almost every time and winds up taking me about twice as long to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, not for the heavy duty jobs though.</li>
    <li> This is our second peanut razor. We had the first one for several years and it worked amazingly well. When it finally gave out, we ordered the same razor here on amazon. This razor does not cut well, it pulls hair while attempting to cut. We even tried trimming hair when it was shorter and the razor did the same thing. Painful to use. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it on my pups.</li>
    <li> No cords to get in the way.  Gives a good haircut.  Easy to use. This is my second set. My niece took first set for her son&#x27;s hair cutting.</li>
    <li> I am a african-american and they work pretty good for me in some areas, but I would think that they work better for caucasians in all areas. The 5 star series by Wahl are intended for african-americans so if you are african- american I would suggest that you would look for something in the 5 star series.</li>
    <li> The Peanut Cordless Clipper/trimmer is a God Sent for my two sons!  My son has been using electric and manual razors and they all hurt his skin - not this Wonderful trimmer!  My older son \\&quot;borrowed\\&quot; it from my younger son and didn&#x27;t want to return it.  He uses it for body hair along with facial.  They both love the fact it is cordless and I especially loved the on line price!</li>
    <li> They work just fine just have to get batteries that last longer than the ones that came with them.</li>
    <li> I needed a new clipper/trimmer because my other one was done. I like this Wahl because its cordless. I usually shave/trim my face once a week. This is perfect for that, it won&#x27;t make you smooth but will go far. You can also use the short attachment if you just want to trim it down. Only knock is the batteries that they give you don&#x27;t last that long so just be sure to charge them before using.</li>
    <li> Priced right,with quick ship. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend at Christmas--he&#x27;s had pretty bad luck with trimmers so he was skeptical at first but he loves this one and it works great. I read a lot of reviews before buying and many of them say that the cordless version is not as powerful as its corded counterpart, and that may be true (I haven&#x27;t compared them personally) but this one definitely packs a punch. And still working off its first battery charge which was over a month ago. It&#x27;s also nice that it comes with 2 rechargeable batteries and the dual charger, because it only takes one battery at a time and if that one dies, you&#x27;ve got a backup and don&#x27;t have to wait for it to recharge (or scrounge for another AA battery).</li>
    <li> replaced a 20 yr old peanut. great with out the powercord</li>
    <li> We had the corded one and bought the cordless one for the husband for christmas and i have to say i was surprised at how strong this little guy is just as well or if not better then the corded one so great buy!!</li>
    <li> Simply the best cordless trimmer I have ever had or seen and I tried and was disappointed by many of the other cordless offerings, even Whal&#x27;s non-pro models suck. I kept using my corded Peanut for 8+ years because all the cordless trimmers were crap, that is until this one. It is nearly as powerful as my corded Peanut with fully charged batteries. I know that if you buy low discharge (pre-charged / hybrid) rechargeables such as these: [[ASIN:B00CWNMR5Y AmazonBasics AA Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack) Pre-charged]]/ which also have a higher capacity than the 2 included batteries you&#x27;ll get some more power and a lot more time. Also, with one fully charged battery in the clipper and one or 2 fully charged as spares you&#x27;ll have plenty of power for the biggest jobs on the longest trips and you can leave the big charger at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the included charger, it is much bigger than it needs to be and the door is clunky but, it is a fair quality, intelligent, charger. Most cheap chargers require 2 batteries to be charged at the same time but this one has better electronics and will charge 1 battery at a time. Despite the size, this proves it is not the cheapest charger. Buy the low discharge batteries, no need for the extra high 2800mAh capacity ones, the batteries I linked above are perfect for this clipper. (The high capacity would mostly be wasted due to complicated math and the way they discharge, read reviews of the Amazon Basics high capacity AAs for more details or just take my word on it and get the ones I linked above.) You can then leave the big, clunky charger that comes with this at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a bad charger as I said above but, as I&#x27;m moving to all rechargeables and standardizing all battery operated stuff on AA size, I will be getting a better charger that is smaller and lets you control charging rate, test battery capacity and discharge / refresh batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, long story short, about the clipper itself, If you liked the corded Peanut you will absolutely love this one, especially with some better batteries!</li>
    <li> Bateries does not last long, I have a previous peanut with cord and works better. Much powerfull device.</li>
    <li> UPDATE- it actually performs well using regular AA batteries, they just need to be new and changed frequently for best performance. When either rechargeable or regular batteries are low, the motor might get \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; if clipper pushed too \\&quot;deep\\&quot; too fast.     Original Review-  I travel quite a bit and needed a portable cordless clipper to trim my very short hair.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few other multifunction clippers/trimmers and they all failed to do the job on the head. I also used Wahl \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; corded clipper, which performed very well, but it would only work on 110v, was big and heavy and obviously had a cord which was a nuisance to use especially in shared bathrooms, often without power outlets, etc    So I decided to try this cordless clipper mainly because it&#x27;s in the \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; product line.  It is quite inferior to the 20-30 dollar corded Wahl Professional clipper- it&#x27;s very poorly built and looks like it was made in China (it might&#x27;ve been as well). The two plastic halves of the clipper&#x27;s body don&#x27;t fit snugly to each other and there&#x27;s a visible gap in between. The blades also don&#x27;t look like the solid steel blades on the corded model.    I found the performance to be quite decent using supplied rechargeable batteries- I trimmed the hair on my head without major difficulties, though it&#x27;d get stuck if I pushed it too \\&quot;deep\\&quot; too fast. I went from about 10mm to 5mm using No.2 attachment.    However, when I tried using regular AA battery, the trimmer would get stuck often (motor stops) making the whole procedure rather ineffective and frustrating. Which means it can only be used effectively with rechargeable batteries.  So don&#x27;t count on regular batteries !    Now about the batteries- the charger is a MONSTER. It is at least twice as big and heavy as the clipper itself and it only holds two AA size batteries. It&#x27;s like it was made in the 80&#x27;s. It is also only accepting 110v, which means it can&#x27;t be used in Europe and other places without a voltage converter (yet another device to carry !). I have a 5-year old 4-battery charger with dual voltage which is a third of the size of this one. Wahl is being very cheap in packaging such a monstrous charger which defeats the whole purpose of portability and small clipper size in the first place.  So if you&#x27;re planning on traveling with this clipper, be ready to buy a dual voltage travel size charger.    Overall and for the price this clipper is ok- it performs better than all other cordless devices I&#x27;ve tried and it actually gets the job done. It also works well on body hair.  But Wahl could do much better quality on the \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; line, especially that it&#x27;s made in the US and not in China. But it surely fails to impress on quality and build.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it takes 1 AA battery so i don&#x27;t have to travel with a charger and spare batteries. Overall its a great trimmer, battery life is great although compared to the corded model this one doesn&#x27;t seem to trim as close to your face but that&#x27;s the pay off for the cordless convenience.</li>
    <li> The  WAHL CORDLESS PEANUT clipper/trimmer is an item I have been searching for in various stores for a couple of years.  I cannot understand why Wahl discontinued this appliance.  I had one previously that lasted for years.  My primary use for it is for trimming my Hairless dogs&#x27; manes, tails, and socks.  Many groomers and  individuals involved with the K9 show ring have used this product to their satisfaction.  For my uses, the K9s, it works beautifully; it is easy to hold, handle; it  produces very little sound and no vibration.  It gives a close shave.  It travels very easily taking up very little space, and it is light weight.  It is also small enough to satisfactorily shave women&#x27;s legs, arms, and other areas of the body.  Next month I plan to purchase one for myself if Amazon has any Wahl Peanuts left in stock.  Frankly, I wish WAHL would BRING the PEANUT back to the marketplace.  I am grateful I found the PEANUT at AMAZON.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the Wahl Neo we had which cut really well but only lasted about a year and a half before it died. I like this unit because it&#x27;s compact, has a replaceable battery, comes with two of them so if one runs out of juice, just swap in the other. Seems to cut fairly well, the only issue I have is I have thick hair and when cutting it you have to go really slow otherwise you can hear motor slow down and catch\pull the hair (think of the lawn mower when going over a difficult patch o&#x27; grass). I don&#x27;t remember having this issue with Wahl Neo.</li>
    <li> I really like this thing, works great for my beard and also to shave my head with.  If you push too fast it can bog down a little, but if you go easy with it, it does an excellent job.  I like the fact that it uses AA rechargeable batteries, no internal batter to worry about replacing in a few years.</li>
    <li> fast shipment, I like that use only one battery, great brand and the size is what I expected for travel. The only thing is that do not work like the cable one but thats obvious, battery operated do not work as one pluged to the wall, but for what I wanted is perfect to travel.</li>
    <li> The best clipper for short hair, and trimmer for short beards I&#x27;ve used. The cordless version works well for clipping hair and trimming beards. There is a corded version, Wahl Peanut Palm Size Clipper/Trimmer 8655, that works equally well, without the cordless convenience of mobility and travel. It comes with combs for sizes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and trims to nearly bald with no comb attached. Flip it around with no comb attached and it is perfect for trimming beards to scruff. There is nothing close to this and the 8655.</li>
    <li> I had one of these some years ago and it seemed more powerful than this one. I m still keeping it but wish it was more powerful</li>
    <li> I like that this is a smaller trimmer.  It is powerful and uses AA batteries.  It comes with two rechargables and a charger.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Wahl Professional 8663 Peanut Cordless Trimmer/Clipper and I really like using it. Great Product. It&#x27;s portable and quite powerful for being powered solely by a single AA battery. I keep my hair short and I camp out almost weekly so it&#x27;s great being able to give myself a haircut in the field. I shave with it too. However, it will not give you a razor close shave down to your skin. That&#x27;s OK my boss doesn&#x27;t care. The replacement blades are easy to install and this portable clipper has great battery life to boot! I highly recommend this product.  My only gripe is that, according to the directions at least, it was supposed to come with a small brush to better remove hair that accumulates around the blades. No big deal-just use an old toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I replaced a Remington cordless with this Peanut.  In comparison, this Peanut is a bit of a joke.  It doesn&#x27;t cut very comfortably and the motor seems weak.  Even with new fully charged batteries it sounds as if it&#x27;s going about half the speed it should be.  Definitely not worth the price IMO.  And, the battery charger is huge; you could probably launch the shuttle with it!  Perhaps I can give this to someone who owns pet.</li>
    <li> Works awesome, but order extra blades.</li>
    <li> Since this unit is called \\&quot;Peanut Palm-Size\\&quot; I was a bit worried that it would be under powered and/or cheaply made - but I was pleasantly surprised!  I love this little booger.  It&#x27;s small, fits the hand, easy to maneuver . . . but powerful.  I also had never heard of a clipper that was powered by a single double A battery.  Would it be powerful enough on one little battery?  You betcha!  And even though neither the product photo nor the &#x27;product includes:&#x27; portion mentioned a thing about including a battery - it arrived with TWO Rechargeable AA batteries, and a charger . . . a nice surprise.  It also uses any kind of AA&#x27;s, which is nice if you should be traveling and get caught without a charger, just pick up a cheap AA battery and you&#x27;re in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the way it cut my hair.  This little thing does a great job on my full head of thick hair, and the battery still seemed full when I was finished.  It&#x27;s half the size of my old clippers, and much lighter too, and does the same good job, with no cord to worry with.</li>
    <li> The razor works fine.  No problem.  The only thing bad was that the battery charger cover was broken when I got it.  I hate returning so I just glued it.</li>
    <li> This is a really good trimmer which doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and is very powerful with just a double A battery.</li>
    <li> I love this little trimmer. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve owned Norelco, Andis, and Remington and none have impressed me as much as this little guy.  It gives me the close and even buzz which  I&#x27;ve never gotten with the other brands.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is a good little shaver. It is small and handy.</li>
    <li> I love the trimmers and the price. I am a little annoyed that the description and the package said that the rechargeable batteries were included. When I opened the package they were not in it. Now I have to go buy some.</li>
    <li> Surprising what a great little clipper this is. Does a great job and holds a charge longer than I expected it to.</li>
    <li> great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Product has good quality. It is a bit smaller than other trimmers but performs very well. I have lots of hair and it cuts that without problem most of the time. This make it a perfect product to carry on and having when travelling. For home I would prefer a bigger one, so I can cut my hair faster.&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is the charger. It is bigger than the trimmer and it is only 110V, which means that I cannot plug it to the outlet in some countries. I&#x27;ll ended up using other rechargeable batteries and a charger that I have, this way it becomes a nice travel option. So I will ended up not using almost half of what I bought.</li>
    <li> I normally stay away from the battery operated clippers but Wahl makes a good value product. These aren&#x27;t bad at all but I feel they could&#x27;ve come with stronger batteries to deliver more cutting power. If there&#x27;s an option for a plug where you do your trimming, I suggest getting the corded model.</li>
    <li> works great and so small and light weight</li>
    <li> Great when your 4 year old won&#x27;t go to the barber to get regular hair cuts...My son who is now 4 really hated going to get his hair cut even with the kiddie video going and riding in a cool car chair since he was 2 and started requiring regular hair cuts. Regular corded shavers were too hard to handle with a small child and he became scared of the shavers. This little peanut was perfect and not too loud to scare him when I&#x27;m cutting around his ears. I can give him a hair cut anywhere - usually in front of the TV with his favorite show going. He still gets itchy and a little scared when I put on the attachments to taper/layer his hair cut. But, for the most part it&#x27;s been great and I save $20 each cut to boot. So, this was well worth it - for now he only wants mommy to cut his hair. I&#x27;m sure it will change when he&#x27;s older...</li>
    <li> I have a corded peanut clipper/trimmer and loved the way it works.  The cordless one does not disappoint.  It works great!  These are the best clipper/trimmers I have ever purchased (and I have purchased several).</li>
    <li> Great for trimming without a cord</li>
    <li> Initially I thought these were nice little clippers. Had them for two months, BUT, I am trying to use them for the second time, the battery is dead.  I charged them and the clippers don&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the batteries or the clippers.  But I&#x27;m not a happy customer.  American Gragrance and Cosmetic Company won&#x27;t allow for a return.</li>
    <li> Received the product and it did not work. Had to return it and receive a refund. Was not given the option to exchange which is what I wanted. Worse part is that this was a gift</li>
    <li> Almost bought an OSTER Classic 76, glad I didn&#x27;t.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t last as long I&#x27;ll be buying another of these when it dies.    I am replacing a $15, corded, noisy, huge Whal.    It does a good even job, is very quite, and lightweight.  Very maneuverable without a cord.  Though not an issue because two batteries come with it, one battery charge will last 3 trims.  I think  that is satisfactory.  I keep my hair at a # 2 and it is thinning.  If you are looking for speed cutting this is not your clipper.  It performs well as a single \\&quot;AA\\&quot; battery clipper.  Guys who still have a full head of hair may want to consider going with a corded (more powerful) unit.      As for me it works great.</li>
    <li> My previous Wahl cordless finally gave up after many years of good service.  I cut my own hair and my Wahl corded clipper does a good job but is heavy.  This \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; should have stayed in the shell.  It&#x27;s small (too small) and lightweight but after going over my head a number of times it still left wild hairs .  I will probably get a better one and put the Peanut back in it&#x27;s shell.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is not strong enough to trim hair.Right out of the box and after charging it It just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to trim hair, It keeps getting stuck when you run it through somebody&#x27;s hair. Even if you try to do it slow its just to weak to cut through without stop working and even pulling hair.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for me after my family recommended it.  They own a salon and use one daily.  I use it for shaving/trimming and have had no complaints.  So far it has been used numerous times and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge the battery.  It has a wider head than my previous trimmer and hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation.  I&#x27;m a little skeptical about how long the rechargeable batteries will last, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> The Peanut is an incredible little trimmer.  I was looking for something to use on my beard, and this was a recommendation of my barber who used the Peanut (with cord) to cut my sideburns, touchups, etc.  It&#x27;s my understanding that this is a very popular product among barbers.  Anyways this is a great little machine, and extremely portable.  I bought a small makeup case (one not too feminine looking) to store it in with the included combs and brush, and can throw it my bag and take anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best features is that it runs off of one AA battery, which I prefer to a rechargeable battery.  I use an Energizer Lithium battery, and I don&#x27;t have to change it for over 6 months (shaving once a week), and it&#x27;s quite powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peanut combs with 4 guides/combs...S1 (3mm), S2 (6mm), S3 (10mm), S4 (13mm),,,which brings me to my one tiny flaw.  There should really be one more guide that is shorter than the S1, of about a 1 or 1.5mm length, and this would be the absolute perfect beard trimmer.  Wahl sells standard combs/guides, but they&#x27;re for their larger models, and do not fit on the Peanut unfortunately.  More often than note I use my Peanut without and comb, and it shaves fairly close, giving me about 1-2 day growth (as opposed to a razor and cream).  If I use the S1 guide, it gives me about 8-9 day growth (of course this depends on the person).  If only there were a guide in between the two...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all great product, I only use it on my beard but I&#x27;m certain it could be used for body, pubes, head, etc.</li>
    <li> I use this to cut my own hair at home and this little guy is so easy to maneuver.  My only gripe is that it seems to be very voltage dependent: if you put in a new alkaline battery (non-rechargeable), then this buzzer hums.  You can really hear how fast it goes.  Once you use it for a while, it doesn&#x27;t buzz as fast.  For this reason, I use a new battery every time.  But don&#x27;t throw out the &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; one!  it still has plenty of juice in it!  Plenty!  Just don&#x27;t use it on this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems wasteful, but I don&#x27;t use any rechargeable batteries on this.  Rechargeable NiMH batteries are usually at 1.2V and stay there until it&#x27;s out of juice.  Alkaline batteries start around 1.5V and drop gradually.  The &amp;#34;lower&amp;#34; speeds of NiMH and used alkaline battery may be okay for shorter hair and detailing, but it doesn&#x27;t work well when hair is longer.  It will choke, but even corded clippers choke with longer hair.</li>
    <li> The best portable buzzer</li>
    <li> A very good product. Easy to handle and operate. Battery run time is rather short so a charged spare battery is a must.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! I loved the plug in peanut but not being connected to the wall is even better! It&#x27;s my favorite trimmer for sure. Sharp and light weight.</li>
    <li> Will not hold a charge well enough to cut into head hair for a buzz cut all around. Not enough power.</li>
    <li> Great size, the extra battery was a great idea. My only complaint was it &amp;#34;bogged&amp;#34; down easier than I would like. I&#x27;ve got fairly fine hair so I would imagine that might be a deal breaker for someone with thick hair. Overall a solid product.</li>
    <li> i bought this cordless clipper for manscaping maintenance.  it does the job really well and being cordless is a bonus.  the charger is bulky but it does the job and isn&#x27;t really an inconvenience for me.  really nice cordless trimmer.</li>
    <li> Convenient and easy to use. Does need a few go arounds to get the job done though. All in good</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the size of this little clipper fool you.  It does a great job and my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> We have the regular Peanut and LOVE it.  Do not buy the cordless version&lt;br /&gt;as it constantly gets clogged.  Battery powered is NOT the way to go... stick with the Corded peanut.</li>
    <li> Does not trim the hairline close enough and leaves too much hair.</li>
    <li> Great product...great buying experience</li>
    <li> The actual trimmer itself seems to work just fine.  It&#x27;s probably more powerful than any other cordless trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had but that means little when the guards that are provided simply don&#x27;t offer a lot of variance.  Only the smallest one comes close to the length that I want and the next level up is for someone who wants a truly bushy beard or lengthy buzzcut.  When I ordered I simply assumed that I could buy other size guards separately from Wahl.  Not the case, these are the only 4 guards they sell and if I had to guess, they made this product with shaving a dog in mind.  Probably my fault for not doing the research before buying the product.</li>
    <li> This was brought as a Christmas present.  It arrived on time, and looked great.  My stepson&#x27;s girlfriend was very&lt;br /&gt;happy with it.</li>
    <li> Just right for what I need.  So was the price and delivery.</li>
    <li> Compared to my old Norelco that gave up the ghost, this seems pretty antiquated.  I think there are CERTAINLY better options out there in a set of trimmers/clippers.  Only having 4 guides means you don&#x27;t have nearly as many options as much cheaper offerings from the larger brand names.  The other big complaint that I have is that the batteries, although just coming off of a full-charge behave erratically and don&#x27;t offer the power that you would think they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better, reading similar negative reviews, but I would steer clear of the Cordless Peanut.</li>
    <li> Perfect trimmer, powerful and compact. Great for travel and home.  Used it for two weeks battery still going strong.  Nice battery charger</li>
    <li> i bought this just over a year ago and liked it at first but now that the warranty is up it suddenly starts to work very slowly.... like it will take about 1hr to cut my husbands hair..very disappointed.</li>
    <li> No negative on the gift thus far.  Already had one and really like. . .more words required, bad feature! Pain!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son for his birthday.  He loves it.  I ordered the cordless one because I thought he would rather have it than the corded type.  Unfortunately, when he saw it he said he would rather have had the corded type because, as a rule, cordless shavers do not have as much power as the corded type.  He has a very tough beard.  I did not know until I gave it to him that he might prefer the corded style.  However, after he has used it for several months he says it works very well and much better than he anticipated as he has had cordless models from other brands before and he said they just don&#x27;t do the trick with his tough beard.  This one though seems to be working well for him doing a great job and holding up very well.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a peanut brand my husband had for years, which only stopped working because it was used internationally and the circuit was not strong enough.  This one is perfect because he can take it anywhere without having to plug it up.  It holds a charge for a good amount of time.  It is a little smaller than the corded clippers, but he has no issue with the size.</li>
    <li> As far as trimmers, the teeth never bite.  The only guards are not really gradually, but then again it is only a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Is not that great. Batteries die. Very fast.  Cost should be $12.00.</li>
    <li> It is comfortable and easy to use.I using it for my boy haircut. I also like the the chargeable battery. It stay long.I still using with the first better since I bought it, and I did three major haircut with it.</li>
    <li> I have a 7 lb schnauzer with fine hair and this little thing could not cut her hair. I should have returned it but I didn&#x27;t. :(</li>
    <li> I got this for grooming my dog but my son stole it for his beard! Nifty little clipper, just keep it out of sight if your son is coming home from college you may lose yours too. I got this brand on recommendation from my dog groomer, she uses this brand and recommended this for touch ups.</li>
    <li> Works well and is small. Can use Standard AAA battery. Need a case and a stand.</li>
    <li> awesome and very long lasting for cordless</li>
    <li> It works just fine but does not have the power that the peanut with a cord has.  I did even consider that factor, I have used the peanut with a cord for over 25 years and love it.  If only the cordless had the same power it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> My husband LOVES his Peanut.  Arrived quickly and well-packaged.</li>
    <li> Love it! So much easier to use when it&#x27;s cordless!</li>
    <li> This was a pleasant surprise! It is just as powerful as the Peanut I own with a cord! Now I can I can trim the Cracker Jacks if I so desire!</li>
    <li> Great product. Much more convenient then corded Peanut. Lightweight and easy to handle, compact and simple to pack for storage and traveling.</li>
    <li> Got this one after looking for a while what the best fit would be to replace my old Moser. Hesitated a lot between this one and the Wahl 9918-6171. I only use the trimmer to leave a stubble on my face, with no cutting guide, just the blades. I do that 2 or 3 times a week, like a dry shave. The peanut does a good job, overall, it cuts pretty well my thick facial hair, it feels good in hand (unless you have big hands I guess, it&#x27;s small), the batteries seem to have a good autonomy, the motor has good power even on batteries. My complaint is about the length of the stubble left. My old Moser, as well as a Panasonic I tried recently (but which blades were harsh on my skin), gave a closer cut. So, this Wahl is ok, it does the job and is nice, although it&#x27;s not the best for what I use it for - it could cut closer when using only the blades.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is the second one we got because we lost the first one, however this one is not as good, its slower and weaker and the blade does not seem as sharp as the first ones. Overall we are pretty much disappointed with this product we expected a better product from Whal.</li>
    <li> The peanut replaced an old Wahl cordless clipper.  I like this because it runs on a AA rechargeable battery (charger included).  I have not replaced or recharged the battery yet and I use it everyday.  It works as good as or better than my old clipper and it is small, compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer.  Love the cordless operation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for beards, wish it came with a few more sizes</li>
    <li> When I first saw the packaging I thought that I had made a mistake and purchased the non- pro version. I was totally wrong. The trimmer is very well made and handles extremely well. The batteries, which are NiMH which gives me concerns regarding longevity, take a while to charge (4 to 6 hours) and get quite warm in the process. However the trimmer seems to last forever on one charge. I trim my beard once every two days and the first battery is still providing good power after about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It handles the trimming function well and is easy to use. The cordless format is much easier to handle than trimmers requiring a cord and it is has plenty of power to get through my rather wiry beard. The batteries may become an issue but they are standard AA format and should be easy to replace when they eventually loose their ability to take a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly recommended.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the biggest POS. Thank god I did not have to pay for it! I have had mine for just under a year. I received one as a gift - as a man in the Northeast I grow my beard or a van dyke, every winter. I like to let it grow as much as possible and then TRY desperately to use the &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; for trimming and shaping. The rest of the year I use it to trim side burns and other fly away hairs. Every time I take it out the Peanut, it won&#x27;t start correctly or I need to recharge the battery. Even with a fully re-charged battery it stops working.  When it doesn&#x27;t have enough power to cut a single hair! I just threw this piece of garbage out! Thankfully there are  corded alternatives that work flawlessly!&lt;br /&gt;There is too many problems with this product - I recommend you stay as far away as possible. Spend a little extra for a really good corded trimmer that works flawlessly, or a more expensive wireless trimmer.</li>
    <li> These clippers said you could use them for Dogs, but they were not strong enough and did not work well at all.</li>
    <li> Great clippers I use them to bald my head and then I use an electric razor.  Battery lasts long enough, what I was worried about.</li>
    <li> This is a great little product.  It&#x27;s sturdy and totally free of wires.</li>
    <li> Great project. Very convient. I recommended it to many friends. Does just as good of a job as the corded one.</li>
    <li> When my trusty 12 year old Wahl mustache and beard clipper died, the lady who cuts my hair recommend this.  Since they were close in price, I decided to take her advice and buy it.  This clipper is light and easy to handle, cuts precisely and cleanly and I like that the battery is replaceable.  It cuts much better than my previous Wahl.  I would not hesitate to buy this clipper again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Wahl Peanut trimmer for almost 10 years.  The first two I had were the standard ones that plugged into the wall.  They worked great, loved them.  But, both after about 4-5 yrs went \\&quot;Pop!\\&quot;.  Literary, that is the sound they make when they break and then you smell some burning and that&#x27;s the end of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my last one went Pop, I looked up on Amazon and was actually trying to find a 110-230V version so I didn&#x27;t have to carry a voltage changer when going to Europe.  I found this cordless version and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The freedom to not have it plugged in is great.  Especially if you are shaving your head like me.  The cord was always a bit of a pain (and sometimes too short).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does not have the same power as the corded version, but I expected this as it runs on a single AA battery.  The power is defiantly enough to cut through hair, you may just have to go a bit slower.  If you have long locks of thick hair, this version probably isn&#x27;t for you.  For my beard/goatee and (sadly, balding) head it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find this cordless version is MUCH sharper than either of my previous standard Peanuts.  With my old ones I could cut any which way without any fear of catching my skin.  This cordless model has a much sharper blade/end.  I&#x27;ve actually nicked my skin a couple times on my neck.  This is good and bad.  Good cause I get a closer shave, but I also have to take a bit more care to not dig-in as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger they supply is stupid-big.  I donated it the next day to a second hand store and use another one I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially installed a Sanyo Eneloop AA battery and it lasted about a month (~an 60-90 minutes of shaving).  I was very pleased with this.  Though the Eneloop batteries are about the best rechargeable you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get two Wahl batteries with the trimmer and I am only now using one of the supplied batteries.  If they under perform I&#x27;ll revise my review to note that.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, the battery life is good and even if travelling for a few weeks I think I&#x27;d only take one extra battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;--The corded Peanut was a great trimmer.  This cordless Peanut is far more convenient with no cord, but not as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;--I love not having a cord dangling into the sink and the power and battery life is fine by my standards.&lt;br /&gt;--Battery charger is too big for a compact device like this, I use another one I have.&lt;br /&gt;--This model gives a closer shave then the corded model I had.  Just don&#x27;t push too hard on your skin with it.teries.

    <li> Great little trimmer, super easy to use, love that I can pop in regular battery, just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product delivered as promised.  This battery unit has performance that almost matches the power of the plug in unit I have.</li>
    <li> Rechargeable batteries WITH a genuine Wahl battery charger, four basic attachments, oil and a blade protector. Too bad Wahl discontinued this model!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using corded Wahl clippers for many years and use them weekly to trim my hair and beard. Unfortunately, the corded models are a bit heavy for when I travel (I travel light with just one medium bag for several weeks at a time). They also don&#x27;t work in parts of the world where the electricity frequency differs from the US, unless one uses a heavy transformer. I decided to buy the Wahl Peanut Cordless so that I wouldn&#x27;t waste time going to barbers who inevitably do a less than satisfactory job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the Peanut. It is very light and runs on just one AA battery. I ditched the battery charger that comes with it since it&#x27;s too bulky. I use a [[ASIN:B0014KLX9C Tekkeon TekCharge Mobile Power and Battery Charger]] when I travel since it&#x27;s an awesome product that charges AA batteries as well as any USB powered device. And I use high capacity, low discharge batteries such as [[ASIN:B003LWMZ5M IMEDION AA 2400 mAh low self-discharge batteries (4 Pack)]] and [[ASIN:B000WMK344 Kodak - Battery 4 x AA NiMH]]. With these batteries, I can get several uses from the Peanut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peanut does cut a bit slower than my full-sized corded clippers. The motor is not as robust and the blade is not as wide. But that&#x27;s expected for a travel model and it really does an admirable job. I&#x27;ve had no issues cutting my head hair or my beard. The only thing I can pick at is the closeness of the cut when no guide is used - the blades trim much much closer than the full sized clippers, and they have a tendency to cause nicks which bleed a little. Just be careful and it won&#x27;t be a big deal.</li>
    <li> Its great! Quiet, light, cuts clean, and I also received rechargeable batteries and a battery recharger! I recommend it to all my stylist friends.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cordless trimmer for my husband and he just loves it. He has a corded Peanut Trimmer which we keep at our second home, however, he decided to try the cordless this time to keep at our primary home. He likes it so much better than the corded one. It gives him so much more freedom and the charge lasts quite a long time. He highly recommends this product!!</li>
    <li> The Wahl clipper was everything I expected.  I have been a hair care professional for over 35 years and have come to know and trust the Wahl name when it comes to clipper products.  I own another clipper identical to the one I purchased on Amazon.  However, I was disappointed to find the new set didn&#x27;t have Lithium batteries, like my older one.  Other than that small detail, I am very happy with my purchase and would do it again!</li>
    <li> My husband has a buzz cut and this is perfect to use in between haircuts.</li>
    <li> Works great I kinda want more options on hard lengths, though.</li>
    <li> Great deal, really reliable.</li>
    <li> Works great, the construction of it feels a bit cheap compare with my old corded one, and the rechargeable batteries run out of juice a bit quik, but over all is very convenient.</li>
    <li> After a couple weeks they notified me that they didn&#x27;t have the product in stock and returned my money. Kinda annoying</li>
    <li> Great product. Works great even after hours of being used. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> We bought this item for an upcoming trip overseas for my husband.  It works perfectly for trimming his close cropped beard.  He&#x27;s had no problems with it and the thing he likes the most is that you can use regular rechargeable batteries in it, not just the one it comes with.  When traveling, it is nice to have that as a back up plan.  He likes this so much that he has actually stopped using his usual bulky trimmer.  Great purchase and it fits in the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> This clipper is small, but powerful. I shaved my dad&#x27;s head, and he shaved mine using just one AA battery.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those in between hair cuts neck trims. Battery keeps a good charge and they are a perfect size in your hand (female hand)</li>
    <li> Awesome little product! I love it best buy of the month.</li>
    <li> I love the peanut.  Easy to use for hair trimming.  Portable and unobtrusive.</li>
    <li> Good size, and well built. Cuts very clean. I had a Peanut for about 4years and it finally died. That said, I ordered my second right away. Couldn&#x27;n ask for more. Good attachments, long battery life, and comes with charger &amp; rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  We&#x27;ll, charger #2 just died.  The battery cap no longer makes solid contact with the battery (it seems) so power is intermittent.  Same issue as my first.  Disappointing as I love the clipper, but not it it can&#x27;t keep power!  I think I&#x27;ll try the corded version next. Too bad:(</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this clipper, which in a word, felt cheap.  On one side of the unit, each half of the plastic shell had about a 3/8&#x27;s gap or larger separation which was extremely noticeable when I took off the battery compartment cap and made the unit look like it would fall apart. Even withstanding this is a small trimmer, the motor was underpowered for a pro level clipper.  This design could also use a few more trimmer attachments in my mind.</li>
    <li> I love the peanut clippers to begin with, and when the batteris are fully charged on the cordless one it is great!</li>
    <li> I been shaving my head for almost 20 years and this is the most satisfied I&#x27;ve ever been with clippers.  I&#x27;ve spent between $15-$125 on different clippers over the years and these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close and the batteries last me 8-10 shaves.  It&#x27;s small and I travel with it weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives would be the giant charger they give you, I never use that one I just use one of my other rechargeables chargers. I don&#x27;t use a guard on my head but would like to use one on my beard but the attachments aren&#x27;t short enough.</li>
    <li> Worth the extra money over other lithium cordless razors.  Higher quality blades, better build quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel, smaller than expected, but gets the job done!  Goes through batteries fairy quickly, so keep an extra AA handy or use one from the hotel TV remote...</li>
    <li> Poor battery life, and not as much power as the corded, but it does the trick.</li>
    <li> NOT PORTABLE AT ALL! The rechargeable battery is a MONSTER, NOT GOOD FOR TRAVEL AT ALL! SO THE PRODUCT DOE SNOT MEET THE GOAL</li>
    <li> I had one several years ago when single and loved it then I got married to hairstylist and didn&#x27;t use it much. We are both busy kids, careers and I got a new battery powered peanut. It&#x27;s even better and my wife is even impressed with it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s built a little cheap but it works good and is cordless.  It is  better than more expensive models I have bought</li>
    <li> It is a very good cordless clipper.  It is easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to do style hair cuts.</li>
    <li> I  LOVE this clipper! It is fantastic for what I wanted it for... I use it once a week to keep my beard the length that I wanted. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer to cut my kid&#x27;s hair. Battery life doesn&#x27;t seem that long but what can you expect from battery operated vs electric.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a decent beard trimmer for awhile now.  There was always something I didn&#x27;t like about them until the Peanut.  I can&#x27;t believe how comfortable it is and what a good job it does.  I give this trimmer five stars and I recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good.  Not as powerful as the corded version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to clean up around my beard and it snags/cuts a little more than the corded version.  It helps to keep the batteries super fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after loosing the corded version on vacation and I might just order another corded one and use this one for travel.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this thing works. I shave my head, and unwanted facial hair along with trimming my beard twice per week. This little guy gets it done no problem. I can usually go 2 weeks with the rechargeable batteries it came with. If I use a good quality AA battery I can go three weeks before replacing. It cleans up pretty easily and the best part is I can go outside in the yard or stand in the shower without a cord. Toss it in the bath kit for trips and it fits no problem. I will say that the fit and finish leaves a little to be desired but who cares. I will also say that if you drop it from 5 feet onto ceramic tile, you&#x27;ll be buying a new one. I have personal experience with that as it is a bit small in my hands. So now I just use the death grip and I&#x27;m good. Would highly recommend and if and when it wears out, I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> Completely lacks power and is only worthwhile if you do not have access to plug-in electrical current.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m utterly crazy about my purchase. It&#x27;s precise, lightweight, and did I mention it&#x27;s lightweight? It seriously weighs nothing. About 5 of my peers have purchased one of their own after using mine. If I had one complaint, it&#x27;s that the batteries don&#x27;t seem to last very long, but then again, I use it an awful lot.</li>
    <li> Ok so I have had the corded wahl peanut before and it was honestly the best trimming device I ever owned I could even groom my entire dog after owning the corded clipper for many years.  Till it started to dull out.  so as it being time to buy a new one I thought why not go cordless?  I trusted the brand and device corded so.  .. give it a shot I thought.... Bad decision.  Infact worst buy I have ever made on this site and ever.... The clipper came in normal packaging. Opened it up charged the batteries oiled it up and turned it on began to start clipping and the dam thing got caught in my hair .... My hair was no more then an inch long and my hair isn&#x27;t thick.  This never happened to my corded wahl clippet.  So I though maybe the batteries need more charging ... Nope it just wasn&#x27;t strong enough on battery power or just a crappy device. It won&#x27;t cut hair of stops on anything more then 3 strands of hair and its a bitc# trying to cut the device out of your hair once it gets cuaght so I had to end up shaving my whole head with a device I had to buy in a retail store.  So upset.</li>
    <li> the wahl professional peanut will surprise you with the amount of power this little trimmer has, it cuts great and is easy to hold . the peanut works great for trimming around the ears and the neckline . the peanut is sure to handle anything you can throw at it, if you are looking for a small trimmer that is easy to handle and cuts great the peanut is the trimmer you want . it was shipped fast and arrived at my door in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  thanks amazon, you continue to amaze me&lt;br /&gt;  freddy</li>
    <li> I have been using a &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; trimmer for years, and ordered a new one as a back up. I liked it so much I wanted to make sure I had a replacement at the ready. Ironically, although the new product looks exactly the same, their manufacturing standards have changed. The trimmer DOES NOT CUT CLEANLY. It JAMS AND PULLS HAIR. This is an INFERIOR PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is exactly everyting it says in the reviews. Its small, light, portable, plenty of extra batteries, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I researched different trimmers for awhile before buying this. I saw the corded product received better reviews in regards to performance. However, a corded option just isn&#x27;t what I was looking for. I only use this for light body hair areas and it works great. I&#x27;m not sure what i could say for professional use, but if you&#x27;re looking for something small and convenient that works great, then this should do it for you.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the clippers that you charge and I really like the fact that I can charge the batteries and use them!  And there are two batteries and a battery charger.  I love this neck trimmers!</li>
    <li> Well, I had high hopes based on multiple other reviews I read before I made this purchase. Plus, I had gone through two corded &amp;#34;Peanuts&amp;#34; previously. But, I&#x27;m not getting a consistent charge from the batteries I suspect: Even after a full day or two of charging, the trimmer seems to operate at a very low output, and cycles up and down in speed, never getting very high. I don&#x27;t know if its a defective set of batteries, or charger, or maybe the trimmer itself.  About ready to change brands at this point.</li>
    <li> I owned, and loved the Wahl Peanut corded clipper - outstanding  performance, sharp crisp cut, efficient and powerful.  One problem: a rather bulky and heavy cord.  So when I inadvertently fried the corded one while overseas, I replaced it with the cordless version.  Very convenient to use, a decent but not as clean a cut (somehow the blades seem blunter, and the line of the cut along my mustache, while ok, is not so sharp).  The big problem is the power - audibly weaker even with a fully charged battery (you get two rechargeable AAs and a charger - only one battery is needed for use, so you can always have a charged spare ready to to).  The battery runs down pretty quickly though.  I get only 3 uses out of a charged battery, but to be fair, I use it to shave my head as well as my beard and mustache, if you use it only for light trimming it should go much farther of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, good but not great.  For every day use I am thinking of getting another corded one, and keeping the cordless for travel only.  (Should note before I got this one, I had a Remington rechargeable cordless - the Wahl is better.)</li>
    <li> The Peanut is a great clipper/trimmer.  You get an extra battery.  I have used mine for over two months and I have only recharged it twice.</li>
    <li> Trims well, easy to change battery, easy to attach guides. Just keep the guides cleaned out or it can bog down in thick hair.</li>
    <li> Kind of a rip off. Not worth the money I paid for it.  The batteries die after only one use.</li>
    <li> I bought this set to use in grooming our two dogs.  Very quiet and perfect size to hold in my palm.</li>
    <li> The Peanut Cordless Clippers are perfect for small dogs....They are very quiet and fit in your hand perfect so it doesn&#x27;t upset puppies from the noise</li>
    <li> I bought these because it seems silly to pay $15-$17 for a little boys hair cut every 4-5 weeks. These are probably not going to last more than 6 months as they seem a prone to pulling and my child has a sensitive head. But hey, they were really cheap and well worth the money they are saving me at a salon.</li>
    <li> This is an update to a previous review--the original is included below.  I bought 2 of these many years ago and loved them.  I bought a new one recently and it has proven to be completely useless.  When I bought the new one, it would not even turn on, so I took the blade off to see if the motor worked.  It did, but was not strong enough to move the blade (even after oiling and moving the blade back and forth by hand).  I took the (dull, old) blade from my old unit and put it on the new unit and it did work, but slowly.  I put the new blade on my old unit and it, too, did not have enough power to move the blade.  Thinking that the problem might just be a defect with the blade that came with the new unit, I ordered a new blade.  Same result--neither the old or new unit had enough power to move the blade.  Whether the problem is with the way they now manufacture the blades or the units, the end result is the same--you have a clipper that does not work. :(  I am very disappointed as I really loved this product and have become dependent on it for trimming my beard and hair.    ------- Original review ------    I originally bought this to trim my hair and beard while traveling abroad, as I it can be difficult to get a good haircut when you can&#x27;t speak the language.  I was very impressed by this little device--so much so that I continued to use it when I got home.  I have been using it for years.  I bought a second one when, after dropping the first one dozens of times, I cracked the cap on the battery compartment.    I was impressed that the device gets enough power from a single AA battery to effectively cut hair.  (Granted, my hair is short.)  Also, a single AA battery lasts long enough for several full hair cuts and beard trims.    The fact that this is cordless makes it much easier to use than the corded model (which I previously also owned and also recommend), although the corded one may be more powerful.    This trimmer is perfect for travel due to its small size and the fact that it uses standard batteries.  No more searching for an outlet or adapters.  (My original corded version of this trimmer got blown out when I forgot to use the voltage converter.)</li>
    <li> I use this to shave the long foot hairs on my dogs.  It works very well.  Battery lasts forever!  Does require that you clean the blades and oil it regularly.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Peanut is great for guys who get a military style haircut (buzz cut).  Without a cord, it is more maneuverable, lightweight and I can easily operate it on myself.  I am sure it would be good for other types of trimming as well.</li>
    <li> great trimmer for traveling to other countries...battery operated</li>
    <li> Works great and not having the cord make it very user friendly</li>
    <li> If battery life was a tad longer, then I would not have to stop in the middle of grooming to change them. Otherwise LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Unless the unit is full charged it jam&#x27;s all the time. I oiled it and the same thing occurs. Maybe mine is defective because the corded one is amazing</li>
    <li> I would recommend it because it works good.  The problem I had is that the attachment teeth easily broke when I was putting them away.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer.....packs a lot of punch for a trimmer conveniently sized and comes with a good rechargeable system...it does accumulate hair in the blades rather quickly and requires vigorous brushing after each use....&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are good. Especially since they are battery operated. The only thing I wish was that the blade was adjustable  in order to get a closer cut.</li>
    <li> A fine trimmer for hair. Be careful not to trim off sideburns. It take practice.</li>
    <li> Service was awesome, as I purchased at the last minute for a christmas gift. My son in law loved it...</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer to go into places my big trimmer won&#x27;t fit-&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to maneuver and very light with no cord to get in the way&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily for general beard maintenance and it is always there to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had serious doubts about its power and reliability.&lt;br /&gt;It is going on a year and no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does need lubrication every month or so, so don&#x27;t loose the little bottle of oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do suggest rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;You can tell as the tool slows, it needs a new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I definitely recommend this trimmer for general daily light trimming.</li>
    <li> MY husband favorite trimmer, and he has had a few...</li>
    <li> This clipper is compact and it does the trick! The battery lasts for a long time and I want to buy a second one as a backup!</li>
    <li> runs great on one battery no need for the corded version</li>
    <li> should have come with a case</li>
    <li> I bought one for grooming terriers&#x27; feet and ears (wonderful!) and then bought a seond one to use on humans (also wonderful).  Very lightweight, and a good size (not too bulky, not too small to handle).  It will not plow through the main coat, but it makes touching up the ears and pads SO much easier, it&#x27;s worth the investment.  It&#x27;s also quieter than the standard-sized trimmers, so my dogs don&#x27;t mind getting their sensitive ears trimmed.  Definitely buy the cordless; the freedom to move around the dog (or human) easily is worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> It has some problems. If you have crazy thin hair and trim it often.. this is fine for you. If you have normal to thick hair, forget it. I&#x27;ve used this on several hair types.</li>
    <li> This styler/cutter is perfect for shaping and doing effective hair touch-ups. It &amp;#34;grabs&amp;#34; minimally and it is quiet and easy to maneaver.</li>
    <li> fast n good price - what more can i say !</li>
    <li> We bought this to use on our Papillons, whose long silky hair can get bogged down w/ plant matter, dust, etc.  We can clip out the tangles and blobs with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus if I ever decide to get rid of what little hair remains on the top of my head, I&#x27;m all set :-)</li>
    <li> Great little clippers. Easy to use even with a fidgety dog. I love that the batteries are rechargeable.  My little one quickly became comfortable with the sound.</li>
    <li> I am a pro hairdresser and find the Peanut indispensible for my work. I use the Peanut for outlining around the ears, trimming side burns and neckline.  I also find using this size clipper for toddlers is better then using a large clipper, because it doesn&#x27;t scare them as much. I love that is cordless, although has a tad less power then the corded model which I use normally. But since I use it mainly for outlining and toddlers, it does not matter.</li>
    <li> These things are by far the best personal trimmer/clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.  They&#x27;re easy to charge and care for and they work really well compared to similarly priced clippers that I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  I&#x27;m really happy with mine and I would recommend them to anyone that&#x27;s interested.</li>
    <li> Works great....like the fact that you can change out the batteries when the power starts to wane...the charger and batteries that come with this is adaquate....if you want to make it great get the AA Eneloop batteries found here on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/eneloop-Pre-Charged-Rechargeable-Batteries-Position/dp/B004RP2VNI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_8?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1358982299&amp;sr&#x3D;8-8&amp;keywords&#x3D;eneloop&lt;br /&gt;You should have these batteries anyway....they&#x27;re the best rechargeable batteries available so they have other uses.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! work perfect and very easy to use!</li>
    <li> I keep my hair very short, so this clipper is perfect for me.  But, I limited my review to only 4 of 5 stars because I feel that with thicker hair it might not be as efficient.  For a cordless trimmer it has adequate power, but tends to bog down in certain situations.  The battery has a long life, and it comes complete with two so that when one runs low, it is a simple switch to the other battery to finish the trim.  I originally used the corded Peanut trimmer and it seemed to be a little more porwerful.  But, like the cordless model better since it is easier to use with out getting tangled in the cord.  I highly recommend the Wahl trimmmer, and with a little more power it would have been a 5-star product.</li>
    <li> Item was dilvered super fast. Packing is simple, actually a bit cheap, easy to unpack though.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is really small, so that easy to maneuver. bought for kids so that a plus. it runs on just one single rechargeable AA battery. package includes 2x 1.2v 1200mA batteries and a \\&quot;super\\&quot; large charger. the clipper can run with one battery for over 20 minutes without obvious loss of power. comes with 4 adapters but they feel very cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;the product is rated \\&quot;professoinal\\&quot; but don&#x27;t have such feeling for it, it&#x27;s more like a small toy.&lt;br /&gt;Finally one big issue for anyone who buy this for kids: it&#x27;s really really loud!!!</li>
    <li> Oh, I just love this little critter!  It takes a bit of practice to use it on yourself, but I&#x27;m getting the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;Being cordless is a great feature if you cut your own hair.  It gives a close to bald cut if you don&#x27;t use an&lt;br /&gt;attachment comb, which is great for today&#x27;s shaved look.  The larger clippers will do that too, of course, but&lt;br /&gt;this is much lighter and shaped for easy handling.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Easy to use, clean, etc.  Rechargeable batteries work well.  The Peanut cuts cleanly &amp; evenly.</li>
    <li> Changed the battery for the first time and it no longer works;</li>
    <li> It vibrates too much, and it isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the &amp;#34;peanut&amp;#34;, with the plug-in chord.</li>
    <li> This does not have much ability to do anything. I thought I would use it on my tiny yorkie&#x27;s face and legs, but it doesn&#x27;t work well. I have a full size wahl trimmer that I use that works better.</li>
    <li> My wife does hair for a living and this peanut works great for lady&#x60;s with holding things all day! It is very light and gets used every day and has not given her any issues at all ! Great for anyone who does hair  :)&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks again !</li>
    <li> I really love this little clipper, It does a super job at trimming &amp; clipping. I use it on my Beard &amp; Hair. I would highly recommend this little Peanut of a trimmer/clipper.....</li>
    <li> We go out of the country periodically and need to cut hair with varying power voltages and frequencies. In England, we used a transformer to power our corded clipper. The frequency made it noisy. It did still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; does the job everywhere. It is not a professional, production hair cutter. It is perfect for home hair cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had to replace the previous one. A wire had come unsoldered in the unit. Before the new one arrived, I opened the old one, discovered the problem and re-soldered the wire. We are still using the old one and are yet to open the new package.</li>
    <li> Finally, a truly useful, cordless beard trimmer. It uses standard AA rechargeable batteries (it comes with two batteries and a charger). I can rapidly trim my beard with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product could be improved if the length of the tines on the #2, #3 and #4 heads were at least 50% shorter. At they are, it is difficult to use them to trim your mustache under your nose.</li>
    <li> Especially good for trimming a little dog. The fact that its cordless  is so beneficial .I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I held off on this review because I wanted to use it a couple of times AND wanted to see how it did while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to the reader:  I shave my head once or sometimes twice a week.  I like a 000 shave on top of my dome so I&#x27;m not trying to cut through a thick head of hair with this thing.  I shave my head and do touch ups on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first round was great.  It&#x27;s even easier to manuever this little thing than it&#x27;s corded cousin.  It&#x27;s not bulky like a set of professional clippers (dealt with those too) and with a fully charged AA battery, this thing screams.  It didn&#x27;t slow down not once during the entire process of shaving my head AND trimming up / lining up my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a small Pelican case made for single hard drives and this thing fits into it perfect with two guards, the oil that came with it and the little cleaning brush.  That ensured no damage while traversing the globe stuffed into my checked duffle bag.  That was a HUGE plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the same battery that was in the thing I was able to perform the grooming detailed above a second time and the thing was still screaming through it.  I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t put a time line on that for you but I do have a huge melon so it&#x27;s no real quick task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third round, about half way is when the battery started showing signs of fatigue but none-the-less it still completed the task.  The fatigue wasn&#x27;t drastic, just enough to tell it was no longer screaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel the need to take the charger with me during travels because let&#x27;s be honest... it&#x27;s entirely too easy to take an extra AA battery with me or simply pick one up.  Even when all of my travels are over-seas.... which is why I went battery operated in the first place.  The corded version doesn&#x27;t accept higher than 120.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this guy if you&#x27;re in the same boat as me (traveling bald melon head).</li>
    <li> This product ROCKS! I use it all the time. Cordless is the way to go! It doesn&#x27;t take up a ton of space when you take it with you out of town. I would buy it twice.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter as her clippers were in need of a visit to the trash can :)  She is a professional stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about it being cordless/rechargeable and that is not an issue.  It comes with two batteries (AA size) so that one can be on the charger and the other being used.  The batteries are high output and hold a charge for a long time so there is no issue with it going dead anytime after beginning use.  It is nice to hold and lightweight.  Creates a nice, neat, and sharp line when used.  Comes with oil, cleaning brush and a nice set of guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to mention, even though the rechargeable batteries are AA size, they state in the manual that regular alkaline AA&#x27;s are not to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Peanut is awesome in the first place, and the cordless is even better.</li>
    <li> On the go trimming-operates on one AA rechargeable battery&lt;br /&gt;Removable blade easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Great for crewcuts-various size guards included</li>
    <li> This is our second one.  The first one finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; after about 7 years of cutting my husbands hair once a week.  It stays sharp and can cut very close.  For the cost of going to the barber 3-5  times, I can cut his hair for 7 years :)</li>
    <li> On time and great trimmer</li>
    <li> ...and does it well.  Seems like it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;If you already have your hair at #3, it will easily maintain it without jamming or pulling. Getting to the #3 length takes some patience.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the #1 comb is not short enough for a close trim, it should be a 1/2.  Otherwise, I could not be much happier.</li>
    <li> guards are too long, I cant trim under nose (mustache) at all with these.</li>
    <li> My wife is in love with it. She got 4&#x27; pillows that just fit on it Great to sit in the shade and talk and swing. Just one place in our yard we can sit and enjoy our flowers and the birds.</li>
