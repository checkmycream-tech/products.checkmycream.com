<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 12 yrs upon advice of my dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve been ordering it at CVS, but suddenly they aren&#x27;t carrying  it.  None of the other drugstores had it and I was in a panic, but went to Amazon to see if they had it and you DID!  Great!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Complex 15 for over 35 years. It is a great product.  My husband uses it also for dry skin problems.  I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I am devastated that the company that made Complex 15 has been sold to Bayer, who decided to stop making it altogether.  Complex 15 was the perfect lotion for my dry skin - very fast absorbing, did not leave any greasy feel or tightness on my skin, and unscented without smelling like a chemical laboratory.  I have recommended it to many, many friends and family members, only to have them stop making it.  Why???</li>
    <li> I have tried every moisturizer available from the cheapest stuff at Walgreens to most expensive crap you buy at Macy&#x27;s. I decided to try this because of the reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Nothing compares to Complex 15! I have combo skin and this moisturizer leaves my skin non-oily, smooth, with no dry spots. Highly recommend this moisturizer if you have combination skin!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it got such high reviews.  It&#x27;s fine, but nothing special.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin after using it about 3 months.  The cream is quite light and not greasy.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes on really thin. It&#x27;s the most watery face moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. That being said, it seems to moisturize just fine. It&#x27;s warmer weather now, so I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;ll be in the dryer winter weather with being so thin. My skin look and feels great.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better face creams that I&#x27;ve found over the years. I like to apply it right after I come out of the shower. The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last. I feel like I have to reapply it more often than other product&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. However, it does it&#x27;s job well and it&#x27;s the brand that I&#x27;ve used for the last 2 years or so.</li>
    <li> I have spent endless dollars since turning 50 looking for a moisturizing cream that works on my extremely dry, sensitve chin and nose. Most moisturizing face creams only seem to make the condition worse; if they help the dryness, I would break out in blemishes.     I&#x27;ve been using this cream less than a week and can already see an improvement in the dry skin. So far it hasn&#x27;t made my skin break out with blemishes--only time will tell if this remains the case. I apply the cream at night after I remove my makeup and during the day under makeup. It seems to make my makeup application smoother.    If I don&#x27;t start breaking out with this, I&#x27;ll use this cream forever. So far, it&#x27;s an excellent buy. It works for me and is a very good price.</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and have never had any problems with Complex 15 facial lotion.  It is extremely gentle and light weight!    The item shipped very quickly and arrived just as described.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion several years ago.  I can no longer find it in my area and am so happy to be able to buy it from Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Hard to find, so am I&#x27;m happy I can find it on the web for a good price.</li>
    <li> I suffer from acne, and I&#x27;ve always used Cetaphil as my moisturizer since my dermatologist recommended it. However, the one thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that by the end of the day, my face would feel like it was covered in a coat of grease. When I switched to this product, I did not have that problem at all. It hydrated my skin and did not weigh it down with grease. It&#x27;s also noncomedogenic and unscented, so it didn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me break out. I don&#x27;t know how well this product would work for someone with extremely dry skin, but for any one with combination skin like mine, this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have had oily skin my whole life and have had a very hard time finding a product that would give moisure without making my skin greasy.  I&#x27;ve spent countless dollars looking for something that would work.  A few years ago my daughter introduced me to Complex 15 and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.  The local store where we used to get it stopped carrying it, but fortunately Amazon came through and we can still get our favorite moisturizer.  And it costs a lot less than those department store products that cost beaucoup bucks.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended Complex 15 to me 15 years ago as a mosterizer that could be used for the rest of my life. I have used it since then and I have no regrets.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery!  I love this cream!  I have dry skin and have bought very expensive skin creams only to find out that this one works the best for me - for a fraction of the price of the expensive stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years after it was recommended by a Dermatologist.  I like this product because it does not cause my skin to breakout.  I would highly recommend this product for someone that has issues with face creams causing breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 for over 15 years and it&#x27;s terrific: light, non-greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It&#x27;s every bit as good (and typically better) than upscale cosmetic-brand moisturizers that cost five times as much. And with Amazon.com&#x27;s three-pack, the bargain is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream when I was in New York earlier this year and was it like a miracle treatment. After about 1 week of using it morning and night, my skin was clear and well hydrated. I have always suffered with problematic combination skin and as I like to over-moisturize (my attempt at slowing down the aging process) I find that most products are either too drying or too oily. But Complex 15 was just perfect. Now I have the problem of not being able to locate it in the UK or other European countries. I can&#x27;t even buy it from Amazon and get it shipped due to Warranty and Manufacturer restrictions. So if anyone knows if this product is branded under another name in Europe, I would love to know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using very expensive moisturizers for years, and yet my pores kept getting clogged.  I bought a cream that was over $100 and I broke out! At a recent visit to my dermatologist (she&#x27;s renowned in the Santa Monica, CA area), I asked her for advice.  She recommended this.  As another reviewer indicated, this moisturizer is light.  That&#x27;s a good thing!  That&#x27;s why my pores haven&#x27;t clogged.  I&#x27;ll take that any day!  I have normal to dry face; my dermatologist reminded me to hydrate - drink water throughout the day!</li>
    <li> This face cream is really a great value for the money.  I have been using moisturizers that cost two to three times as much but aren&#x27;t that much better.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect face lotion, it is a light, non-greasy formula.  Our dermatologist recommended it years ago and we have been using it ever since.  My only issue is that I can no longer find it in our local stores.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 15 years, ever since I heard a dermatiologist on the news in Arizona recommend it.  I get lots of compliments on my skin.  It&#x27;s the moisturizer my 21 year old daughter has always used, too.  We use other products by Clinique, Merle Norman, and Dior, but feel this is the best moisturizer available.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding it in the past and was thrilled to see it was available through Amazon!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this instead of aftershave.  It soothes and moisturizes without any oily or heavy lotion feeling.  I use it in the summer, sometimes, as an alternative to my regular heavier facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I last bought a 3-Pack  not to long ago for  about $18.00 Now over  $179.00?!!  Used this product over 25 years and loved it. I can understand a slight price increase, but this is beyond absurd! I&#x27;m done. I would like to have what these resellers are smok&#x27;n, NUTS!&lt;br /&gt;Rich, Lexington, KY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> This was recommended by our dermatologist.  Could not find in stores so bought on amazon.com  Easy to use and would buy again.  Originally bought to be used in conjunction with a very drying acne medication.  Still using just becasue.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers I started using this on the advice of my dermatologist for its non-comedogenic property. It&#x27;s fabulous as a moisturizing face cream but it also works like a healing agent on sunburns (so cooling), and on cold sores that are in the drying up stage and on skin that is the victim of too much chlorine in a public swimming pool. Good for little kids and senior citizens and everyone in between. I&#x27;ve been using it for 27 years and twice within the past year I&#x27;ve been mistaken for my daughters&#x27; sister! For those with dry skin, more applications are probably needed.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best products that has worked for me. No break outs and soft feel all day. Most products I used before would still leave my skin feeling a little irritated. First, I bought a pack from the local store, then ordered another pack of three after realizing how compatible it was with my sensitive skin. All this with the hope that they keep it as it is.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement for Purpose lotion now that their formula has changed for the worse, and so far I&#x27;m happy with this one. It&#x27;s scentless, non-greasy, and blends in well. I haven&#x27;t tried the lotion version of Complex 15, but this seems more like a lotion than a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor gripes are that it&#x27;s a bit expensive (even purchased in a 3-pack) and apparently doesn&#x27;t include any sun protection.</li>
    <li> This is a light, fragrance free product. I have combination skin.  I&#x27;ve tried different brands, but I like this product more than any I&#x27;ve ever used.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 15 years after my dermatologist recommended it. It is light and forms a moisture barrier on your skin. Contains phospholipids which are also good for the skin and is hypoallergenic. It is hard to find it on the shelf anymore and I am seeing other similar products in drug stores now instead. But I like Complex 15, found it on Amazon so I purchase it from them now. It&#x27;s great. Please keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> I needed a face moisturizing cream that wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores.  This is it! I love using it and it comes in convenient, light-weight 3 oz. tubes, ideal for traveling. And it doesn&#x27;t cost much -- works better than expensive fancy creams from the beauty counter.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me 25 years ago by a dermatologist as I was having skin problems.  The problems cleared up and I have been using it ever since.  I am now 70 years old and I always  get compliments on my skin.  In fact, just yesterday, my grandson said I have fewer wrinkles than his  mother.  I don&#x27;t know what I will do if they ever discontinue this product.  I love it!!</li>
    <li> My face tends to get dry.  My skin is pretty sensitive.  I have tried a lot of different brands, cetaphil, acne.org, etc...  This is the only one that does not cause any breakouts yet still moisturizes.  I&#x27;m sure there are a lot of companies out there that will market the crap out of their product and sell it to you for $40, but in the end it&#x27;s not going to match up with complex 15.</li>
    <li> This face cream is great! It&#x27;s not greasy at all and feels like you have nothing on. I started Retin-A treatment which really dries out your skin. This cream soothes all the dryness away. The fact that it has no smell at all is also great. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to read over the reviews and to see that there are so many others out there (like me) who love this product! My mother in law told me about it almost 30 years ago (Complex 15 came out first then a few years later, the face cream was added). I never use any other moisturizer on my face. Like others, I was distressed to see that most drug stores do not carry it anymore, but thankfully there are still ways to buy it (thank you, Amazon!) I love this face cream. It is non&#x3D;greasy and restores a suppleness to the skin so that it doesn&#x27;t ever feel tight and dry, even after a good scrubbing.</li>
    <li> The product came in perfect condition however after the order I found the same product for a small fraction of the price.  I love the product and except for the price have no complaints</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t work for me after using it 3 times my skin started to feel dry and red I don&#x27;t know about the good reviews but this product is not good at all be careful</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m 34 and have fair, sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m growing vainer as I age and I don&#x27;t want to be wrinkly and sun spotted before my time.  I like how it goes on and quickly absorbs without feeling greasy.  I hate this about most lotions and especially face lotions, but this goes into the skin quickly.  If it had a little SPF it would be even greater.</li>
    <li> Many, many years ago Phil Donohue had dermatologists on one of his shows to educate the public on inexpensive (and usually better) alternatives to expensive products on the market.  Complex 15 Face Cream was one of those inexpensive products and I have been using it ever since as a night cream.  Only recently have I decided to use it as a base for my foundation and I really like the result.  I often receive compliments on my skin, at age 74, and I think that having used Complex 15 all these many years has something to do with that success.</li>
    <li> I purchased this moisturizer because my face was becoming dry from my Proactive Acne Treatment. After only a couple usages, my skin was restored. Although some may complain of the moisturizers thin consistency, I found that not much was needed to cover my face completely because it spread very well. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a facial moisturizer that does not clog pores.</li>
    <li> Now I buy multipack. Cannot live without this cream. I have very sensitive skin that easily breaks out. I have tried many expensive creams, switching them often. This is a miracle! No breakouts, my skin is smooth and better looking!</li>
    <li> easily absorbed by my skin&lt;br /&gt;no greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt;no obnoxious smells&lt;br /&gt;great product which I have used for years and years, and hope to continue to use for many more</li>
    <li> my mother used this when i was growing up.  she had to order it through her pharmacy.  i didn&#x27;t start using it until several years ago in my thirties.  this is the most soothing, moisturizing face cream i have ever used and i&#x27;ve tried ALOT.  i am thankful to find it at Amazon as i was having to drive a ways to find it at CVS.</li>
    <li> This cream is the first I&#x27;ve found that never irritates my skin, just smooths and lubricates it. Having your face and body cream in a tube prevents you from introducing germs into the product. Pleasant, light fragreance.</li>
    <li> Great cream.... Super light &amp; not oily.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was highly rated, but maybe I just don&#x27;t have the right skin for it.  I used it for several days.  At first I thought it improved the look of my makeup.  After about the 4th day I had started getting a couple deep massive pimples on my face, and I haven&#x27;t really had pimples since I was a teenager.  Unfortunately the biggest one was present throughout my college graduation ceremony.  Oh well.  I stopped using this cream and they went away.  Now I have to figure out what to do with the 2 other tubes.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 10 years . It&#x27;s the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for over 20 years. I have sensitive face skin and this is the best thing out there for my face. It&#x27;s hypoallergenic, non-greasy or heavy and goes on without leaving a filmy feeling and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. Additional bonus is that it&#x27;s not expensive and you can order it through amazon in triple packs to save additional $$.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 30 years. Other products have come and gone, but nothing else measures up for quality and results for sensitive faces - young or old(er)!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have a mixture of normal and dry facial skin that is also sensative.  This has no mineral oil which clogs pores so that was a plus.  This did not sting my eyes like recent moisurizers I&#x27;ve tried and did the job in areas where my skin is normal. Where my skin is dry/peeling, it did not work so well.  I continue to have dryness and peeling in those areas. To help I apply twice as much in those areas and I also mix this light (yes it is light) formula with my foundation for extra moisture.  Works well that way.  I drink 64 oz of water a day anyway so I&#x27;ll see if the performance of this face cream improves with warmer climate and weather.  I bought 3 and wont buy more unless I notice an improvement with my dry areas. Other than that, good, light, moisturizing formula - if you dont have extremely dry skin - try it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years and love the product. I&#x27;m always asked what moisturizer I use and I tell everyone Complex 15.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over ten years and my face loves it!</li>
    <li> A dermatologist recommended this to me years ago, and I use it every day. I love it. My skin always feels moisturized. I only have to use it in the morning, and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I Love this Stuff!~ I don&#x27;t like heavy face creams or lotions and I hate sticky also. However this moistures and seems to soak in quickly!~ I Love it it&#x27;s a great product and a good price!~</li>
    <li> Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Face Cream is a superb product because it moisturizes without any greasy feeling,no perfumes,keeps your skin soft and moisturized longer. My skin does look better with it than any other skin sensitive product. It is not available in any chain drugstore that I have been to recently. So having it available at Amazon at a reasonable price is excellent. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have been using the Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Face Cream 2x daily for over 25 years after a recommendation from a dermatologist in Houston, Tx. She stated she had just returned from a seminar where many products were rated among all the doctors attending and this was their overwhelming choice. I have made believers out of many friends and family.  This is a no nonsense, value priced product. Why pay more for fancy packaging and national advertising?  It doesn&#x27;t promise the moon, just well hydrated faces and it delivers.</li>
    <li> unfortunately, the manufacturer stopped making the best moisturizer on the planet. shame.</li>
    <li> Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Face Cream. This is a hard to find item, but I always know I can find it at Amazon.  It was recommended by a dermatologist and I would not use any other moisturizer. J.</li>
    <li> This is a great every day lotion that does not feel thick or sticky.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 15 years and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> I like this a lot; the price is great; it is not sticky or gummy and goes on smooth.  I can even wear it under my makeup without any problems.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have an oily T-zone and dry skin all over so I was looking for a good facial moisturizer, especially for the winter months. The reviews for this product were great so I thought, excellent! - I&#x27;ve found my new lotion! Yeah right...I have no idea who is posting these reviews, but this stuff is not good. It&#x27;s definitely water based so I&#x27;d put it on and after it dried I&#x27;d get that tight feeling. It didn&#x27;t help me with moisturizing. If you have lightly dry skin this might work, but if you&#x27;re like me and get flaky from makeup and the environment, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use it twice, once in the morning and once before going to bed. Skin stays very moist without any greasiness.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin, and I have two issues with this product.  One, like someone else has said, it dosen&#x27;t work all that well on really dry skin.  Two, I actually thought it felt heavy.  Most of the reviews say its so light, but I disagree.  Felt heavy on my face.</li>
    <li> Used lots of moisturizers.This doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or irritations. And the price is right. Since it&#x27;s not $50+ a bottle, don&#x27;t mind using a little extra during the coldest windy weather.</li>
    <li> I started using this product more than 20 year ago and love it.  I can no longer find it in the stores by my home so have been ordering it on line for a couple of years now.</li>
    <li> The product shipped and arrived quickly, no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of being a product that is green, and has no harsh, carcinogenic chemicals, it&#x27;s a winner. The problem is that I have a pretty decent problem with acne, and I think that this product did a little bit to exacerbate that. Also, there is no sun protection involved, and I think that&#x27;s important in a moisturizer. Did it do everything it said it would? Yep. Did it fall short of my expectations of the perfect moisturizer? Yep. Basically, I think it&#x27;s a very good value-based price point, and who knows, I may give the product another chance in the future, but I&#x27;m not happy that I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent lotion.  My doctor recommended it to me years ago.  I have a condition that makes my skin itch easily and have received great relief using Complex 15.</li>
    <li> This product may not be for everyone but it works good for me.  It is a light moisturizer that does not clog pores or irritate my skin.  This probably would not work for someone with very dry skin.  I have used it for years and love it as my skin, even at 63 years old, still will break out if I use Olay or other heavier type products.    Winters in California are mild but a few weeks out of the year I might have to use something heavier if I am exposed to indoor heaters on a daily basis. But I soon return to this product for the rest of the year.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 3-pack after much web-shopping for a new face moisturizer. Pros: It&#x27;s inexpensive and a nice, light moisturizer. It absorbs reasonably quickly and isn&#x27;t heavy at all. Cons: Not heavy enough for night-time use, doesn&#x27;t diminish signs of aging (dark spots, wrinkles, etc.) For the price, I&#x27;m perfectly satisifed with my purchase. However, I doubt I&#x27;ll order again. It just didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me as a long-term facial moisturizer. I need an over-40 product to combat signs of aging.</li>
    <li> too bad I cannot afford it any more....</li>
    <li> This is a great product but much more expensive than the same thing in lotion form in an 8 oz. bottle.  This is easy to find at stores but I prefer the lotion form which doesn&#x27;t seem to be in drug stores any more so I order it on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 15 years. Recently the drugstore that carried the product canceled it. I was delighted to find that I could purchase it on Amazon.com. I have found it to be a wonderful face cream and would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 30 years after a dermatologist recommended it to me in NYC.  I have a twin sister who has never used the product.  People always ask me if she is my older sister and I had one woman ask if I was her daughter! I should be the poster child for this product.  I am just happy that I took some good advice all those years ago.  Review after review from long time users should convince you to try this product.  I religiously use it night and day, and the proof is in the lack of lines on my face and hands. I originally kept using it because it blends into your skin so easily, (not greasy like a lot of moisturizers), glad I stayed with it.  I will use this product forever.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for your face.  Light, moisture filled, and non-comegedic.  I have used this product for 20 years and could do without it.  My skin is in great shape for my age and C-15 is the reason.</li>
    <li> Always great..... wish I could find it in the stores. The moisturizing ingredients really do what they say they&#x27;re going to do.</li>
    <li> This lotion is hard to find at CVS and RiteAid so it&#x27;s always much easier to order via Amazon, and I like that it comes in a three pack.  The only suggestion I would have is for it to be available with Amazon Prime so shipping could be free.  Other than that it is great.</li>
    <li> Bought this after seeing all the rave reviews. I have fair/moderate skin.  The consistency is a little strange, almost \\&quot;slimy,\\&quot; which makes it a bit difficult to absorb. It stays on the surface of my skin a lot longer than other generic type of creams/lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past (meaning it doesn&#x27;t absorb easily). Also, it looks, smells, and has the consistency of one of the ingredients required to make a baby.  That&#x27;s actually the worst part. Although there is no intentional fragrance added to this product, it still has a faint lingering smell that I just can&#x27;t stand.  Considering that it moisturizes my skin no better than other generic products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, I cannot recommend this product. Especially because of the disgusting, nauseating smell.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great on oily or acne prone skin. It moisturizes without causing break outs. It is a good value.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 15 years. Now most of the women in my family are also using it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 30 years and as long as it is available won&#x27;t ever use anything else!</li>
    <li> My go-to ever since my dermatologist recommended it to me ages ago.  Very lightweight.. disappears shortly after application.  If your skin is very dry, though, you may want to try something else, or supplement with something more heavy-duty.  I buy it whenever I see it for 7 bucks or less.. usually never goes below 5.75.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for people with semi-dry skin.  Have used this product for 25 years....was recommended to me by my sister-in-law.  She still uses this as well as several other family members including my son.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a new product for semi-dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this. I&#x27;ve tried so many moisturizers, and this is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin liquid, only takes a few drops, and feels very light.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy or heavy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Not heavily perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So often, I put on moisturizer and after a little while, it&#x27;s gone and my skin is no different. This stuff actually moisturizes--rare indeed!</li>
    <li> I can get an 8oz container at my local drug store for about $9.00.  What are you thinking?</li>
    <li> I started using Complex 15 Face Cream about 25 years ago when a dermatologist recommended it to my husband.  He had some darker spots on his face and this helped to diminish the darker areas.  I had very oily skin and always feared putting lotion on my face because I&#x27;d break out.  But I tried this lotion and never had a problem &amp; have been using it daily ever since.  I&#x27;ve used the C-15 body lotion and that&#x27;s a great product, too.  This is just my opinion, but I was a smoker for 30+ years and I never got the wrinkly, leathery face like many of my smoking friends and I will swear it&#x27;s because I have been using this lotion on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about C-15 is that you rarely find it stocked on the store shelf, and I have always had to special order their product from my pharmasist.  But now I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon.com for about the same price (if not less) than what I had been paying and I don&#x27;t have the hassle of phoning, confirming and driving to and from my pharmacy!</li>
    <li> I have been using Complex 15 face cream for over thirty years and it is a wonderful moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;Can not say enough about it. Just great!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since the 80&#x27;s when I went through a couple of rounds of Acutane treatments, which dries up the top layer of your skin and makes it flake off. (I know, sounds gross. It was, but it worked). My doctor recommended it, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. Even now, in my 50&#x27;s when I really should be using something richer, it&#x27;s the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I use it on my face, neck, and decolletage every morning and night.</li>
    <li> My mom has been using this face cream forever. She loves it because it&#x27;s water based and very light. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. It&#x27;s cooling and soothing to the sensitive skin of the face. I&#x27;ve ordered it for her from Amazon the last 3 times she stocked up. The delivery was timely and in great condition.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001EJOPXE Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Face Cream - 2.5 oz (Pack of 3)]]    Before trying this product, I developed facial rashes when using any aftershave containing fragrance.  Complex 15 soothes my skin after shaving and has not caused a rash with years of daily use.  Each tube of cream lasts me about two months, since only a small dab is needed.  I could not rate this product more highly.</li>
    <li> I have used Complex 15 Moisturizing Face Cream for many years.  It is a very light cream that is immediately absorbed.  It is much less expensive than many other moisturizing creams and, in my opinion, as good or better.  I have often recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> The fact that it is water-based and has no oil is why I buy it. Oily moisturizers make my face breakout - anywhere else on my body they&#x27;re ok.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using expensive face creams until complex 15 was introduced to me.  It&#x27;s fabulous.....my whole family uses it..male &amp; female,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe I will buy it again.  They raised the price to much</li>
    <li> Happy with the order. Price was very good. All was well done. Would buy from them again in a New York minute.</li>
    <li> Is a very light moisturizer, I use after shaving and before bed. No smell goes on easy and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I love this facial moisturizer.  My face gets so dry in the winter that it is very painful.  This product really makes my face feel better, never makes me break out and never stings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using complex 15 for many, many years.  Use to be able to but it at stores, now only on internet.  It&#x27;s an amazing product, not greasy at all, contains phospholipids which maintains a moisture balance.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I like this. It&#x27;s clean feeling and scent neutral. I&#x27;m not the most cosmetically savvy man in the universe, but I know enough that I should keep my face from drying up. This does that, and does it without feeling greasy or without an obtrusive fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a great &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; though, I could stand to be getting more for my money. However that may just be my inexperience with the price points for these kinds of products talking. Still, I liked it enough to re-order at least once.</li>
    <li> i THINK THAT AIR HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO THE TUBE AND THE QUANTITY THAT SHOULD BE THERE ISN&#x27;T.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and found it very effective, easy to carry in travel, and not costly</li>
    <li> I have used this product loyally for over 20 years. Started using it as a teenager on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation. It is so light, non greasy, will not clog pores, yet still very effective as a moisturizer. Perfect for anyone, but especially those with acne or sensitive skin. The price on this 3 pack is an incredible value compared to what I used to pay at the local drugstore. Would never consider using anything else.</li>
    <li> This product is not to heavy and is very gentle on extremely sensitive skin.  Now that I&#x27;ve found it, I plan on using it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I struggled with a huge acne breakout. It was terrible. One of those ones that leaves you not wanting to leave the house. One of those ones that adds at least ten extra minutes to your makeup routine just for cover up, and even then you are self conscious. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. I won&#x27;t be switching anytime soon. I use this with CeraVe Foaming Face Cleanser and before I apply this, I use a mixture of organic apple cider vinegar with water (half and half) as a toner. Acne is GONE. Nothing. And my face is healing fast. I finally feel confident enough to wear nothing but a tinted BB cream outside. I buy these in the three pack.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a very long time. Price and the 3 pack was an excellent value.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected however I&#x27;m pleased and use the 3 tubes then I can give  your a better evaluation .</li>
    <li> I have a rare skin &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; and this is the only face cream that does not aggravate it. It is light, but really moisturizes. I am sorry it is not sold in stores anymore. If they did some advertising, I am sure more people would fall in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I got it so fast. I am very happy with the service of the seller.</li>
    <li> Complex 15 is gentle, moisturizing and is fabulous for my skin.  I apply it after bathing each morning on my face and also before bedtime at night (after washing my face).  My only &#x27;con&#x27; is that this product is very difficult to find at local stores.</li>
    <li> I use this around the house when I&#x27;m not going anywhere but I want a really light cream. This is the stuff!</li>
    <li> Have used complex 15 for years...fabulous.  Having difficulty finding it to purchase.  Happy to find it through Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for many years,am sorry to find sourse very limited, and price tripeled!!!  ,Ii am complimented on my complexion often</li>
    <li> My dermatoligist recomended this product and I like it. It doesnt have antiaging properties so if you are looking for more that hidration you should use other things. Also if you like thicker texture this is very light, but i like light creams specially for the summer. I was using cerave before and that one was too thick.&lt;br /&gt;This one i can apply below make up and suncreen and works great</li>
    <li> I bought this because I developed an allergy to the moisturizer I was using.  It is very light, works well under makeup, and keeps on working throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, oily, acne-prone, hypoallergenic skin and this is the only moisturizer that suits my skin. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, cause breakouts, or excessive oiliness. I recommend this to everyone and those who have tried it are hooked. It&#x27;s really helpful for those with acne; my dermatologist had recommended it to me. My friend&#x27;s acne cleared up after she started using this moisturizer with a face wash.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. It dries quickly and it&#x27;s very moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and was not able to use moisturizer on my face until my dermatologist told me about Complex 15. I can&#x27;t even tell it is on but if I don&#x27;t use it my skin hurts like dry leaves.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on amazon and found this product is really on a high rated level. But for me, it is just not that outstanding. A little oil and feel sticky.. not very clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Soaks into the skin completely with no greasy feeling. I have very dry and sensitive skin and have no more flaking since using it. It has not irritated my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a daily user for the past 30 years and it is the BEST product on the market&lt;br /&gt;for dry skin.  It is easy to use and gets absorbed immediately without any greasy&lt;br /&gt;feeling.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends and my own daughter uses it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot understand why it is no longer available anywhere except at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Many drug stores carried it for 25+ yrs but now it&#x27;s been removed from the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thankful I was able to purchase it thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now! I have very sensitive skin , especially on my face . Due to an allergic reaction to some plastic eye glass frames years ago. This cream is the only one that works for me and believe me I have tried many over the last 20 years. It also keeps my rosy cheeks under control. I love it and do not want to use anything else. As I said before , it works for me!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Complex 15 for about 14 years now and it is the best face lotion on the market. It is very thin and great for year round use. A staple in my daily routine!</li>
    <li> Everything written about this product is true: it is light, moisturizes, does not clog pores, is fragrance free, and lasts a long time.  I waited to write this post until I had a chance to try it. It is amazing. My skin always feels soft and hydrated. But, the big BONUS is that it seems to smooth out fine lines on my face and flatten those little bumps and imperfections in your skin due to age. I have never had any other product do this even the more expensive brands I used to buy.  I credit the Amazon community for sharing this product info with me. I am a forever customer.</li>
    <li> I have used for 35 years and love the product.  It is ridiculous that it went from 7.99 ( 3 for 23.99 at Amazon) to 56.99 (3 for 179.99) in 4 months.  This must be a mistake.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist years ago and I use it every day. Very good for fair skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years. For me it is the best.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  What happened to it?  Seems to be no longer available?  Where is it next plentiful?  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best,  Ella</li>
    <li> I am 78 years old and my face is still smooth and unwrinkled.  I have been uing Complex 15 for 40 years and would never be without it!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.</li>
    <li> Was as advertised and come in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Ever since my dermatologist recommended this face cream years ago, I haven&#x27;t been able to use anything else.  It is so light, my skin soaks it in without feeling heavy or greasy.  Most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. This item isn&#x27;t carried in my local drug stores any more, so I&#x27;m really grateful I can buy it online.  This is THE BEST face cream, especially if you have sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to breakouts.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has very sensitive skin and is a swimmer.  Chlorine stays in the skin and other moisturizers would burn her sensitive skin.  If she put nothing on, it would be extremely dry and red.  Complex 15 has been a miracle -- she can put it on her skin following swim and it adds enough moisture to keep it from being overly dry while not causing any burning or stinging, even on her eyelids.  I highly recommend to swimmers and those with very sensitive skin.  This moisturizer is not at all greasy and performs well under make-up.  It is light, so you might need to use it more than once daily in the winter.  For us, it has been the only thing that did not cause irritation in combination with swimming in chlorinated pools.</li>
    <li> Been using this product since the late 90&#x27;s….love it!</li>
    <li> Pharmacist recommended this product for irritated facial skin resulting from an allergic reaction to facial product....it worked very well, was gentle and nonirritating</li>
    <li> I have perioral dematitis and mild roseaca and this is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found. Skin is soft and protected even in cold weather but no flare ups. Great value. Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I have combination, acne-prone skin and this is the only moisturizer that does  not irritate my skin.  It does not make my skin greasy, oiling, shiny, etc.  This product will leave your skin absolutely beautiful.  I never liked moisturizer in the past because of all the negative reactions it had on my skin.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone, with any skin type - YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  However, this price increase is ridiculous!  I believe most people who use this product started to use it because of its original price point, and not just the rave reviews.  Many people don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on their beauty products and like to keep things simple.  I hope the company reconsiders its inflated price adjustment and consider the good the product has done for its customers for decades.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, but it is no longer being made by the Merck Pharmaceutical company.  I still see it being sold on line at outrageous prices.  I have used it for 30 years and all my family also used it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good. I really like it and I will buy it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;I reccommend for people who dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Complex 15 for MANY years and just love it.  Cannot be without it.  I am allergic to so many cosmetics, etc.  I wash my face with Yardley Lavender soap and then use this complex 15.  I am 80 years old and have VERY nice skin without hardly any wrinkles.  Everyone wants to know what my secret is.    For some reason I find Complex 15 is hard to get at any of our local stores.  When I found it through Amazon I was very happy and will continue to buy it there.</li>
    <li> Delivery and product was excellent.</li>
    <li> Since I have rosacea my skin tends to be somewhat sensitive to most products.  I started using this product over 10 years ago after it was recommended to me by a dermatologist. I will never use anything else.  Ever.  It is light, soothing, non-greasy, and moisturizes and helps heal without that heavy quality.  My only regret - it is getting harder to find!</li>
    <li> CHEAP crap. may as well just apply water on your face because that&#x27;s what the consistency is!</li>
    <li> Best non pore clogging moisturizer that a dr prescribed for me 25 years ago!!! Was not available on the open market then.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My friend gave me a tube when she bought the 3-pack. Finished that and bought 3 for myself. Ive been recommending it to friends and my sister bc i like it so much. It doesnt break me out, its perfect for my combination skin under make up. I need to layer up to 3 layers when iface is dry, but im not complaining. Awesome price, not changing my moisturizer for awhile ♡♡</li>
    <li> During the winter months in Boston it can get pretty dry. I&#x27;ve gone through many facial creams and could not find one that properly hydrated my skin. This stuff is magnificent. I don&#x27;t feel that pull on my skin when i smile anymore - feels like normal humid summer face! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is really good for my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin and i think it would be good for any other type as well.  It sinks in nicely and leaves skin feeling hydrated.  I really like this.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream but the prices since are outrageous since it is being &amp;#34;discontinued.&amp;#34;  I found it online from a Canadian retailer for about $10 a tube.  The packaging is updated but the ingredients are listed on the website and identical.  I know I can&#x27;t post the other website but just Google-search &amp;#34;Complex 15 Canada&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll find it.  I have an image of the new packaging here.  I copied/pasted the ingredient list from the site too: check it, it is the same:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water/ Eau, Caprylic/ Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, PEG-40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Gylcol Stearate, Myristyl Myristate, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Diazolidinyl Urea, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, C10-30 Cholesterol / Lanosterol Esters, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It is effective, light weight and a good value.&lt;br /&gt;A dermatologist recommended it. The doctor was right !</li>
    <li> I have the dryest forhead ever mostly in the winter it gets so bad it just flakes off like snow it was discusting and embarasing i have tryed tons of different brands even had stuff doctor prescribed nothing worked.... well I used this twice and I look like I have new skin I am just amazed going to stock up on this !!!</li>
    <li> Like some many other reviewers of this product, Complex 15 was recommended to me by a dermatolgist back in the early 1990&#x27;s.  I have used this product for approximately 23 years!  That&#x27;s a testimony for ya...I had some major surgery at that time and ended up with a severe allergic reaction to some internally injected medicine, which resulted in an extreme case of hives on my face that were super itchy!!!  After I recovered from this reaction, which took several months, my dermatologist recommended this product for its non-comedogenic properties. It has worked beautifully for me, and I have rec&#x27;d numerous compliments on the appearance of my skin while in my 20&#x27;s, 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s.  I am having difficultly locating this at Walgreen&#x27;s and CVS recently.  Even Wal-Mart and Target doesn&#x27;t carry it.  So, I was over-joyed when I found that it is available on Amazon.  THANK YOU AMAZON!! I hope you will continue to make this available!  I have also have tried some very expensive lines, like the L&#x27;Occitane Divine line.  It is nice too, but is also extremely expensive, like $300 for the complete line.  So needless to say this definitely fits my budget, and works just as well if not better!  If you are considering purchasing this, by all means give it a try.  You are sure to be pleased with this purchase.  A very small amount covers the skin thoroughly and it is quickly absorbed.  You can apply your makeup over it in about 1 minute.  Make up appliation is very smooth over this facial mosturizer.  Five stars all the way!!</li>
    <li> just same as other cheap product. Nothing special about it. Used it once and will not buy them again. expected better with good review.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best facial mousturizer I have ever used.  I have been buying it for over 20 years.  It is fragrance free, oil free and very moisturizing.  I have sensitive skin with mild rosacea and would recommend this to anyone, but especially to those with my issues .</li>
    <li> I thought I would never find a replacement for my favorite moisturizer when it was discontinued. I have combination skin which is prone to breakouts, so finding a moisturizer that was lightweight, so as not to block my pores, and yet effective enough to prevent dry flaky skin is a challenge. This cream has stepped up in all these areas. It&#x27;s a fraction of the price of the brand I used to purchase, although I tend to use more of this because it is slightly lighter. I have purchased several times since I found it and am very happy!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend.  I ordered it for myself and have been using it about a month.  I love the purity of this product, and that it is completely non-greasy.  I also love the reasonable price!  I have four sisters and two sisters-in-law and have purchased a tube for each of them as well and hope they become fans too.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff... I just wish it has SPF!  Absorbs super quickly... but you have to add SPF on your own.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face cream because it&#x27;s light, clean and oil free adding water to the skin, it has a bit of urea and it&#x27;s very basic so there is no mistake, no fragrance and a bit of urea, the ingredients are all ok in terns of toxicity. I myself add some of my own stuff to it and it becomes marvelous in the end.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my face for the past 5 years. It has been the only facial cream that I can depend on daily to supply moisture to my face without breaking out. It&#x27;s noncomedegenic, hypoallergenic, and fragrance-free. It&#x27;s perfect for my extremely-sensitive, acne-prone skin. The consistency is perfect, absorbs quickly, and is light. I remember buying this so cheaply at CVS for less than $10, then they discontinued carrying the product. Thank goodness for Amazon, where I was able to buy a pack of 3 for less than $20. But now, this current price of $50 is breaking my college budget. I wish they would manufacture this product again or I might just have to find a cheaper alternative. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and sister, and they use them everyday. Very cheap and they last a lot. It was recomended by their doctor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years. If you want your face to look fresh and moist don&#x27;t hesitate to try this.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s perfect in any weather condition. I&#x27;m an esthetician, so I&#x27;ve tried everything.. this is hands down the best.</li>
    <li> My &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; dermatologist recommended this for my face at least 20 plus years ago.  Many new creams have hit the shelves since then but none holds a candle to this one for keeping a soft skin which remains moist.  I can also use it around my eyes without tearing.  I use it under other more &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; sounding creams that have an SPF in them.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream!!! My mom has enjoyed the hand/body lotion for many many years, after it was recommended to her by a dermatologist. When I found the face  cream version of Complex 15, I had to try it for my sensitive, sometimes dry, sometimes normal, somtimes acne prone hormonal skin. I am 44 years old. It was perfect! It balances my skin out, calms it and doen&#x27;t have extra irritants in it that can irritate a sometimes tempramental complexion. I bought extra of these (9 tubes) and shared them with my 75 year old mom, as well as to my fourteen year old  daughter. We all love it. My mom had no idea that Complex 15 made a version of their wonderful cream for your face. I am so grateful to find it here on Amazon! Thanks you very much!!!</li>
    <li> Many years ago my dermatologist subscribed Complex 15 while he had me on a medication for acne that dried my skin terribly.  Complex 15 is non-greasy, does not cause acne like some moisturizers do, and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> My mom at 81 swears by this stuff</li>
    <li> This product, along with Basis soap completely cured my problem when it was misdiagnosed by my dermatologist.  And in a very short time.  I love it, that it is reasonably priced and works so well.  It helps with different skin problems  I have experienced.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my son as he loves the product, but is a student so cost is usually outside his budget.  Was perfect as had three tubes for very reasonable price (half what others were selling it for) and company delivered within the promised time.</li>
    <li> Great product and at a fair price!</li>
    <li> This facial moisturizer was recommended to me by a skin care professional. I had a reaction to some medication and my face was covered in dry skin flakes. This moisturizer is non allergenic and worked very quickly to bring my skin back to normal. I have continued to use it daily. It&#x27;s great for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, buy the big bottles as it&#x27;s much cheaper!  Good moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t leave our faces greasy like most others.</li>
    <li> I have been using Complex 15 face cream for 20 years. It is better than the expensivie face creams sold at department stores. A dermatologist recommended it and it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years. When it was taken out of the stores I was quite upset. I was very happy to find it on line. This is the 3rd time I have ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping of this product was even quicker than they said.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is very nongreasy and it seems to straight into my skin very quickly. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic reduction in wrinkles but it does feel good going on and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 20 yrs. I am sad to find the company has stopped production</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist- great product and price!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and sadly must report that it has been discontinued!  Perhaps that is why it is selling at such a ridiculous price.  I had NEVER paid more than $7.00 for it in any pharmacy!  Outrageous!</li>
    <li> I cannot use any products with perfumes - it is so refreshing to find a product that I can use on my face that does not have added perfumes</li>
    <li> I had used Lancôme products for years and always got compliments on my skin. However, about two years ago I developed acne Rosacea along with seborrhea and had to stop using Lancôme. Complex 15 is all I use now. It is amazing that it is so inexpensive. I can apply it throughout the day if necessary and don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wasting money. It is light and absorbs well into my skin. My mother had told me about Complex 15 for years (her dermotologist recommended it - mine never heard of it) but I was hooked on the expensive stuff.  I still use Lancôme eye cream but am very satisfied with Complex 15 for my face.  I am 59 years old with a very fair complexion.</li>
    <li> This product has just what my skin needs.  I have been using it for many years with complete satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Best Moisturizer I have ever tried, ( recommended by my Dermatologist.), as it does not merely &#x27;oil up&#x27; or cover the skin w/ a greasy coating. One can feel this Moisturizer being absorbed into the skin, leaving little, to no trace of any ineffective oils or emollients mainly because I believe this product contains a complex which, unlike so many others, hydrates the skin by way of the only true way to accomplish this,...with water.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot find this product as easily as the other, less effective brands.&lt;br /&gt;KEEP STOCKING THIS SUPERIOR PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturiIng cream</li>
    <li> I really love this cream, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried lots of different face products.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like anything special when you apply it, but it absorbs quickly and is sufficient for the day or night.  I have very dry and sensitive skin and am not young anymore, and this cream is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, from the cheap to the expensive. Unlike much more expensive creams, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and light, but not dry or irritated. I can even put it near my eyes, something I&#x27;ve never been able to do with any other face cream.  Love it, and will be using it exclusively from now on.</li>
    <li> Love this face lotion!  It&#x27;s light, not greasy and very moisturizing.  Perfect for nighttime or daytime with or without sunscreen.</li>
    <li> wow...what a shock. The price gouging on this is appalling. The original price on this item at a Walgreens/cvs caremark/Wal-Mart was between $8 to $15 it&#x27;s facial skin cream and nothing more. I been buying it since like 1999 or 2000. the manufacturer discontinued the line for some reason...probably slow sales cause it was mediocre at best....but I liked it cause it was not greasy.  I have found Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel-cream For Normal/Combo Skin, 1.7 Fluid Ounce, and it&#x27;s absolutely WONDERFUL!!!  It costs like $6.79; just in the same price range as the complex so....Please try that and in my opinion, you will be very happy and pleased with the results and the way it feels ....  This old product was good, but please try something else and move on ........DON&amp;#34;T give these leeches a penny for this old discontinued product...it was good, but not what they are trying to scalp it off for.</li>
    <li> This is really good moisturizer.  It does the job without ever feeling greasy.  Too bad it seems like they&#x27;re not going to be making it any more.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer I&#x27;ve been searching for my entire life. I finally have my skin under control with the acne.org benzoyl peroxide &amp; this! I buy it in bulk because I can&#x27;t find it in stores and I dread the day I can&#x27;t get it anymore! Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this stuff it&#x27;s perfection for sensitive skin :)</li>
    <li> I used this great lotion for over 15 years. But now, with the recent obscene price increases, and elimination of the 8 oz. size, I will find a different lotion. Within the following year, I suspect that the makers of Complex 15 will learn that their huge and sudden price increases was a very poor business decision.</li>
    <li> Great face cream!  Very hard to find in stores!</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer!  Feels great under makeup as well&#x27;</li>
    <li> am completely satisfied except for the cost</li>
    <li> My wife love this product and has used it for over 15 years.  The price with amazon is cheaper than buying it at the retail store and very convenience to order on line.</li>
    <li> Have used this wonderful product for over 30  years.  Why the huge price increase suddenly?!!  So disappointing...will no longer be purchasing  it.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product...I&#x27;m not sure why it has become so difficult to find.I&#x27;ve used it daily for over 20 years and just recently had problems replenishing my supply. This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found. Shering-Plough, please bring it back!</li>
    <li> One of the best face cream.  Dermatologists recommend it, easy on the skin, feels great and gives the moisture I need.</li>
    <li> great for out of a shower on face.  not greasy, no oil in this one, does not agrivate acne !</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and my dermatologist recommended this product over 20 years ago.  I have been using it since then.  Have tried other moisturizers but found them heavy in texture and uncomfortable on my skin.  I always return to Complex 15.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice.  I live in AZ and its not to heavy with the Arizona heat.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any dry spots or make my face feel oily/heavy.  I used to buy those expensive moisturizers ($30-$50) I prefer this over those overpriced moisturizers. Great price also.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer...the only one I use because of my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Um, what happened to the price?!?! I purchased a 3 pack about 1.5 years ago, and it was $18.47. Now it&#x27;s $36.99? Seriously? I&#x27;m sorry, but there&#x27;s absolutely no justification for doubling the price. Severely disappointed in amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I use this product for everything.  From my face to my feet.  The first time I used it I felt like my face absorbed the lotion.  It is wonderful and I recommend it strongly.</li>
    <li> Light, non-greasy face moisturizer, goes on smoothly, sinks in easily. Although I use a heavier moisturizer at night, this has been my daytime choice for many years. The 4 star rating is an average of 5 stars during the day and 3 at night. It does not contain a sunscreen, so you would need to apply that separately when spending time outdoors.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it does not irritate my senistive skin like other creams.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream since 1970.  I would recommend the cream for anyone with a delicate, senistive face.</li>
    <li> Light non greasy lotion for your face. Using for over 10 years and still love it! Wish it had SPF in it but I won&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
    <li> I am so sad to see this product disappear, but I want to let others know that the Canadian version does not appear to be the same. It is OIL FREE. I ordered several bottles when this product was discontinued, and my skin is much drier now than when I used the original Complex 15.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 20 years.  Sadly, I can&#x27;t afford the EXORBITANT price any more. Are you kidding me? I can&#x27;t believe thagt a 2.5 ounce tube costs $50, I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer but there&#x27;s no way I will pay $50.00 for something that used to be under $20.00.  They must be phasing it out.  Figures that when you find something that you like they either change it or discontinue it.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> Too bad after so many years this is being discontinued.  Another great product the victim of corporate greed.</li>
    <li> Love the product and it will always be part of my daily facial care routine.</li>
    <li> Excellent to use before applying primer.</li>
    <li> Best face cream ever.  Can&#x27;t believe they stopped making and selling in U.S. market.  Crazy.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my sister swears by it.  It smells good and feels nice and light on your skin. :)</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different creams - some expensive and some not. I love this cream and have decided to just stick with this one and not try any more. I was so happy to find it on Amazon because I can no longer find it in the stores. The closest I came was to getting the body lotion at a local hospital pharmacy - great I can now get the face cream from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the face cream for 30 years (since I was teenager).  It was recommended to me by my dermatologist at the time and talk about an excellent recommendation!  I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s gentle and light on my face.  I started using the body lotion about 5 years ago for the same reasons (sensitive skin, light, not heavy on my skin).  I was literally panicked when I saw prices going up and then found out that they were both being discontinued.  CRAZY--why would they do that with such an amazing product? And with so many long time users, what a testament to this product!  There is literally nothing else like it on the market.  I think it&#x27;s a big mistake to discontinue in the US (go Canada!)</li>
    <li> Not irritating or oily, leaving my skin soft and smooth. Might not be moisturising enough for the winter dry weather.</li>
    <li> No fault of the product, I just cannot use it for my face. I have Rosacea issues and the application of this moisturizer enhances the redness and slightly stings. So, I am just using it as a light hand cream.</li>
    <li> It does what is claimed. My daughter who is a swimmer, but does not like heavy products, likes this one a lot.</li>
    <li> I finished 2 bottles of complex 15 and this is one of the only 2 moisturizer I use (the other is CeraVe PM just to alternate). This gives your skin enough moisture without other nasty stuff. I found the best deal on amazon just $6 something for the moisturizer that really works...I can&#x27;t give it any less than 5 stars.</li>
</ol>
