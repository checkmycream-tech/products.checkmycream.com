### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>A very excellent product.</li>
      <li>This comb is excellent for three days.  </li>
      <li>He is very happy with them.</li>
      <li>But they are unbreakable which is a very good thing.</li>
      <li>A superior product!</li>
      <li>I am a happy girl.  </li>
      <li>Found them here on Amazon at a fair price.</li>
      <li>I guess they&#x27;re gone for good now.</li>
      <li>The conair combs, in this regard, are a superior product.  </li>
      <li>ACE needs help with this product, it use to be a good product</li>
      <li>Since I can&#x27;t get a GOOD comb, I&#x27;m not going to spend good money on a crappy comb.</li>
      <li>If anyone would like a superior quality comb, I would suggest a \\&quot;Kent\\&quot; or a \\&quot;Speert\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Go to any store and you can find cheap plastic combs as good as these.</li>
      <li>Have to agree with many others.</li>
      <li>I will continue to look for a better quality comb.</li>
      <li>Whe was well pleased.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve carried Ace combs most of my life.  </li>
      <li>My favorite.  </li>
      <li>Its better than the cheap combs sold in stores that are plastic.</li>
      <li>This comb scratches the scalp and easily breaks in your pocket.</li>
      <li>The teeth bend easily in your pocket and remain bent.  </li>
      <li>These are cheap plastic combs.  </li>
      <li>This is the chinese version of what was once a great produce.</li>
      <li>Just cheap plastic combs.</li>
      <li>The Conair plastic combs are also made in China but have smooth teeth, so if you need a cheap pocket comb buy Conair and forget Ace</li>
      <li>Consumers actually care about the quality more than the price!!</li>
      <li>The perfect comb with the exception they are no longer truly \\&quot;hard rubber\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I got these for my husband, who is very fond of Ace combs and cannot find them in our area any more.  </li>
      <li>What used to be a good quality hard rubber comb is now nothing more than a cheap Chinese-made plastic wannabe.  </li>
      <li>This is made out of cheap plastic and Goody&#x27;s business practices are exactly what consumers are complaining about - cheapening products in order to keep profit margins up.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and the service was fantastic.</li>
      <li>They have all changed over to a lesser quality comb which breaks very easily.</li>
      <li>I prefer an all fine hard rubber comb and was delighted to find these.</li>
      <li>I would gladly pay twice as much for the old comb ...</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t pull hair, and left hair very smooth.  </li>
      <li>Goody actually makes better combs under it&#x27;s Goody brand than these it makes under the ACE brand.</li>
      <li>I gave this 3 stars because they&#x27;re still a cut above the too-small, too-pliant, unbreakable plastic men&#x27;s combs that dominate drugstore shelves, but most stores also have one or to kinds of nicer plastic, Chinese-made combs in stock.</li>
      <li>I guess they&#x27;ll be defunct pretty soon, as there is plenty of competition out there.</li>
      <li>If you need first aid after using a product</li>
      <li>Good comb but not as heavy duty as I wanted.</li>
      <li>Purchased for a man who wants the right tool for every job.  </li>
      <li>If you buy an Ace comb, be sure to run it over a fine emory board a few times to take the pin-points of the teeth.</li>
      <li>Pure junk.</li>
      <li>Good combs like these are hard to find.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a nice hard rubber comb with smooth edges, I got cheap plastic that was rough on the scalp.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the prompt service.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
      <li>I am not going to even bother to return them,but instead throw them away, and hope that I can purchase real ones elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Thank you for the fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>The only thing you can do is get out some sandpaper and sand the ends of the teeth to try to smooth them out so they don&#x27;t cut your scalp.  </li>
      <li>I guess Ace found a cheap way to make combs and has chosen to drive the company into the ground while milking some profit off of its former reputation.</li>
      <li>guess the whole world is now &amp;#34;buyer beware&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I noticed about a year ago that the teeth have become sharp and the rubber is more brittle.</li>
      <li>The teeth are not polished and will unpleasantly sharp on most folks&#x27; scalps.</li>
      <li>The teeth are sharp and scratch the scalp, and they break too easily.  </li>
      <li>The comb is plastic and not hard rubber like advertised.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll go get one of those other crappy combs cheap.</li>
      <li>This product has is wide enough for full head of hair, sturdy enough to remove tangles and flexible enough that the long teeth do not break off as do many cheap combs.  </li>
      <li>Cheaply made comb with sharp teeth.</li>
      <li>The new ace combs are junk.</li>
      <li>These new Ace combs are not unbreakable and are made of plastic.</li>
      <li>For decades Ace made hard rubber combs that had nice smooth teeth and lasted a long time, even after being sat on in the back pocket of a guy&#x27;s jeans.</li>
      <li>Like the Ace pocket combs of 50 years ago: very soft on the scalp,</li>
      <li>NOT the old Ace combs per what I have been reading</li>
      <li>That being said they appear to be sturdy like the old models</li>
      <li>This is not only very plastic feeling</li>
      <li>I naturally decided to replace it with another.  </li>
      <li>After barely two weeks in a back pocket one end broke off and after a few more days the teeth are bending into unusable shapes.  </li>
      <li>this is not the old high quality hard rubber pocket comb originally sold by ACE that made its reputation.</li>
      <li>I would have been willing to pay a little more to cover reasonable increased manufacturing costs, but alas, the manufacturing of these combs was moved to China.</li>
      <li>looks like the old hard rubber one, but as everyone else says, its just cheap plastic that breaks within a day or 2!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be very careful at first.</li>
      <li>Advertised as hard rubber combs, these are just cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>I have been using these combs for many years, and recently they have been hard to find in our local retail outlets.</li>
      <li>Ace combs are now hard plastic crap&#x27;anese, and I&#x27;m sure a chemical analysis of the plastic would indicate a great deal of lead as well.</li>
      <li>This is not the same Ace combs of old.</li>
      <li>It comes with literature providing a written statement that these are the original ace hard rubber combs.  </li>
      <li>Nothing like the original ACE hard rubber comb.</li>
      <li>The only pocket comb is the Genuine Ace Hard rubber comb.  </li>

<li> I gave it two stars only because I have been unable to find another fine tooth comb without sharp pointed teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I&#x27;d give them a zero or minus one star if I could.</li>
<li> As other posts have noted, this is not the Ace hard rubber unbreakable comb of old.  </li>
<li> Has sharp tines.</li>
<li> , their traditional combs are no more.</li>
<li> I have to agree with the other 1 star ratings.</li>
<li> and I was greatly disappointed to find that these combs are not sold as hard rubber combs but a cheap plastic knockoff made in China!!</li>
<li> My Ace hard rubber pocket comb has been a valued possession for several decades.</li>
<li> These are not the same Ace unbreakable hard rubber combs I carried for over 50 years.</li>
<li> The teeth are very sharp and cut your scalp.</li>
<li> Could have bought a plastic comb for less money but wanted rubber.  </li>
<li> Now they are outsourced to China with predictable results.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Not the same as the old style combs of years past, but stuff has to be changed in manufacturing at some point in time. That being said they appear to be sturdy like the old models, I shall let you know if and when one bites the dust...</li>
    <li> Just cheap plastic combs. The teeth are not polished and will unpleasantly sharp on most folks&#x27; scalps. If you buy an Ace comb, be sure to run it over a fine emory board a few times to take the pin-points of the teeth. The conair combs, in this regard, are a superior product.  Unfortunately, Ace no longer manufactures the hard rubber UNBREAKABLE COMB. The Ace brand belongs now to Goody Products, Inc., which, in turn is part of Newell Rubbermaid. Goody produces plastic hair combs and brushes. Go to any store and you can find cheap plastic combs as good as these. Goody actually makes better combs under it&#x27;s Goody brand than these it makes under the ACE brand. The teeth bend easily in your pocket and remain bent.  Just not what anyone would want in a pocket comb.</li>
    <li> I have used this comb for decades.  The perfect comb with the exception they are no longer truly \\&quot;hard rubber\\&quot;, at least not like they used to be.  Ends always break which is frustrating but it is still my desired comb.  You just have to know if you carry it in your back pocket, the ends are gonna break!</li>
    <li> ACE needs help with this product, it use to be a good product but it has made a turn downward. Can&#x27;t carry this pocket comb in your pocket with out it breaking.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a man who wants the right tool for every job.  The only pocket comb is the Genuine Ace Hard rubber comb.  It comes with literature providing a written statement that these are the original ace hard rubber combs.  Whe was well pleased.  I am a happy girl.  Thank you for the fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Whatever happened to product integrity ?  NOT the old Ace combs per what I have been reading&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the whole world is now &amp;#34;buyer beware&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair is doing the same thing as Ace (cheapening their product)</li>
    <li> Good combs like these are hard to find.</li>
    <li> My Ace hard rubber pocket comb has been a valued possession for several decades. I would have been willing to pay a little more to cover reasonable increased manufacturing costs, but alas, the manufacturing of these combs was moved to China. Ace combs are now hard plastic crap&#x27;anese, and I&#x27;m sure a chemical analysis of the plastic would indicate a great deal of lead as well. Well, \\&quot;Ace\\&quot; my friend, your greed has caused you to poop in your nest. I will never again purchase your \\&quot;junk\\&quot;. If anyone would like a superior quality comb, I would suggest a \\&quot;Kent\\&quot; or a \\&quot;Speert\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Not the hard rubber I was expecting. Has sharp tines. It will scratch your head. Be very careful at first.</li>
    <li> This comb is excellent for three days.  One end broke off the fourth day and teeth began bending and breaking soon after.</li>
    <li> Just the ticket! Exactly what I wanted and the service was fantastic. Rec&#x27;d the items within 6 days of ordering. Thanks for the prompt service. This is how ordering over the net should work all the time.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible comb.  It very definitely isn&#x27;t the same as the old Ace hard rubber comb.  The worst thing is that the teeth of the comb are VERY sharp and will scalp you!  The only thing you can do is get out some sandpaper and sand the ends of the teeth to try to smooth them out so they don&#x27;t cut your scalp.  DON&#x27;T buy this.</li>
    <li> I had looked in vain for this comb in drug stores. I prefer an all fine hard rubber comb and was delighted to find these.</li>
    <li> I got these for my husband, who is very fond of Ace combs and cannot find them in our area any more.  He is very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ACE 5&amp;#34; hard rubber combs for the past 40 years and I was greatly disappointed to find that these combs are not sold as hard rubber combs but a cheap plastic knockoff made in China!! I am not going to even bother to return them,but instead throw them away, and hope that I can purchase real ones elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Have to agree with many others. Should have 0 stars. The new ace combs are junk. Mine broke within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give them a zero or minus one star if I could. These are not the same Ace unbreakable hard rubber combs I carried for over 50 years. These combs bend and break in a matter of days. The teeth are very sharp and cut your scalp. I&#x27;ll never buy another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve carried Ace combs most of my life.  So having lost my last Ace I naturally decided to replace it with another.  What a disappointment.  What used to be a good quality hard rubber comb is now nothing more than a cheap Chinese-made plastic wannabe.  The teeth are sharp and scratch the scalp, and they break too easily.  Yet another once-fine product now lost to the god of cost-cutting.</li>
    <li> Pocket combs, what can you say, they do their job.  Nothing fancy, just keeps your hair from looking like you just woke up if you use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Ace combs now for over 20 years. I noticed about a year ago that the teeth have become sharp and the rubber is more brittle. The company seems to have changed the manufacturing process. This is not the same Ace combs of old. I can no longer use it. I&#x27;m writing this review in the hope that the company will realize that their customers aren&#x27;t stupid and hopefully they&#x27;ll go back to the old manufacturing process.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb and it fits in your pocket. &amp;#34;Not&amp;#34; the Ace comb of the past. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> How disappointing! I&#x27;ve always preferred ACE&#x27;s American-made, hard rubber combs, and just about the only place left where I could find them was online. I guess they&#x27;re gone for good now. The combs I received were made in China, and are made of brittle plastic that has already started breaking. The teeth also have sharper ends than the hard rubber ACE combs used to have, the easier to scratch the scalp with, I suppose. I gave this 3 stars because they&#x27;re still a cut above the too-small, too-pliant, unbreakable plastic men&#x27;s combs that dominate drugstore shelves, but most stores also have one or to kinds of nicer plastic, Chinese-made combs in stock. There&#x27;s no longer any reason for me to hold out for ACE and order these online.</li>
    <li> Good comb but not as heavy duty as I wanted.</li>
    <li> This product has is wide enough for full head of hair, sturdy enough to remove tangles and flexible enough that the long teeth do not break off as do many cheap combs.  A very excellent product.</li>
    <li> I was suckered by the &amp;#34;Ace&amp;#34; name! Wow, is this ever a bad comb! Hard and brittle, and it hurts my scalp! I guess Ace found a cheap way to make combs and has chosen to drive the company into the ground while milking some profit off of its former reputation. I guess they&#x27;ll be defunct pretty soon, as there is plenty of competition out there.</li>
    <li> My favorite.  Have used these ACE combs for years.  Unable to locate them locally anymore.  Found them here on Amazon at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I remember when Ace pocket combs were thicker.  These are thin plastic.  But they are unbreakable which is a very good thing.</li>
    <li> As other posts have noted, this is not the Ace hard rubber unbreakable comb of old.  After barely two weeks in a back pocket one end broke off and after a few more days the teeth are bending into unusable shapes.  I gave it two stars only because I have been unable to find another fine tooth comb without sharp pointed teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has found a durable pocket comb, please reply.</li>
    <li> I have been using these combs for many years, and recently they have been hard to find in our local retail outlets. They have all changed over to a lesser quality comb which breaks very easily. These hard rubber combs are of the same high quality as always, and withstand the rough and tumble of carrying in the pocket. A superior product!</li>
    <li> These combs are not as durable as the &amp;#34;hard rubber&amp;#34; combs that Ace used to make.  They do, however, have the same equally-spaced teeth the entire length of the comb, which is what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Made in China junk -- flimsy, plastic, uncomfortable.  Nothing like the original ACE hard rubber comb.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Terrible product&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the old hard rubber one, but as everyone else says, its just cheap plastic that breaks within a day or 2!&lt;br /&gt;Absolute;y awful.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor owns at least part of this responsibility since they are selling this crap and creating ill-will.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a nice hard rubber comb with smooth edges, I got cheap plastic that was rough on the scalp.</li>
    <li> This is the chinese version of what was once a great produce. Don&#x27;t buy these unless you like a lacerated scalp.</li>
    <li> Advertised as hard rubber combs, these are just cheap plastic. I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> For years I carried Ace unbreakable pocket combs and would buy nothing else. These new Ace combs are not unbreakable and are made of plastic. The teeth have sharp points and I have had several incidents where my head was bleeding from cuts caused by the teeth. If I could, I would give these products zero stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I repeat...DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> These combs were awful, terrible, harmful, and a total discredit to what used to be the good name of ACE in the comb market. The ends of the teeth were so sharp they tore at my scalp, then the teeth would bend and not straighten back out. Let me say again, AWFUL.</li>
    <li> For decades Ace made hard rubber combs that had nice smooth teeth and lasted a long time, even after being sat on in the back pocket of a guy&#x27;s jeans. Now they are outsourced to China with predictable results. The package says hard rubber but I don&#x27;t believe it. This is not only very plastic feeling but the teeth are viciously sharp and gave me bloody scratches on the crown of the head where my hair has thinned. If you need first aid after using a product it&#x27;s no bargain. The Conair plastic combs are also made in China but have smooth teeth, so if you need a cheap pocket comb buy Conair and forget Ace, their traditional combs are no more.</li>
    <li> These are not the same as the old hard rubber combs.  These are cheap plastic combs.  The teeth break, they bend and they scratch your head.  I even had one of the teeth jamb into my finger and the tip broke off leaving part of the tooth embedded in my skin.  Pure junk.</li>
    <li> this is not the old high quality hard rubber pocket comb originally sold by ACE that made its reputation. Its better than the cheap combs sold in stores that are plastic. I will continue to look for a better quality comb.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS COMB if you&#x27;re expecting anything like the old Ace Hard Rubber comb. This is made out of cheap plastic and Goody&#x27;s business practices are exactly what consumers are complaining about - cheapening products in order to keep profit margins up. A pox on you Goodys! This comb scratches the scalp and easily breaks in your pocket. I would gladly pay twice as much for the old comb ... ya hear that Goodys? Consumers actually care about the quality more than the price!! (It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;value&amp;#34;.) I&#x27;m getting my money back. Since I can&#x27;t get a GOOD comb, I&#x27;m not going to spend good money on a crappy comb. I&#x27;ll go get one of those other crappy combs cheap.</li>
    <li> The comb is plastic and not hard rubber like advertised.  Could have bought a plastic comb for less money but wanted rubber.  Would not deal with this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a narrower thicker softer-toothed Ace rubber comb.  Like the Ace pocket combs of 50 years ago: very soft on the scalp, didn&#x27;t pull hair, and left hair very smooth.  I always &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; my father&#x27;s comb.  I&#x27;m still looking...</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other 1 star ratings. Cheaply made comb with sharp teeth. Ace used to be the go to for combs but quality is just no longer there. Avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Combs are not as flexble as indicated.  hdhdhd  dhdhdh  jksdaklsea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cd f b h n&lt;br /&gt;a x s d f</li>
