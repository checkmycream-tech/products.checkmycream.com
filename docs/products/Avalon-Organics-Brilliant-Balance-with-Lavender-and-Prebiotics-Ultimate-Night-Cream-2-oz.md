      <li>Great moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light, gets absorbed quickly, very nice fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The thickness of the product is thicker/heavier than I thought it would be, but feels amazing on my skin at night.  </li>
      <li>Salicylic acid free way to manage oil and ance with great night time moisture.</li>
      <li>However, after a couple days when my skin got accustomed to the product I will not lie, it was amazing.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s great in the summer, it&#x27;s so light and no irritations or breakouts.</li>
      <li>It feel nice going on, but don&#x27;t have the capacity to do the job.</li>
      <li>I am not exaggerating, this is really the best to me.</li>
      <li>I love almost everything by this company and it is always good to know that their products are organic.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice too.</li>
      <li>I like the smell- nice and calming before bed.  </li>

      <li>Also just a very light lavender scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and not greesy on your face at all.</li>

      <li>Love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>

      <li>will buy again for sure.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why some others don&#x27;t like it, but I love it.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be without using argan oil, organic hyaluronic acid serum, and this excellent night cream in my facial regimen!</li>
      <li>I love this cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year.  </li>
      <li>Maybe this would make a better hand cream than night cream.</li>
      <li>When I woke up, I showered, washed my face again and once more put on the cream.</li>
      <li>so many products make my skin feel a burning sensation, but not this one.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, helps me sleep at night.</li>
      <li>and although the smell was wonderful, it did not hydrate nearly enough for me.</li>
      <li>I love this cream.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for some more improvements on my complexion but frankly speaking</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Now I use it as my night hand cream:)</li>
      <li>I love this night cream.</li>
      <li>I note the company does not say what becomes \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot;.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My jar was not made in China (like a previous reviewer said) and I was having dry skin on my forehead that wouldn&#x27;t respond to ANYTHING except this.  I use this day and night and it feels great and goes great under my mineral make up.  Very pleased with this product and will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Supreme moisture from this product.  Great for my almost 60 very sensitive skin.  I use it for a facial moisturizer. Light enough to wear under makeup.   Soft lavender smell.   terrific product. will buy again for sure. great affordable price.</li>
    <li> I started using Avalon&#x27;s Biotin shampoo and was so impressed with what it did for my hair that I thought I would try  their skin care.  I have back and forth with many products, Dept store to Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s, to you name it.  Happy to say that I am in love with this product for my skin.  I am a mother of twin toddlers, skin, hair changed after hormone changes and I have had quite a difficult time trying to find what would suit my skin.  My skin is now normal/dry, when it used to be oily/combination.  I have had quite a few breakouts but I think that had to do with products I was trying and that it irritatd my skin.  I have the crows lines, and a few lines on my forehead.  I used both the eye serum and face moiture cream and it goes on so easy, very light and very moisturizing.  I noticed that my face is no longer dry, not oily, just perfect to where is should be.  Skin does get tight as advertised, but not in a way where your face is burning or dry.  Just taught.    Pleasant fragrance of essential oil Lavender. Light, not overbearing.  After using for a week, my face no longer has break outs, feels soft and appears brighter.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> for some reason my skin doesn&#x27;t love this product as much as I thought it would. This cream smells heavenly, the ingredients are good, but it did nothing for my dry patches, and I couldn&#x27;t use it in the morning (too sticky). I love the brand, especially the cleanser in the same line, but this is a little bit of a let-down. I&#x27;ll finish it but will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years.  It&#x27;s gives great moisture without clogging pores.  I use it morning and night in the winter and then add their daily moisture for mornings in the summer.</li>
    <li> Deeply moisturizing. Smells and feels wonderful.  I love almost everything by this company and it is always good to know that their products are organic.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisterizer. It&#x27;s very light and not greesy on your face at all. It works instantly on dry skin. I love the smell, and the fact that it&#x27;s Organic!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because of the high Amazon rating and was very impressed. What a great product for my face. I absolutely love it. My skin looks like never before: very smooth and silky. I used to have allergy break out but since I start using this cream (3 month ago) I haven&#x27;t had any. I recently bought other Avalon lavender products (cleansing milk, toner and day moisturizer). I never expected such a great result! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it is truly lightweight. This lotion does not make my skin break out, does not make it greasy, it just makes it nourished and youthful. I think that this is better than any other expensive lotion I tried. It feels a little bit like the Clinique gel lotion, (the yellow gel from the three step cleaning set), but it hydrates even more, and it goes much better under make up. I am not exaggerating, this is really the best to me. I find it at some drugstores too, but on amazon is slightly cheaper. Also, consider that it does not contain harmful ingredients like the other brands.</li>
    <li> Great product. My sensitive/combination skin is much happier (less redness/acne) with this moisturizer than with many others I&#x27;ve tried. I am planning on sticking with this moisturizer for a long time... so many products make my skin feel a burning sensation, but not this one. Very pleasant scent (lavender) and smooth feel as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Avalon Organics are a much better product line than Alba (owned by the same company) - they&#x27;re organic &amp; natural skincare products at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I wanted to go organic so I was checking all the organic lines and decided to give this a try.     Now warning, first few times it stung and really irritated my skin.  Not sure which ingredient but I will avoid stuff with lavender in it in case this might by the culprit.      However, after a couple days when my skin got accustomed to the product I will not lie, it was amazing.  The redness from my scars were gone and get this, a deep wrinkle that  I had actually filled out.  It did not go completely but it was almost completely gone!  No surgery nothing!  Even though I want, I will try another of their product and hope i get the same results.      Jus hope i dont get the initial burning again.  But for those who dont have any irritation issues, try it!</li>
    <li> This cream is light and non oily. It smells like an open lavender field and also it is very good for moisturization. The cream is simply divine and beautiful, using it makes your skin very pretty...Will order again when I am out</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetology student, and currently am learning skin care. We use a high-end salon line of facial products at my school. With my dry skin, I tried everything we had. I switched cleansers, I did moisturizing masks, I exfoliated. Nothing was helping.  I read some great reviews about this Lavender Ultimate Moisture cream and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  OMG, I am a believer! I washed my face before bed, put the cream on, and then went to sleep. When I woke up, I showered, washed my face again and once more put on the cream. When I got to school, before I could even sit down and take out my homework, my teacher came up to me and said \\&quot;Ok, you have to tell me what you did. Your skin looks amazing\\&quot; she asked \\&quot;can I touch your skin?\\&quot; and then told me it was the most moisturized and soft my skin has ever been (or at least as long as she&#x27;s been my skincare teacher). She also asked me to write down what product it was because she had to get some. I said \\&quot;oh sure, I&#x27;ll do it later\\&quot; and she said \\&quot;No, do it now, I don&#x27;t want you to forget, I just can&#x27;t believe how good your skin looks\\&quot;.  My skincare teacher said I looked radiant, moisturized and that my skin looked less red and less irritated. This is coming from a woman who has been a professional esthetician for over 20 years! Later in the day, another esthetician instructor stopped me in the hall to ask me what moisturizer I was using, she said it was a huge difference from how my skin has been looking, and was surprised to find out it was Avalon Organics. After she researched it she came back to tell me how impressed she was by their list of ingredients.  Since my skin is so dry, I use this as a day and night cream. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> After reviewing all of the five star reviews, I was very excited to try this face lotion. I started using it as soon as I received it. After two days, my face started breaking out. I figured that it was the lotion getting all of the impurities out of my skin, so I continued using it for two weeks. All it did was give me constant painful acne (I haven&#x27;t had acne in ten years) and very dry skin. Perhaps this is meant for certain skin types... Just not mine.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and my face especially dries out quickly. I&#x27;m also very sensitive to chemicals and perfumes so I stay away from a lot of scented lotions, especially for my face. But I liked that there were so many natural ingredients in this moisturizer and the scent was very pleasant and more natural rather than harsh and chemically or fake. Usually one&#x27;s skin has to adapt to a new lotion and you may have a small breakout the first couple times while you adjust but I&#x27;ve never had a blemish from this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it now for over a year and won&#x27;t use anything else. This works as a night cream, an under makeup cream, and just a daily moisturizer. Very light and the scent picks me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s not cheap and it&#x27;s not easy to find in stores but I dread it ever being discontinued because I have yet to find another natural lotion that isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy and actually works like this does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fragrance is very nice and light, it&#x27;s organic, and it WORKS on even the driest skin!  Need to order a larger jar!</li>
    <li> This is a very moisturizing cream that nourishes the skin.  It has an excellent, smooth texture.  I used it as a night cream during the winter and it was wonderfully soothing to my dry skin.  I also used it after a mild sunburn and it was very healing. The lavender essential oil makes it smell heavenly. The only downside is that it caused flushing to my skin which lasted a long time, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for daytime use.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light, gets absorbed quickly, very nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Environmental Working Group gives it a moderate hazard rating.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for an organic cream, the company that makes it (Hain Celestial Group) has full member status in the Compact for Safe Cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;I started looking into all the chemicals that get into cosmetics and I hope more women will! We should buy products based on ingredients, not advertisement!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now, it&#x27;s great in the summer, it&#x27;s so light and no irritations or breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 100% positive that is a very amazing product but the service is horrible I&#x27;m still waiting for them to send it out is been 6 days since I order it and still they haven&#x27;t send anything.  I cannot believe someone cannot do their job right and send something out is not like is something that takes critical thinking.  Horrible service</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good cream for normal skin, but it lacks enough moisture for dry skin, like mine ( during winter).</li>
    <li> Just started using it this week and am amazed by how quickly my skin is moisturized.  I turned 50 this year and my skin is becoming more dry; Aveeno wasn&#x27;t making a difference, but this really does!  I even appreciate the added hint of Lavender, which is actually good for relaxation.  I&#x27;m a believer; just ordered the daytime moisturizer with SPF!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is light, not oily.  It goes on smooth as i use it under my make up.  I also like that the ingredients are natural and does not contain parabens.  The only downside is that while the smell of lavender is wonderful, the scent of this cream is so so strong.  After a while u get used to it but the first few times its very overwhelming to the senses.  So be prepared for that if you get it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this cream and I&#x27;m not understanding the good reviews. Maybe mine is from a defective batch or it somehow went bad. Because of the great reviews, I&#x27;m going to exchange for another jar and give it one more try. I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll have good things to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar I have smells like the \\&quot;scrubbing bubbles\\&quot; bathroom cleaner, not like lavender. I was afraid to put it on my face at first, but after reading the ingredients I felt my nose must have been tricking me. I began to break out about 4 days into using this on my face. I decided to test my chest and neck next and they broke out too. The breakouts kept up until I had stopped using this product for a few days. Maybe my skin was getting rid of junk that needed to come out of the pores. I can&#x27;t really say, but I can say it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my usual Avalon cream, breaking out was never an issue. I&#x27;m going to go back to that one for now and recommend it to anyone with combination skin [[ASIN:B000QFCQCO Avalon Organics CoQ10 Wrinkle Defense Night Creme, 1.75-Ounce Bottle]] . The Wrinkle Defense Night Creme is expensive, but one little pump covers my face and upper neck area if slightly damp.</li>
    <li> I bought this mosturizer based on other customer reviews and I was not disappointed.  I was looking for a natural cream free of harmful chemicals at a reasonable price.  This one fit the bill and it smells awesome to boot!</li>
    <li> If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I have used this brand for years with great success, but THIS ITEM IS FAKE. Within 30 seconds of application,my face was burning and bright red. I checked the ingredients against my old container and found many in the new one, such as Squalane and various toxic acids that are NOT listed on the amazon page OR on the real product&#x27;s website. Will be returning this Asap. Awful rip-off. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Well I thought the product would be much bigger cause the box picture just makes me thing its huge. Guess I should of known 2oz is not much. The smell of the product I like, it smells like a field of flowers. Now I haven&#x27;t seen anything different with my skin I&#x27;m not sure if my skin was already soft or what but I still like the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the lavender toner that goes with it. Wonderful combination and great on my skin. As I stated in the toner review, it does the same for my skin as my spa products and does relax me just a bit. I can&#x27;t threaten my husband with it anymore, though, since he&#x27;s no longer allergic to lavender. :P</li>
    <li> I have finally found my moisturizer for life! I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month now and noticed a difference the first day I used it. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and I have combination/oily skin and have tried countless expensive moisturizers (if they sell it at Sephora, I&#x27;ve tried it) for after work/night time wear and love this one. One of my friends at work has amazingly bright, smooth skin and she told me she&#x27;s used this moisturizer since she was 18 so of course I had to try it. It&#x27;s organic and it does not make my face greasy. I put it on at night and in the morning, my skin is soft and smooth. It&#x27;s weird but I first tried the daytime moisturizer with the same brand but didn&#x27;t like it as much because it made my face greasy. The ultimate moisture cream doesn&#x27;t have an SPF but it&#x27;s ok because I love my Elta SPF 46 that I use during the day. I love this moisturizer so much I&#x27;m buying one for my mom and sister to use. At under $20 for such a great product, I really recommend this one. Hope they never change this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed because the formula has changed. It is now called lavender \\&quot;Luminosity\\&quot; night cream. It has a sticker that says \\&quot;NEW more sustainable\\&quot; on the box. I don&#x27;t know if the product has become better or worse, because it&#x27;s my first time buying it. I specifically bought this product due to its near 5 star reviews, so I&#x27;m sad that I don&#x27;t get to try out the original product everyone was raving about. As for this new formula, the scent is mildly pleasing, and it moisturizes my skin well. Takes a while to sink in. Lavender might burn your skin a little at first. I wish the formula didn&#x27;t change. It&#x27;s unwise for any company to change a perfect product that&#x27;s loved so much. Chances are high they will not make it better, but worse.</li>
    <li> I have combination type of skin and my face gets really dry during winter time, so I need rich cream for the winter. A friend of mine got this lavender cream for me from Japan and it worked so well that I was convinced that it was the lavender that did the wonder to my skin. After finishing that cream, I started looking for other lavender products on Amazon and found this one which fit my budget at the time. I remember the first time when I applied it to my skin, there was a tiny bit of \\&quot;burning\\&quot; feel but it went away very quickly. Throughout the winter, I used it every day. It kept my face moisturized for the entire day and it also didn&#x27;t feel too thick or anything. I was hoping for some more improvements on my complexion but frankly speaking I was sleep deprived most of the time during the usage of this cream, so I really shouldn&#x27;t blame the cream. I will consider purchasing it again for this coming winter.</li>
    <li> I have combination and sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s been hard to find a skin product for me.  Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for a cream to use for both during the day and night.  I have tried this one for a week and am absolutely in love with this.  When I put it on, it feels light and refreshing with a light lavender and fresh mint scent. After a while the scent wears off and you&#x27;ll barely notice it&#x27;s there.    It has the perfect amount of moisturizer so my face feels hydrated and I don&#x27;t need to constantly reapply nor wiping oil off my face.  I have not found any other product fits my skin so well and I&#x27;ll stick with this one for a while!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer! I have super dry and sensitive skin, and this is the only cream I have found to finally moisturize my skin sufficiently! It&#x27;s rich and thick, so if you have oilier skin, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. I&#x27;m in love with lavender for my skin. I also use Kiss My Face lavender lotion for during the day in the warmer months, because it is light and soaks right in. During the winter, though, I like the Avalon lavender daily moisturizer instead, because my skin is drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true that when it comes the package says &amp;#34;Lavender Luminosity,&amp;#34; and some ppl are upset that this is a new formula. Well, i dont know what the old formula was like, but I haven&#x27;t had anything but great results with this one. Some ppl said this made them break out, and that surprises me, because I have had the opposite results! This moisturizer has actually cleared and calmed my skin - it&#x27;s the lavender essential oils. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different I suppose, but for me this is a 5 star product!</li>
    <li> This cream is exceptionally high quality for a comparatively low price. The lavender oil in it its extremely therapeutic, and has a divine scent, which is also relaxing. I found that it is very soothing for sensitive skin, like mine, since I am sometimes allergic to face cream ingredients. Lavender oil not only has a gorgeous scent, but, helps skin heal. I absolutely love this product, and the very reasonable price makes it a win-win.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It keeps my easily irritated sensitive skin soft, moisturized and supple. I look radiant and refreshed. I like it as much as some of the $100 creams I&#x27;ve tried at Sephora, but instead of chemicals, it&#x27;s all good organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has transformed my itchy, dry, fine-lined winter skin. I don&#x27;t know why, but a week after I began using this product, my skin tone became more even, lines began fading, and--most importantly--my face feels great. I was so impressed that I emailed the company, too.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great and is absorbed competely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light lavender scent..not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are what I wanted.  And it seems to do it&#x27;s intended job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again and suggest to a friend if asked.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my wife.  After using it for about 2 weeks, she asked me to rate this product as 5-star.  My wife has sensitive skin, so she has to use baby lotion for many years.  This cream contains 70% natural ingredients and works really well for her skin. She said that she could actually feel this cream working.  She also likes the lavender aroma, not strong but just right.</li>
    <li> I love the brand and this product in particular. The smell is very pleasant and not overwhelming like some other brands. It works very well on the sensitive skin - leaves it nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a gentle and hydrated night cream and I like about its natural ingredients; but its way too oily than all of my other moisturizers. I think it&#x27;s good for dry skin but not for combination/oily skin. Now I use it as my night hand cream:)</li>
    <li> as you know lavender is very healing. this organic cream smells lovely and it is worth it! try it for yourself!</li>
    <li> This is great for before bet not greasy at all but very moisturizing its great I love and use a lot of their products they seem to care about them and put a lot of thought into them. I am extremely allergic to practically the entire planet but have no trouble with this cream!</li>
    <li> Seems like a fairly decent moisturizer. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> The smell is like an angry factory worker set the fragrance to \\&quot; STINKY LEMON BUTTER CRAB DIP\\&quot; . Was able to return to amazon. UPS pick up is awesome.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that either breaks out or dries out. I needed a moisturizer for my face and neck. So I decided to try the Avalon Organics Lavender skin care line. This is a wonderful product. It moisturizes and fine lines disappear. It is gentle on your skin, so it is perfect for people with sensitive skin. I have really noticed a difference using this product. Also just a very light lavender scent. Perfect for anyone who is looking for an organic product that helps minimize fine lines.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. Have been using this for over 2 years. It is thick, creaming, all natural, and makes my skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Love it!  Perfect to use when pregnant or breast feeding.  Salicylic acid free way to manage oil and ance with great night time moisture.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It feels good on my skin and smells so wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than a year.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use it every night. It&#x27;s important to give your skin these ingredients to help rejuvenate it overnight. Plus the lavender it calming before bed.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel. I use it every night.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin and I normally do not have any negative reaction to skin products.  However, this product, which is labelled as &amp;#34;hypo-allergenic for sensitive skin&amp;#34;, caused me to have a negative reaction.  I applied it to my face around bedtime and my skin immediately started burning painfully.  After a couple of minutes I looked in the mirror and my face had become a splotchy red. I washed off the lotion and the burning/redness went away. The cream also has an unpleasant smell (I normally love anything lavender-scented).</li>
    <li> It worked like all creams I have used  It feel nice going on, but don&#x27;t have the capacity to do the job.</li>
    <li> I like the smell- nice and calming before bed.  I find it to be a good thickness.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to it, even though my skin is a bit sensitive.  I bought it hoping it would really help out my complexion. It&#x27;s a little soon to tell, but I can at least imagine it&#x27;s having good results already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m just sorry it took me this long to try it!  I have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to the stuff that beauty product manufacturers usually use in moisturizers, and this lotion has never caused any sort of bad reaction at all.  It also does a nice job of diminishing redness and smoothing fine lines.  I am completely addicted to it and will never use anything else on my face.</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful smell to it and does not make you greasy. Not as moisturizing as it could be. I use it as  a day cream. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for over a year now, after I began to notice some little \\&quot;smile wrinkles\\&quot; around my mouth, consequences of being in my 30s. I&#x27;m also breakout-prone, which means I needed something that would both hydrate my skin to prevent new wrinkles but not be too oily/greasy and make me break out. This little tub of miracle substance from Avalon has saved my beauty routine! It&#x27;s absolutely perfect. My skin has never looked or felt better, soft and smooth and that lavender extract even reduces redness around my nose. It creates a great velvety texture under makeup too. I&#x27;ve started buying this in bulk, because I ran out once and had to use the old oil-free Neutrogena moisturizer for a week (which was such a contrast, my skin went dull). Also I will mention that the little lines around my mouth have now disappeared after using Avalon Organics.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend this product higher, it&#x27;s wonderful! I hope the company never changes the formula or discontinues it ... because we love it exactly as it is, and I&#x27;ll be a loyal customer for life with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years. I love the way my skin feels!</li>
    <li> I use this day, night, all the time.  It smells wonderful, works as promised and I would (will) purchase again as soon as I run out.  My sister enjoys this product and is also going to order a second time.  I do notice a difference.  Could I pass for 25?  Nah.  However, I still dance in the mirror and sing my lungs out in the car, only stopping when I hit a red light.  Buy this!</li>
    <li> It is thick and moisturizes well. However, something was causing an allergic reaction. Every time I used it, my face was burning, so I had to stop. My friend tried it too and had the same problem.</li>
    <li> THEN: I used Avalon Organics Ultimate Moisture cream for over 10 years.  It is the only product that really moisturized my skin here in the Rocky Mountains with nearly 350 days a year of unrelenting sunshine and wind at 8,000 feet above sea level. The original cream was a lovely and rich (without being heavy) cream that gave my skin a remarkable and noticeable glow often commented on by others.  Fine lines were kept at bay, my face was never shiny or dry. Due to our extremely dry climate I would use approximately two 2 oz. containers a month. When I traveled to hot and tropical climates the amazing effect was an actual lessening of oiliness.  I am at times prone to breakouts and this product never caused any.  I would keep some in my purse to apply under my eyes once or twice during the day, and the effect was always a brightening lift of any appearance of fatigue, youth in a jar. No other cream (including several quite expensive ones) had ever been so remarkable.  It was a quick to soak in, frothy souffle of intense moisture but with a feather light feel on the skin.  I run out of adjectives trying to describe how perfect this cream was.  I never broke out and my face felt and looked dewy and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW:  The name and formula have both changed.  If you purchase from this page you will be receiving \\&quot;Lavender Luminosity\\&quot; night cream instead.  When I went to make a recent online purchase I saw more than one review of the product stating that if you had previously enjoyed this product to now beware.  The new formula was an entirely different product and had suffered at the hand of the new \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot;  formula.  I note the company does not say what becomes \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot;.  I am inclined to believe it has more to to with their cash flow and less to do with the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found a store I could test the new formula.  I left without making a purchase because I found both the daily moisturizer and the night moisturizer, completely different products from their former selves.  If this were an improvement I would have undoubtedly purchased in bulk.  I am afraid I find both new products extremely, in a word, horrible. And it would be a gross waste of my money to purchase either one. I will also add he product turned my face dangerously red and stung like an angry hornet. A unique an unpleasant sensation no other product before or after has managed to produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbeknownst to me my mother did purchase both the daily moisturizer and the Ultimate Moisture night cream (based on my rave reviews to her of the previous formula), which she gave me (since she didn&#x27;t like it anyway).  Braving a potentially hostile skin reaction, I wore the daily moisturizer for two days, and each day it felt like such a relief to wash my face.  It leaves a completely unnatural \\&quot;mask\\&quot; like layer on top of the skin without actually sinking in or moisturizing in any way.  It feels like a layer of plastic saran wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it not possible, but the night cream was even worse.  It reminded me of some margarine I purchased during an extended stay in a third-world country once.  I tried to melt it in a skillet and it never melted, even at very hot temperatures.  It would never spread with any fluidity, nor would it soak in to any food item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lament the new night cream feels just as cheap and ineffectually formulated as third-world margarine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have never written to a company to express my disappointment until now.  I wrote Avalon Organics to express to them my disillusionment with their new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; product. They have chosen not to reply or acknowledge my letter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is with a heavy heart that I find I must change my decade long and loyal romance with Avalon Organics to someone else.  I am currently trying a bevy of products one after the other in my quest.  None are as perfect as the one solitary jar I have left of the  original formula \\&quot;Ultimate Moisture Cream\\&quot;.  Good title that one, \\&quot;ultimate\\&quot; is absolutely right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a user of the late lamented Ultimate Night cream and have found any product that compares favorably please let me know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this line for about 5 years after transitioning from uber-expensive Yonka products (which I also love). This is a very efffective night cream. I am in mid-50&#x27;s and have formerly very oily, acne-prone skin, but my skin is changing and this keeps it nice and hydrated. Wonderful lavender fragrance. I also use Avalon&#x27;s cleansers (CoQ10 and Vitamin C Hydrating Cleansing Milk) and the Luminosity daily moisturizer. Can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.</li>
    <li> Avalon Organics: Lavender Ultimate Moisture Night Cream, 2 oz. If you like lavender, than this can be your modest treasure that you will love and be thankful for. I love the smell of Lavender at night, and this one is just right, not too heavy, or oily, but if if you are more on the oily side do use a face wash in the morning. The smell of lavender is soothing and light. It did make my skin smooth, but I was not looking for any special benefits, just moisturize and aroma, and I got it, love all the Avalon lavender products!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin (even as an adult) and was looking for a restorative night cream to moisturize and help heal my breakouts. The first time I used it, I woke up to shockingly different skin. Even the next day, my face was soft, hydrated, and many of my breakouts were healing. I wanted to try this cream before investing anymore money into the rest of the lavender luminosity line. Although at first I had a slight burning sensation on my skin (I have quite sensitive skin) I placed a cool, damp towel on it and it relieved the burning quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time and have now been using it for nearly two weeks. This Lavender Luminosity is wonderful. It moisturizes my face beautifully; it never feels dry. It leaves it SO soft and the smell is amazing. I don&#x27;t know why some others don&#x27;t like it, but I love it. I don&#x27;t like a night cream that sinks right in immediately and leaves my skin feeling like there&#x27;s nothing on it. My skin is incredibly soft with this on it at night .. and the following morning. I found my new favorite night cream!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this cream several times and I use it as a night cream. The smell is very mild and calming and my skin seems ok. Of course I also like that it&#x27;s organic and not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, arrived in good shape on time!</li>
    <li> I AM IN LOVE! I have always been picky about moisturizers as I have VERY sensitive skin and can break out in contact dermatitis around my eyelids. I bought this stuff on a whim at a local Kroger, and I can&#x27;t believe how wonderfully it works. First of all, it&#x27;s super soothing like I can feel the lavender in it. It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing, especially for my dry skin, and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t break me out in the least, allergy- or acne-wise. Another great thing about it is that it gives me that dewy glow that is so beautiful and &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; right now. I use it in the morning with only concealer over spots (no foundation) and my skin looks great. This is my holy grail moisturizer - beautiful, soothing, safe, and organic!</li>
    <li> I have used this moisturizer for a couple years now. The formula change hasn&#x27;t bothered me. This moisturizer has not caused me any breakouts or skin irritations. I will keep using this as long as they keep making it. I haven&#x27;t found another facial cream/moisturizer that I like better. I love the lavender smell. Avalon organics moisturizers keep my skin hydrated and feeling soft even in the winter months. In the summer I use their Vitamin C moisturizer, it&#x27;s just a bit lighter.</li>
    <li> Maybe this would make a better hand cream than night cream. The scent is eye-wateringly strong, and the stuff really gloops on thickly. I used it for about 3 weeks, and then it started to irritate my skin (to be fair, my skin seems to be very sensitive). Avalon makes good products, but I&#x27;m not a fan of this one.</li>
    <li> I love this for reducing inflammation, my skin is extremely sensitive. Be careful though, as they have changed the ingredients in many of their products this year.  Their face wash now has shea butter and I can no longer use it.</li>
    <li> The person I bought it for said it was just fine. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</li>
    <li> I have been buying Alavlon Organics lavender scented Ultimate Night Cream for many years. With this order the company seem to have changed their formula. The new \\&quot;Luminisity\\&quot; cream is much thicker and greasier than the original, which was light and creamy. This cream is thick, and greasy. It does not soak into the skin.I will not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent.  It goes on nicely, is not greasy, and has kept my skin smooth durning these cold, wintery days.  I find this cream so lite that I use it as a daily moisturizer as well.  This is a product I will purchase again and again.  Priced right, delivered as promised and does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> This cream turns my face red, so I&#x27;ll have to look for something else. Bummer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading the reviews which stated that this product was appropriate for sensitive skin. I have rosacea that&#x27;s usually under control. The first night I applied this cream, I felt a bit of a tingle and noticed some redness. At the second application the next night, my skin turned bright red after just 2 minutes. Had to wash it off. Don&#x27;t know exactly what caused the irritation but I can say that the lavender smell is quite strong. Not a good fit for me, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> It was alright, it didn&#x27;t help my redness or rosacea or anything, but it&#x27;s just a basic moisture cream, eh.</li>
    <li> I use this every night.  I swear soon, my age should reverse another 10 years!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the scent is great.  The thickness of the product is thicker/heavier than I thought it would be, but feels amazing on my skin at night.  Not greasy. ( I have normal combo skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I used to use this cream for years and it was the only one that worked well on my skin. I loved it! However, since the company went under recent changes to \\&quot;update\\&quot; their products, this cream has not been the same. It has a different texture, and it burns my skin and makes it completely red. I do not have sensitive skin. I have never in my life had a reaction to a product, and I&#x27;ve used many types. I am saddened that the chemistry of this cream changed. Poor move Avalon Organics.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this night cream after reading the reviews and am totally satisfied with this product!  It&#x27;s really thick, but it soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. My skin tone has already evened out, sun spots are fading and my skin looks clearer and brighter. And I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks! I use it at night and during the day under my make up. Before using this cream, my face was pretty oily by the end of the day, but not anymore. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. Obviously, it&#x27;s not going to work for everyone, but it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. I also use the Lavender body lotion and have noticed the KP on my arms is not as bad.</li>
    <li> I have combination-type skin. This product moisturizes really well but doesn&#x27;t leave a shine.  It smells really nice too. Great for dry winters and also other seasons. But please note that it&#x27;s generally dry all year round where I live.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for almost two months and it has replenished the moisture, suppleness, and baby softness to my face.  I use it at night together with an organic hyaluronic acid serum which makes the cream go a long way using less.  My skin no longer has large dry patches, especially occurring during the winter months.  I am thrilled to have baby soft skin again.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without using argan oil, organic hyaluronic acid serum, and this excellent night cream in my facial regimen!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizing cream. It&#x27;s the best of all the ones Avalon offers. I use it every day and it not only smells good, it really hydrates your skin.</li>
    <li> I got this cream for my wife, she is so happy with it, so tender and there is a beautiful smell of lavender.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician and wanted to try a new organic line.  I have very dry skin and although the smell was wonderful, it did not hydrate nearly enough for me.</li>
    <li> This got me through the winter but I loved it so much I ordered another.  Great night cream, but I use a little in the day as well.  Love the smell, helps me sleep at night. I did (and will continue) to buy again!</li>
    <li> Very heavy not something I would buy againa</li>
    <li> This is a lovely moisturizer...nice scent and makes my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a nice night cream for dry skin. And I&#x27;ve found it to be very nice for my skin type. The only reason why it is 4* is just because I don&#x27;t really like the smell that much. It&#x27;s really strong lavender smell. However it&#x27;s not staying for that long. So for someone who really like lavender shouldn&#x27;t be a problem at all.</li>
</ol>
