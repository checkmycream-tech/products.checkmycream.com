      <li>Most importantly, this brush is good to my gums.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most gentle toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, which would be wonderful alone, but it also does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth --  better than any of the other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I was glad I could get this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE it.      </li>
      <li>And he is glad it comes in a package of 6.</li>
      <li>I always love the toothbrushes you get a the dentist when you have your teeth cleaned but can never find them at the store.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush what can I say?</li>
      <li>My Periodontist introduced me to these brushes and I love them.</li>
      <li>Will order more to keep as back-up.</li>
      <li>and I said I love it</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush...</li>
      <li>Tried many toothbrushes from drug stores and none have come close to these.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite toothbrush..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a SonicCare electric toothbrush for many years and been very happy with it, but recently forgot to bring it on a trip so picked up one of these tooth brushes.</li>
      <li>these are much better for your gums/teeth.  </li>
      <li>This is much better than an electric toothbrush for my situation.  </li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say any more.</li>
      <li>The head is compact and fits my challenging mouth.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>even if you don&#x27;t, many dentists say we should all use softer toothbrushes anyway.  </li>
      <li>I was so glad to find them on amazon.  </li>
      <li>This toothbrush is all that and more.  </li>
      <li>Regardless of how big your mouth is the compact size is the best</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m good about changing to a fresh brush to maintain my dental hygiene, but . . .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found a source online.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never used the tongue scrubber part but that doesn&#x27;t bother me, has a nice grip and it&#x27;s just really good as far as tooth rushes go.</li>
      <li>The brush is great, and is really soft as claimed.</li>
      <li>Really great if you have sensitive gums or teeth or just like a softer</li>
      <li>and I loved it so much</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable and the product arrived on time in good condition.  </li>
      <li>Its got a tongue brush and rubber pieces that seem to clean the teeth better.</li>
      <li>The rubber grip was pretty nice too.  </li>
      <li>The bristles glide across your teeth comfortably, and don&#x27;t cause discomfort on the gums (which has always been a problem for me).  </li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d describe a toothbrush as comfortable, but this one is.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not always readily available in stores</li>
      <li>First, the extra-soft bristles are great if you have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>They are a bit pricey but worth it!</li>
      <li>My dentist said the compact size toothbrushes are best because they get into the back area of the mouth and around the molars much better than bigger size toothbrush heads.  </li>
      <li>We already clean our tongue with the brush, leave the gimmicks out of it.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean and my gums don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel squeaky clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>mega clean and</li>
      <li>Told by dentist to use a extra soft toothbrush and this was perfect.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a toooothbrush; I don&#x27;t want to spend my life looking for the right toothbrush!  </li>
      <li>Better then good, soft, soft bristles.</li>
      <li>I need extra-soft and prefer the full size rather than compact.</li>
      <li>Even though I prefer the full size and this says it&#x27;s compact</li>
      <li>Nice to get exactly what you purchased and in truly new condition.  </li>
      <li>Finally, after years of searching I&#x27;ve found the perfect sensitive toothbrush that really cleans my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely order more of these!</li>
      <li>very comfortable for sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>and there I found EXACTLY what I need, QUICK,</li>
      <li>However my dentist tells me I need to use electric toothbrushes now because I&#x27;m scrubbing the enamel right off my teeth...</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive gums and a small mouth the compact size is excellent.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soft, they clean well, and I can finally acquire them on my own.</li>
      <li>I know, it may unusual to wax euphoric about a toothbrush, but this one is worth it.  </li>
      <li>will order more  latter for use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was perfect.  I wish extra soft toothbrushes weren&#x27;t so hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> My Periodontist introduced me to these brushes and I love them.</li>
    <li> Good extra soft brush if you cant use the soft ones you buy in the store.</li>
    <li> good item tooth brush is one of the better tooth brushes for dental use. will order more  latter for use.</li>
    <li> I am glad I can order the sensitive toothbrushes I can only find at my dentist&#x27;s office. They were exactly as expected and arrived quickly. These will protect your gums from being brushed too hard.</li>
    <li> These are great and are just what I had hoped based on the description. Will definitely order more of these!</li>
    <li> I am very picky about my toothbrushes. I need extra-soft and prefer the full size rather than compact. I have a hard time finding anything in the stores. My dentist gave me this one and I loved it so much I went online to find a supply of them. I change mine every 3-4 months, so I ended up buying a dozen of these. I KNOW I won&#x27;t want to use any other brush. Even though I prefer the full size and this says it&#x27;s compact, it&#x27;s not real small like some I&#x27;ve tried. Most importantly, this brush is good to my gums.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a Colgate 360 extra soft last year.  I liked the feel of the handle and the tongue cleaner...and it&#x27;s extra soft.  I looked for it in the stores for months.  No one carries extra soft tooth brushes any more.  Finally, I found these on Amazon and bought six.</li>
    <li> If you like soft bristles- this is the brush for you ! If you have sensitive gums and a small mouth the compact size is excellent.</li>
    <li> I got one as a sample from my dentist and I&#x27;m in love with it. It is very hard to find extra soft tooth brushes and also compact ones in the stores. My jaw is very narrow and my dentist tells me I need the compact kind. I&#x27;m in loooove with this tooth brush. Feels so soft on the gums yet cleans really well.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth or gums or simply prefer softer bristles, this toothbrush is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve tried others, but this one is the softest so far. Causes no irritation to gums, but does a thorough job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The handle obviously tries to be ergonomic, but I don&#x27;t think it adds to or subtracts from the basic function of being a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Really great if you have sensitive gums or teeth or just like a softer bristle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an extra soft, compact-sized toothbrush.  This toothbrush is all that and more.  It feels good in my mouth, does its job with aplomb, and feels good in my hand...  it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever wanted in a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has the softest touch/bristles yet very effective at cleaning your teeth from anything (within its price range of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used the tongue scrubber part but that doesn&#x27;t bother me, has a nice grip and it&#x27;s just really good as far as tooth rushes go.</li>
    <li> Finally, after years of searching I&#x27;ve found the perfect sensitive toothbrush that really cleans my teeth.  I have so much dental work, it was difficult to get a really good cleaning with any brush I tried, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  This is much better than an electric toothbrush for my situation.  I am so happy.  My teeth feel so clean and my gums don&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m placing another order so I don&#x27;t run out for a long time.  Thanks Colgate.</li>
    <li> At last I have found an extra soft toothbrush that even my dentist could not provide.  I have started brushing my teeth again.</li>
    <li> If you have extremely sensitive teeth this is the toothbrush for you,I&#x27;ve used it for several years now and can&#x27;t use any other brand even those for sensitive teeth or soft toothbrushes. It cleans just as well as a hard or medium brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Extra Soft tooth brushes before. This definitely isn&#x27;t Extra Soft. It feels like a medium. Try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush...my dentist turned me on to it and I&#x27;m addicted.  Leaves my teeth mega clean and the brushing is gentle on the teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Decent enough brush... one of the better ones for extra soft bristles, but the tongue and cheek cleaner is abrasive.  It catches on the sides of your mouth and the edges of your lips while you are brushing.  We already clean our tongue with the brush, leave the gimmicks out of it.</li>
    <li> I know, it may unusual to wax euphoric about a toothbrush, but this one is worth it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month - so far I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it!  It feels great, and my mouth actually does feel cleaner than with other toothbrushes.      First, the extra-soft bristles are great if you have sensitive teeth like I do - but even if you don&#x27;t, many dentists say we should all use softer toothbrushes anyway.  The bristles glide across your teeth comfortably, and don&#x27;t cause discomfort on the gums (which has always been a problem for me).  The shape of the bristles makes it easy to reach hard-to-reach places in the back of the mouth, and the bristles don&#x27;t get harder over time, the way most have for me in the past.      The tongue/cheek cleaner on the back of the head is the real surprise - it&#x27;s very effective, and so comfortable!  It&#x27;s not a rough scraper the way some are, and it doesn&#x27;t just slide across your tongue ineffectively, either.  It works great, it makes my mouth feel cleaner, and using it before going to bed (I&#x27;ve found) actually helps reduce morning breath the next day.  There&#x27;s also not as much of that yucky sticky feeling in the morning, either.      I&#x27;m kind of a picky person, so I usually find some little fault, here or there, in many things.  I&#x27;m honestly surprised to see that I haven&#x27;t found any faults in this toothbrush so far.  A five-star rating may seem a bit superfluous sometimes - but this toothbrush has earned it.</li>
    <li> I had a brush sample that my dentist gave to me and really loved it. Want to buy it but just couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere. When I saw this one I bought 12 of it immediately. They were shipped from India and indicated it is \\&quot;Only for sale in India, Nepal, Sir Lanka, Bangladesh, and Maldives\\&quot; on the case. But after I and my wife tried, we both didn&#x27;t like it. It is kind of hard and bulky. I found out later the \\&quot;Colgate 360 Degree Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft, Compact\\&quot; code is 35, not like the description at here code 34 (Compact 34). 34 is for soft, it is indicated \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; on the case that I got indeed. So the product description at here is misleading. If you have sensitive teeth like I and my wife do, don&#x27;t waste your money buy this brush. I bought another brush \\&quot;Dr. Collins Perio Toothbrush\\&quot; from somewhere else, and it is so soft and comfortable, Amazon also has it, try it and you won&#x27;t be regretted.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  However my dentist tells me I need to use electric toothbrushes now because I&#x27;m scrubbing the enamel right off my teeth...even with these extra-soft bristles.  I really am sad to see these go...they felt so good in my mouth...nice and soft and easy to get into the hard to reach places.  The rubber grip was pretty nice too.  And the tongue scraper on the back of the toothbrush head!  It&#x27;s everything all in one, and I no longer get to use it.  Let my loss be your gain.  Buy these toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 stars for this if not for the tongue cleaner bristles at the back. After a month of using, it is coming out. Looks like somebody used Elmer&#x27;s glue to attach this plastic bristle part to the back of the brush head. Poor quality. It comes off in pieces while cleaning the tongue.   The brush is great, and is really soft as claimed. I am happy with the brush though.</li>
    <li> the tooth brush package looked worn and was open on the side.  I felt it was unhygienic.  I waited around a month for delivery too.</li>
    <li> Several of the toothbrushes on the market are \\&quot;wide\\&quot; -- so wide that when brushing teeth, you spend quite a bit of time brushing your gums.  Now, you&#x27;re supposed to brush your gums too (helps prevent peridontal disease), but the bristles (even the soft ones) irritated my gums.  I even progressed to using childen&#x27;s toothbrushes as they weren&#x27;t so wide.      I found this toothbrush online and was interested as it was supposed to be a sensitive toothbrush.  I didn&#x27;t like the look of the \\&quot;rubber-looking\\&quot; circles in the center and didn&#x27;t want to buy 6 \\&quot;mistakes\\&quot; so decided against it.  I then found it in the grocery store in a single toothbrush and bought it.  I absolutely LOVE it.      It&#x27;s the most gentle toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used, which would be wonderful alone, but it also does an excellent job of cleaning my teeth --  better than any of the other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.  You don&#x27;t even notice the little \\&quot;rubberish-plastic\\&quot; circles when brushing -- feels like only bristles.  It also has a tongue and cheek brush.  Wow!  I&#x27;ve stocked up for the time in the future when this brush gets discontinued.  Just when you find something you love, it&#x27;s discontinued!  It&#x27;s on my auto-purchase list for Amazon!  Price is comparable to a little less than the price in stores locally.  I never write reviews, but was so impressed with this toothbrush I just had to!</li>
    <li> Great value for a hard to find and very expensive item in the stores.  Who knew Amazon had toothbrushes?</li>
    <li> Due to having especially long shifts at work, I decided to bring my toothbrush to work and buy a new one to use at home. I prefer a toothbrush with soft rubber panels in the bristles and this was the only one at the grocery store that had this feature. It was a bit more expensive, but what the hey, the sample patch on the package of the tongue and cheek cleaner was neat.    Wow! I never thought I&#x27;d describe a toothbrush as comfortable, but this one is. It feels amazing in the mouth. It also does a great job of brushing all around the tooth. This is without question the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. I didn&#x27;t even realize that a toothbrush could be great in the way that this toothbrush is. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve been living in a cave and suddenly someone tells me there are these things called houses.</li>
    <li> If you want to use an extra soft toothbrush, which a lot of dentists are recommending these days, then these won&#x27;t disappoint.  Good construction.  It works.</li>
    <li> This is the worst electric toothbrush.  The handle leaks water from the brush, the head comes off during brushing, and the vibration is very slow.  When you try to contact Colgate directly it is impossible to send them an email.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite toothbrush..</li>
    <li> I have to have extra soft toothbrushes for my receding gums. They&#x27;re impossible to find in the stores. I used to only find them at my dentist&#x27;s office. These are the same brand as the brushes my dentist provided, but they&#x27;re even better. I love them. They&#x27;re soft, they clean well, and I can finally acquire them on my own.</li>
    <li> One of the worst toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever had.  Very hard and too large.  I use it for a scrub brush for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a seller that shipped from India the second time -- first time it was Fulfilled by Amazon. The seller from India shipped product that was dusty and \\&quot;old\\&quot; looking. In addition, it was clearly meant for an Indian market (it had bilingual text on it) and I don&#x27;t know what type of quality control those products have when compared to the same product that is meant for a US market. On top of that, it took an extremely long time (1 month) to get this product. The US product itself is great but if the seller doesn&#x27;t have great ratings, I would recommend waiting or looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Not very soft, has stiff bristles in the center.  Made my gums bleed. Made the mistake of buying a 6-pack :-(</li>
    <li> My son has very sensitive gums and has had gum surgery....this is the only brush he will use. We love it!!</li>
    <li> After suffering a rare &amp; complicated course of cancer treatment, I ended up needing to brush frequently but with the most gentle brushes I could find, These did the trick &amp; are helping to keep me healthy.</li>
    <li> These are super hard to find.  I was so glad to find them on amazon.  They are a bit pricey but worth it!</li>
    <li> My dentist has instructed me to use only extra soft toothbrushes.  When all other brands of extra soft toothbrushes vanished from store shelves, I finally tried this one.  The bristles are fine, but I found the tongue and cheek cleaner to be a little strange at first.  Because it&#x27;s attached to the back of the toothbrush head, the inside of your cheeks are cleaned while you brush.  After a few days I got used to it, though I have no idea if there&#x27;s any benefit to it.  Were my cheeks really all that dirty before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these toothbrushes are becoming very hard to find.  When local stores stopped carrying it (there&#x27;s no place on the shelf for it now) I found it here and signed up for Subscribe and Save.  Today my S&amp;S order was canceled. I called Colgate and was told that this toothbrush has been renamed, to the [[ASIN:B005OFT14C Colgate 360 Sensitive Pro-relief Extra Soft]].  When I pointed out that renaming the toothbrush seems to have nearly doubled the price, I was told \\&quot;Yes.  Is there anything else I can help you with?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stock up now, while you can.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush because it is exactly what dentist recommend.  My dentist said the compact size toothbrushes are best because they get into the back area of the mouth and around the molars much better than bigger size toothbrush heads.  Regardless of how big your mouth is the compact size is the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I was told to only use soft bristles to brush with.  This toothbrush fits both of my dentist&#x27;s requirements for a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I need a soft bristle, sensitive, compact head toothbrush.  I&#x27;m good about changing to a fresh brush to maintain my dental hygiene, but . . . it&#x27;s not easy to find exactly the brush I want/need in drug or grocery stores.  I went to Amazon and there I found EXACTLY what I need, QUICK, NO HUNTING, no wasting time, no using the wrong brush and being dissatisfied twice a day, every day.  It&#x27;s a toooothbrush; I don&#x27;t want to spend my life looking for the right toothbrush!  THANK YOU AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Great tooth brush will order again we need more</li>
    <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, these are the best toothbrushes on the market. They&#x27;re not always readily available in stores so I&#x27;m really happy that I can get them so easily from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Received very quickly,in perfect condition. I have extra sensitive teeth and these toothbrushes are amazing, very soft, but work extremely well.  I&#x27;ve been using these for several years now and would not use anything else.</li>
    <li> much softer than Oral B&#x27;s \\&quot;extra soft.\\&quot; i can&#x27;t believe there was a time when i used to used hard brushes...what the frak was i thinking?  these are much better for your gums/teeth.  they do get firmer over time so make sure to replace your toothbrush regularly.  this is my new fave brush.</li>
    <li> Who reviews toothbrushes? I just had my in my hand and I just think its a real good brush. Its got a tongue brush and rubber pieces that seem to clean the teeth better. My wife bought this toothbrush and I said I love it and my son likes his too.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of extra soft tooth brushes but these are the best...others felt like medium soft brushes...I will always buy this brand in the future!</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive mouth and chose a soft compact tootbrush because of this.  I used this toothbrush one time and had to throw it away.  The bristles may have been extra soft, but the cheek and tongue cleaner was totally abrasive and irritated the inside of my cheeks.  There was no way to avoid it.  If I had continued to use it I would have been in real trouble.  What a silly thing to do to ruin what might otherwise have been a perfectly good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have a very hard time finding extra-soft brushes that are actually extra-soft; my last attempt - with a different product - was very unsatisfactory (as my gums unequivocally evidenced).  Even my dental hygienist is happy with the results I&#x27;m achieving (and the abrasions I&#x27;m avoiding) with these great brushes.</li>
    <li> I love having the scraper on the outside of the toothbrush. The head is compact and fits my challenging mouth. My teeth feel squeaky clean afterwards.</li>
    <li> Nowhere in the description does it say anything about colors. I was happy to have received two purple, two green and two blue toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband.  He has always had read bad teeth and very sensitive. All the local stores here don&#x27;t sell EXTRA SOFT.  He told me he was very pleased with this toothbrush.  And he is glad it comes in a package of 6.</li>
    <li> Told by dentist to use a extra soft toothbrush and this was perfect. It seems to help my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I couldn&#x27;t find them in the stores.  Anyone that has any sensitivity at all should try these.  Good Brushing!!!</li>
    <li> Our dental hygienist told me to use the extra soft bristle toothbrushes and discovered that they were very hard to find in stores.  I was very glad to find them through Amazon &#x3D; way easier. And, even though the bristles are very soft, they are holding up very well.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I always love the toothbrushes you get a the dentist when you have your teeth cleaned but can never find them at the store. I was given one of these once and found it once. I went on Amazon and they have them so I purchased a package of them and it should last me awhile. I was glad I could get this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> We have a hard time finding extra soft toothbrushes in our area and we both need this type of brush.  The price was reasonable and the product arrived on time in good condition.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Yep, that&#x27;s what they do.  I&#x27;m very picky about toothbrushes and only buy the oral-B compact soft toothbrush but I wanted to buy some in bulk and these are great. Just as good if not better than my preferred brand.</li>
    <li> Nice to get exactly what you purchased and in truly new condition.  Good price and didn&#x27;t have to search for them at the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a SonicCare electric toothbrush for many years and been very happy with it, but recently forgot to bring it on a trip so picked up one of these tooth brushes. I was very surprised to find that my teeth felt cleaner using this manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s compact so it&#x27;s made for small adult mouths. Bristles are soft and I like the tongue scraper on the back of the handle. Five stars for this product.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush deserves all the five star reviews that it&#x27;s gotten!  I happened to find it in a retail store recently, on sale (Colgate has changed the name of this model, using \\&quot;PRO\\&quot; in the new name, and priced it at around $5.00).  I bought the last 4 of the \\&quot;old\\&quot; sensitive extra soft brushes for $1.99, a real bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for around $3.00 each on Amazon, this is still the best toothbrush deal out there.  Like so many people, I have a hard time figuring out why ALL the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; and even \\&quot;soft\\&quot; brushes on the market, are not actually soft.  They all seem to use the same hard bristles, which makes no sense at all.</li>
    <li> Three Colgate products helped reduced sensitive tooth and gum problems my husband was having: Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Mousewash  + Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste + Colgate 360 Degree Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft.  He was very happy with the relief provided by using these three products together.  We highly recommend the combination.</li>
    <li> These are so much easier on my gums. I don&#x27;t know why I can never find these in any drug store. I&#x27;m so glad to have found a source online.</li>
    <li> very comfortable for sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> Better then good, soft, soft bristles. Can&#x27;t say any more. Tried many toothbrushes from drug stores and none have come close to these. Will order more to keep as back-up.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush what can I say? It works for me, I do have senstive tooth and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> CAUTION--try one of these before you buy a six-pack--not as advertised!  This toothbrush may have a very slightly shorter head than standard, but it is NOT a \\&quot;compact\\&quot; head.  The stiff longer bristles at the top also are not very soft, even if the rest of the brush is a little better. Even worse the \\&quot;tongue/cheek scraper\\&quot; is too rough on the inside of the cheek as you brush (and there&#x27;s no way to avoid it). Big waste of money for a pack of toothbrushes I have to give away.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I wanted an extra soft head and they are very hard to find in stores. The rubber things in the middle of the head have no real purpose and just make it more rough on your gums and teeth. I switched over to an Oral B soft toothbrush that didn&#x27;t have this and it was so much softer. If they just didn&#x27;t have those in the toothbrush they would be great,</li>
    <li> I love these ultra soft toothbrushes and they are very difficult to find on a regular basis at stores such as Walmart, Target, Walgreens etc, so I have gone to online ordering in bulk.  The bristles are soft so are not hard on the teeth or gums (I tend to brush hard) yet firm enough to get the job done,</li>
    <li> This is the only tooth brush my family uses. They are very hard to find at the stores so I am so happy to be able to buy them on Amazon. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have worn off the enamel off my teeth and my dentist told me that I needed to use something that is extra soft.  I tried using a natural toothbrush and have looked for all natural bristles. But I keep returning to this toothbrush.</li>
