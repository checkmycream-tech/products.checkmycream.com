<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Product, Quick Delivery !</li>
    <li> i bought this at rite aid about mid-spring on a fluke.  i was starting my fascination with fragrances.  i&#x27;ve always loved oils. they last longer, wonderfully scented, no alcohol tone, and usually cheaper.  this is my 1st and so far favorite musk scent.  white musk oil is too sharp for me, jovan musk oil isn&#x27;t bad &amp; reminds me of soapy skin, but skin musk...sweet, delicious, slightly woody, soft.  basically a cat&#x27;s purr in a bottle.  personally i think the packaging could use an update, but the product within that .5oz bottle with the cheesy label is heavenly.  the 1st time i wore this out i was wandering a store and had two random guys stop &amp; tell me that whatever i was wearing smelled &#x27;amazing&#x27;.  i&#x27;ve never tried the other products in this scent b/c so far i am utterly content with my $10 bottle of oil.  *helpful tip: if you don&#x27;t like dispensing the oil out of the bottle or want something faster, get some empty refillable roller balls, about 1/8oz works well.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely scent that last for hours.  I use it alone and I also layer spray perfumes over it.  It is a perfect feminine scent.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present and it was very much appreciated although the fragrance could have been much stronger.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite for 30 years. I work retail and am getting complimented all the time for smelling so good.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.  This is the best, fastest, and cheapest source and I am grateful.</li>
    <li> I too have been wearing skin musk for 36 years. When I run out I just don&#x27;t feel complete.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It just  doesn&#x27;t remind me of the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; musk of yesterday. But it&#x27;s still a good smelling scent for everyday.</li>
    <li> After reading all the negative reviews about how the scent has changed since the original manufactured by Bonne Bell I was leery to try this, but I love it so much and have been wearing for 25+ years, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s pretty darn close to me. I had a bottle of the original up until a couple of months ago. I don&#x27;t wear perfume much so that bottle was years old. I finally had to toss it becuase it was making my neck break out, probably because it was so old. Anyway, my point is that I remember the original scent, and this is quite close....close enough for me. I&#x27;ll continue to buy the oil. I don&#x27;t like the spray at all and never have. Smells too much like candy. The reason I give it 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original. I put it on my wrist 2 hours ago, and the smell is pretty faint already.</li>
    <li> Have worn skin for years and have always loved it.....also the price is great.</li>
    <li> I love this musk oil. It is a nice fragrance that lasts all day, and everyone seems to love the smell too, even when you can no longer smell it, other people can, and its not too strong.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this same perfume and I found it was significantly cheaper on Amazon.  Delivery was fast and shipping cost was zero.</li>
    <li> Read most of the reviews and was convinced that this was, indeed, the Skin Musk oil I&#x27;ve missed for so long. After receiving it and opening it to smell it, all I can wonder is if all the other reviewers ever actually used/smelled the ORIGINAL from Bonne Bell in the early 70&#x27;s?  If you are looking for that same scent, believe me, it is NOT in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil doesn&#x27;t have any of the subtle undertones and inviting warmth of the original. And, guess what, AMAZON DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS on this item, which I found out AFTER the fact.  The very first time I&#x27;ve ever wanted to return a product - and wouldn&#x27;t you know it, no returns on this fragrance. I have to wonder if it&#x27;s because too many people want to return it???  Don&#x27;t really understand why as the product is brand new, in the original packaging...if I had found this in a store, I could&#x27;ve opened it, smelled it, decided I didn&#x27;t like it, and just put it back on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned a lesson on this one, glad it was only an $11.00 lesson at least.</li>
    <li> The quality of this oil is horrible.  I received it less than two weeks ago.  Initially I was very pleased - the scent and strength was familiar and exactly what I expected.  Since then, fragrance has diminished considerably.  So much so that this morning as I was dabbing some on, I noticed that something was missing.  I put the entire bottle under my nose and discovered what was missing - the scent!  There was nothing.  Now I am stuck with a practically full bottle of oil that is absolutely worthless.  I am beyond disappointed.</li>
    <li> This oil I love. It brings me back to my teenage years.</li>
    <li> THE ONLY PUFUME I WEAR!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Almost as good as the original Still my fragrance 40 yars later.</li>
    <li> seems too be a good quality</li>
    <li> this product does NOT resemble Bonne Belle Skin Musk.  It is packaged exactly the same but the fragrance is not with  what I am familiar.  I am very disappointed. But am grateful that when I complained, I was credited back my payment.   AM STILL SEEKING to find Bonne Belle Skin Musk can someone guide me on where it is sold?</li>
    <li> I have used this Skin Musk for years and so happy you had it, as Walgreens, CVS don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent for years ..since the 80&#x27;s.  Reminds me of high school.</li>
    <li> I guess my sense of smell has changed.When I was younger I loved the smell but now it just doesn&#x27;t cut it</li>
    <li> This is an amazing fragrance! No alcohol.  Just an oil that lasts all day! I always get nice complements while wearing.</li>
    <li> This was for me. I love the spray but once in a while I like the oil. It is the best smell anyone can wear this. Great for young ladies or for the mature woman.</li>
    <li> Smells perfect, my mom has wore it since I was a baby, it&#x27;s the most comforting smell. It&#x27;s not a normal perfume it&#x27;s a perfect mix with your natural oils and skin the name describes it perfect .Everyone loves it no matter who is wearing it, it very natural, hope this helps!</li>
    <li> My sister loves this fragrance.  This is one of the few places that the original musk in oil form can be found.</li>
    <li> Clean smelling and will continue too use it for years. I would suggest that if u r looking for a new perfume try this.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite scent!!</li>
    <li> This skin musk stays on and lingers.  I get many comments about it&#x27;s fragrance and the price is certainly right.</li>
    <li> Excellent what else is available that stays with your skin</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for over 40 years- since the 1970s. Although not as concentrated as it used to be, I stil get compliments on the scent all the time. I just apply it a few more places on my body &amp; I am happy</li>
    <li> Happy to receive my favorite fragrance. Packaging was good as was the price.</li>
    <li> Not like the original version.</li>
    <li> The first skin oil musk that I used and did not turn funky smelling even in hospital not one pt Disliked ant is a lot in it self it stays on 6 am to midnight and no readding Worth the money</li>
    <li> My favorite to wear alone or with another perfume</li>
    <li> VERY NICE SOFT SMELL,WILL PURCHASE AGAIN,NICE FRAGANCE LAST ALL DAY&lt;br /&gt;WILL REFER TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THANKS FOR PLEASANT OIL</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY BEST KEPT SECRET!! BUT I WILL FINALLY LET IT OUT, BUY THIS !!!! YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY. USE IT ALONG WITH THE SPRAY AND WOW!!!!! YOU WONT BELIEVE YOUR NOSE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE COMMENT ON YOUR SCENT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and a great deal! I will use this forEVER!  Clearly worth the money!! Thank you so much !!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I where this Musk oil....I have worn this fragrance since I was in High School...even when you think it fragrance hasn&#x27;t lasted til the end of the day....it does! I would highly recommend this if you are a musk lover!...</li>
    <li> item smells like alcohol,does not smell like musk, very small bottle for price paid. Wild Musk Oil by Coty smells alot better unfortunately they don&#x27;t make it anymore. This smells nothing like that. Save your money.</li>
    <li> It was a fresh wonderful scent on day one the after...........&lt;br /&gt;I smelled this on my co worker for the longest time.  I loved it  !!! Fresh awesome&lt;br /&gt;finale when I ask about the scent she&#x27;s wearing, we talk about it.  She tells me cost &amp; where to get it.  I get from walgreens first, smells the same&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love !!!!!!!!!  Then The big Noooooooo !!!! Where&#x27;s the wonder scent ?&lt;br /&gt;Happens,  I didn&#x27;t tighten top before going to work in morning, came home &amp; the smell was not the same I tighten top for days pure alcohol smell.  So I order from amazon which is where she said to get in the first place got yesterday&lt;br /&gt;NOPE A DUD !  So I&#x27;m done so SAD&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN. Back to my old stand by, which I love.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a soft oil that adapts to your own unique smell.  I have been using it for years.  Continously receiving compliments. I am so glad I finally found out that I could purchase the product on line.  The product is not available at all stores.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Skin&amp;#34; musk has been around many years and still turns noses as i walk past poeople. It&#x27;s a soft, clean, breezy fragrance. Don&#x27;t shy away from this because of the &amp;#34;Musk&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s an absolute lovely scent that lasts all day. There&#x27;s also an oil! Get them both if you can find the oil. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve worn it for years and it is my signature fragrance.  The scent is unique and identifiable.  Everyone knows when I&#x27;m around.</li>
    <li> I really like this scent . The only problem is that it don&#x27;t last long enough. It is similar to civet musk with Egyptian oil.  This is one of my favorite scents.</li>
    <li> This was my favorite perfume and my husband actually went and purchased it for me.  Unfortunately, the same oil that I use to use several years ago has changed and it is not as strong as it use to be.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I wore this in college (a hundred years ago) my boyfriend then, husband now, loved it.  When Bonne Belle sold off this scent, the replacement was not close.  They have tweaked it and it is closer.  When I wear it, my hubby says it reminds him of Ohio State, oh so many years ago!  I will continue to wear it.</li>
    <li> A lovely musk fragrance; not too overpowering, not too sweet. It is perfectly named - because it smells like clean, fresh, SKIN with a nice warmth, and a slight musk scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other musk fragrances (Jovan, VS, among others) but they&#x27;re either too strong or too sicky sweet. This one has a great balance. It&#x27;s a very subtle musk yet lasts all night. Apply it to your pulse points and the warmth of your skin continually releases the fragrance</li>
    <li> i love this product,i have been using so many perfume spray,but it doesnt last long.&lt;br /&gt;this seems to work, getting compliments already</li>
    <li> Great fast service. I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores I found it here!! I&#x27;m so happy to have it again and so affordable too!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful inexpensive soft musk fragrance.  It has an oil base that feels good on the skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I never used this back when Bonne Bell made it, so I can&#x27;t compare the two, but this smells good to me: a little wood, a little lavender, and a nice smooth warm musk.</li>
    <li> It still smells pretty good, but I wish they were using the original formula!!&lt;br /&gt;It just isn&#x27;t quite the same.  It is a little more sandalwood than the original with less sweet musk smell.</li>
    <li> Too strong &amp; does not have the clean refreshing scent I was expecting.  I am not using &amp; would prefer to return this item but I have opened &amp; do not think I may return.</li>
    <li> I USED TO WEAR THIS YEARS AGO AND I LOVED IT THEN AND I LOVE IT NOW....YES WILL BUY AGAIN ...DELIVERY PROMPT AND PACKAGED GOOD.OH IT SMELLS MARVELOUS....</li>
    <li> This is the one I&#x27;ve been looking for.I wanted the one that is a little better than Jovan,this is it.I have received numerous compliments!</li>
    <li> I am 52 years old and started wearing this oil as a teen and it still smells heavenly!  Hard to beat for the price as compared to the other perfumes I love such as D&amp;G Light Blue or Donna Karan&#x27;s DKNY Be Delicious!  I save the others for special occasions but my skin musk is for everyday.  The only thing to ever rival it for the price was Jovan&#x27;s Patchouli and they don&#x27;t make that anymore so again, for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance. If you like musk scents, you&#x27;ll love this one. It is light and unimposing and has a wonderful sweetness to it making it very lady like. I like to dab it on after a bath or shower. I have received many compliments when I wear this fragrance. I have also added a few drops of the oil to a wool dryer ball that I throw in with my clothes in the dryer, lightly scenting my clothes. I also have the body spray and the spray perfume. I wish Skin Musk would make a body powder and lotion. I would buy them too!  It is well worth the cost..</li>
    <li> Never wear anything else.</li>
    <li> Nice clean fragrance. Perfect for everyday.</li>
    <li> I thought it would smell better. I guess my taste has changed since I first tried this. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the most delicious musk.</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent the majority of my adult life and I always get compliments.  I wear it on top of patchouli oil for a scent that is all mine.  I am so happy I was able to order and Pharmapaks was amazing in getting me my products, thank you.</li>
    <li> loved it and it arrive earlier than expected</li>
    <li> Got for my wife as a presant, can&#x27;t get it local. Wife said she loves to use the musk and she does smell great with it on.</li>
    <li> Love it. I will order again when I run out! I hope this never disappears from the market. My favorite scent.</li>
    <li> The commercial for Skin musk, when it came out, bore the tagline, &amp;#34;If warmth had a scent, it would be Skin.&amp;#34;  I always remembered that, because the best way to describe the aroma of this oil, IS &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a musky, natural-smelling oil. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t have a chemically, perfumy, floral, old-lady-type fragrance. It&#x27;s the kind of scent you smell when you are physically close to a person; it&#x27;s subtle, quiet, earthy.  I&#x27;ve worn it off and on for years, and it seems men and women both like the scent, as inevitably someone, of either sex, ALWAYS remarks that I smell good.</li>
    <li> I love the smell from the bottle and when you first put it on. But after the drydown, all I smell is sandalwood. I like sandalwood, but I like my fragrances to be more complex, not just one-note. I&#x27;ll layer it with other fragrances but I will not be buying again. I never owned the original scent, so I can&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Each persons chemical reaction to perfume etc. reacts different.  Mine works so well with oil rather than spray.  I love this stuff and hope no one ever discontinues it or I&#x27;ll be stuck.  It&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve worn for 20 + years.</li>
    <li> My mom had to have this so I had to find it.  She says it is just like the old musk from Bonne Belle, which she loves.  Can&#x27;t see any difference and neither can I.  So glad we can continue to find this musk oil!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne so I have ordered it on more than one occasion, but the last time I ordered it I received a bottle that did not have the lasting effect that I am used to. I will still order it again but If I get a bad order again I will stop ordering it.</li>
    <li> very bad, no  perfume in it all - ver y sorry to purchase</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe this fragrance was still available! lol  Without giving away my advanced age (lol), I&#x27;ll just say it was a popular perfume in the &#x27;70&#x27;s, although it used to be sold by &amp;#34;Bonne Bell&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s still the same after all these years .... wonderful, sexy fragrance.  My only minor complaint is that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long .... but, for the price, that&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> I wear both daily...unbelievable scent throw...light, musk, sensual, feminine...everything I like in a scent.  Lots of compliments from men and women...it is not an overpowering scent...makes me smile when I get a whiff of it...seems to do that for everyone who smells this fragrance.  Buy this...unbelievable....I haven&#x27;t worn anything else in many years...I love it.</li>
    <li> Was quite disappointed with this product.  It has been modified in recent years, it smells nothing like the original.</li>
    <li> My favorite since college! Love it, and wear it almost daily.</li>
    <li> Duane Reade use to carry it, I haven&#x27;t bought it in a while, I haven&#x27;t run out yet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since the 70&#x27;s, it is not to heavy or strong and because it is a oil last longer. It is a great buy if you love musk.</li>
    <li> I am a huge musk fan and bought this oil purely based on the Amazon. I&#x27;m too young to know the Bonne Bell version of Skin Musk but this PM version arrived today and all I can say is...ugh. Smells to me like a cross between baby powder and the pomade my darker-skinned girlfriends wore in their hair in the 80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered a bottle of the vintage Bonne Bell version (gold cap, from 70s) off eBay but it hasn&#x27;t come yet. I&#x27;ll try to remember to post an update when I get it for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, the musks I tend to like are the \\&quot;white\\&quot; or \\&quot;crystalline\\&quot; kinds, like Cabot&#x27;s Original Natural Musk Oil. That would be the absolute end of my musk searching as I would bathe in it if I could, however, the scent has become weaker and weaker over the years to the point of having to slather it on and skip a day of showering to be able to smell it. They say to put it in a warm windowsill or to microwave it but that doesn&#x27;t help, so I&#x27;m forced to look elsewhere.  &#x3D;O(</li>
    <li> I was afraid they would quit making this product so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I have been using Skin Musk for 30 years.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great old fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as it use to but love it</li>
    <li> Yummy smell.  Takes me back to the 70&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> An old tried but true perfume. It is really hard to find and was glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I get soooo many compliments on the skin musk.  People always want to know where I purchased it from or if I can get some for them.  My answer is NO. I don&#x27;t want anyone I&#x27;m working with smelling FRESH AND CLEAN like me.!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Skin musk by Prince Matchabelli is awesome!  I can use it alone or add it to other body oils that have little or no fragrance to give them this wonderful skin musk fragrance.  Skin musk is a clean smelling oil that is very uplifting.  I only use products of superior quality that are priced to buy!  I will always buy skin musk as long as it is available!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been years that I have used Skin Oil as one of my favorites perfumes.  The good thing is that it has such a wonderfully sweet and clean smell, that it has become part of me through the years and every single person that I pass by, always asks me what is the fragrance I wear.  It hasn&#x27;t changed a bit in the last 20 years plus.</li>
    <li> Same reason here, couldn&#x27;t find this locally any more and have been using it for years.  I always get lots of compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> This oil has much more staying power than the tall cans of spritz and short glass bottles of spray.  I haven&#x27;t used the oil but maybe once in the last 20 years but I have to admit I like the fact that I can put it precisely where I want it rather than having it end up all over the place: it&#x27;s not good for jewelry to come in contact with perfume (particularly pearls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the price has gone up some since Bonne Bell no longer makes it, I just feel lucky that it&#x27;s still available, as this is the only perfume that smells good on me.</li>
    <li> Cost is a little high, but musk is difficult to find.  You can use this sparingly and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have to tell you. I was hooked on this scent when I was little girl. My favorite aunt used to wear it all the time. And when I got a bit older I started purchasing it for myself. Absolutely love this smell. People at work always compliment the smell. Its perfect for the office. Not to overbearing like perfumes.</li>
    <li> Long lasting fragrance that is not a heavy musk scent.There is almost a floral flavor with it. Not the same as the original version but excellent.  Introduced to this 20 years ago by a friend who is now in an assisted living facility. I bought it for her so that she has something familiar to comfort her. Always received compliments with this scent. Will buy it again from this merchant who included lovely samples in the package.</li>
    <li> Compliments every time I wear the Skin Musk by Prince Matchabelli for Woman...I absolutely love it&#x27;s fresh, non-overbearing scent...and will buy this every time</li>
    <li> I have used Skin Musk (formerly by Bonnie Bell, now by Prince Matchabelli) since 1979. I happened along this seller and he/she had a good price. I ordered 5 bottles. I opened the first one, absolutely no smell, it could have had water in it except being oil. I figured any thing can have a bad batch. I opened another, same thing. I contacted the seller and told them about the problem. They said they could only take back the unopened bottles. ??? So I get stuck with the bottles I already know are no good and send back the bottles I suspect are of the same quality so they can sell them to some other poor unsuspecting purchaser. I didn&#x27;t ask the seller to take back the product, didn&#x27;t want the hastle, but this seller does NOT back his product. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> A couple of years back I was reading about musks in perfumes. I googled musk today, these excerpts are from Wikipedia. This is not the original article I had read...but, basically says the same thing. Perhaps this is the reason for the change in scent, I had loved the original as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Deer musk is a substance with a persistent odor obtained from a gland of the male musk deer situated between its back/rectal area. The substance has been extensively used as a perfume fixative, incense material, and medicine, since ancient times. It was and still is one of the most expensive animal products in the world. The name originates from the Sanskrit word muṣká meaning \\&quot;testicle\\&quot;.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; Deer musk has been a key constituent in many perfumes since its discovery, being held to give a perfume long-lasting power as a fixative. Despite its high price, musk tinctures were used in perfumery until 1979, when musk deers were protected as an endangered species by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). Today the trade quantity of the natural musk is controlled by CITES but illegal poaching and trading continues.[4] An illegal shipment of 700 kilograms (1,500 lb) of Chinese musk from the musk deer was seized in Japan in 1987, an amount corresponding to approximately 100,000 deer killed.[5]\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Soft, clean smelling, a little bit goes a lOng way, I get tons of compliments from both men and women</li>
    <li> I have worn this musk oil exclusively for 40-plus years.  Very glad to find it online when it became unavailable in stores.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed...wasn&#x27;t cheap and it was such a small bottle...won&#x27;t buy again.  Can purchase it cheaper at Walmart, but it&#x27;s hard to tell sometimes online.  Take your best shot!</li>
    <li> This IS NOT SKIN MUSK I used to get years ago.  It smells nothing like it at all.  I have a great nose for this, I know what I am talking about, and smelling here, and this isn&#x27;t Skin Musk.  It smells exactly like an older man&#x27;s barber shop type after shave, and it goes on as a cold aerosol spray, almost like a feminine deodorant spray.  NOT AT ALL AS EXPECTED.  It does not smell bad, it is just not the Skin Musk smell.  If I wanted to smell like a man&#x27;s barber shop, I&#x27;d go there myself.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this perfume and was reminded a while ago.  Had to order some and it&#x27;s just as wonderful as I remember.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best musk oils i have found - it is light and somewhat sweeter than others, more femine.  It is not overpowering at all.  I discovered this one when my other favorite became unrealistically over priced so i started shopping around and gave it a try.  It is almost as good.  The only difference is it is not as strong so you need more and it doesn&#x27;t last as long.  I like the scent just as much.  It is a soft musk that is light with a sweet/clean smelling scent.  I have always received positive comments about it.  Men seem to notice it more than woman...</li>
    <li> Prince Matchabelli / Bonne Belle:  Somehow both designer names are interchangeable because you get the same product under either name. I used this product back when it was distributed by Bonne Belle. The last time I bought 4 bottles it was packaged under the Prince Matchabelli name and I was pleased. It still had a rich, long lasting musk fragrance. Once I was down to my last bottle I ordered and received FOUR more bottles on Amazon about a month ago. The oil smelled the same - - initially.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, what I got was a watered down version masquerading as the real thing. There was still a hint of the original fragrance - but it didn&#x27;t last long.  NEW wearers may not even know the difference.  The scent dissipated almost as soon as I put it on! I opened the other three bottles thinking perhaps the first one was just bad. They were all the same way. One day recently while in Walgreens I bought another bottle - same issue.&lt;br /&gt;The original musk oil fragrance used to require just a few drops and lasted almost 24 hours. I got so many compliments when I wore Skin Musk than when I wore perfumes that were $50 or more. The current formula gets few compliments. Does this company think long-time users are not smart enough to recognize that the formula is different - and weaker? I won&#x27;t be buying it anywhere unless I can open the bottle, smell it and dab it on to make sure it&#x27;s the original formula. Perhaps I&#x27;ll get lucky enough to find some old inventory somewhere (since musk never seems to get old). Guess it&#x27;s time to find a new fragrance.  ...*sigh!</li>
    <li> We use this as a base because of its good quality oil.  Then apply any other fragrance over it.  Makes the other fragrance last all day.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! It is so unique and sexy. I would love this to be my signature scent forever. I hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> I expected a less sweet smelling musk. I can&#x27;t wear this.</li>
    <li> The price here s awesome and I never have to find parking. Not flowery or fruity. Not spicy or green. Just naturally sweet. Just me. kp</li>
    <li> I love to wear fragrances that come in an oil.  It lasts so much longer!!!  This is my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for over 25 years.  I will never be without it.  I have two bottles as backup.  This is a great scent if you have allergies.  Very soft and non irritating.</li>
    <li> love it---my grandmother wore this for YEARS--reminds me of her</li>
    <li> My favoite perfume. Very light smelling and last a long time</li>
    <li> I have always loved this fragrance. I would like to find the spicey musk if they still make it. I get compliments on it whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance has been my favorite for many years.  Nice clean and fresh scent for me.  Oils do tend to smell differently on different people so caution to the buyer if you have not sampled this one.  I do get a lot of compliments on the scent and it last all day with just a few drops on the wrists and back of neck.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this scent and always get complements when I wear it.  Soft, not overpowering.  An old product that is still great</li>
    <li> Years ago, my girl friends and I used to wear Skin Musk Oil by another company.  Skin Musk by Prince Matchabeli is o.k but it does not last as long as I was use to or expected it to.  I do not intend to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> i GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME ON THIS ONE--BODY OIL BETTER THAN SPRAYS..  kEEP IN MIND THO THAT FRAGRANCES ARE DIFFERENT ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE-- It&#x27;s the body chemistry thing.  Since it&#x27;s inexpensive...give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved bonne bell skin forever. When I was right out of high school I got a summer job working at the bonne bell factory in Lakewood Ohio. Brings back memories...still wear skin  every winter. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This product is so difficult to find.  They don&#x27;t sell it in the stores anymore.  My husband got this for me for valentine&#x27;s day.  I hope you never run out.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and always get compliments that I smell good, and this fragrance oil lasts all day with just one application.</li>
    <li> My 2nd favorite fragrance and great price.</li>
    <li> My Mom has been wearing this scent since I was a little girl. When the pharmacy where she would buy it closed, she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I found it at Amazon (of course!) and ordered it for her, which was a really nice surprise. She still smells as beautiful as she always has. That scent will stick in my memory for years to come.</li>
    <li> i am very disappointed. it  is nothnig like wha ti last bought . the fragrance is no the same and it doesn&#x27;t last  at all. i have been using this product for 20+ years it was the only one i could  use due to sensitivity to smells . i was so excited to find it on amazon and this was several years ago. i needed it again and repurched it rom here and it is not the same even tho its the same product,. packaging and etc  what happened. guess i will just have to do without.</li>
    <li> Funny... I read the rave reviews by so many others and had hopes that this was my long-lost fragrance... many said that they&#x27;ve been wearing this since the 70&#x27;s and now I&#x27;ve discovered why:  It kind of has an &amp;#34;old-lady smell&amp;#34;!!!  Definitely not for me :)</li>
    <li> this is my mother&#x27;s favorite. bought recently for a gift to give her. she is very happy with it so that makes me happy that I was able to find it online.</li>
    <li> If you are like me, you can&#x27;t handle perfumes that are too floral.  This is a lovely scent that has gotten me several compliments.</li>
    <li> This oil is so subtle. It&#x27;s not sweet-smelling; it&#x27;s not musky in the heavy way most people have experienced musk. It is sublime.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother who has worn this as long as I remember. It&#x27;s perfect for travelling and will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking for the original musk oil and I thought this might have captured that fragrance but it didn&#x27;t.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff, but I only buy the oil, Not the sprays! I wonder why I never see it anymore in stores? I always get compliments on this whenever I wear it and Ive been wearing it since 1987, it is by far the best scent Ive ever smelled and anyone who smells it agrees with me! Please bring it back, why would they not carry something that is so wonderful?</li>
    <li> I have worn Skin Musk for about 15-20 years.  I love the light fragrance and often get compliments.</li>
    <li> Buy these for gifts for a friend.  She always loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for years with great results. It is really a SEXY fragrance. She has more compliments, from men and women, than you can imagine. It smells different on different women.</li>
    <li> Really can&#x27;t stand this scent.  I gave it away to someone who just loves it!  lol  To each his own!</li>
    <li> I like wearing this perfume oil as I do not need to inhale alcohol vapors while applying it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is warm, sweet, fresh and fruity.  It dos not last a whole entire day on me ,however, or  I just can not feel it anymore after 4-5 hours of wearing.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is tiny and can fit comfortably anywhere, if you want to carry it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very nice product.</li>
    <li> I love this smell. It isn&#x27;t too much, its just the right amount of smell that keeps you fresh all day after a nice shower.</li>
    <li> while I like musk, this product doesn&#x27;t work with my body chemistry.  It smells almost masculine, i.e. Old Spice.  Won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> Wife has been wearing it for years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 10+ years!  It is such a clean smelling scent (so people tell me as you normally can&#x27;t smell it on yourself). It used to be carried in stores but I can&#x27;t find it anymore so must use the internet to find it.  If they ever quit making this, I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do.  Try it for yourself, I don&#x27;t think you will regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for my wife for a couple of years now. Why? Well, for one, I like how this smells. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a typical perfume, but I liken it to the washed air around the base of a large waterfall. Seriously. Of course perception is everything, and your perception will probably be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason, and the most important to me, that I purchase Skin Musk is that it doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze or make me have a headache. I am severely sensitive to chemical smells. Even a slight smell of most perfumes will send me into a sneezing fit. It can be quite embarrassing to be sitting at a conference table in a meeting, and a female colleague walks by, sending you into spasms. The same in public. It is a constant assault, from womens perfume and mens cologne. Even aggressive deodorant can trigger a session of sneezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, we were at a local restaurant, and the server, a woman, walked by, and there was this strong, but unoffensive smell. I asked her what she was wearing, and it turned out to be Skin Musk. My wife and I looked at each other, and I immediately bought her a bottle. She loves the smell, and so do I, and not just for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone has allergy considerations, they should try this product. What do you have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body oil for over 30 years. It is my favorite go to. I heard a rumor that it was being discontinued and that is why you can&#x27;t find it in the stores. I can only purchase it online.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly hope the rumor is false as this fragrance stays fresh on me all day long.</li>
    <li> it is almost as good as coty wild musk hat i wore for years.</li>
    <li> Again this is one of my favorite products for fragrance this was a fast shipment. Thanks guys . I would definely recommend this seller. It is my favorite musk. It also leaves a soft fragrance on your clothes which my daughter loves.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t stand most perfumes, but enjoy wearing this. Many compliments. This silly form wants more words after I&#x27;ve finished the review.</li>
