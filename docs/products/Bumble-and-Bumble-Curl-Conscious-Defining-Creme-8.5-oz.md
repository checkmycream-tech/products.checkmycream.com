      <li>Love the smell and the product.  </li>
      <li>I love how Ouidad&#x27;s gel leaves my curls lightweight, shiny, and frizz-free.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>non the best product I have ever used while my hair is long.</li>
      <li>I use when I get out the shower and let it air dry in my hair and it feels great!</li>
      <li>This product helps you achieve beautiful, soft, natural and very appealing curls!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s EASY.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about Bumble &amp; Bumble products for curly hair, but I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth for the product.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve tried this summer is still John Master&#x27;s Organics Sea Mist Sea Salt Spray with Lavender, HANDS DOWN.</li>
      <li>I have medium-tight fine curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of fine hair that will gently curl on its own (and then frizz)</li>
      <li>It was okay for the frizz, didn&#x27;t eliminate all of it, but that&#x27;s probably mostly because my hair is damaged and can&#x27;t be helped in certain places.&lt;br</li>
      <li>: The B&amp;B revitalizing spray does a great job bringing curls back to life on day 2.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for my combination wavy/curly hair for about a year now, and it really makes my hair look nice and curly.  </li>
      <li>it has quite a bit of natural curl in it but needs a good cut to get it going.  </li>
      <li>Based on all of the positive reviews here, I thought this product would be great for my naturally wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>Worth it!</li>
      <li>But this amazing product has turned my huge, frizzy, wild mane into manageable ringlets that get lots of compliments.</li>
      <li>I was recently on a trip to Turkey, and got there a wonderful spa treatment, a part of which was they just massaged some natural oils into my scalp and told me to leave the hair oily for a while.</li>
      <li>It is pretty much tried and true for me at this point and always leaves my wavy hair looking defined with some nice texture.</li>
      <li>feel I gave it a fair amount of time, tried multiple times, in order to get the amount for my hair correct.  </li>
      <li>There is a nice, subtle rose fragrance to this hair cream that I love.  </li>
      <li>It probably works well for people with  super curly hair, but if your hair is wavy, go ahead and pass on this overpriced bottle of blah.  </li>
      <li>Over decades I have bought many different types of curl care products, always searching for the magic bullet.</li>
      <li>After the very first time my hair were silkier and livelier than I ever remember it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a good product - all the B&amp;B products I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
      <li>my curls still curl but the product is much less effective than before and it takes more product to achieve the desired effect.</li>
      <li>Is it worth the money?  </li>
      <li>I have never been able to achieve soft curls without tons of frizz.</li>
      <li>If you have the disposable income, its worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m returning it and definitely will be sticking with Ouidad&#x27;s Gel, which I&#x27;ve been happily using for nearly 10 years.</li>
      <li>In my pursuit of natural hair care, I recently came across another great advice for having silky and shiny hair.</li>
      <li>I had heard good things about other Bumble &amp; Bumble products</li>
      <li>Maybe your not using the right conditioner?</li>
      <li>I purchased this product a few months ago and have been pretty happy with it.</li>
      <li>And they say that a simple natural soap actually works the best.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s nice to have something a little fragrant that I can enjoy without my eyes tearing and my nose burning.  </li>
      <li>- it makes them more uniform throughout my entire head of hair.</li>
      <li>Its the first one I&#x27;ve found where I can practically have wash and go curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I just get out of the shower, towel dry very lightly, put it on and</li>
      <li>I do find that I have to touch it up a little with more cream later in the day, but overall I&#x27;m really happy with the product and the results, and I&#x27;ve gotten 2 or 3 compliments on my ringlets since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
      <li>The bottle was only about 4/5 the way full!</li>
      <li>After having read all the positive reviews, I was expecting really a lot.</li>
      <li>I live in a very humid area (the Eastern Shore of Maryland) and in the summer, it&#x27;s not even worth it to try to straighten it because it frizzes up as soon as I step out the door.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After having read all the positive reviews, I was expecting really a lot. But no matter how much I tried, I was never satisfied the result. If I apply very little of it, there is no difference. If I put a bit more - it right away makes my hair greasy and gives it a dirty look. I experimented at least 10 times: both following the complicated instructions (curling hair around the finger!) and just leaving them dry free, and was never happy with the way they looked after drying.     ADVICE: I was recently on a trip to Turkey, and got there a wonderful spa treatment, a part of which was they just massaged some natural oils into my scalp and told me to leave the hair oily for a while. The next day, after I simply shampooed my curly (usually quite frizzy) hair and let it dry on its own, it looked truly wonderful - silky, shiny, soft, and very lively! No product I ever tried could do the same! So I browsed a bit for \\&quot;HAIR OILING\\&quot;, and for the last month have been regularly massaging some natural oils onto my scalp 1-2 times a week before going to bed, and shampooing the following morning. My hair has never looked that beautiful! And I don&#x27;t need expensive conditioners any more! And they say that a simple natural soap actually works the best. Much cheaper than $60/set for shampoo+conditioner, very healthy and very effective. I vary the oils I use: jojoba, coconut, olive, soybean - all with great results. This is how people have been treating their hair for centuries before the cosmetics industry realized that there is a profit opportunity in creating hundreds of the products (none of which is properly tested). Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to be pushy, but I thought that if you thinking of buying Curl Concious products, you may consider natural oils instead, and may be you will benefit from them as much as I did.     ADVICE 2: In my pursuit of natural hair care, I recently came across another great advice for having silky and shiny hair. After shampooing (no conditioner), rinse yourhair with lemon juice mixed with water (1 lemon + 1-1.5 cups of water). Apparently, it removes all the soap residues that are left on our hair after soaps/shampoos, which harden our hair and make it bushy. They say a mix of vinegar with water has the same effect, and that it&#x27;s better to use vinegar on dark while lemon on blond hair. But I am afraid of the vinegary smell, so I have tried lemon only (though it&#x27;s perhaps more expensive than vinegar). It works like magic! After the very first time my hair were silkier and livelier than I ever remember it. If you want to learn more - browse for VINEGAR or LEMON RINSE.</li>
    <li> I got a perm and for months, I used the Curl Conscious on it.. worked wonders!  It held up my perm and really gave the curls definition.  Would recommend to anyone with a perm or curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have long soft curly hair and this product makes my curls a lot nicer and tames the frizz.  I have tried many products and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve bought so far. I would also recommend the calming creme.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing for my hair, not even a little.&lt;br /&gt;I have to condition my thick curly hair after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t even leave my hair smelling nice.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Based on all of the positive reviews here, I thought this product would be great for my naturally wavy hair.  Unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing.  No hold.  No curl boost. No shine.  No nothing.  I really wanted to like this product, trying several different ways of styling with it, from letting it air dry to finger curling and diffusing.  But I got nothing but a frizzy, dull, definitionless mop of hair from this product.  It probably works well for people with  super curly hair, but if your hair is wavy, go ahead and pass on this overpriced bottle of blah.  I&#x27;ll be returning the product to BB.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product - all the B&amp;B products I&#x27;ve used in the past I&#x27;ve been quite happy with. So I thought nothing of spending the scratch to try this one... but I have to say, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. I have fine hair but a good bit of it, with baby waves and a couple stubborn cowlicks. I live in a very humid area (the Eastern Shore of Maryland) and in the summer, it&#x27;s not even worth it to try to straighten it because it frizzes up as soon as I step out the door. I thought this product would put a little more spring into my waves but alas, it only seems to weigh my hair down and make it look dirty. And it&#x27;s forumalated for fine-medium hair and I use it sparingly! Best product I&#x27;ve tried this summer is still John Master&#x27;s Organics Sea Mist Sea Salt Spray with Lavender, HANDS DOWN. The sea salt really make the curls pop when it dries while the lavender oil keeps it from looking/feeling brittle. Oh well, you live and you learn - and if you&#x27;re me, you continue to spend beaucoup money on haircare products...</li>
    <li> This stuff works consistantly on my hair. Often times my hair has gotten some how used to a product after a momth or two and it doesn&#x27;t work the same anymore, this stuff WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loove it for my hair, I have thick hair that is fine and very curly.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. i hated my curly hair for years, nothing seemed to make it look good. this stuff is great, i am able to add just a drop and i have great bouncy cruly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only curl cream I have found that helps my curls to form and mold without having that crunch that other products leave.  I have shoulder-length thick hair and I put in about a quarter-sized drop of this in my hair after it has been blotted with a towel and leave it to air dry.  The cream doesn&#x27;t leave residue on my scalp.  It will actually coax my curls into forming without me having to form each one.  I recommend this product to anyone with thick, curly/wavy hair that just needs some help to tame without making their hair crunchy.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for curly hair. I&#x27;m a devotee - it does wonders in making the curls soft, but hold shape. Love it. My hair is naturally curly and I&#x27;ve tried everything from sprays to mousses to gels to creams. Complementary product: The B&amp;B revitalizing spray does a great job bringing curls back to life on day 2.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. My hair is still frizzy after using it.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever found for taming my wavy/curly, fly-away hair, without having to straighten it.  I can just put in a dollop after washing, blow-dry the roots and then let it be.  Works in humid and dry conditions.  For extra body, finger curl locks while wet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 8 yrs and I just love it!  I have very curly hair and it tends to frizzy and be unruley.  I use when I get out the shower and let it air dry in my hair and it feels great!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. My whole life I&#x27;ve tried different products with varying degrees of success. Finally-a product that WORKS and makes my hair look good and it&#x27;s EASY.  Simply wash your hair, squeeze out extra water, then apply cream.  It is best to twist 1 inch sections of your hair so as your hair dries it has some style without looking overly done.  NO FRIZZ and your curls will be bouncy and not crunchy.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Over decades I have bought many different types of curl care products, always searching for the magic bullet. Frizz, dryness, puffiness have been my enemies. Bumble and Bumble really makes some of the very best products and this is one of them. My curls stay soft and I never have frizz or dryness. My searching days for the perfect product are over!!</li>
    <li> i have very, VERY thick hair that is also very, VERY fine.  it has quite a bit of natural curl in it but needs a good cut to get it going.  most products weigh down my fine hair and make it look flat and greasy.  my hair dresser introduced me to this on the side (they don&#x27;t even carry B&amp;b in their salon) and i&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  that was 3 years ago.  i love this.  it gives my curls enough support to make it through the day and makes my hair shiny and soft.  it is enhanced when you use the supporting shampoo/conditioner but also works great on its own!</li>
    <li> This is one of those products that you get what you pay for. Love the stuff.</li>
    <li> Really unimpressed with this product. It smells great but doesn&#x27;t do anything for my curls. I use a diffuser on my hair and this cream just made it a hot mess. It&#x27;s too poofy and there&#x27;s no curl definition, and my hair is flat by the end of the day. I liked the Curl Conscious Mousse a lot more, but it barely lasted me three weeks and made it so difficult to comb my hair out in the shower. I&#x27;ve heard great things about Bumble &amp; Bumble products for curly hair, but I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth for the product.</li>
    <li> My hair is not uniformly curly, and this product helps my hair be curlier where it needs and less frizzy where it is too curly.  All without making it hard or sticky.  The trick is to have the hair not too wet but not yet dry, and use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> I have fine and thin curly hair, about shoulder length. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I really like it. I find it works best when used in combination with gel. I use a small amount of DevaCurl&#x27;s AnGel combined with a small amount of Curl Conscious Cream. I put that through my hair, but only on the length, not at the roots. I then use just gel at the roots. I find if I use the Curl Conscious Cream at the roots, my hair looks flat and weighed down. I then let it dry naturally and shake it out when dry. I do find that I have to touch it up a little with more cream later in the day, but overall I&#x27;m really happy with the product and the results, and I&#x27;ve gotten 2 or 3 compliments on my ringlets since I&#x27;ve been using it. I just wish it cost a little less, but since you don&#x27;t need to use much, it should last a while.</li>
    <li> This really helps my hair stay curly and my perms last longer and it leaves my hair feeling great!</li>
    <li> ever since bumble and bumble reformulated the product hasn&#x27;t been as good. they cheaped out. my curls still curl but the product is much less effective than before and it takes more product to achieve the desired effect.</li>
    <li> This product helps you achieve beautiful, soft, natural and very appealing curls!  No stiff gel feel, just a natural, falling, pretty appearance to your hairstyle.  Only seems to have the same effect for the first day however.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair that becomes a mess without a good product. I love bumble and bumble because it lets me work a small amount into damp hair after a shower and just forget about it. other products either weigh my hair down and make it look greasy, or don&#x27;t do enough to tame the frizz. my local beauty supply shop doesn&#x27;t carry it, so i didn&#x27;t have time to go to a salon to pick some up when my last bottle ran out, and i tried some other well respected product lines as a replacement, and found that nothing works like the B&amp;b curl creme! thank god for amazon, especially since the pricing is about $8-10 less than most salons that retail it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have a lot of fine hair that will gently curl on its own (and then frizz) but with a bit of a blow dry is straight. However, my hair is VERY frizz prone. I have never been able to achieve soft curls without tons of frizz. Somehow this product makes my hair curlier than it would be naturally but without the frizz. I have never used anything similar. The instructions on the product are bizarre and initially I thought it was a joke (twirling hair around your finger...) but it really works, and you can control the size of the curl based on the amount you twirl. It&#x27;s quite amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought Bumble and Bumble because I was curious to see how high end products may make a difference in my curls.  I have fine, curly hair that I only finger comb (Brushing my hair actually straightens my hair to the point that you can&#x27;t tell it was curly in the first place.)  I like my curls, so I look for products that will hold the curls without feeling greasy or weighing them down.  I like the Bumble and Bumble curl cream, but I use much less than I normally would with another cream-based product.  It&#x27;s very thick and you don&#x27;t need too much.  I especially like the effects when paired with a curl spray, try John Frieda&#x27;s Dream Curls (relatively inexpensive, soft curls) or B&amp;B Surf Spray (More expensive, texturizer/beachwave.)  Is it worth the money?  I would definitely say yes if it was the only product I needed to use.  Fortunately for my grad student income, I can get the same effect with a less expensive curl cream and spray.  If you have the disposable income, its worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have wavy hair that will stay in ringlets all day without frizz or heaviness. My hair remains soft and natural and feels like a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for my combination wavy/curly hair for about a year now, and it really makes my hair look nice and curly.  The trick is to put it on when your hair is wet right out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, was told once that it was a bit pricy.  However, I have no problem paying for the bottle ( it takes so little each day)  Worth it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few months ago and have been pretty happy with it. I have fine, medium thickness, color-treated, slightly wavy hair. Without this product, my waves dry unpredictably, with some bits falling straight and others frizzing up. Curl Conscious DEFINITELY defines and hold my waves - it makes them more uniform throughout my entire head of hair. I have to be careful not to use too much because it does make the hair look kind of greasy if you use too much - I use barely a dime-sized dollop on my long hair. I feel that my only reservation is that it doesn&#x27;t really reduce those fly-aways that pop up all over my head. These might be a result of damage but when I straighten my hair and use a serum they are significantly less visible. To style my hair wavy, I never brush it after the shower (only before), apply a leave-in conditioning product (currently b&amp;b&#x27;s new line - the mend complex) - I rub though out my entire hair, starting with the driest bottom layer. Then I rub the small dollop of curl creme between my balms to activate it and use a light scrunching motion and some patting to coat those extra frizzy bits. It is pretty much tried and true for me at this point and always leaves my wavy hair looking defined with some nice texture. It also smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> Great hair product but was quite expensive on Amazon.  Unless they sell the same product in a larger container I would probably not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Unlike many of the reviewers I didn&#x27;t find a problem with stiffness of hair. Helps to create soft defined curls especially with those like me with lots of curl that has a tendency to frizz. Don&#x27;t wash hair every day and this product is great when you re-wet hair to style. Many will leave the hair sticky feeling then stiff with drying. Hair looks just showered/washed styled.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST!!  I have naturally curly dry hair that I don&#x27;t wash everyday and this stuff allows me 3 days (although I don&#x27;t always do that) without washing my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased w/ my purchase!</li>
    <li> I like Bumble and Bumble -- I can&#x27;t do my &#x27;do without their Styling Creme.  But this stuff is worthless.  Instead of  &amp;#34;defining&amp;#34; my wavy hair, it weighs it down and makes it look greasy.  The scent is also off-putting.  Yuk.  I&#x27;m bummed I ever purchased this $29 bottle of stinky goo.</li>
    <li> So I have SUPER THICK wavy blonde hair that I bleach, so it&#x27;s kind of damaged and a little bit frizz-bomb in a few places. It&#x27;s naturally wavy, but I certainly like to amp up the waves and minimize frizz if possible. My hair stylist recommended this product to me, and I had heard about the magic of bumble and bumble before too, so I decided to bite the bullet and actually try out the expensive stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say that it definitely does amp up my curl factor, or I guess my \\&quot;wave\\&quot; factor. It defines and controls most of my frizz. Is it the be all end all of hair products for my hair type? Maybe not. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that it wouldn&#x27;t work wonders for girls with curlier hair. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy at all and it requires  bit of technique to master, what with the whole \\&quot;section out and twirl with your fingers\\&quot; stuff. It&#x27;s kinda got a gooooooopy feel to it, and I was afraid it would make my hair greasy, but it didn&#x27;t (although it really just depends on how much you use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was alright, but nothing really potent, which is probably good since sometimes fragrance additives can do bad things to your hair (says the girl who bleaches her hair). It was okay for the frizz, didn&#x27;t eliminate all of it, but that&#x27;s probably mostly because my hair is damaged and can&#x27;t be helped in certain places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I bought the product and opened it, I kinda felt like I do when I buy a bag of chips from a vending machine and realize the bag is half empty. The bottle was only about 4/5 the way full! That&#x27;s how they get ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I would recommend it. It&#x27;s not the worst product ever, but I&#x27;ll continue my quest to find miracle waves in a bottle with minimum effort. Hopefully there&#x27;s a product out there labeled \\&quot;lazy girl&#x27;s hot beach waves\\&quot;. Hopefully it&#x27;s a spray bottle... spray bottles require less effort.</li>
    <li> B&amp;B&#x27;s curl creme is absolutely great! It leaves my curls soft and defined, I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and this product was toooo thick and heavy on hair. Not something I would order again.</li>
    <li> I have thin curly hair (3a-3b). It will fall flat when put in a ponytail but the hairline will always be frizzy. I use this to add body and I love it! It helps creates a larger ponytail and holds the body all day. Tames my natural curls.</li>
    <li> Recommended for people with curly hair, it is a leave-in hair conditioner that encourages curl without frizziness.  I like it and have used it ever since my hairdresser started using it on my hair.</li>
    <li> I used to have to bother by rolling my hair on rollers. It took time, &amp; my arthritic arms got tired. However, now that I have the above product, O no longer have to spend that much time on my hair; and it looks rolled, with big, loose curls, thanks to above product!</li>
    <li> Cannot live without this stuff.  Okay, exaggeration.  But this amazing product has turned my huge, frizzy, wild mane into manageable ringlets that get lots of compliments. Instead of &amp;#34;Wow!  You sure have quite the head of hair&amp;#34; I get &amp;#34;Wow!  Your hair is so pretty&amp;#34;  Now, which one would you rather hear?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy many hair products but got this at a salon and love it.  This particular purchase was for my mom, who also loves it.  And it doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the product.  No too greasy and tames my hair.</li>
    <li> I have medium-tight fine curly hair.  I bought this product after going to Sephora a couple days ago to buy my usual Ouidad Climate Control Gel, and finding out Ouidad is no longer carried in Sephora stores.  I was completely out of product, so I had to buy something to hold me over until I could order Ouidad&#x27;s Climate Control Gel online.  I had heard good things about other Bumble &amp; Bumble products so I decided to give this one a try.  Definitely will not be buying again.  I love how Ouidad&#x27;s gel leaves my curls lightweight, shiny, and frizz-free.  This creme is very thick and feels heavy when you put it in your hair.  I used the Ouidad rake and shake method with the creme, using small amounts as it is so thick, and proceeded to blow dry with a diffuser.  It left my curls feeling greasy and stiff, and weighed down.  I&#x27;m returning it and definitely will be sticking with Ouidad&#x27;s Gel, which I&#x27;ve been happily using for nearly 10 years.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Its the first one I&#x27;ve found where I can practically have wash and go curly hair.  Just put work it through damp hair and let it air dry or twist around fingers for defined curls.</li>
    <li> I have fought with my naturally curly crazy hair for all of my life..I have tried more products that I care to mention..but I do love this product! It truly delivers what it promises...frizz free,loose, non-stiff curls!  I just get out of the shower, towel dry very lightly, put it on and voila! Makes my curls looks sexy!</li>
    <li> I have been perming my hair for years and decided to give that up.  The curl creme is just what  my usually limp hair needs.  I love it.  It is pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have had curly hair my entire life.  This is one of the least effective products I have ever tried. It was recommended to me by a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I feel I gave it a fair amount of time, tried multiple times, in order to get the amount for my hair correct.  It does not tame frizz, does not define curl, does not enhance curl.&lt;br /&gt;If you use enough to tame frizz, it&#x27;s greasy, and the curl goes flat.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend investing your money to try this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I used it on my frizzy curls and my kids too (who are mixed race).  I recommend putting it on soaking wet hair and then scrunching with a towel.  Otherwise it can be really sticky.</li>
    <li> There is a nice, subtle rose fragrance to this hair cream that I love.  I&#x27;m usually allergic to scents, but this one is so subtle it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  So it&#x27;s nice to have something a little fragrant that I can enjoy without my eyes tearing and my nose burning.  And I love that it brings out the waves in my hair without making my hair the least bit crispy like mooses or gels.  I have bought several bottles of this and will definitely buy another when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> It really does not do what i thought it would do. I can&#x27;t see the difference in it and something less expensive.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine so it&#x27;s a little gummy going on.  I add a bit of water to it so that it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair away in my hands.</li>
    <li> Great product for my curls.  Gives my curls a natural look and feel without feeling heavily compacted with hair products.</li>
    <li> Works great on my fine curly hair.  Takes a little more than what bottle states but otherwise works for me</li>
    <li> Part of my regular hair routine.</li>
    <li> For all you people saying your hair is left greasy looking, your either using too much or you have greasy hair from the start. Maybe your not using the right conditioner? The only time i can see what would be a shiny or maybe greasy look would be from applying too much product. For a guy I have wet hair almost down to my waist that dries insanely curly and this stuff is bar non the best product I have ever used while my hair is long. No heavy feeling, keeps the locks tame, my hair always gets compliments from the ladies, thanks Bumble and Bumble.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and its the only thing that works on my natural curls and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily.  I have all the body and bounce that comes with curly hair, but less frizz and no crunchy hair.  A little goes a long way though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this for my curling but baby fine hair!  I&#x27;ve tried many products but this is the best.</li>
    <li> Not bad, at least it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
    <li> A good product to curls hairs, but not the best. Helps to defin, but not always. when it&#x27;s cold and windy, I have to pass a spray liquid after, to help hold and define my curls.</li>
