<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect product....perfect price point.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the cleaning brush very much.  use it twice a week especially when I wear makeup. I apply cleanser to my face and then wipe it off with a tissue, then apply a little bit more cleanser and use the facial brush and am amazed at how much makeup is still on my face. I think the facial brush could be a bite softer but then I have sensitive skin.  The one attachment that I realllly like is the sponge for applying moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t tried the shower/body attachment.</li>
    <li> I really love this face and body brush. I always wanted one but thought they were over hundred dollars. I was so happy when I found this one on line. It feels awsome on your face and body. The other thing that I love about it is that it is water proof so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wet while using it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and my acne has dramatically decreased! The trick is to use it with enough wash to make a good amount of lather to protect your skin from abrasion and to use it gently. If you scrub or use too much pressure, you can cause more damage to your skin and prevent it from improving at all. I immediately follow with some facial moisturizer to keep the skin soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I like it! Good product and no problems. I have been using it since December 2014.</li>
    <li> This face brush works just as it says it does. You can use it in the shower and you see a difference in your skin after only a week of daily use,</li>
    <li> was a gift - no compaints</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I purchased another of briteleafs facial brush kits and it served me well for years. When I was ready to purchase another facial brush, I knew that I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with a briteleaf product. This one is great, it completly spins as opposed to just vibrating, and the facial brush attactment feels great on the skin,not too hard, not too soft. I also love that it&#x27;s waterproof. If you are looking for a great product at a great value, this is the one you need to get.</li>
    <li> I loved this thing.  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good ever, I think.  It got a nightly workout in the shower, until a few nights ago.  I purchased this on October of 2012.  Now, in June of 2013, it&#x27;s dead.  That&#x27;s less than a year.  The motor was corroded.  The switch was corroded.  It&#x27;s dead.  So even though this says waterproof, it&#x27;s not completely.  If you&#x27;re using this in the shower, you may want to make sure you take it out and dry if off after you use it.  Open the battery case and dry that out.  The motor is behind the brush head, you can see where the cover is and that can be removed as easily as the battery case cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs a motor in a sealed chamber.  I&#x27;m looking for one now that is rechargeable and truly waterproof.</li>
    <li> Loved this product but it broke after having it for like 2 weeks :( Was good while it lasted although it felt like it was less powerful just after a couple uses</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really in a place to lay down $140 for the Clarisonic Mia, so I gave this baby a try and I am so happy with it.  I&#x27;ve used it every night to clean all the makeup out of my pores (my skin gets pretty oily by the end of the day), and then I moisturize. After the first few times I used it I broke out a little bit, but I think that was just makeup and dirt coming to the surface that had been trapped deep down. My face is so soft and clear now, and I love going to bed knowing my skin can breathe while I sleep. This company responded so kindly after I made my first review on the product, which was missing one of the brushes when I received it in the mail. They reached out and apologized, and then offered to send me another brush free of charge. I&#x27;m totally happy with my purchase and appreciate BriteLeaf&#x27;s great customer service.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time, easy to open package and my wife loves it, thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and the shipping was faster than I could have imagined. I received my package in just a few days, as promised. I used the Cleansing System on my face and neck before I went to bed and in the morning, my skin was radiant!! I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. One other notable fact is that I have oily skin, but after using the Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush, my skin lasted all day without shining. I&#x27;ve tried microderm abrasion products which dried my skin and caused rough patches, but this product left my face and neck soft and supple with no dry spots at all. I HIGHLY recommend this product, particularly to those who like me, have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love, Love this product! I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend 100&#x27;s of dollars... Best customer service too!! Can&#x27;t say enough good things! Would recommend to everyone. No need to look any further, this is an amazing brush!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Seems gentle but well made, small and simple to use. You can take it in the shower with the brush for body or use the smaller one for face. Also a sponge head and a pumice head.</li>
    <li> No matter how much you think that you did great job cleaning or exfoliating, you will be disappointed when use this!!!!  it did a good job clearing my face and my shoulders of acnes when you use it daily and handling the discoloration of you body. But you have to be patient and use it daily</li>
    <li> I assaultly love the brush.it is soft but dose the job well. I have fond thst it not only cleans my face feels tighter and looks full of color. I would recommend this to anyone that likes a clean feeling face.</li>
    <li> Exceeded all expectations and can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Received promptly. Works great!</li>
    <li> actually like this. figured with a battery, it would not be so well. but i wash my face and use the spongy part after that, and youcan see you left stuff in the pores. trying to say that w/o being gross</li>
    <li> its easy to use and it feels like a real massage</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically take very good care of my skin, but I have been enjoying using the brush system.  I have used it on my face and on my body.  It feels good, attaches and detaches easily, and is easy to clean and use.  I have only used it for a few weeks, and not every day, so I can&#x27;t say whether it really makes a difference cosmetically or not.</li>
    <li> This BriteLeafs face and body brush feels amazing! The brush heads are soft and gentle on my skin but they still do an excellent job cleansing and exfoliating. You will need 4 AA batteries (batteries not included) to get started. It took me a few minutes to open the battery compartment to install the batteries. I think mine was just sealed a bit too tight, it finally slide open so I could add the batteries. The battery compartment opens and closes easily now so whatever it was that kept mine sealed shut is no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle of this cleansing brush fits comfortably in my hand, even with a touch of arthritis it is easy to hold and use. The on and off buttons are easy to access on the handle and easy to press. What I love about this cleansing brush is having the ability to use it in the tub or shower. The body brush works great, just add a bit of soap or your favorite cleansing gel. Perfect to use before shaving or adding self tanners. You can use the soft little sponge to apply tanners, lotions, or even make up. It polishes your skin nicely as you go along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After bath or shower, while your skin is still soft, use the pumice stone to go around your feet. I didn&#x27;t think it would work very well, but after I tried it I noticed a difference to the skin on my feet. No more rough heels! I followed up with a nice moisturizer and my feet look and feel so nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small brush head works well with your favorite facial cleanser, just make sure you have your hair pulled back and away from your face as you use it. Keeping away from your eyes all you need to do is go around your face is small circles while the brush spins around. The brush is nice and soft and feels so good on your face. Because it is soft you might not think it is working but it is. After using this even one time you will notice a difference in the appearance and feel of your skin,... you&#x27;re left with super smooth and clean skin, you&#x27;ll love how it feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love using this face and body cleansing brush! I love that it is cordless and waterproof, and I love how it makes my skin look and feel after I am done using it! I recommend 100% and feel this would even make a wonderful gift for preteens and teens that are just getting serious about taking care of their skin as well as us older folks that have slacked off a bit over the years. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free product sample for review purposes.brush!

    <li> Purchased it for my wife and she loved it. It is easy to use and it is 4-in-1 vs just for face. Shipping is super fast. Overall, great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a month and i love how it cleanses my face and body and feet after washes.My face has cleared up so well,i had rashes beacuse of my natural hair always on my face.Check out my youtube for a review username nappturalguru,Hope you enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> This brush creates remarkably clear skin! I love it!</li>
    <li> the brush doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much power as other brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past...overall it&#x27;s an ok product</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof, cordless, and the large brush is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Heavy (4 AA batteries), one speed, no carrying case and the pumice attachment is poor quality.</li>
    <li> I love this facial brush! I suffer from dry skin and adult acne. The brush comes with multiple attachments, but the small round bristle brush is my go-to. It exfoliates my skin and gives me a deep clean I hadn&#x27;t experience until now. My skin looks brighter, cleaner, and it feels healthier to me! Plus, it&#x27;s waterproof and can be used in the shower. Love it and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my granddaughter as a christmas gift.  She was happy to get it but I have not idea how it&#x27;s working out for her. Sorry!</li>
    <li> One of attachments broke and have not used yet.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love it. I recommend this product. My skin looks feels clean after every use. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom for Christmas.  The reasons I liked it were that it was compact and waterproof.  My mom really liked the idea of it and I even used it once and it seemed to scrub the skin well without hurting it.  However, the product is packaged cheaply and the instructions are translated poorly, so for the price the gift came out looking like a cheap imitation.  To buy it personally, I think it would work for your needs.  To buy it as a gift, I wouldn&#x27;t advise.</li>
    <li> Spending $100+ on microdermabrasion device is ridiculous! (I still can&#x27;t believe why I purchased one from Sephora before...)&lt;br /&gt;So after I bought an expensive one, used it a couple of times, then I ended up not using it and gave it to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;Yrs later, I noticed fine lines, bigger pores and uneven tones of my skin. I need help with exfoliate my skin! Clearly, my hands alone didn&#x27;t do a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth your money. the bristles are gentle and cleanses the skin very well. I tried all 3 attachment and they deliver the results just like the one I bought from Sephora, if not better. So again... why did I spend that much?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, (chuckle) it does vibrate, and as some other Amazon reviewer mentioned... a personal toy of some sort...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this one instead of the Neutrogena one due to the fact that I can use this with any type of cleanser. Neutrogena is a fixed microdermabrasion pad with its own formula of exfoliate particles. Everyone has different types of skin, and at times, your skin needs a different kind of nutrient, so i chose something that gives me flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another thing about this purchase was that, it comes with the other 2 attachments which allow me to moisturize my skin with a facial massage which aids in puffiness of the face, better absorption, improved circulation, and evenly distribution of the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The body scubber attachment is awesome too. I no longer need my husband to scrub for me (lol jk) It definitely helps me to reach the back where I couldn&#x27;t reach before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after 2 weeks, my pore size, over all complexion of my face is improved (using 2x per wk)&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I had recently bought the facewash brush from Proactiv and loved it, but found out the hard way that it was NOT waterproof. So I was in the market for one that was and came across the BriteLeafs brush. Not only does it come with a facewash brush, but also a pumice stone, a large brush for exfoliating your body, AND a make-up/lotion sponge. AND it only cost me $30 when all the other brushes like this are from $50-$160. Loving it!</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old and have always looked after my skin but with age and too much sun when younger, I had started to notice that my skin lacked luster. I use facial scrubs regularly but they didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference. I have been using this product almost every day for the last 2 weeks and think that my skin looks better. Sort of glows a bit. Once I use the facial brush, then apply some moisturizer and mineral make-up I think it takes about 5 years off the look of my skin. Used pumice attachment on feet and it worked very well in the shower and used the body brush too which felt very good but not quite as good as using a natural loofah.  I chose this item because it was inexpensive but it actually feels like a quality product and the brush is soft on my face. I think that the waterproofing is a great idea as it is very convenient to use in the shower. Given the option, I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This product works great (for the face). I would give 5 stars except it doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of power. It runs on batteries which is convenient. The power is fine if you are only using this on your face where you need to be gentle, but if you try to use the larger body brush or pumice stone on your feet, it isn&#x27;t powerful enough and bogs down with very little pressure. So, if you need something for your face, this product is great; however, if you are looking for a more universal product, then keep looking.</li>
    <li> I received product promptly. I have only used the face brush as of yet. I do like it alot and it works well. I look forward to using the one for body and feet very soon. I will update once that it done. I would say this is a good buy compared to prices on others that i&#x27;m sure do the same work. Great buy! M~</li>
    <li> It is right on the mark for doing what it says.  It has made my face feel cleaner and smoother.</li>
    <li> Seriously, my face squeaks from being scrubbed so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny that TEI Spa attempts to warn consumers that theirs is the \\&quot;one and only\\&quot; rotating face brush when this brush is actually sold by at least 3 companies as [[ASIN:B004NJ8WFO Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System, Waterproof and Cordless]], [[ASIN:B004BASKAC g-maher Waterproof Rotating Face and Body Cleaning Kit]] and Dermatouch Skin Perfecting System. They are all the same and the brush heads are interchangeable. The Dermatouch brush comes with a normal brush head (same one that is sold by TEI Spa and g maher) and a feathery soft gentle brush head. Unfortunately, Dermatouch has non-existent customer service and does not respond to emails or live chat messages so I suggest getting the brush from one of the other sellers. I bought the Dermatouch brush at TJ Maxx and ordered replacement brush heads that fit (pumice stone, sponge and body brush) from TEI Spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this despite already owning the [[ASIN:B001SERK9G Pretika SonicDermabrasion Facial Brush]]. The brushes have two different technologies so its easy to justify the need to try both. The Pretika vibrates and this one spins. I was disappointed in the seemingly wimpy face brush bristles at first but the rotating action helps make it more abrasive. Only one speed but I think its perfect and wouldn&#x27;t want it any slower. I like that it is waterproof so I can use and leave in the shower. It was difficult to get the cap off to insert batteries, but it helps to tie something thru the hole in the bottom (like a shoelace) and use that to pull the cap off. I&#x27;d rather have it tight and secure to keep water out than easy to remove and risk having it ruined by water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much love it and use it every morning. It would be nice if the companies offered different textures of brush heads. I would love to try a slightly firmer one. And the super soft gentle one that came with the Dermatouch brush feels great when my skin is sensitive such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere. The body brush is too soft in my opinion and should be made firmer. The handle seems unnecessarily big but this is not a big deal. Compared to the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]], this brush is more abrasive and does a much better job at exfoliating.e such as after a chemical peel, though I don&#x27;t see it for sale as a replacement brush anywhere.

    <li> I was so excited about replacing my old one that quit working for some reason and I received the new one in no time flat! However, it only works half the time. I use it in the shower and when i turn it on, it&#x27;ll rotate then stop. I put it up to my face, it rotates then stops and so on, through out the entire time of trying to use it. In all fairness, i haven&#x27;t contacted the company yet and if they end up helping me, i will retract my review as long as the replacement works!</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes it, works great and love the attachments.</li>
    <li> I love the way it does help improve skin but 1/2 the time it won&#x27;t turn on! Or I turn it on, it wont work and after I am out of the shower it all the sudden starts working....Did I get a faulty one?????</li>
    <li> My husband bought me this for Christmas, and this brush is amazing!!! I love all the attachments especially the pumice stone! I would recommend this brush to anyone and I literally use it everyday when I wash my face!</li>
    <li> This is my first battery operated brush and for the money it really is nice. I wish it was a bit more powerful it has one speed i. I use it in the shower the face brush and body brush  both. I have to say I wont go back to manual after this. The attachment for feet really dose not have enough speed to do the job. Still worth the price!</li>
    <li> The face and Body Ultra Clean brush works really well. I use the large body brush to clean my back, legs, chest and arms. I also use the facial brush to take off my make-up at night and it cleans my face well because of the rotating action of the bristles, it gets deep down into the pores. The sponge attachment is used to apply microdermabrasion creams and it buffs the skin leaving it soft and smooth. I use the pumice attachment to loosen the dead skin cells on the soles of my feet. After that I apply moisturizer and the soles of my feet feels soft and smooth. I highly recommend this gadget to anyone who wants to improve the texture of their facial skin and who is looking for a very effective body brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this brush.  I was a bit skeptical and thought I would end up needing to buy the more expensive Clarisonic.  However, the BriteLeaf brush works really well.  When I finish cleansing with it, but skin is glowing and looks plumped up.  My facial therapist continues to tell me how great my skin looks.  It has cut down on the small bumps near my jawline also.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that if you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, this will work okay for you. I&#x27;d expect to see this in a Dollar General or similar store. It successfully spins one of the 4 included attachments. However, after the first use in the shower (no full submersion) the battery compartment had water in it. I had to open it up to dry before storing. The two brush attachments work as expected. The sponge attachment is a joke - for lotion - who would do that? The pumice is pointless, as the motor isn&#x27;t strong enough to allow much pressure.</li>
    <li> It works, but not nearly powerful enough for what I wanted. I would want both a coarser brush and a high rotational speed or powerful.</li>
    <li> Excellent rotation and love the bigger brush for all over exfoliation!</li>
    <li> Love this product, works incredibly well with Garnier Skin Blackhead Eliminating Scrub for Oily Skin, as the added charcoal in the facewash mixed with the routating head makes your skin super smooth and leaves your complection very bright. Its gentle, I&#x27;m a male so this is really nice to use in the shower as your face stuble makes it hard to wash your face throughly after a few days of no shaving.</li>
    <li> The brush is a little rough for the face but not something that bothers me too much it really keeps me from breaking out. :)</li>
    <li> please don&#x27;t waste your money! You can getsome kind of crap from the dollar store and you can do a better job then this crap! Waste of money</li>
    <li> I was using the \\&quot;Wave\\&quot; face machine prior to the purchase of this product. It was the one that rotated with 2 speeds. Since I have used the BrightLeafs machine I won&#x27;t go back to the Wave. It has a soft facing cleaning brush that is small enough to get into the \\&quot;creases\\&quot; of your nose with no problem. I could stand the bristles to be a little harder than they are, but when I use an \\&quot;exfoliate\\&quot; cream is works great to get down deep. I purchased the \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; one and it has a nice weighted handle to grip in the shower. I like all three of the attachments and am very glad I ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if this machine had at least 2 speeds but still it works well with just the one.</li>
    <li> I Love this product, the fact that I can use it in the shower with my regular face cleanser and body washes.  It works great, I need very little cleanser with it, and the rotating brush really gets my face and body clean and glowing.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the last 2 weeks.  It&#x27;s very gentle.  But with a small amount of soap, it gets a great lather on my face, and makes my skin feel very smooth after each wash.  To me, it&#x27;s a great bargain compared to the other very pricey brands.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to; cleanses my face, replenishes my skin. Absolutely do not regret buying it.</li>
    <li> This product along with Arbonne has made my super oily skin flawless! I previously owned an Olay brush and it was okay but certainly not as powerful and the brush head was not as full. You get what you pay for. ..great product!</li>
    <li> Love it!! It&#x27;s quiet and works excellent!!!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying my face and  body brush.  I think the condition of skin has improved with it&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> Felt so good on my face.  I am going to use the larger brush for my legs and arms.  I hope it takes the dry skin off.</li>
    <li> i bought this because i got a facial recently and the aesthetician told me i should be exfoliating more than i am with my little daily scrub. i really thought i was cleaning my face and just had weird little bumps and some acne because, who knows, hormones?? but it turns out i&#x27;m a gross person who apparently isn&#x27;t washing her face properly! after only one day i could tell a difference, and now it&#x27;s been 3 days and i practically don&#x27;t even need makeup anymore, my skin is so smooth and glowing all the time!! i love this little thing!! i didn&#x27;t want to pay $200 or whatever it costs to get the clarisonic one, and i honestly don&#x27;t see why you would. even if this breaks in 4 months, i&#x27;d say this has already been worth it! i&#x27;m so happy about my skin!!!! HOORAY! :)</li>
    <li> Face brush works really well. Improves complexion with just one use! However, pumice stone works better manually than attached to the motor as the motor really doesn&#x27;t revolve fast enough for callous smoothing action.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be stronger it seems to be weak proformance .</li>
    <li> This seems to be the brush I have been looking for.  It really cleans and I can notice a difference in my skin after just a few days usage.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this brush so much that I bought it twice.  The first one I kept solely in the shower and eventually it did seem to rust, but it helped my skin so much I bought it again.  I&#x27;m pregnant and have horrible skin right now, this helps a ton!!!!!</li>
    <li> This brush cleans my face just as well as the very expensive brushes.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This device for face is absolutely awesome. I don&#x27;t really care about presentation of this product (plastic box or paper box, whatever) but I do care how it works, and this one works very good. Because of 4AA batteries it is very powerful compere to Olay brush(I would give Olay 2.5 stars). All brushes that came with are very good. I&#x27;m using face brush every evening and it does clean your face! And 1-2 times/weak I&#x27;m using the sponge brush for microdermabrasion, that what is for(I apply the Clarince cream with microbeads and polish my face with spongy brush- works awesome). If somebody can not decide what is better: device with rotating brush or with vibration(for-example,clarisonic), I would suggest to go for rotating/spinning brush(it does much much better job by cleaning your skin and smoothing out wrinkles). For now I&#x27;m happy with this tool. I only wish this one will last long enough :)</li>
    <li> Brush does not stay on. Poorly made plastic. Otherwise seems to work OK. Here are your needed extra words. OK?</li>
    <li> I have been using the briteleaf&#x27;s face and body cleaning system and it has been working great so far. I have not used the applicator or the pumice but have used the large and the small brush. Both work as advertised.  It is waterproof and worked great on my dry skin, I do not see those dry spots anymore</li>
    <li> When this was working I loved it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of this no name brush.  Then about 5 weeks later it stopped working.  I figured the batteries needed replacing, which I was prepared to have to do often.  Unfortunately, when I opened the battery compartment there was black water and the corroded batteries fell out and left black stains on my carpet.  In between uses this was stored out of the shower and it wasn&#x27;t used daily.  Needless to say I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have aging skin and well....aging skin does all sorts of weird stuff!  This little machine solves some of those problems.  My skin is smooth and blemish free.  This system is also very gentle on my face and skims over it with ease while doing some major cleaning with a microderm cream.  I would highly recommend this product if you want something that works while being gentle on your skin.</li>
    <li> I Really like this brush. It helps to keep my skin clean. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The container was crushed when I opened the envelope it came in. THe brush itself ws very weak. Any pressure applied even just the tiniest pressure will cause the brush to stop rotating. The brush also is very wobbly when it rotates almost like it isn&#x27;t attached on but I have tried to push it on as far as it will go. I read the reviews and that is why I went with it and am SOOOO disappointed.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I brought this and had to return it the second day. The first day it was spinning slow and the second day it did not work at all. I put fresh batteries in it three times I am very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;in this product.We you buy a product online you want it to work. This is a true review</li>
    <li> I have been using for the past 3-4 days. So far so good. I love the product. I am using Neutrogena Pore refining daily cleanser since my pores are a bit bigger. It makes my face smooth and I am using skin whitening too. After I use the briteleafs I let it dry and removed the battery so that the water wont ruin it.</li>
    <li> A previous Xmas&#x27;s ago I asked Hubby to get me a battery operated, rotary face scrubber for me to use in the shower. He found this product and I have used it with much delight as it accomplished what I wanted, to clean my face easily and not be too rough to my skin. I was so happy with it, my sister asked about getting one, so this is what I purchased for her and she too is very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. I acually purchased couple extra face brush attachments as the one I had is just now starting to show wear.</li>
    <li> I loooove this Face and Body brush set! It works so well! I know it isn&#x27;t name brand like but for the price it works just as well. My face is smooth and I can see my skin tone evening out as well. Love it! Will be buying this as a gift for my sisters!</li>
    <li> The PRODUCT box came really damaged as they just shipped it in a padded envelope and it didn&#x27;t hold up well.  It didn&#x27;t damage the product itself but beware if you are buying as a gift. The first time I used it on my face, it felt great and soothing which lead to me over using it and it felt like I had a sunburn the next day (we&#x27;re not talking very long, maybe 2 mins?!?!) So just be careful and easy does it!  Now I use it once or twice a week and I&#x27;m careful only to go over the surface of my face only once. I really like the face and body brushes but feel the foot stone is not effective at all.  It&#x27;s just not strong enough or coarse enough in my opinion.  I&#x27;m overall satisfied with this product but glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for it as it&#x27;s barely worth it&#x27;s price as is.</li>
    <li> I had received a recommendation from my facialist to get one of these to exfoliate my face.  After much shopping around, I found this item and it was at a much better price than any of the others out there.  It came very quickly in the mail and I was so excited to use it, I did that very night!  My skin was glowing just from one use and I could not believe how easy it was to use.  All the attachments are waterproof and the machine itself is as well so I know it will last a long time.  I&#x27;ve already used the pumice stone on my feet as well and they already look amazingly smoother.  I just wish I had purchased this item sooner!</li>
    <li> Great product and price</li>
    <li> They delivered two to me by mistake, I believe. I only opened one, but the attachments don&#x27;t fit the handle and slip off for no reason. The body brush is just ridiculously rough and scratches your sensitive areas pretty bad. I used it during my evening shower (trying to keep it on, since it didn&#x27;t fit) and had to go to sleep with my skin burning. Even a mild pass leaves your skin red. The facial sponge is just dry, although very soft, and the facial brush is also quite rough. Honestly, I bought this because of very good experience with almost identical product from a different manufacturer, and this one is such a bust. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I am not going to pay the money for a comparable Clarisonic, and have been very pleased with it so far. I have been using the face brush attachment everyday, and the body brush attachment before I shave. My face definitely feels cleaner using this brush, and I can tell my legs get a smoother shave when using the body brush. I did try the pumice attachment on my feet, and it did nothing. I have so far found no use for the sponge attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did drop it in the shower a couple of days ago, and the battery compartment came flying off, and the four batteries went everywhere. Once it was dried out, though, it worked fine. Just a little irritation, as something that is used in a slippery shower should maybe be a little harder to come apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am completely satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brushes and this is my favorite. the brush is powerful but not to rough and it is easy to switch the brush heads just make sure you get the waterproof brush its worth it.</li>
    <li> This was purchased in March 2013 and it is broke.  I would not recommend it. Had I bought it locally I could return it.  The product should have lasted a lot longer.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> this is a cool piece for the price, however it is not as powerful as I would like it to be.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this and for the price, it&#x27;s a huge value.</li>
    <li> Item works great, on face and body softens polishes the skin, would like information on how to purchase accessories. ..</li>
    <li> This was a surprise gift for me.  My daughter and I had fun giving each other facials and pedicures using the various attachments.  We enjoyed the feel of the soft brush for the soap and the sponge for the facial cream, which we also cleaned and used it for a pedicure, foot &amp; leg massage.  The pumice stone worked well to remove the dead skin from our feet and our skin very clean and so soft after.  I recommend the product, as it worked great and although I use it to clean my face quickly each evening, I am really looking forward to our next pampering session! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The facial attachment is soft and gentle but does wonders for my pores. I like the sponge to apply moisturizer as it seems to help the skin absorb treatment better (I use differen after moisturizing). I&#x27;m not crazy about the pumice; maybe for maintenance, but I don&#x27;t have the time for that. The body attachment is great too. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I was excited to start using this brush. I used it for two weeks and I liked it for the most part. It wasn&#x27;t very powerful but I&#x27;d assume if it was more powerful it would damage my skin. After two weeks it stopped working. I went to replace the batteries and saw some corrosion. Looks like water got inside of it. I did not keep this brush in the shower but I did use it in the shower. I&#x27;m disappointed and I&#x27;m now looking for a new exfoliating brush. I will say my skin was softer than ever in the short time I used this product.</li>
    <li> This really works. It is waterproof.  Keep in the shower, and just touch the button to scrub face, fast switch to larger brush, and then scrupulous body.  Skin really feels smooth after using it.</li>
    <li> Worked great for 5 months then it stopped. I think the problem is the seal and maybe it&#x27;s gotten wet inside but I&#x27;m not sure. The company that makes this system was gracious enough to replace the unit, even though it was out of warranty. New system is working fine.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of positive reviews here. I think the product is garbage. Very poor quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING. PERFECT !!!!!</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product! It came very fast in the mail. It&#x27;s a lot more powerful than most facial brushes, and I used to have an Olay regenerist one. I love all the attachments that come with it, and it&#x27;s battery life is very long. Also it is waterproof, so I use it in the shower. Huge plus for me. So easy.</li>
    <li> This facial and body brush works great.  I requires 4-AA batteries, but is waterproof as I have used it in the shower without any problems.  It comes with 4 different attachments the are easy to &#x27;snap&#x27; on the handle.  The large brush is great for arms and legs.</li>
    <li> It is really not a bad deal for the price.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a little umph for their daily face routine</li>
    <li> Broke after 6 months of use.  Bought a replacement at Rite Aid for almost half the price.</li>
    <li> Broke after a week. Not water proof at all. Pointless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleansing system several times now and it seems to be very good quality. I have no complaints at all and the shipping was quick. I use in the shower a few times a week on face and feet, using a couple different attachments. I doubt I will get much use out of all of the attachments, but handy for some I am sure. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great product. Battery back is a bit hard to get off abs it takes 4 double A batteries, but I still really like it. Sadly, this totally quit working after just 1.5 months of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying using the facial brush.  I was pleasantly surprised that the brush seems to be soft enough for sensitive skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind slightly higher rpms.  I have not tried the other attachments, so, cannot comment on them.  :0</li>
    <li> Comparable to most on the market but the price seemed on the high side.I do love it though !!  Great !</li>
    <li> This unit is powerful and cleans well with the brush attachment.  I like that I can get my pores really clean without using harsh chemicals.  I wish it had a storage case.  I tried using a bag I had and ended up squishing the body brush!  :(</li>
    <li> I have only used the cleaning brush so far, but I am very happy with this product. In my opinion it&#x27;s better than the spin brush from Oil of Olay because it&#x27;s less expensive and the cleaning brush is set further away from the wand, which helps the wand stay dry while you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last one was from Oil of Olay and it died when I stopped using it and left it in the shower, which somehow caused the batteries to become corroded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend not taking this product in the shower even though it is wafer proof. I also recommend using this product in conjunction with a micro needle and Vitamin C to get healthier looking skin.</li>
    <li> It worked well for the first month and then started sputtering and working half the time. The power would cut on and off. It states it is water proof but water gets in where the batteries are very easily. I am not impressed with this brush and in fact am unsatisfied. Save your money and purchase a face brush such as ultrasonic. I know they are expensive but they are well worth the money and will last with a warranty!</li>
    <li> I was concerned that this would not have enough power being that it runs on batteries.... I was wrong.  This has plenty of power &amp; I love the different attachments. This company makes great products!</li>
    <li> Bought this mainly for the facial cleanser but what an amazing product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial brush really opens up my pours. I&#x27;ve used it with Neutrogena liquid soap and love the way it makes my skin feel. Also, I suffer from dry skin on my face from all of the acne treatments that I have to use and this has solved the flakey skin issue too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pumice stone feels amazing :-D Between the stone and my foot lotion, they are now perfect. Only problem I&#x27;ve had is that I dropped the stone once and it broke off of the plastic part completely. Solved the issue with some super glue but be careful in the shower :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, haven&#x27;t used the facial sponge or big body brush more than once each. Not for any particular reason, just haven&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this product, especially if you have dry, flakey skin on your face. Feels absolutely amazing :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it is most definitely water proof. Dropped it in a bubble bath and use it in the shower every day without any issues.</li>
    <li> This is good bang for your buck.  It does the job that it is designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment is not that hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;It requires 4 AA batteries, so you should get rechargable Ni-MH batteries and a charger.</li>
    <li> I liked this brush while it worked- for less than two months. My skin felt super clean and I liked the large brush for body exfoliation. However, the description claims it is waterproof- I used this in the shower and I know that is why it quit working. I was disappointed but not mad due to the low price. If you DO NOT use this brush in the shower, maybe it will last longer for you.</li>
    <li> This brush is great. My skin feels soft to the touch. When used on my face I noticed my pores seems smaller which also contributed to the softness. When using the body brush in the shower I come out feeling squeaky clean. Not to mention my boyfriend is in love with it as well. He loves using it saying &amp;#34;It&#x27;s soothing&amp;#34;.The foot scrub works wonders as well. My feet are soft and lovely. Perfect for an at-home pedi.</li>
    <li> Easy to use in the shower or at the sink.  Very similar to the one used at a salon I go to.</li>
    <li> The second time I was using this on my daughter her hair got caught! I had her hair clipped back but there were some wispy pieces hanging out. Her hair got caught on the spinning rod that the brush attaches to. It ripped her hair out and it happened so fast. This is my second cleaning brush like this. My other one I had for 5 years and it finally died :(  I couldn&#x27;t order a new one, it was discontinued. The brush attachment on my old one had a &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; on it so we never had this problem. I will continue to use it but I will be careful to have her hair pulled back and I won&#x27;t  let her use it herself. My daughter is a preteen and is dealing with the beginnings of acne. We&#x27;ve only had this a week and have already seen results! I use the sponge attachment on myself to exfoliate and am happy with my results also. It is comparable to my old unit but much less expensive!</li>
    <li> EDIT:  Supplier contacted me to offer another chance too have a good relationship with them after they sent a unit that batteries could not be forced into.    Edit: After to much time passed that I should have updated, I do now and say this unit I have is outstanding. I am so glad the customer service contacted me too make it right. Only issue is you have to be very very careful to not get close to long hair as it will grab and better find off button fast.  Like I said kudos to customer service. I first was delivered a true piece of crap that did not let the batteries be installed at all.    After I did a real review customer service contacted me and took charge of making it right so I could give it a true workout.    If my reviews have helped you,\\&quot;Please\\&quot; click below.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product,works great. Only problem I had is getting the battery cover off to install batteries, I hope they last a long time because I was so afraid I was going to break it. My main draw back is I was going to order the refill for the face brush and the shipping is higher than one brush! I love the product though but I really wish you could get a better deal on the refills!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! The face brush, body brush and face spomge cleanse and exfoliate my sensitive skin without irritating it and leave it radiant. The price can&#x27;t be beat, so don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive versions.</li>
    <li> I love this and I have given as gift to 3 family members. They love it too.4 stars is Because I have to grip tightly for it to work sometimes but I think my son dropped it one to many times so the connection is funky. No problems from the family members thou</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this. She&#x27;s used it daily for a few weeks now and has seen complection improvements as well as softer skin. It is more powerful than I expected at this price range, it has some torque! I really don&#x27;t think spending more money would be worth it, seems like this is about as good as it could get.</li>
    <li> Love the product, as really helped improved the quality of my skin! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving the BriteLeafs Clean Brush five stars because it honestly deserves it. It has exceeded my expectations of a brush this cheap. I was scouring amazon for a cleansing brush that came with a detachable sponge piece and I&#x27;m very glad I picked this one. Other reviews say it doesn&#x27;t spin or it craps out after some usage. I have not had this problem. When I first got it, I thought the brush had this problem but I realized I put in 2 batteries that were old. You need to put in fresh batteries for the brush to spin with intensity. I definitely notice my skin is healthier, clearer, brighter, and softer. Worth  your money and time investment. Also their customer service is amazing. I use the sponge part to put on moisturizer and the sponge was disintegrating a bit from usage. They are mailing me 2 in the mail for free. Finally, a company that actually cares. Thanks BriteLeafs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 and I have acne prone skin.  While the worst was in my late teens when the only thing that helped was Accutane, I&#x27;ve never fully mastered my skin and have been nursing a small or large breakout for most of my post adolescent life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After turning 30 and feeling like my acne was ridiculous to be this old, I decided to try some chemical peels to improve my skin tone and improve the hyper-pigmentation that resulted from some blackhead scarring. This worked well for my skin tone and hyper-pigmentation, but I was still getting breakouts!  My aesthetician recommended the Clarisonic, however I was skeptical about spending so much for a facial care system.  I decided to do some research and landed on this product.  Boy am I glad that I did!!!  I started using it on July 10 (3 weeks ago) and my skin now looks flawless. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments. My hyper-pigmentation is continuing to improve because the topical medicine can penetrate my skin better.  Also the cleansing is amazing!  My skin is completely clear and soft.  I give the BriteLeaf most of the credit for this because I think it is helping the excellent products I have to do their job more effectively.  I haven&#x27;t changed products since I got this system.  I wet the BriteLeafs and put the products on the small facial brush.  I mix the Pan Oxyl 8% and Ageless Total Facial Cleanser during the luteal phase of my cycle (nearing my period when I&#x27;m prone to more breakouts) and the Total Facial Cleanser with an Ageless Acne Salicylic Acid wash during the follicular phase (after my period until ovulation when I usually experience fewer breakouts).  I follow my cleansing with the Proactive Repairing lotion, Ageless lightening serum, and Target brand light moisturizer with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I think my products are effective, I think they&#x27;re able to do so because of this brush. I can&#x27;t sing its praises enough.  For the past three weeks I&#x27;ve been using it twice per day and it hasn&#x27;t been too rough for my skin.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, I felt that it had the right amount of power to gently clean the skin, and the brushes were easy to change and stayed on. The waterproof feature is awesome so using it in the shower was a breeze. I think it&#x27;s a great product  and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!!I would highly recommend this product for anyone whom loves to feel deeply cleansed and refreshed!Also all the different brushes gives you a very versatile cleansing palette!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these but this machine has already cleared up my skin!  I am using it with one of the top Amazon cleanser products and it&#x27;s been instrumental to my skin.  Great product at lower price!</li>
    <li> Been using this for about three weeks now. Its quite sturdy and seems satisfactorily water resistant (I never use it under directly under water just to be safe). Its definitely deep cleaning and better than using hands alone. I don&#x27;t like the sponge personally and I dont use the pumice stone but its nice to have. I really like the body brush. Im ok with the face brush but its a bit rough feeling. I dont mind that for the most part, it doesnt irritate my face or make me break out. Worth the money, the only recommendation I would have for BriteLeaf is to make a sensitive brush attatchment.</li>
    <li> Although I have only used the 2 brushes so far and have not tried the Pumise Rough Skin Brush I am very satisfied with this product; I can highly recommend this product for Good Value for Money and its efficacy to my very rough face due to Acne.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my skin with the first use. I have always wanted a cleansing brush but did not want to spend $200. What a bargain this is! Worked great right out of the box. A must have for soft, clear skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product when I first got it. The brushes are soft and gently exfoliate, leaving skin feeling fresh and new. Then I tried the pumice stone adapter to smooth heels after a good soak. Seconds into the process the pumice detached from its holder rendering it completely useless. Still use the brushes. Hence the two stars. Bummed about the broken pumice, it could have been awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic tool.  It is extremely versatile and has so many uses.  First, I want to start by saying that I have been a Clarisonic Mia user for years.  The replacement brushes for the Clarisonic are so spend, though.  You can buy this entire Brite leafs set up for the same price as a Clarisonic replacement head.  And I have found I actually like this one better!&lt;br /&gt;My overview of the brush:&lt;br /&gt;1.). The main unit is nice.  Fits comfortably in my hand.  Easy to turn on/off.&lt;br /&gt;2.). The facial brush is amazing.  I prefer the way this one rotates compared to the Clarisonic vibrating.  After I wipe my makeup off with a remover wipe, I use this.  I can see more makeup coming off of my face with this brush.  As a result, my skin looks clearer and brighter since using this.  I never got that with the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;3.). Facial sponge:  I use this to apply my foundation (don&#x27;t press to hard, though).  Gives excellent EVEN foundation application.  This was a surprise for me, I didn&#x27;t think I would get much use out of the sponge applicator, but I was wrong.. You have to try it for foundation application!&lt;br /&gt;4.) Body brush:  awesome for dry-brushing! If you don&#x27;t know what dry-brushing is, google it.  This puts a whole new &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; on dry brushing.  One improvement briteleafs could make would be to include a head with firmer bristles (Tampico fiber) to specifically be used for dry-brushing.&lt;br /&gt;5.) pumice stone- nice!  Works well!  Makes feet super soft.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this system.  It is well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this product.  I definitely see a difference in the way my face feels and look. I&#x27;ve only used the facial scrub attachment but look forward to using the other attachments.  Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel amazing without pulling or tugging! Would def recommend to friends. Worth the low price! Good product.</li>
    <li> Love this little gaget. Lightweight, compact and works wonders. My face goes through stages where there are days that my whole face feels like I just rubbed grease and oil all over it eventhough you dont see it. I can wipe my face but that &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; still doesn&#x27;t go away....that is why I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. My face feels so clean and refreshed after using this cleaning system. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face brush. I dropped my previous one a couple of times (oops) and it finally died after hitting my tile floors pretty hard, repeatedly. I had been living without one of these for about a week, and I was going crazy! Without this brush I break out, especially in places like my neck. My pores get clogged and I cannot seem to get all of my makeup off. Since it&#x27;s the summer and the season of sunblock, my face is taking a beating with all of the products I&#x27;m putting on it. Three days after being back to using this brush I can already see a different. My acne is starting to heal and I haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts since then. Thank goodness for this affordable life changer!</li>
    <li> Product came quickly after order; all in working condition; daughter likes the head/brush options and has used it regularly.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good alternative if you can not afford the Clarasonic. It definitely cleans well and I like it. It won&#x27;t give you the sonic vibration but it will clean your skin better than washing with your hands and it will exfoliate pretty well.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have had mine for about 6 months and my skin has cleared up to almost perfect! I always seem to have a pimple or two here and there And now I almost never get any! And if I do they are gone much quicker now that I use this brush! I use mine morning and night because I am addicted and I love that the replacement heads are cheap! I was going to buy a clarisonic but decided to try this first since it was cheap and I&#x27;m glad I did. I love it !</li>
    <li> I have had my cleansing system now for a couple of weeks and I really like the way my face feels after I have used it.  I have also used the pumice stone on my feet and it does a good job.  I would highly recommend it to anyone considering a facial cleansing system.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is exactly what I was looking for. It is gentle and yet very effective in it&#x27;s ability to cleanse and minimize pores. So glad I bought it. I also like the bonus body brush and the little sponge that comes with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for yourself or a friend.  It&#x27;s lightweight, but requires 4 batteries, but is waterproof so can use in the shower.  I used the body brush once just on my legs in the evening to relax myself to sleep and get the circulation going.  Not ebrasive at all, and I have sensitive skin.  I used the face brush with my regular face cleanser and it was very nice to cleanse the pores better, so didn&#x27;t have to use a secondary scrub that I often use after the cleanser.  I still need to try the buffer for softening the heels, but for someone who doesn&#x27;t go for extra gadgets, this is really a nice item that is VERY EASY to use and keep clean, and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  I recommend the product.  It&#x27;s the 2nd item I have from them, so am interested to get more things from BriteLeafs.</li>
    <li> Seems like a pretty good product.  I&#x27;ve never used one of these, so don&#x27;t have any comparisons to make.  I like that it&#x27;s waterproof, certainly.  And it&#x27;s compact enough that it would travel easily, as well.  The brushes are gentle, so no worries there.  Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know how long/well it&#x27;ll hold up.</li>
    <li> My skin actually got worse using this. If you plan on using this brush make sure you moisturize.</li>
    <li> I received the cleansing product very quickly. Overall I was pleased with this and love that you can use for the entire body. I especially like the big brush head for the body and that there is no timer on it. I also have a clarisonic, which I love but the brush head for the body is much smaller.  I prefer the brite leafs cleansing system for the body but prefer the clarsonic for the facial cleansing.  I am ok with the pumice stone on the brite leafs, for the feet.  I am fortunate to not have a buildup of dead dry skin on my heels or souls of my feet, so it worked okay.  Would I purchase this as a gift for someone or for myself, yes to both.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece as a xmas present and she loves it. She has break out problems and this really helps as it gets rid of dead skin.</li>
    <li> I used it couple of times and felt it does exactly what was expected of it. Good one for this price.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I love everything about it. My skin feels so soft and smoothe. Its built to last. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  I love that it includes a body brush.  I believe it is comparable to my clarisonic as far as cleaning my face and body for much less in price.  It also has a buffer brush for applying  liquid makeup and that is nice for  smoothing excess foundation.  The  foot buffer however broke off the handle when it fell in the shower so for that I am giving it 4 stars.  And a timer would be nice.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great appliance. Does a wonderful job of cleaning my face getting into every pore. The water proof design make it easy to leave in the shower hanging from a hook.</li>
    <li> I got this product as a gift and it&#x27;s perfect for me. All of the attachments are wonderful and have improved the feel and look of my skin! It&#x27;s a must buy especially for people who have been looking at products like this such as Clarisonic, but it&#x27;s a better deal!</li>
    <li> I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS PRODUCT TILL MY GIRLFRIEND AT WORK TOLD ME ABOUT IT.  HER SKIN WAS SO LIGHT AND REFRESHED.  I BOUGHT MINE AND I AM HAPPY WITH IT.  MY FACE AND BODY IS SO RADIANT.  THANKS AMAZON. THE QUA;ITY WAS ABOVE MY EXPECTATIONS.  YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS A TRY.  IT REALLY IS GOOD FOR YOUR FACE  AND YOUR BODY.</li>
    <li> I love and appreciate this.  It cleans better than my other drugstore scrubbers.  I especially appreciate it when it&#x27;s late and I&#x27;m tired and I don&#x27;t have to do much work to get my face and pores clean.</li>
    <li> Incredibly usefull.  I use it reguarly.  Hope the removable parts are available for long time.  Cheaper than the one offered by  major cosmetic brand</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Good ergonomics and solid feel. Gentle brushes and no issues after first use. I like that it takes batteries for portability and no extra chargers on the vanity. Will see how it holds up, but I guess I&#x27;ll get years of good use.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! My face feels so clean after I use it. No need to spend all of that money for the Clarisonic</li>
    <li> This is the first facial brush I&#x27;ve used so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but I absolutely love this system. The facial brush helps get off all the dead skin and clean out my pores better than just using my hands. My face is left feeling so soft afterwards. The attachments are great, I&#x27;ve used them all and don&#x27;t have any complaints. The speed of this product is at the right speed and doesn&#x27;t slow down when you touch the brush to your skin. I do recommend this product.  Customer service is also super helpful if you have any questions.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for an excellent price! This system stacks up to the high prices ones and is so much more wallet friendly. I will be recommending this to my friends and family</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times so far and I like the results. The only thing I would change would have been a stronger oscillator for the device. I have an oily T-zone and need a little more kick when exfoliating that area.</li>
    <li> After about one use it just stopped working, I even put new batteries in it and it still would not work. Just junk. So upset I wasted money on this.</li>
    <li> I originally was going to purchase an item from groupon around the same price, turns out this item was much more useful with all the attachments. The quality of the product is solid. I bought the product for my girlfriend and she couldn&#x27;t be happier. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap in your hands, the attachments are made out of good materials and the motor on it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Have used this on my face a few times.  I does just what I wanted...cleans nicely so that when I apply moisturizer that it soaks in better. I even notice some pore tightening, already.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the pumice stone on my feet and it works well and used the larger brush on the legs for exfoliating.  Everything works. For the price&lt;br /&gt;this is doing just what I wanted.  I am not sure how long it will be before I need to get replacement heads, the paperwork says every 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they actually last longer, no doubt, it will depend on use. I was actually hoping it would be more like once a year for brush replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she is very pleased with it. She especially likes the large brush that she uses on her chest and shoulder areas. Other products that she hinted at wanting do not have this feature. She says it is better than what she had originally hoped for.</li>
    <li> Cleans face amazingly well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve officially been using this for about two weeks now and the results are remarkable! I was very skeptical because I was weary of getting a non &#x27;name brand&#x27; brush for my skin but the other options are so expensive I figured I would go to the next best option and choose the highest rated affordable one on amazon. I have never been more pleasantly surprised. My skin looks amazing! I have acne prone skin and this has done wonders for making my skin feel soft and smooth. I use it every night and the first time I used it I was surprised how much cleaner my skin was and felt. It got out so much extra makeup after I had already washed my face! It also reduced the size of my pores significantly in my t-zone and on my cheeks near my nose. I didn&#x27;t order the replacement brushes with it but I plan to get them now that I&#x27;m sure I love it. Yet to use the pumice stone but I have used the polishing sponge with coconut oil on my face twice a week. Sublime.    I know other reviewers have talked about rusting in the battery compartment so I wipe it down when I use it to make sure water doesn&#x27;t get trapped inside and cause problems. Small price to pay, it&#x27;s a pretty great product!</li>
    <li> it came fast and it works great what else can you say</li>
    <li> I use to use the susan lucci and they discontinued the brushes for the one I had so I bought this. It works great. I dont have super sensitive skin but if I use it everyday for a couple weeks my face will feel a little raw so I use it once a day or so. I break out here and there and this seems to help the breakouts occur less frewuently and they go away quicker. I use this with Philosophy face wash. The rotating brush works great. I thought I would miss the vibration but you dont need it. Leaves the face squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> The bottom kept coming off after a few months use. Had to jimmy rig it to keep it on &amp; waterproof with a rubber band. 😕</li>
    <li> Never had a clairsonic, but this facial brush worked well until I needed a replacement brush head. Might as well buy a new set since the price for a new brush head and shipping is close to a whole new set!</li>
    <li> After hearing good things about the name brand version of this tool but not wanting to drop $100+ on a single brush head with faulty battery issues, I purchased this version. I use the face and body brushes, haven&#x27;t tried the foam or pumice ones. The tool works great in the shower (waterproof) and I&#x27;ve had the same set of batteries for 2 months with no reduction in spin level, meaning they will last. I did not experience any significant breakouts in the first 2-3 weeks that others seem to warn about, but it also has not significantly changed my complexion in the 2+ months I&#x27;ve had it either - my skin feels smoother but about the same in little time-to-time breakouts. I use the body brush on my keratosis pilaris afflicted arms and there has been a noticeable reduction in bumps. The brush also makes my rougher elbows feel much smoother. 4 stars because I think they should include batteries in the pack, but oh well. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this item.  I would buy it again or as a gift for others.  Convenient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! After just one use, my face was radiant.</li>
    <li> Works nicely. Love all the attachments.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my granddaughter.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Love this Clean Brush.  It comes with several different attachments.  Love the big brush for my legs.  Live in warm weather, so have problems with dry skin.  This helps so much.  It only has one speed, but don&#x27;t know why I would want it faster or slower, so happy with it.  I think you would like this, as it price is good compared to some models.</li>
    <li> You  get a lot for the price, works great. I own the clarisonic and needed to replace the head, this was the cheaper alternative and came  with other attachments and cost less than the clarisonic replacement head.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;this product worked great.. did what it was suppose to do.. no complaints. I am writing this two months after receiving\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I learned a long time ago that the price of an item is not nearly as important as the value of that item. Just because something may cost less, if it doesn&#x27;t meet your expectations it loses value. I am so pleased with the BriteLeafs Face and Body Cleansing System because it has really helped with my very dry winter skin and at an affordable price. The face brush is soft but still sturdy and the pumice attachment made a huge difference on my heels the first time I used it. Finally, it&#x27;s important to purchase from a company that stands behind its products. I had a minor issue with one attachment and the customer care representative exceeded my expectations in addressing it. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing it gets more makeup off than scrubbing ever did</li>
    <li> Wife lOves it so no reasons to complain</li>
    <li> Works great in the shower and nothing lost with only one speed on this brush!  One thing that would be even better would be a caddy or holder to keep it all together.  Very pleased with the product and would definitely recommend to anyone - male or female!!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy how clean my face feels after I use this.  I can see a big difference in the size of my pores since I started using it. I highly recommend this cleansing system.</li>
    <li> I have used each style/piece once so far and was amazed at how user friendly it was and quick. I did it right in the shower. I honestly did not think I would take the time to use this much but with how easy it is to add to my shower routine, it will be a regular part of my routine. The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 is because I did not notice softer skin, but that could be because it is my first time using it or maybe you are not supposed to notice since it is such a &#x27;fine&#x27; change. The pumice stone does help grind down rough spots on the feet though and all of the pieces feel great! Sort of like a massage in some ways.</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft but do the job and my face felt soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of homework on facial cleaning systems and ended up buying this one. I am so happy I made the right choice. I used the brush with my favorite face soap. Wow, after the first use, my skin felt so soft. Since then, I have been using it every other day for almost 6 months. And it did a great job in helping to clear my acne. I did notice the change on my skin. It could be because after routine exfoliation, my skin absorbs  better and I use the sponge to apply my night cream. So very very happy. I do not use the pumice stone that often. But it is a great extra feature. The only thing I wish they could do better is to add a holder. Overall, great buy for the price and quality.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid I think I got my money&#x27;s worth. The product works as advertised and I have had no problems with it. My skin feels great and I like using it on my feet as well. The sponge will need to be replaced more often than the other brushes and I only use 1 kind of face cream with the sponge. You should also find something to hold it in so the brushes dry after use. Over all good product</li>
    <li> At first, I thought that this was a decent product. However, because of its cheap manufacturing, after some the top part (side away from the brush) kept falling off, which exposed rust. The whole inside had rusted over. I found it would stop working if there was too much rust, so I would attempt to rinse it with water (never in the shower, of course). It revived the brush a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then one day, it suddenly stopped working in the middle of my shower. I tried to rinse the rust off, but it still wouldn&#x27;t work. I then went to go replace the batteries. When I did, I found that water had seeped into the battery compartment, rusting it, and my batteries leaked acid onto my hands. After that, I completely gave up on this product. This happened only 4 months since I started using it, too. Do not buy! Or if you do, please be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: The only redeemable quality this purchase had was customer service. Customer service was great!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on expensive body exfoliators, this will do the job just as well. I use this product weekly!</li>
    <li> This is so good. The variety of attachments is great. It exfoliates as it cleans. My husband had terrible acne on his back and since using the bath attachment, his back is really clearing up. I would highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> I started using this in mid-January, and it has really made a difference on my face fighting my adult acne.  I haven&#x27;t used the other attachments yet since I only got this for face washing, but I am curious to try the pumice attachment.  Battery life seems to be really good; haven&#x27;t had to change them yet and haven&#x27;t noticed any loss of power.</li>
    <li> Great and well built.</li>
    <li> I love this product. After just a few uses my face is much softer and smoother. I does not oscillate the same as some of the more expensive models but does a great job at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!! I&#x27;ve now purchased 3 of these and they break after a month. The most recent one I babied and didn&#x27;t even get it wet or drop it. Still stopped working after using once a day for about 30 days. I get Maybe 30 to 40 uses before they break.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price. However, when I received it, the package looked like it had been used or opened because it wasnt sealed with anything and the tabs on the box were worn out. Be careful with ordering from this vendor. The cleaning brush is kind of hard and I would not recommend using it everyday. It requires 4 AA batteries and gets pretty heavy so don&#x27;t expect it to be lightweight. Overall, it did it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It really does get your face clean. I thought I was doing a good job by washing my face with face cleanser and using my hands. Boy was I wrong. You will not believe how much cleaner your face gets by using the BriteLeafs Cleansing system. My pores got smaller and my blackheads disappeared leaving my skin smoother and brighter. Skincare products are more effective when the face is really clean. You will not be wasting products on a dirty face that the product will not absorb into the skin. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $200.00 price tag for the popular one that pulses. I wanted a cleansing system that the head rotates. I clean my face first with cleanser using my hands to remove makeup before I use my BriteLeafs if I don&#x27;t have any makeup on I omit this step. I then use cleanser or add microdermabrasion crystals to my cleanser and using the BriteLeafs with the brush head I clean my face. Last step I then apply my skincare products. I am so glad that I made this purchase. Try it you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> This product has been the best that I have tried. I love it and would recommend it to all of my friends/family. The customer service has been absolutely amazing and supportive with a defective brush that i initially received.</li>
    <li> This first type of device I bought like this was Olay brand.  I liked it until it started to get water into the battery compartment and died.  Then I searched for another brand and found this one.  I think it cleans much better than the Olay brand one.  I like that it can be hung.  The pumice stone doesn&#x27;t work very well, but I bought it for the face cleaner part.  I like the body brush, but feel like it could have more power when using it.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I was very excited by this product! It was amazing, making my face very soft while clearing up my acne (which has always been a problem for me). I was especially excited about this product&#x27;s ability to go in the shower because it made my life so much easier, until this past week when it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I tried clicking it on an off for a bit, but that didn&#x27;t help. So I opened it up and found water had leaked into the machine because it was damp inside and rusty. It no longer works and both the machine and batteries have corroded/rusted. Now neither the machine nor the batteries will work :(&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed this product and it did amazing things for my acne, but please if you buy it don&#x27;t take it in the shower with you. :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new facial exfoliating system to use with my Youthful Essense facial scrub.  This product is perfect! It not only has the cleansing brush but the sponge that works well with my facial scrub.  At first I thought the small diameter of the brush and sponge might be an issue but it wasn&#x27;t.  I can use it on my forehead and on the side of my face with ease due to it&#x27;s smaller brush diameter. I also don&#x27;t get facial cleanser or on my hair because the brush/sponge are smaller.  I thought the way the brush and sponge connect to the unit would be an issue, it is slighly elevated and connects by snapping onto a post.  It was not an issue, it actually keeps the remainder of the unit cleaner. It is waterproof and small enough to travel with and easy to since it is battery operated.  I was looking at a few others that were priced much higher, some I have had but this is by far the best unit overall I have purchased and used.  Well designed, well made, easy to use. Love it!</li>
    <li> This has helped my moisturizers be absorbed much better for my skin.  Pore shrinkage is also evident, as are some of the fine lines beginning to look less prominent.  It is a good product for the price, and does what it says it will do.  I really like this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works on a slower speed so very good for sensitive skin, and&lt;br /&gt;does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the results, and others have too.</li>
    <li> I like the cleansing system but the brush is a little rough. I would recommend that they make a softer brush.  I also get cleanser all over the place but maybe all brushes do.</li>
    <li> i like you using it a lot. The cleansing system really help with making my face  and body feel and look bright.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing system. I use the face brush almost every day and the body brush and pumice every night! Leaves skin feeling clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> This brush is great for people with never ending acne - like myself. Use twice a day and it helps keep pores clean.</li>
    <li> It removes the daily grime gently in the shower without removing the skin and having 4 batteries means it lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;before changing batteries, unlike other products.</li>
    <li> Nice addition to my skin care.</li>
    <li> At first it seemed as though it was used before because there were spots on the tool. I still used it though, and omg you really dont need another speed just this one is fine. I have or I rather had a darkness around my mouth, neck and forehead and i have been using this machine with a skin lighthening soap and i have seen remarkable results. I cant remember when last my skin looked so even toned. I was it morning and nigth with the soap and i follow up with a skin lightening cream. I must say i am glad i didnt return this product it has changed my life in about two months. I would recommend this product since it not only evenout my complexion it also reduced my pores, reduced my fine lines and plumps up your skin and it also reduced my mild breakouts. Off course i drink the required amouth of water needed daily and i eat lots of papaya which is great for your skin.  After a two weeks of using it i was complimented by so many people who noticed a difference.  This turned out to be my best online purchase ever.</li>
    <li> At the moment I am NOT happy with this purchase.  I have tried everything  except the hammer to get the base of the handle off to put in the batteries.  It is stuck stuck stuck.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for home facials. Saves you time and money. Versatile too can be used for pedicures and as a body scrubber</li>
    <li> The product works great quick delivery😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 love it</li>
    <li> It is not quite the quality that I was expecting.  For the price I was expecting more.  It will be sufficient however.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love how it cleans my face.  The pumice attachment is an added bonus to me.</li>
    <li> Waited anxiously for the product to start facial routine, too only be blocked by the design. My brother and I couldn&#x27;t open the bottom to remove it for the batteries to be entered to operate the device.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. My face looks so refreshed after I use the super soft face brush. I broke out just as I moved into my dorm and this brush and cetaphil totally took care of it within a week. My friend is a little jealous because she paid 100 bucks more for the same product from a different company before I found this steal!</li>
    <li> Product works well.  Teen granddaughter loves it.  Brush is soft and does not irritate skin.  Quite, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that could be used in the shower and this does that.  Overall I am very happy with the system and feel it works as advertised and I am pleased with the system.  I have seen many systems that do the same as this one at a much higher price.  So I think this one has a good value as well.</li>
    <li> I would buy this device just for the pumice stone attachment. It made my feet so smooth! I tried the other attachments and they were too rough for my face and body but I have pretty sensitive skin. The body brush was nice but I wanted to use it at a slower speed. I think if there was an option for varying speed levels the brush would be amazing.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product and it was shipped quickly. I used it the very day I received it and it works wonders. It does require 4 AA batteries which aren&#x27;t included, but whatever. I noticed a change in my skin when I woke up the next day. Definitely a fantastic buy 😊</li>
    <li> Actually, I bought this for my girlfriend so I can&#x27;t comment too much, but I did test it for a while.  It seemed well constructed and sturdy.  The different brushes were easy to switch out.  The motor is powered by four AA batteries and it seemed to have a strong amount of torque. The sponge head seemed a little small in diameter but whatever I dont really know.  I hope it works on her.</li>
    <li> A good device. Sufficiently accurately removes the top layer of skin, but of a special cleansing pores I have not noticed.</li>
    <li> Love the gentle and effective brush on my face. Use it with a cream cleanser in the morning and a foaming cleanser in the evening. It works great with both. After about a week I saw the steady results of my skin clearing...even the &amp;#34;sweat pimples&amp;#34; from going to the gym and living in a humid southern climate are faded away. Great product...don&#x27;t pay $100 or $200....this does the job well!</li>
    <li> It seemed like a great product for a fraction of the cost of the competition.  It broke in the 11th month of use.</li>
    <li> Love this device!  My only issue with it is more about the documentation on using it.  It offers no suggestions on how often to use the scrubber on your face.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Allows me to feel like I&#x27;m getting a facial without the price. Had no problems so far with it</li>
    <li> The brush is all it says it is and works just great.  It was sent and I got it the next day. Was worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I like it very much! I have a health issue that causes my skin to be extremely dry. This little machine helps me get off all the dead dry skin allowing my creams to do their job. I wish it had something to hold all the little attachments together to be kept in the shower but made up my own. I gave one to my sister for Christmas and she loves it! She has trouble with too much oil! So either way, it works great!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really complain for what i spent.  The motor is fairly weak, so the body scrub stops rotating on contact but the smaller brushes do fine.  I really like the fact it is waterproof.</li>
    <li> Love my device and water did not cause any issues at all.  Girlfriend was taking a shower and knocked it off the stand and broke it, but I&#x27;m ordering another one because it is a great unit.</li>
    <li> I tend to get sebaceous cysts on my face and was told to deep cleanse to prevent it. Keep this in the shower and use it daily. I feel well scrubbed when I&#x27;m done and helps with shaving.</li>
    <li> I bought a cheap face brush for 6$ at a discount store and immediately saw results in my complexion. But after leaving it in the shower a few days it no longer worked. I bought this one and it IS waterproof. I love it and my skin feels so clean and I no longer break out. I work at an indoor water park, which is kept at 85 degrees and immense humidity! My face breaks out SO bad. I now use this to wash my face in the morning, when I get home from work, and before I go to bed. My girlfriend comments on how soft my face is, and so does our best friend Nicole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed,&lt;br /&gt;One happy girl!</li>
    <li> I bought the BriteLeafs Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush for facial care.  It works, in that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  However, the machine does not stand on end like it does in the photograph of the product, so I cannot stand it up to dry.  The bottom portion has a hole, and I may try to create some kind of hanger so I can hang it to dry.  It also takes 4 double A batteries.  I&#x27;d rather it plugged into the wall.  The batteries add weight and are going to wear out, requiring replacement with time.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has helped clear my face up dramatically, and I have only been using it for about a week! Also, since it is waterproof I can use it in the shower. I haven&#x27;t used all the attachments yet, but so far it has been everything that I hoped for in a brush, and even more considering the price point. I would highly recommend this brush to anyone who is shopping around.</li>
    <li> Works well, great price</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my niece.  She was thrilled with it.  This product is a great value for the price, which is quite reasonable.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. Works great for my face and leaves my skin smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It makes my face so freaking soft!  I haven&#x27;t used any of the other brushes yet but I have used the pumice stone, it didn&#x27;t do much for me though.</li>
    <li> For my face, this cleansing system cleans my face perfectly.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product. Like the versatility with the different brushes . Most pleased with the price compared to other products in beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> Just got this, so far so good. It gives the face a good wash, leaving it feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t drop it. Not even once. It&#x27;s waterproof and made to use in the shower with soapy hands but don&#x27;t drop it. Because inside is the cheapest solder job and the thinnest wires I have ever seen… plastic cheap Chinese toy-type solder job. One drop in the bathtub and the connections and wires snapped. That&#x27;s all it took.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, go ahead and drop it if you know how to solder and have the materials. I don&#x27;t. But if you don&#x27;t know how to solder, never drop it. Because no one with wet, soapy hands would ever drop this. Unthinkable. At least this is obviously what the manufacturer thinks.</li>
    <li> My face feels so thoroughly clean and soft when I use this.  I don&#x27;t even have to use it everyday.  I just clean my face with water since my skin is so sensitive when I don&#x27;t use the face brush.  I also love the pumice stone.  It&#x27;s like giving myself a spa treatment!</li>
    <li> simple, not expensive  and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;was a good gift for the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these words to let amazon make me submit this :)</li>
    <li> Works great in and out of the water.  My kids even love it!  I haven&#x27;t used the callous stone yet but I&#x27;m hoping it helps save me money on trips to the nail salon.  BriteLeafs has consistently provided high quality products at an affordable price (I have a diffuser as well).  I&#x27;m excited to try my essential oil blends with the brushes as well!  So many possibilities for making your skin look great!</li>
    <li> I use the Briteleafs face and body ultra clean brush every morning and night.  It leaves my skin feeling cleaner.</li>
    <li> My cosmetic/make up lady had recommended I get one of these for deeper cleaning and skin stimulation.  I just did not want to spend $100+  When I saw this one, it seemed to be well recommended by others, and the price was right.  I works under water which is awesome.  It does a nice job of cleaning my skin, and I use the sponge for smoothing creams and make up.  Everything I have done with it has been perfect.  Batteries still going strong after several weeks.</li>
    <li> This face brush was pretty awesome. I loves using it and it worked perfectly. However, it broke after a few weeks of use. The product is pretty fragile.</li>
    <li> I love my scrubber!!! Everyone needs one.  My only complaint... I do wish it had two speeds. I enjoy the multiple heads so I can do my face and also do my body.</li>
    <li> Although I use this product rarely, my wife uses it and found to be useful. Although the price is bit higher, we are happy with the item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush a handful of times so far and my skin feels so soft. I&#x27;m beginning to see a more even tone and brightness also. Very gentle on my face. Looking forward to using the other body and pumice attachments. A bargain for the money!</li>
    <li> As much as I hate to write not great reviews, this one had to happen. I had used my friends ultrasonic cleaner and read many reviews before buying this one. I&#x27;ll I can say is you get what you pay for. It does not vibrate and only spins. The large brush and pumice stone are useless because it is not powerful enough to turn with even the smallest amount of pressure. After about 5 uses, water got in it and corroded the batteries. It was a waste of my money for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: August 28, 2012&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service! I was contacted within 12 hours of writing my review and was offered a replacement for my defective unit. I will update my review after I get another chance to try out the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Oct 7, 2012&lt;br /&gt;I finally just got around to trying out the new unit customer service replaced. I really didn&#x27;t think there would be a difference but sure enough the replacement was much more powerful and after 1 week of use it has not leaked like the first one. I would still pay a bit more money for a little more power when the big scrubber or callus remover is used. Works great with light pressure especially on the face. Customer service was great though and even included new batteries to replace the ones ruined by the first one.</li>
    <li> I would like to give this brush a 5, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and since the last rotating facial brush I bought (ToiletTree Cleansing System Facial Brush) conked out on me (and the system would not allow me to update my review), I am a bit skeptical that this one may not last long either. Other than  that I AM THOROUGHLY LOOOOOVING THIS BRUSH!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purposely waited a few months after purchasing this product to write a review.  I must say that I am very pleased.  The Clarisonic initially caught my eye in a magazine ad.  When I researched it, I saw the price was astronomical! I would not pay that much.  So I decided to get on Amazon and look for something comparable.  I came across this model, which was rather cheap and very similar to the $170 Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it.  I have less breakouts.  I use it every other day, but there are times when I forget to use it.  If I notice a breakout on the horizon, I simply began to use the product and it will control the pending breakout to keep it from getting out of control, then it disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one who has a specific beauty regimen or facial process that I must do every day/night--so I don&#x27;t have a whole bunch of facial cleansers, etc.  That is the BEST PART about this product: I use it with plain old Dove soap!  My skin feels soft, smooth, and it looks radiant!  It controls mild acne and it is less expensive than most similar products.  I would say it is certainly worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not currently use the other attachments to this product.  I mailny purchased it for facial use.  But they are an added bonus, should I choose to use them in the future.</li>
    <li> Good product - definitely makes my skin tone look more even.</li>
    <li> We put together a \\&quot;spa experience\\&quot; gift basket for our son&#x27;s housewarming gift and included the facial brush. He loved his gift and is using the facial brush daily!</li>
    <li> Exact description. Powerful. Love, Love love!!</li>
    <li> Great product for bathing and just for any other cleaning job. I used mine to clean my ride, specially hard to reached area. Lol</li>
    <li> The wires unattached inside of the device, requiring me to have to do some surgery work. Works well until this happens. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this facial brush to replace a cheap Conair facial brush I had previously.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and can say that I definitely feel as though it does a much better job than the one I had before.  There are a few things that this brush system lacks which the Conair system had, such as variable 2-speed control, and a selectable direction for the rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise), and those missing features are the only reason for my rating being less than 5 stars.  With this brush, you get a moderate speed and only single-direction rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial brush attachment has bristles that are perfect in strength and texture, at least for my skin.  There is no uncomfortable abrasiveness with light pressure applied, and the brush is easy to clean after each use with mild hand soap.  The sponge applicator attachment is equally good for applying moisturizer after cleansing, and also is easy to wash with warm water and mild hand soap.  To get the best life out of either attachment, and to get them to work as intended, you *have* to wash them after each use.  After each use of this system for facial cleansing, my skin feels softer, smoother, and looks much better than washing with fingertips alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body brush is a little less impressive.  It just isn&#x27;t quite as practical as I was hoping it would be, and I find that I get much better results from an exfoliating loofah.  As I&#x27;ve not yet tried the pumice attachment, I&#x27;ve no opinion on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s well worth the money for the facial portion of the system if that&#x27;s your primary reason for looking at this item.  It probably won&#x27;t compare to a Clarisonic, but it&#x27;s also /far/ less expensive.  It&#x27;s still waterproof, so you can use it in the shower or the tub.  And, as I said, it will clean and exfoliate your face far better than fingertips alone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use for my at home pedicures.  It works wonderfully.  The brush is large enough to cover the body area.  Yesterday, I used the hard cell remover and found that it worked very well.  I am quite pleased with the compactness and ease of usage of the product.  My only concern is that it operates at one speed, and that speed is not very fast.  Over all the product is ergonomically friendly, light weight yet sturdy.  I tried using it in the shower, however, the slow speed made it pointless.  I would recommend this product for pedicures or to lightly apply oils to the body.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product! My face feels so clean and fresh! It cleans very gently and is not abrasive at all. I also enjoy using the pumice stone on my feet. My callouses are much better! I tried the body brush in the shower, it was ok, I just found it awkward to use in the shower, might be easier in the bath! All in all, a nice product for a little at home pampering!</li>
    <li> Was a great deal for the money and worked great for about a month . . . until it fell from the soap shelf in the shower and broke into about 6 pieces!!  Wasn&#x27;t a very far fall so I was a bit shocked and disappointed that it broke the way that it did.  Not sure if it is THIS product/brand that is cheaply made or if they are all made that way and we just need to be more careful.  Just glad I didnt spend $100+ on it like some of the other brands are charging</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Big Brush once a week over the past month and am experiencing smoother skin on my arms and legs.  The Pumice Stone alone is worth the cost of this system.  Following the directions on the mini-manual, my feet are looking much better!  I&#x27;ve only used the Facial Sponge once so don&#x27;t feel I can comment on those feature at this time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
    <li> This cleans and exfoliates my skin.  Feels amazing.  There is a dramatic difference in my skins clarity and texture.</li>
    <li> I love the BriteLeafs Face and Body Brush.  It really feels great on your face, like a mini-massage and the large brush for your body works great also.  I should have gotten one of these years ago.  Don&#x27;t know what I did before I got the BriteLeafs.</li>
    <li> I had my eye on this cleansing brush for months because it rotates, not just vibrates. The bristles are soft and gentle on your skin but they cleanse very well. In just a few days my skin is smoother and brighter than usual (and I used a natural fiber exfoliating pad every night before I bought this). The body brush is perfect for the top of my back and my shoulders and I have already noticed fewer blackheads and smoother skin. I love the pumice for feet- when used with a natural scrub my feet are instantly softer and smoother.  I haven&#x27;t really gotten to the sponge yet, but I assume it works well too. When first taking it out of the package, though, I did have a little bit of trouble with the batteries. After trying several different combinations of batteries, the brush still didn&#x27;t turn on. I thought I was going to have to return it, but after a few more tries it worked; so if you have the same problem try, try, try and if it doesn&#x27;t work, try again and you should be fine. The handle is a bit bigger than I expected, but its not clumsy or cumbersome, and it allows me to do my back my myself. All-in-all a great product, and I plan to use this for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you haven&#x27;t found your perfect cleanser yet, I use Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser and I feel like it works really well with this brush. I have sensitive, combination skin and this cleanser is light and fresh smelling and leaves skin soft and clean but never dries it out. Just my suggestion  :)</li>
    <li> This product works great! The handle is longer and it is more powerful than similar devices I&#x27;ve used. The pumice stone came apart from the disc the first time used but the company is sending a replacement right away.  I like the ability to use all of the discs in the shower as it makes for easy clean up. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! my skin does not very well with facial scrubs, so I thought I would give this a try. I was expecting my skin to be irritated after the brush, but to my surprise it was just what I needed! the brush is gentle for sensitive skin and leaves it bright and smooth. Now I use it once a week on my face. I do not like the feeling of the brush on my skin, but I got more tolerant of it after the third time. It is still totally worth the feeling for those of you like me with sensitivity to the brush texture. I even started using the wider brush for my back.&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stone is very good too, I was skeptical about it seeing that is was so small, but it does the job of keeping your feet nice and smooth with little effort. I am even more pleased as I know that I can replace the parts. I am planning to get another brush replacement to surprise my husband with a facial treatment! needless to say this makes a great gift!</li>
    <li> Love the brushes but the pumice attachment broke almost immediately...is too small...and not a good shape</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this and love it, couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The device lasted about 2 months then crapped out on me.  It says it is &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; and that is far fetched.  In no way is this waterproof.  It accidentally got dropped into water for about 2 seconds and was water-logged.  This device can; however, handle water dropplets but not dunked in a tub of water.  This is the second one I bought and they both no longer work.  I would not recommend this device.</li>
    <li> This is the first product like this that I have owned so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but I like it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it has helped to clear up my acne. I enjoy the different brush types.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. It may not be as fancy as more expensive models that you find at department stores, but it does everything I need and more. Plus it is a great price.</li>
    <li> My skin on my face and body feel smooth and rejuvenated. I feel like I have paid for a spa treatment! I good thing is that I have saved myself so much money and I can use the Cleansing System time and time again.</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a way to exfoliate and deep clean my skin. Normally, I can accomplish both of these things without a tool and just using my hands. But, the vigorous scrubbing twice a day can be tiring. I assumed this product would assist me with the scrubbing, it is battery powered after all. Unfortunately, the rotation of the brush on the product is pretty slow, so the exfoliating factor is very mild. There are no speed settings, just an &#x27;on&#x27; and &#x27;off&#x27; button. So I end up having to do most of the work myself anyway. After using this product for a month, it has become defective. Sometimes, it doesn&#x27;t turn on when I press the &#x27;on&#x27; button. I have to press the on and off buttons repeatedly, take the brush off the head and mess with it, and then it will turn on like it is supposed to. The batteries are fresh, so it is the product itself that is the problem. Overall, BriteLeafs Face and Body Brush is just mediocre. I will be looking for something else to replace it.</li>
    <li> i only used it twice  water got in it and corroded the batteries. I regret the purchase</li>
    <li> I used the small facial brush with my deep cleaner today and then followed it with the polishing foam pad and some moisturizer...my face absolutely feels and looks amazing!!! It has a nice, healthy glow and feels great!!!&lt;br /&gt;  I also used the pumice stone on my calloused feet and I might add that it worked rather well also! It&#x27;s waterproof, runs on 4 batteries, and has no stand to get in the way...&lt;br /&gt;  I tied my hair back to it didn&#x27;t get tangled, and no worries there. My only complaint would be that it seems like it could be a little bit more powerful, but not sure I&#x27;d want that where my face is concerned ^^ So, have to say that....&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, VERY VERY PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASE OF THIS KIT!!!!</li>
    <li> Need more stars to give this a truthful rating.  I must admit that I was a bit hesitant when ordering -- it sounded too good to be true based on a majority of the other reviews.  However, for less than $20 I decided to take a chance.  I was stunned that after the first use my skin felt like I had just walked out of the spa after my monthly facial.  I love the fact that I can use it in the shower.  The sponge head works fantastic with my daily moisturizer.  I am going to be ordering more heads because this little gadget is most definately a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It is still working great. It survived being dropped in the shower and at first I thought that was it, because it was in pieces. However, I let it dry out and after 24-hours I was able to put it back together and it still worked!! I did have a problem with one of the sponge heads not wanting to stay on the spindle; yet, when I replaced it with a new one that particular problem disappeared. I have noticed that if I used cheap batteries that it would run slower. I would most definitely purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to purchase something like this for quite a while but couldn&#x27;t justify the price.  This product is certainly an affordable alternative, and works great, so why spend the extra money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face brush left my face feeling very soft and I felt like I was giving myself a full spa treatment.  I tried the pumice stone on my feet (I live in the country and tend to walk outdoors barefoot!) and it also did the job great.  I also used the large brush for my daily &amp;#34;body brushing&amp;#34; routine which is supposed to detox your body as well as to reduce cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for this item is that I did contact the manufacturer to inquire as to the material that the brushes are made of.  They had a quick response (great costumer service) but let me know that it was made of synthetic material.  Maybe this is something that they should consider?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Works great. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Very happy with this system.  I &#x27;ve never used anything like this.  Just washed my face with a wash cloth.  It feels wonderful</li>
    <li> This product is reasonably priced and seems to work well in or out of the shower.  Brushes interchange easily,  Skin feels very smooth after use.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product, but I possibly should spend the money and get a dermotologist recommended exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I use the smaller brush head every time I shower, with the clean and clear daily scrub. I first used it with aveeno, but got 0 results. With the clean and clear it does a lot better, but I think there is room for improvement with the brush. First, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s getting very deep in my pores, and I specifically heat my water to open pores before washing my face. Second, I think a longer handle would have been smarter since the larger brush is meant for body, but how can you reach between your shoulder blades, which for girls with long hair can be prone to occasional acne, if the handle is so short? Haven&#x27;t tried the other two heads yet, I&#x27;m not big on pumices so this review is specially of the machine and two brush heads. I love the waterproof feature, and the speed seems decent. The brush is a bit abrasive, but I feel like it at least exfoliates well. I would recommend the idea, but maybe a different brand.</li>
    <li> I never considered buying something like this…..but, somehow found it and now, love it.  it is quiet, a good handheld unit, safe….and the &#x27;tips&#x27; are easy to put in/remove/clean.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve always struggled with black heads, this cleans and exfoliates my skin on a deeper level than I am used to! I would buy again and suggest to a friend!</li>
    <li> I got my order well on time... the quality is good and but I wish the speed in which it moves be a little more faster... u cannot increase the speed in which the brush moves... so that part is a bit dissapointed,,  the attatchments were also of nice quality....</li>
    <li> I dropped it in the shower and it broke into three pieces. Not sure if it was my fault or the, build quality. Only used it for two weeks, not impressed enough to replace it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother. And she loves it! She says it works great. It isn&#x27;t heavy and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a very easy to use and versatile product. I&#x27;ve tried several other face brushes but none that had 4 different applicators like this one. I have sensitive skin, prone to random mild rosacea so I&#x27;m very picky. I tried it and the face brush is very gentle and non-irritating. I love that it&#x27;s water proof so I can use in the shower. I used the body brush on my legs and that worked well. The pumice attachment was great. I used the pedi-egg on one foot and this one on the other. Hands down this product got more dead skin off. Warning that it&#x27;s also messier so use it over a towel! I have no complaints on this product so far but only been using it a week.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> best little thing i have for face and body.</li>
    <li> Its works really good and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> This product function perfect and I am still exited about using it. My skin is kinda bad, but it already helped a lot. Can´t wait to use it more to see if my skin will be even more amazing.</li>
    <li> Just what the body needs to rid dead skin cells with little effort.  Runs very smooth &amp; isn&#x27;t harsh on your skin. I would give this as a gift. The seller is A*** in customer satisfaction.  I have bought other products from them with no problems.</li>
    <li> After debating for 2 weeks which product to go with I chose the Brite leaf. I picked it for the reviews and for all it came with. I have only used it a couple of times but love the way it feels on my face! I feel like only after a couple of days my face looks so much better. I can&#x27;t wait to see the progress after using it longer. The package arrived very quick and I couldnt be happier because I was so eagar to use it immediately! Great product from a great seller!</li>
    <li> I am VERY PLEASED with this purchase. Well built, reasonably priced, attractive. Good customer service, good packaging and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004NJ8WFO BriteLeafs Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System, Waterproof and Cordless (BL-813)]]&lt;br /&gt;My face has never been so clean.  It has really complemented my facial cleanser.  I recommend it</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my wife will be happy when she can use it with her face and body, also with her patients, because she is a professional esteticien and she work in a SPA</li>
    <li> I have had the product for about a month now and am very pleased with the results.  I have extremely sensitive skin, so I&#x27;ve found using it with very light pressure, for short intervals, every few days is enough to keep my skin healthy without irritating my skin too much.  I&#x27;ve also found it&#x27;s best to use it in the evening (as the redness in my skin can take awhile to fade) and that using a high moisturizing, non-abrasive cleanser helps too.</li>
    <li> I received the product this morning.  On its first use, the pumice stone fell apart (separated from plastic holder and is not useable now),  Very disappointed in quality.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks, motor started to slow.  I went to change the batteries &amp; found that it was definitely not water tight, as water had leaked in and rusted the compartment.  Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t last!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh where to start? I LOVE THIS CLEANSING BRUSH! It scrubs my face SO well and makes it feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and fresh! (like getting a professional cleanse!) So much cheaper than the Clairsonic brush, but does the same job! I use it twice a day and couldn&#x27;t live without it! Gets all my makeup and gunk off my face and out of my pores! My face is as clear and acne free as ever!(:</li>
    <li> Because it uses 4 AA batteries it&#x27;s very powerful but also because of this it&#x27;s very heavy. The small brush is great size and hardness for the face while the large brush is great size for the body. I am questioning the quality of this product though. It&#x27;s only been 6 month since I&#x27;ve started using this and it had become defective TWICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time, the battery cap kept sliding off to the point the batteries would fall out while I&#x27;m in the shower! I got a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery cap for the replacement does not slide off but I don&#x27;t like how it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;click\\&quot; on. It just kind of stuffs onto the top and still moves around, leaving a small gap. Because of the gap steam gets in and the inside of the battery compartment gets a mildewy smell (and really bad). Then after 4 months of using the second unit of the spinning head stops spinning properly (it&#x27;ll spin one second, then stops, then spins slowly, then accelerates).</li>
    <li> i got my facial cleaner and i am very happy with it it does a great job  and it really holds up in the shower i have not had any problems with it yet. i did have the other face cleaner pretika and it only lasted 2 weeks i was so disapointed then i got this one and i am so happy it is a great facial cleanser and i could not ask for more ,thank you briteleaf for making a affordable facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love it, the speed and everything about it, I just need to find out now how do I get replacement brushes for it?!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she was okay with it. She said the bristles on some of the brushes were a little uncomfortable and made her face red. It&#x27;s a nice cleaning system, I think she just needs to get used to it.</li>
    <li> product has lived up to description.I like the facial brush, my face feels clean and revived. The lotion applicator is great. I take it in the shower with me i like the fact there is NO cord to get tangled up with.</li>
    <li> It works great. I keep it in the shower and have not had any problems so far. Cleans my face great.</li>
    <li> When I was looking for a product like this, I was looking for one thing WATERPROOF. After looking and looking, I decided to take a leap of faith and purchase this. And I say &#x27;leap of faith&#x27; because I have fair, sensitive skin; I was concerned that it would irritate my skin and I would be red in the face. It arrived by the estimated delivery date and I waited a day before trying it.&lt;br /&gt;Did it work? Why, yes it did! First off, my skin didn&#x27;t get irritated like I thought. My skin actually seems to be glowing, I can see my pores are smaller and it is soft to the touch. I also enjoy the body brush because I have very acne prone skin (especially in the summer no thanks to the Texas heat) and I can already tell that it is helping to get deep down into my pores like I need. I have ued the attachment for the moisturizer and it did what it said, I just haven&#x27;t tried the pumice stone yet.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with this product. It can be used in the shower so &#x27;check&#x27; to being water proof and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin! YAY!</li>
    <li> i have never felt cleaner than when i started using this product...feels like i use body lotion when you touch my skin and I dont...i use the body and face brush mostly....one day I will use the foot one provided..I just have ordered it so many times cause is keep dropping and breaking it...</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this little brush. Yes it is waterproof, I rinse the whole thing clean under the faucet each time I use it (which is every night before bed) and it all works fine everytime. I love how this little facial brush has made my skin look, feel and glow. I also love the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! The system is simple and good for the money. Wish the brushes were available on prime as at only $3 each for the face brush you have to pay $4.99 to ship it :o(</li>
