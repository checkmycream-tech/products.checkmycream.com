<li> to clean and delicate brush.</li>
<li> I feel like it should have a little more of a pointier tip, but there not a good quality brushes at all</li>
<li> this is not exactly what i&#x27;m looking for.</li>
<li> so I could try other acrylic brands.</li>
<li> too bad, because I was so excited to get these in the mail...</li>
<li> Very small to be #10 see pictures comparing a ten (finger pointing) with these not #10</li>
<li> I like them but the acrylic I brought made it mess up already.</li>
<li> I would say they are a little smaller than an 8 and very thin flat brushes.</li>
<li> They are firm and the tops come off so you can enclose them and make them compact.</li>
<li> She never going to send your merchandise, or answer them so don&#x27;t waste your time and your money.</li>
<li> At least they came in hard plastic tubes that I can use for other brushes.</li>
<li> They are small for a size 10.</li>
<li> Everything that looked metal was either very thin (you could bend with your finger) or actually coated plastic.</li>
<li> They lose their shape and it&#x27;s hard to use acrylic wi this</li>
<li> Yes, they&#x27;re cheap but these were awful.</li>
<li> Terrible, when I received the product both of them were broken</li>
<li> Horrible brushes!</li>
<li> Terrible quality.</li>
<li> Horrible product.</li>

    <li> i never use it since i bought it....this is not exactly what i&#x27;m looking for. but it look nice not just what i was looking for acrylic nail brush.</li>
    <li> These are garbage. The first use the metal fell off and left the tip inside my mono jar.</li>
    <li> Used it once and i couldnt use it again.</li>
    <li> Terrible quality. Yes, they&#x27;re cheap but these were awful. Everything that looked metal was either very thin (you could bend with your finger) or actually coated plastic. Would never, ever repurchase. Horrible product.</li>
    <li> Shipping took couple weeks but I am happy with my purchase. These are way nicer than I thought. I thought they would be light cheap plastic and they are not, these or the cost are outstanding, and I will be buying more for back up. Great quality, easy to clean, pretty, durable....love</li>
    <li> I dont think this sable hair is real.. The brush clumped up and was not repairable.  I won&#x27;t waist my money if i was you.</li>
    <li> They are small for a size 10. I would say they are a little smaller than an 8 and very thin flat brushes.</li>
    <li> After waiting I finally got them I just so happy there here there great nail brushes to do acrylic with.</li>
    <li> I bought these so I could try other acrylic brands. They will serve the purpose well. I will probably not buy again because I only needed them for that purpose. I&#x27;ve been a nail tech for 24 years and I am used to a higher quality brush. If you are a beauty school student and trying lots of different products, these are perfect. I would have ordered them in bulk for my students when I was teaching beauty school. They are good enough quality for the novice sculptor and a great price so you can use a fresh brush on each product and not cross contaminate your monomers.</li>
    <li> Brush is very easy to handle.</li>
    <li> These work great, but the brush fell off the handle of one of them after only a few uses so I had to glue it back on</li>
    <li> I received these amazing brushes right away.  They are the best I have found for acrylic nails and the price was very reasonable.  I would recommend them to any nail tech.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I luv these brushes, I&#x27;ve been doing my own acrylic nails but ended up throwing away the brush at the end until I gave these a shot,and they are perfect,easy to handle and apply the acrylic,definitely will be purchasing more soon,very easy to clean,just perfect&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend them</li>
    <li> That are really good I really like them. Now I can do my nail designs how I want them .</li>
    <li> Do not buy. Broke first time I used it. All the hair just came out. Pluss they took over a month to even get here</li>
    <li> These work great for what I use them, the only complaint is that it&#x27;s quite difficult to clean them. They get the job done though.</li>
    <li> too bad, because I was so excited to get these in the mail...an hour ago. The handles are caps, which is cool, but I sculpted a few nails to see how they did and the acrylic gets totally stuck in the bristles and the nice fine point they came to is completely gone and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll return any time soon. It&#x27;s so frayed I can&#x27;t get it back into the cap. At least they came in hard plastic tubes that I can use for other brushes. Don&#x27;t bother with these - guess I&#x27;ll have to spend $40 on a good brush.</li>
    <li> This brush didn&#x27;t get through a full set of nails before I had to switch to a different one. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Ordered just 8 days ago and I have received already! Great looking brushes,  thank you!</li>
    <li> I just ordered this two days ago and I live in columbia Missouri when do you think they will come in?</li>
    <li> I bought this for cosmetology school. I was very happy with my purchase. It came in within the time I was given.</li>
    <li> Fancy cheap brush that is hard to clean because the acrylic just sticks to it. and doesn&#x27;t perform well. Very small to be #10 see pictures comparing a ten (finger pointing) with these not #10</li>
    <li> Realy good for Acrylic design it can make flower french everything You want easy to clean and delicate brush. I like it</li>
    <li> I like them but the acrylic I brought made it mess up already. So make sure you use good acrylic. And it came in no time.</li>
    <li> These brushes make it easy to apply acrylic. We&#x27;ll worth the money. Fast delivery, just as described. The brushes make it easy and fast.</li>
    <li> Was happy when I got them after using them they aren&#x27;t to good. They lose their shape and it&#x27;s hard to use acrylic wi this</li>
    <li> Horrible brushes! Hair on brush is crappy! Good for practice but nothing else. Shipping is good with the company bit you pay for what you get.</li>

    <li> Terrible, when I received the product both of them were broken</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and it works lovely however I purchased an identical lash curler at sallys for 1$</li>
    <li> it is soooo cheap. the brush hair falls apart.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushs was very good. The sabel hair is very smooth and holds the liquid very well. They were packaged in there own little tube held for storage to keep the brush in good condition. Knowing now the quality of the product I will be ordering more.

    <li> These are really crappy. I didnt expect much because they were so cheap but they arent worth the money. Put the couple bucks toward better quality brushes</li>
    <li> Brush fibers melted together after cleaning with acetone.</li>
    <li> I love my brush they are so good they work so good I like the way they put on the acrylic on my nails.</li>

    <li> I love these brushes. They are firm and the tops come off so you can enclose them and make them compact. Great product and a super great deal!</li>
    <li> These brushes broke before I even had a chance to use them</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes get the job done make sure you was all your brushes when your done I&#x27;ve screwed like four of mine up because I didn&#x27;t. The handle also is the lid to the brush so they don&#x27;t get rewend</li>
