### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Not the best sleep cap, however.</li>
      <li>The wideness of it is very good, helping to keep it in place.</li>
      <li>I was happy with the cap but not the price I had to pay for shipping costs</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good post-shower cap for curly girls.</li>
      <li>nice but doesn&#x27;T stay on for sleeping</li>
      <li>Fits nicely, holds hair in place and keep the style I scrunched underneath,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>she never said how well she liked it</li>
      <li>nice today\\&quot; kind of compliments.</li>
      <li>fits very nicely, stays on, comfortable for sleeping with.</li>
      <li>Nice size, and would buy more if needed</li>
      <li>Okay, by the time I have my ear plugs in, my sleep mask on, and now my super attractive granny mesh sleep cap on, there is just no way any man could ever resist me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also have very fine, frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would stay in place since I toss and turn, but the cap did.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>This cap is lightweight but significantly more durable than a hairnet and easier for her to manage.</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>This cap is so comfortable in comparison to all the others!</li>
      <li>Nice wide elastic, nice airflow, comfortable fit, nice for air-drying hair.</li>
      <li>Shipping speed was fine</li>
      <li>These are important issues since I wear a sleep apnea face gear that straps around my head and needed a cap that would not leave me marks around my face but would protect my hair from getting pulled out by the head gear.</li>
      <li>This bonnet is not \\&quot;extra-large\\&quot; nor does it \\&quot;fit over the fullest hairstyles (or curlers)\\&quot; as stated in the description.</li>
      <li>I found it quite comfortable.</li>
      <li>Very much, I would like more colors.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect size netting for curly hair, and I&#x27;ve found it works really well as a \\&quot;plopping\\&quot; device after a shower, allowing your hair to air dry while keeping it in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>BETTER than any in any store, &amp; I&#x27;ve looked, but those were Too hot</li>
      <li>First, it breathes so much better than satin caps</li>
      <li>I love it!It is soft and easily applicable.</li>
      <li>Fortunately the other one was a more quality product and that satisfied the requirement.</li>
      <li>Was delighted with the quality considering low price.&lt;br /&gt;Stays on pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Nor Too flimsy, this is JUST RIGHT.</li>
      <li>I intend to order some more,thank you very much.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your head or forehead hot like</li>
      <li>The price is low, which makes it a worthwhile gamble.</li>
      <li>Also, the wide band assures it&#x27;s not cutting into your face like most bands</li>
      <li>Fits over large rollers AND under my c-pap cap</li>
      <li>kind of tight</li>
      <li>will probably not write a review again since too much is required.</li>
      <li>I almost wish it had that rubber inside that you find on thigh-high stockings, because it does slip off in sleep (perhaps if you&#x27;re a very still sleeper</li>
      <li>After my first night of wearing this cap, however, I actually got compliments on my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 23 years old and like curly hair.</li>
      <li>OK but not great - I&#x27;m using it</li>
      <li>I have a small head and the size was right.</li>

<li> This product took a LONG time from order to shipment, but it finally arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Fits my head and holds all of my permed hair from being flat in the morning</li>
<li> It might fit a small head with small rollers.</li>
<li> It constantly slides down to my eyebrows even though I have big Rollers underneath.  </li>
<li> too small, looked bigger in the picture,  can not put over curlers as not big enough.  </li>
<li> This bonnet was so skimpy that it just keeps slipping off.</li>

<li> It is a little loose and slips off during the night, but all in all it does what its supposed to.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t enjoy being spammed with bad marketing.</li>
<li> The netting might be too tight for curlers unless they are small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Just imagine the possibilities if you&#x27;re someone who actually gives half of a rat&#x27;s behind.</li>
<li> I used to dread wearing my sleep cap because the satin ones would make my head sweaty and the thin elastic band trimmed in lace was scratchy on my face and left indents.</li>
<li> And the elastic is VERY, VERY tight.</li>
<li> have complained that the elastic was too tight.</li>
<li> Not very good at staying on at night.</li>
<li> I would not order this again nor recommend it unless one has a very small head.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of extra money to spend and hate being cheated out of what little I do have.</li>
<li> /&gt;CONS: very, very, very slow shipping.</li>
<li> do that have the lace on a thin strip of elastic.</li>
<li> The stretchy band is too thick and uncomfortable.  </li>

    <li> It slips off constantly</li>
    <li> Fits my head and holds all of my permed hair from being flat in the morning</li>
    <li> nice but doesn&#x27;T stay on for sleeping</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t use. kind of tight</li>
    <li> Fits nicely, holds hair in place and keep the style I scrunched underneath,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And will probably not write a review again since too much is required.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I have a small head and the size was right. I just don&#x27;t have enough hair anymore for it to stay on all night.</li>
    <li> Arrived when expected and does the job.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would stay in place since I toss and turn, but the cap did. I love it!It is soft and easily applicable.</li>
    <li> Was delighted with the quality considering low price.&lt;br /&gt;Stays on pretty well.  Nice size, and would buy more if needed</li>
    <li> The stretchy band is too thick and uncomfortable.  It constantly slides down to my eyebrows even though I have big Rollers underneath.  Shipping speed was fine but now I get a lot of junk mail for senior citizens.  I&#x27;m 23 years old and like curly hair. I don&#x27;t enjoy being spammed with bad marketing.</li>
    <li> It is a little loose and slips off during the night, but all in all it does what its supposed to.</li>
    <li> Okay, by the time I have my ear plugs in, my sleep mask on, and now my super attractive granny mesh sleep cap on, there is just no way any man could ever resist me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a wash &amp; wear kinda gal. I also have very fine, frizzy hair. After my first night of wearing this cap, however, I actually got compliments on my hair. No lie. And I&#x27;m one of those invisible people, like Milton in Office Space. So it was one of those, \\&quot;Uh, gee, your hair [implied: actually] looks nice today\\&quot; kind of compliments. But this only goes to prove that this cap works! Just imagine the possibilities if you&#x27;re someone who actually gives half of a rat&#x27;s behind.</li>
    <li> OK but not great - I&#x27;m using it but it&#x27;s made of a material that doesn&#x27;t allow your head any air.</li>
    <li> I have sleep apnea and my hair tangles I wear the cap and it slices the problem</li>
    <li> too small, looked bigger in the picture,  can not put over curlers as not big enough.  was packaged well and came promptly</li>
    <li> Bought this for my elderly mother who has her hair done weekly. This has helped extend the life of her hairstyle. This cap is lightweight but significantly more durable than a hairnet and easier for her to manage.</li>
    <li> The cap looks nothing like the picture, that is, unless the model has a head the size of a five-year-old. And the elastic is VERY, VERY tight. I don&#x27;t have a lot of extra money to spend and hate being cheated out of what little I do have.</li>
    <li> i gave it to afriend who had been wanting one she never said how well she liked it but it seemed to me it would do the job</li>
    <li> This bonnet is not \\&quot;extra-large\\&quot; nor does it \\&quot;fit over the fullest hairstyles (or curlers)\\&quot; as stated in the description. It might fit a small head with small rollers.</li>
    <li> My wife said it was tighter than she would like</li>
    <li> Delivered on time with no problems.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Fits over large rollers AND under my c-pap cap</li>
    <li> fits very nicely, stays on, comfortable for sleeping with.</li>
    <li> I bought this bonnet along with another for my mother in a nursing home. This bonnet was so skimpy that it just keeps slipping off. Fortunately the other one was a more quality product and that satisfied the requirement. I would not order this again nor recommend it unless one has a very small head.</li>
    <li> This product took a LONG time from order to shipment, but it finally arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many have complained that the elastic was too tight. I found it quite comfortable. The wideness of it is very good, helping to keep it in place. I almost wish it had that rubber inside that you find on thigh-high stockings, because it does slip off in sleep (perhaps if you&#x27;re a very still sleeper it will hold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect size netting for curly hair, and I&#x27;ve found it works really well as a \\&quot;plopping\\&quot; device after a shower, allowing your hair to air dry while keeping it in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Nice wide elastic, nice airflow, comfortable fit, nice for air-drying hair. It doesn&#x27;t make your head or forehead hot like some sleep caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: very, very, very slow shipping. You will forget you ordered this before it arrives. Not very good at staying on at night. The netting might be too tight for curlers unless they are small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over-all, it has some pluses and some minuses. The price is low, which makes it a worthwhile gamble. It&#x27;s a good post-shower cap for curly girls. Not the best sleep cap, however.</li>
    <li> I like the hair cap. Very much, I would like more colors. I intend to order some more,thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the cap but not the price I had to pay for shipping costs</li>
    <li> I used to dread wearing my sleep cap because the satin ones would make my head sweaty and the thin elastic band trimmed in lace was scratchy on my face and left indents. Also the satin would slide off. But this cap solves all that. First, it breathes so much better than satin caps do that leave your head sweaty. Also, the wide band assures it&#x27;s not cutting into your face like most bands do that have the lace on a thin strip of elastic. These are important issues since I wear a sleep apnea face gear that straps around my head and needed a cap that would not leave me marks around my face but would protect my hair from getting pulled out by the head gear. This cap is so comfortable in comparison to all the others!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this for years, as my former one wore out.  I wear this when I sleep to preserve my hairstyle and it works!  I&#x27;ve tried other sleep &amp;#34;nets&amp;#34; but they didn&#x27;t work.  I would recommend this one to anyone.</li>
    <li> BETTER than any in any store, &amp; I&#x27;ve looked, but those were Too hot Nor Too flimsy, this is JUST RIGHT.</li>
