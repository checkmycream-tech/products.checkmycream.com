### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Now, they discontinued it at the drugstore; so I was very happy to find it at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the best face treatment I have ever found.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy you have this product!</li>

      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno&#x27;s Ageless Vitality cleansing pads for over a year &amp; have been happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give this product a try.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is wonderful and it soaks into the skin leaving it very soft and the great frangrance lasts.</li>
      <li>but it feels nice.</li>

      <li>Product has nice sensation.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE the smell of this product and when I put it on it makes my skin feel renewed and very smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aveeno makes great products and they&#x27;re reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 days now and have decided I don&#x27;t want to use it on my eyelids or lips any more.</li>
      <li>I love the aveeno product it does wonders to my skin.</li>
      <li>I am 46 and most people guess I&#x27;m early-mid 30&#x27;s :).</li>

      <li>Never before have I used an anti aging cream that I was SURE was working.  </li>

      <li>I love this product and will keep buying more.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, and can see it working after a 10 days.</li>
      <li>I just couldn&#x27;t believe such a great product fell off the map!</li>
      <li>I turn 40 this month, most people assume I am 33-35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many years.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve used better.</li>
      <li>I used to Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I am vain, but my complexion is clear and looks great.</li>
      <li>The cream gives my skin a nice fresh look when I wake up.  </li>
      <li>My face/neck do not irritate easily.</li>
      <li>I have used a strong glycolic cleanser as well.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is good enough on its own.</li>
      <li>It absorbs well into my fine lines</li>
      <li>This product made it look better after the first week!</li>
      <li>can already see a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly.  </li>
      <li>This did not arrive in its original packaging and there is no way whatsoever to determine if the product is contaminated or not.  </li>
      <li>I had found it at a store last year &amp; tried it &amp; loved it.</li>
      <li>The package arrived very beat up, and the product smelled overwhelmingly of perfume.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m only 26, but I like to use products now to keep my skin looking good.</li>
      <li>I will continue searching for something better that gives real results.</li>
      <li>They were gentle with not too strong a smell, but NO wrinkle reduction,</li>
      <li>This product really works!!  </li>
      <li>My skin feels very smooth and natural looking.  </li>
      <li>So far I love the ressults.</li>
      <li>The Positively Ageless cleanser leaves my skin squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>My skin needs lots of help right now.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but at this cost this is going to produce a far greater result than anything you can do in a spa in a day for the same amount of money or more.</li>
      <li>I bought and gave this item to my sister and she likes it very much.</li>
      <li>Besides this, I like the product very much.  </li>
      <li>Very reasonable priced and works well for me.  </li>
      <li>I tried this for the first time at CVS.  </li>
      <li>I am sure it will be different for everyone</li>
      <li>so only put it where it is needed most.</li>
      <li>I was saving for the job hunting time and started using it before I ordered the Positively Ageless system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I wash my face with the Positively Ageless cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Also, I really don&#x27;t like the dispenser the cream comes in.  </li>
      <li>I was really Hoping for some improvement...</li>
      <li>Ageless Vitality Elasticity Recharging System really works.</li>
      <li>I am 32 and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet, but I have noticed damage to my chest area from the sun.</li>
      <li>Not seeing much difference</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Aveeno Positvely Ageless line for quite awhile and really like this.  </li>
      <li>Yes to Carrots Gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>I really like the eye cream in this set.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle smell and</li>
      <li>My dentist even remarked that it looked \\&quot;really nasty\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>It really works made.</li>
      <li>Clarins user among other brands, this is better than anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>It is hard to find in stores but is a very good product for reducing wrinkles and other signs of aging</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using the 2 Aveeno products together takes a little more time, but as I said, my skin needs lots of help.</li>
      <li>so no real wrinkles but, in general, my skin just feels more youthful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely well worth the money.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t control how much of the product it dispenses, and it makes a mess on the top of the jar, so every time you use it, you have to clean off the top of the jar (and waste some of the product, which is not cheap).</li>
      <li>Again, this product does NOT appear to be new.  </li>
      <li>Not sure it actually reduces the fine lines on the face!!  </li>
      <li>skin is very soft now</li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It had a nice consistency - a little goes a LONG way.</li>
      <li>It is a thick consistency, but like most creams it does not really do anything special.  </li>
      <li>ordered both Ageless Vitality (eye and night time systems) and Positively Ageless at the same time.</li>
      <li>I certainly see a difference in my skin the next morning.</li>
      <li>Im in my early 30s</li>
      <li>Skin tone lightened, which makes you appear younger than you really are.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to be looking for a job and don&#x27;t want to have old lady skin.</li>
      <li>They could&#x27;ve made the bottle smaller being that there isn&#x27;t that much product.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin very soft and I actually use it for daytime moisture instead of night for my older skin.</li>
      <li>Hands down my favorite and I&#x27;ve been a long time</li>
      <li>I am certain the little gray tubes will run out first, but I don&#x27;t care -</li>
      <li>Used it for about a month before switching back to my normal moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>My pores are smaller and the wrinkles under my eyes that have been driving me crazy are greatly reduced already.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am 27 years old and have slightly enlarged pores and a fairly deep laugh line by my mouth.</li>
      <li>My pores shrank a lot ( which has been a big issue for me) and my skin is even toned and soft now.</li>
      <li>The white jar was packed in the bottom of a small box, topped with wadded up newspaper, and then the four vials were packed loose on top of that.  </li>
      <li>I am still on the first little tube after a week.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried this for the first time at CVS.  Now, they discontinued it at the drugstore; so I was very happy to find it at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will continue to carry it.  My skin feels very smooth and natural looking.  The eye tube is very small, and it finishes first.  Also, I really don&#x27;t like the dispenser the cream comes in.  I wish they would change that.  Besides this, I like the product very much.  I am 50 and up.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years. The texture of the lotion/cream is very good. The fragrance is wonderful and it soaks into the skin leaving it very soft and the great frangrance lasts. Makes my skin very soft and I actually use it for daytime moisture instead of night for my older skin.</li>
    <li> Skin tone lightened, which makes you appear younger than you really are.  Bought this because in magazine review it was recommended by dermatologist to younger and firm skin.  Well, they didn&#x27;t lie!  I am sure it will be different for everyone but I for one got the result!</li>
    <li> I love the aveeno product it does wonders to my skin.</li>
    <li> This product really works!!  It doesn&#x27;t take all the sags and bags away, but I (and my friends) have noticed a bigg difference.  I will continue to use it :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, and can see it working after a 10 days. That said, the little plastic jar it comes in is annoying. You can&#x27;t control how much of the product it dispenses, and it makes a mess on the top of the jar, so every time you use it, you have to clean off the top of the jar (and waste some of the product, which is not cheap). There are several ways of packaging and dispensing lotion like this, and unfortunately, Aveeno has chosen the very worst and most wasteful.</li>
    <li> I bought and gave this item to my sister and she likes it very much. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Never before have I used an anti aging cream that I was SURE was working.  It was always - maybe yes, maybe no.  The Aveeno Ageless Vitality is a no brainer.  My lip wrinkles had just sprouted and they were driving me crazy.  Within 10 days of using this night cream, my lip wrinkles were gone. My eye wrinkles, crepe paper chest wrinkles,  and brightness of my skin have also improved.  I am certain the little gray tubes will run out first, but I don&#x27;t care - I love this product and will keep buying more.</li>
    <li> Preface: I do 50% Glycolic chemical peels monthly on face, neck, decolletage &amp; hands with NO irritation. I have used a strong glycolic cleanser as well. My face/neck do not irritate easily. I have kept face/neck out of sun (hats &amp; vigilant SPF usage.) I turn 40 this month, most people assume I am 33-35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno&#x27;s Ageless Vitality cleansing pads for over a year &amp; have been happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to give this product a try. It had been 3wks since my last peel, and had not used glycolic cleanser since before last peel. Face/neck was cleansed using Say Yes to Carrots Gentle cleanser. Face/neck makeup free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied some of the grayish gel to above my eyebrows, around eyes and neck. It had a nice consistency - a little goes a LONG way. Let it soak in. Then applied the pump lotion over entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woke up in morning, felt a bitch scratchy, didnkt think about it, took a shower. When I got out, hairwrapped in a turban, my entire neck was covered in red blotches! Cold compress and lots of hydrocortisone cream. My dentist even remarked that it looked \\&quot;really nasty\\&quot;. No problem with face irritation. Tried just gray gel on face - no problem. Six days of cortisone cream &amp; wearing scarves to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was an ingredient I was allergic to, it would have caused problems around the eye. T&#x27;s been 2wks, it&#x27;s cleared up, and I used a lighter lacto-glyco peel yesterday on my neck - no problem. I can&#x27;t explain why it did it to me - I&#x27;ll continue to use other Aveeno products but you might want to do a skin patch test on neck beforehand so you don&#x27;t end up looking like reptilian_neck woman.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I like Aveeno products, but ended up not using it all.  The package arrived very beat up, and the product smelled overwhelmingly of perfume. It gave me a headache.  Used it for about a month before switching back to my normal moisturizer.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This did not arrive in its original packaging and there is no way whatsoever to determine if the product is contaminated or not.  The white jar was packed in the bottom of a small box, topped with wadded up newspaper, and then the four vials were packed loose on top of that.  No instructions for use either, of course.  Neither the jar nor the tubes had any sort of tamper proof packaging whatsoever...Again, this product does NOT appear to be new.  I am NOT happy and will never do business with this company (Impossible Discounts)again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 26, but I like to use products now to keep my skin looking good. I absolutely LOVE the smell of this product and when I put it on it makes my skin feel renewed and very smooth. I look refreshed and dewey when I wear it.     I also like the day cream because it is the only product I like to wear with sunscreen as it does not have a bad sunscreen smell or thick coverage feeling to me.    The only thing: avoid placing it too close to the eye area, it does tend to irritate the eyes a bit when placed to close to the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the best face treatment I have ever found.  Perhaps I am vain, but my complexion is clear and looks great. I am 71 and look 50-ish. I have used Aveeno products for I don&#x27;t know how many years. Ever since they branched out of &#x27;medical&#x27; treatment to cosmetic and face care.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product at night.  I apply the night eye gel then use the cream.  I must say the night cream I find works well.  The eye gel is still to be determined due to the fact I have been sick.  I definitely see a difference when you apply the gel.  It absorbs well into my fine lines but I need to reapply it in the morning.  The cream gives my skin a nice fresh look when I wake up.  I certainly see a difference in my skin the next morning.</li>
    <li> Been using for over 4 weeks and my skin feels softer, skin tone is lightened/brightened. Im in my early 30s so no real wrinkles but, in general, my skin just feels more youthful. So glad I found this product and agree with other reviewers that it can be tough to find in stores. Love it. Hands down my favorite and I&#x27;ve been a long time Clarins user among other brands, this is better than anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I like the cream for it&#x27;s gentle smell and how it make my face feel.  The smaller tube of cream goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I am 32 and don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet, but I have noticed damage to my chest area from the sun. This product made it look better after the first week! Very pleasant scent, as well.</li>
    <li> I tried all 3 products in this line and was disappointed with the results on my 66 year old face.  They were gentle with not too strong a smell, but NO wrinkle reduction, NO age spot fading, NO firming....just an expensive regime for products designed to last about a month and do nothing much.</li>
    <li> Great product.  So far I love the ressults.</li>
    <li> I really like the eye cream in this set.  And it lasts a long time.  I am still on the first little tube after a week.  It goes on so smoothly.  The cream is nice too.  Not sure if it has performed any miracles yet.</li>
    <li> Spent over $35 for this and it hasn&#x27;t done a thing. I was really Hoping for some improvement...any improvement and got nothing. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> I wish they did not discontinued this night cream.  Very reasonable priced and works well for me.  It also does not discolor the sheets at night like other creams do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy you have this product! I had found it at a store last year &amp; tried it &amp; loved it. I have VERY sensitive skin and I have no irritation from the cream. My pores shrank a lot ( which has been a big issue for me) and my skin is even toned and soft now. I use the grey gel on my 1 big forehead wrinkle and my marionette and outer eye lines and they go away as long as I keep using it. I also use the cream on my hands and it has done wonders for them. I am 46 and most people guess I&#x27;m early-mid 30&#x27;s :).</li>
    <li> It really works made. Me look 10 years younger .if you try it ,you Be glade you did.i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Product has nice sensation. Not sure it actually reduces the fine lines on the face!!  I&#x27;ll give it another week to see results.</li>
    <li> It is a thick consistency, but like most creams it does not really do anything special.  I will continue searching for something better that gives real results.</li>
    <li> I used this for only about a week before my partner started asking me what I was doing. It definitely firmed up my skin and smoothed it out in tone and even color. It&#x27;s definitely well worth the money. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but at this cost this is going to produce a far greater result than anything you can do in a spa in a day for the same amount of money or more.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time buying this product.  After a week I noticed a difference around my eyes.  The cream in the tube almost disappears on contact so only put it where it is needed most.</li>
    <li> I am 27 years old and have slightly enlarged pores and a fairly deep laugh line by my mouth. In terms of it helping with aging, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. And as a moisturizer its pretty thin and I&#x27;ve used better. I agree with the other review that says, \\&quot;NO wrinkle reduction, NO age spot fading, NO firming.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t have issues with the amount of product dispensed by the bottle but I did find it slightly &#x27;clunky&#x27;. They could&#x27;ve made the bottle smaller being that there isn&#x27;t that much product. Not buying this again.</li>
    <li> this must have been an experiment for Aveeno because it&#x27;s not on their web site.  I used it for 4 weeks along with the eye vitality treatment and after 4 weeks it looked worse than before I used the product.  I&#x27;ve used the Aveeno Positvely Ageless line for quite awhile and really like this.  This was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I used to Love this stuff. Not so thrilled with it now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually using 2 Aveeno products together. My skin needs lots of help right now. I finally saved enough money to splurge and decided to see what Aveeno product I could find at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered both Ageless Vitality (eye and night time systems) and Positively Ageless at the same time. The Positively Ageless cleanser leaves my skin squeaky clean. I&#x27;ve used it 3 days now and have decided I don&#x27;t want to use it on my eyelids or lips any more. I read the instructions and they say it can be used to remove makeup, but I have a different cleanser I&#x27;m going to continue to use to remove my mascara with. Then I wash my face with the Positively Ageless cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can already see a huge improvement in my skin. My pores are smaller and the wrinkles under my eyes that have been driving me crazy are greatly reduced already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the 2 Aveeno products together takes a little more time, but as I said, my skin needs lots of help. I&#x27;m going to be looking for a job and don&#x27;t want to have old lady skin. Ageless Vitality Elasticity Recharging System really works. I was very impressed with it when I was using it daily. I couldn&#x27;t believe how it helped my skin. Then suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find it at any retail store in my area. I ordered it once from Amazon and then I couldn&#x27;t find it here either. I just couldn&#x27;t believe such a great product fell off the map! I still had some (daytime treatment) I was saving for the job hunting time and started using it before I ordered the Positively Ageless system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very soft now and I don&#x27;t have my troublesome combination skin. I have a touch of eczema and get dry patches on my face. My oily t-zone and dry patches are gone. I wear a matte finish foundation and don&#x27;t have a shinny face when it&#x27;s time to wash up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno makes great products and they&#x27;re reasonably priced. You can&#x27;t go wrong no matter which one you choose.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is good enough on its own. Not sure why we need the little tubes?  I only use them around my eyes. Not seeing much difference but it feels nice. The dispenser is weird and if you pump too much, it&#x27;s wasted.  Not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> have used this several times.  It is hard to find in stores but is a very good product for reducing wrinkles and other signs of aging</li>
