      <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the service that I received.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice shaver, lots of features, but Norelco shaves closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Ok you are asking, \\&quot;AN HOUR?\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I traded up to better technology as Braun produced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>okay; however if the cutter shield ever comes off, goodbye head$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If this model is no longer offered, I&#x27;m sure they offer a comparable model.</li>
      <li>Battery life is great and replacement heads reasonably priced, even from Braun.  </li>
      <li>I think you will love the speed and the close shave you get.</li>
      <li>I have used Braun electric shavers for many years.</li>
      <li>For me this is the best possible solution although I realize most people don&#x27;t have that option.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the Norelco.</li>
      <li>It works great, and if it lasts like my previous Brauns, it will be a great value.</li>
      <li>This is easily the closest and most comfortable</li>
      <li>lol and sure enough</li>
      <li>The latest Braun 9595 Pulsonic shaver is a beautiful feat of engineering and looks the part for a place in the modern high tech world of today.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the most comfortable shaver I&#x27;ve come across, and provides a surprisingly close shave at that.</li>
      <li>Also, the foil part may be perfectly fine...</li>
      <li>I charged it up and everything worked just fine.</li>
      <li>Also, the foil part may be perfectly fine...</li>
      <li>The case it comes with is cheap and flimsy but holds the shaver and charger</li>
      <li>so I hope replacement cutters stay available.  </li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>So far, I am very pleased with this shaver.</li>
      <li>The quality is excellent, I can use my old cleaning unit/refills (that I get with Amazon&#x27;s auto refill program at a low price/free shipping) and it comes with a full warranty.</li>
      <li>They offered to have it returned for a full refund, which I did.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;d say they last good amount of time...</li>
      <li>Although it is not essential to have it (you can indeed clean the razor just fine with a brush), it is a nice benefit.  </li>
      <li>Although it is not essential to have it (you can indeed clean the razor just fine with a brush), it is a nice benefit.  </li>
      <li>The Braun cleaning solution does indeed scour the blades super clean and leaves a fresh clean smell.    </li>
      <li>The Braun cleaning solution does indeed scour the blades super clean and leaves a fresh clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but luckily wasn&#x27;t damaged.  </li>
      <li>8595 has a reasonable running noise (slightly more so than the Norelco, but quieter than the 7000 series), effective cutting technology, excellent battery life, and the right balance of weight and grip.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>The blades last a pretty good time.  </li>
      <li>(the blade/foil alone is worth $35), but no protective cover or brush.  </li>
      <li>A very solid, well-made and effective electric razor.</li>
      <li>The closeness of the shave is on par with the Norelco which was very adequate (not better than a good non-motorized razor).  </li>
      <li>I was not disappointed in getting a closer shave but the shaving took much longer with the Panasonic.</li>
      <li>Right away I started getting closer shaves.  </li>
      <li>The price was right and that is my story.</li>
      <li>however this is a minor issue other then that best Braun shaver I ever owned</li>
      <li>I wish I had done it much sooner!  </li>
      <li>I am sure the 8595 will last me for another 10 years!</li>
      <li>so I decided to shop for the same Braun I enjoyed at home.  </li>
      <li>This is the third Braun electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned and each has worked great, and lasted a long time.  </li>
      <li>Ok first off, I bought this for my husband since he is a total furball.  </li>
      <li>Me: I have a fairly light beard, but sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I checked out the instruction manual online first and confirmed the electric charging cord can be plugged in to the shaver directly for use and charging.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE it (and not just because of the unbelievably low price)!</li>
      <li>I tried my first shave &amp;</li>
      <li>What cinched the deal was the low cost of this refurbished shaver and the many favorable reviews I read.</li>
      <li>The shave is very close and soooooo comfortable compared to my old shaver.    </li>
      <li>While it does not shave quite as close as the Remington it is replacing, it is much quieter and seems to be of significantly higher quality than the Remington.</li>
      <li>They politely explained that they normally would send a replacement right away but can&#x27;t in this case because it&#x27;s a third-party provider (Amazon just handles the fulfillment) and inventory is changing all the time they can&#x27;t guarantee availability.  </li>
      <li>It is quiet, and is easy to grip.</li>
      <li>And really, getting a shave that close without the danger of nicks and irritations is preferable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>cause you really don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge if you are in a pinch.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you empty out your blade every once in a while and just tape</li>
      <li>Worked well for a couple of years, I noticed from the start it did not have as much power or speed as my existing shaver.</li>
      <li>Particularly impressed with the cut I get from the sideburn cutting feature.</li>
      <li>once less than 10 minutes are available--quite accurate, too), and how much longer the shaver needs to be plugged in to achieve a full charge.  </li>
      <li>THE CLEANING STATION IS TOO FREAKING LOUD!!!  </li>
      <li>Hubby has got up and forgot that I was sleeping or whatnot, used his shaver, and plopped it in to clean it, and I about fall back to sleep....</li>
      <li>I actually bought the step down from this, the 8585, and he loved it</li>
      <li>This particular unit is the shaver alone--no cleaning station.  </li>
      <li>This particular unit is the shaver alone--no cleaning station.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely more useful than the less informative LED lights on lesser models.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I moved my older model into my travel kit and this refurbished baby is my new main shaver.  </li>
      <li>Price does not mean quality.</li>
      <li>And although you don&#x27;t get the cleaning system, it is easy enough to just open the razor up and brush it out.</li>
      <li>- It does NOT shave as close as a Norelco, even after weeks of my face &#x27;getting used to a new shaver&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>The battery maintains it power as it did when it was brand new.  </li>
      <li>so I started researching new shavers.</li>
      <li>Looks and functions like new.</li>
      <li>...was pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>I ordered this shaver and had to send the first one back.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly in almost new condition, but I can see that it was refurbished when I noticed 3 whiskers in the center cutter between the 2 foils.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used the heck out of my 8595 shaver and it finally needed to be replaced.  I purchased a refurbished unit.  It came quickly, is in great condition and I&#x27;m very pleased with the service that I received.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Braun shavers for over 15 years and have owned about 5 different models.  This isn&#x27;t to say that the old ones didn&#x27;t last... in fact, all but one of them still work.  I traded up to better technology as Braun produced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But eventually, a tool is nearly perfected.  The major leaps of technology start to slow and you find that there&#x27;s really not much more to be done, save changing the appearance or marketing aims.  The latest Braun 9595 Pulsonic shaver is a beautiful feat of engineering and looks the part for a place in the modern high tech world of today.  But... beneath it all, it is really not much different from the 8595 Activator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8595 has a reasonable running noise (slightly more so than the Norelco, but quieter than the 7000 series), effective cutting technology, excellent battery life, and the right balance of weight and grip.  The LCD display shows you how long your shave is taking (and retains that, so you can see how long your last shave was), the total number of shaves performed with the unit, how much charge on the battery is left (which goes down to the minute once less than 10 minutes are available--quite accurate, too), and how much longer the shaver needs to be plugged in to achieve a full charge.  It&#x27;s definitely more useful than the less informative LED lights on lesser models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance wise, the shaver works admirably.  You do have to learn how to shave with an electric razor, though, in order to optimize the capability.  With a little skill, you can get nearly as close as a blade.  I find that I do with mine.  And really, getting a shave that close without the danger of nicks and irritations is preferable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other key features of this model is the cleaning station improvement.  The older 7000 series had this lock down arm that made the unit more bulky, but even worse an inner tab is prone to breakage after a year of use that makes it impossible to lock down the shaver.  The 8000 series solved this design beautifully.  And in essence, this is still the same basic cleaning station included with the 9595, aside from a few cosmetic upgrades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  This particular unit is the shaver alone--no cleaning station.  Although it is not essential to have it (you can indeed clean the razor just fine with a brush), it is a nice benefit.  The Braun cleaning solution does indeed scour the blades super clean and leaves a fresh clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering the 9595, I&#x27;ll tell you what the differences are:  The 9595 obviously has an updated appearance.  There is also an indicator that tells you when to change the shaving head cassette.  Yes, \\&quot;cassette\\&quot;, as the foil and cutter block are now molded into one unit.  This recommendation is... well, not very accurate.  I believe it is based on the shaving count, which is not representative of the total cutting time.  If someone takes 2 minutes versus 5 minutes, then the shaving head change indicator will be premature.  Also, the foil part may be perfectly fine... it is the cutter block which gets dull over time.  On the 8595, you can replace just the cutter block.  On \\&quot;that auction site\\&quot; you can find a seller who offers that cutter block for $10.  That&#x27;s a dramatic difference from the $50 you&#x27;ll pay for the \\&quot;cassette\\&quot; you have to change on the 9595.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you should know that the next model version, the 8995 360 Complete, is practically identical to the 8595 Activator, except for some very minor cosmetic differences and the \\&quot;blade change\\&quot; indicator.  Otherwise, it is the same device.  In fact, you can interchange the cleaning station and plug between the two models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in my book, the 8595 is the best value shaver available from Braun.this design beautifully.

    <li> I have used Braun electric shavers for many years. At home I used a similar yet older model of this razor for several years.  My travel kit had an Eltron product that I was not enjoying at all so I decided to shop for the same Braun I enjoyed at home.  I soon learned that several generations had passed and that the new models were very pricey, not worthy of another $200+ purchase.  Being an inveterate Internet shopper I discovered this refurbished model, similar to my older Braun...and what a deal on the price.  I did not need another clean/wash base so this looked ideal and proved to exceed my expectations.  I moved my older model into my travel kit and this refurbished baby is my new main shaver.  You must look seriously at this if you are a Braun 8000 series fan.</li>
    <li> This is easily the closest and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve EVER experienced.  I absolutely LOVE it (and not just because of the unbelievably low price)!</li>
    <li> Nice shaver. Maybe doesn&#x27;t get quite as close a shave as I was thinking, but still very nice.</li>
    <li> This is a refurbished unit and clearly states that it does not include the cleaning unit.  Not a big deal since I didn&#x27;t want to set myself up for the future expense of the cleaning solution.  I checked out the instruction manual online first and confirmed the electric charging cord can be plugged in to the shaver directly for use and charging.  But what the listing apparently doesn&#x27;t indicate is that the electric cord is not included, at least it wasn&#x27;t in my box.  What&#x27;s up with that?  An electric razor with no electric cord?    Kudos to Amazon customer service for responding to my question about the lack of a cord in less than 10 minutes (wow!).  They politely explained that they normally would send a replacement right away but can&#x27;t in this case because it&#x27;s a third-party provider (Amazon just handles the fulfillment) and inventory is changing all the time they can&#x27;t guarantee availability.  I understand.  They offered to have it returned for a full refund, which I did.  It&#x27;s a shame because I&#x27;d rather have the shaver than the refund, but with no cord it can&#x27;t be charged or used.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for over 40 years. This is one of the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Braun 8595.  I wish I had done it much sooner!  The old shaver&#x27;s motor had been slowly declining over the last few months.  I did not notice the decline until the head movement was completely out of control.  I could not believe the difference when I began using this replacement shaver!  The shave is very close and soooooo comfortable compared to my old shaver.    The quality is excellent, I can use my old cleaning unit/refills (that I get with Amazon&#x27;s auto refill program at a low price/free shipping) and it comes with a full warranty.</li>
    <li> This is the second model of this shaver that I have owned.  It works well and stays charged and working for a long time.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Me: I have a fairly light beard, but sensitive skin. I have used virtually every brand of electric shaver out there, including Norelco, Remington, etc. This is by far the most comfortable shaver I&#x27;ve come across, and provides a surprisingly close shave at that. It is quiet, and is easy to grip. The head follows your face contours, making it easier to reach under the jaw, etc. At this price, I don&#x27;t think there is a shaver to compare. And although you don&#x27;t get the cleaning system, it is easy enough to just open the razor up and brush it out. A very solid, well-made and effective electric razor.</li>
    <li> Shaver performs as advertised. I&#x27;ve purchased several refurbished Brauns and have never had a problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m most impressed with the quality of the Braun shaver. I&#x27;ve been shaving with a Norelco cordless shaver for the last several years. When the Norelco heads needed replacement I was disappointed in the cost of replacement heads so I started researching new shavers. What cinched the deal was the low cost of this refurbished shaver and the many favorable reviews I read. So far I&#x27;m very pleased. Particularly impressed with the cut I get from the sideburn cutting feature. It&#x27;s better than the Norelco. This unit did not include the cleaning station so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing (or not). The closeness of the shave is on par with the Norelco which was very adequate (not better than a good non-motorized razor).  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> hard to believe, my Braun syncro 7526 no longer able to be recharged, found receipt dated 10/19/00, had used for 10 years... so I&#x27;d looked around and found Activator 8595, the appearance looks very similar in size, sharp and function, but in fact the 8595 cuts closer than the old 7526 and quieter than the old 7526... I am sure the 8595 will last me for another 10 years!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a Braun 370 (3000 series) I left behind in a hotel room. It arrived quickly in almost new condition, but I can see that it was refurbished when I noticed 3 whiskers in the center cutter between the 2 foils. Came in a white box with a picture of the unit, instructions, charging cord, clip-on foil protector, cleaning brush &amp; black travel zip pouch. I charged it up and everything worked just fine. I tried my first shave &amp; it was very smooth. Somehow the higher speed of cutter oscillation and foil design enable it to shave closer than both the previous 7000 and 3000 series Braun shavers I owned. Very happy with purchase &amp; since this is a travel shaver, I have no need for the cleaning jug. Just what I needed. The box and instruction manual say it has a 2 year warranty in the US and Canada. I hope it is honored when I need it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic model hoping for a closer shave after owning the Braun Activator for a number of years. I was not disappointed in getting a closer shave but the shaving took much longer with the Panasonic. I decided to try a fast rough shave with the Braun and then a fast finish shave with the Panasonic. For me this is the best possible solution although I realize most people don&#x27;t have that option. For any that own both as I do give it a try. I think you will love the speed and the close shave you get. I imagine using a Panasonic like this with other faster shaver for a rough shave first will work well too. I hope this review might help a few people.</li>
    <li> Ok first off, I bought this for my husband since he is a total furball.  I actually bought the step down from this, the 8585, and he loved it, it lasted nearly 4 years faithful to the end, and then one day, the trimmer part broke(actually a small plastic piece inside) and then it failed to come up at all, or shut off completely.  I indeed was impressed with the amount of power that the L-ion battery contains.  Even after nearly 1500 days of operation(yes every day)the battery still lasted nearly a hour of shaving.  Ok you are asking, \\&quot;AN HOUR?\\&quot; but after he shaved his face, In morning, I would shave, (yes womanly bits) and all in all, would take nearly an hour.  Well let me tell you ladies... I used to use the Gilette Fusion, (still do in a hurry in shower) and this has totally taken my heart.  I do mind the process of cleaning up after usage due to me holding it upside down most of the time, but small price to pay, *lay down a towel, lol*.  I shave my hubby cause I hate hair, and this makes small work of it, HEAD TO TOE, and once again, I can do all that using the trimmer attachment and regular and still have enough juice for me.  I have had one time though, after doing his Hair(head, I&#x27;m a stylist) and I had to plug in the cord, which in itself is a saving grace, cause you really don&#x27;t have to wait for it to charge if you are in a pinch.  The blades last a pretty good time.  I have only had to change 3 times on the 8585 in 4 years, so i&#x27;d say they last good amount of time...only had a problem once where somehow the foil got damaged and actually scratched my hubbys face pretty badly.  He didn&#x27;t realize it was but noticed burning, lol and sure enough about an hour later it looked like he got in a fight with a kitty.  Another thing I will make note of... THE CLEANING STATION IS TOO FREAKING LOUD!!!  Hubby has got up and forgot that I was sleeping or whatnot, used his shaver, and plopped it in to clean it, and I about fall back to sleep.... BURRRRENNNNNNNNNGGGGGGTTTT!!!!  It sucks, and let me tell you, the price on the cleaning solution... WHAT A RIPOFF for some friggin alcohol and scent!!!    Oh well Rant went on long enough, I recommend this totally, as it gets closer then a fusion blade, quicker and cleanup is quick and its great for a man, perfect for a woman, and a great price.  Even if this was full retail I would still consider it, but since it wasn&#x27;t, hah, well I bought it!!!    P.S.  Make sure you empty out your blade every once in a while and just tape the foil on sink or trash can imbetween shaves and it will prolong your blade and solution!!!</li>
    <li> So far, I am very pleased with this shaver. While it does not shave quite as close as the Remington it is replacing, it is much quieter and seems to be of significantly higher quality than the Remington. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that it has a slick finish that is not the easiest to hang on to.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver on the market.  I have owned a number of shavers in the past 55 years and the Braun 8595 is tops.</li>
    <li> ...was pleasantly surprised! Looks and functions like new. It&#x27;s been a few years now and the battery as well as the time left indicator still work as new.</li>
    <li> with out the base which does not come with this it is impossable to get get of the cleaning needed message however this is a minor issue other then that best Braun shaver I ever owned</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Would buy it again and give it as a gift.  The price was right and that is my story.</li>
    <li> The Braun Activator 8595 Solo Shaver gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  As far as the refurbished part, I see on the Braun website it is a discontinued model so I hope replacement cutters stay available.  I ordered this shaver and had to send the first one back.  It was damaged in shipment due to poor packaging.  Thank you Amazon for great service providing the return authorization and paying shipping cost.  The second one was packaged the same way and arrived bouncing around in the box but luckily wasn&#x27;t damaged.  Right away I started getting closer shaves.  I have about a medium beard.  Some swirls that have always been a pain posed no problem for this shaver.  I shave dry and haven&#x27;t tried it wet.  Don&#x27;t intend to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it to supplement my Norelco, to use for close trim work and when on the road but the Braun gives at least as close shave, and is just a tad louder.  Battery life is great and replacement heads reasonably priced, even from Braun.  The case it comes with is cheap and flimsy but holds the shaver and charger okay; however if the cutter shield ever comes off, goodbye head$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12.21.2009 - It does NOT shave as close as a Norelco, even after weeks of my face &#x27;getting used to a new shaver&#x27;.  I will continue to use the Norelco for close shaves and the Braun for close trim work.  It&#x27;s a nice shaver, lots of features, but Norelco shaves closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction book that came with it is for the wrong model shaver but the right manual is on their web site.</li>
    <li> I manually clean my 8595 every day, so after a few years the clip that holds the blade in place wore out.  The old shaver was still usable but harder to clean that way.  This replacement was perfect to get me going again.  It DID come with an electrical cord and instruction manual and blade/foil (the blade/foil alone is worth $35), but no protective cover or brush.  Of course, I already had a cord and cover and brush and cleaning system from before.</li>
    <li> I knew when I purchased it that it was refurbished, but I did expect it to arrive with all of its parts. All razors come with a protective shield to cover the head to protect them but not this razor.  I was using  a Noreleco Quadra Action razor. I see no difference in the quality of the shave between the two. Time was the Braun takes longer to shave with.  Price does not mean quality.</li>
    <li> UPdate Dec. 2012:  This gets updated to 5 Stars.  It continues to work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: Four stars, not 5, because I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to know if the refurb unit will last - but it works great at this point.  This is the third Braun electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned and each has worked great, and lasted a long time.  I replaced blades and screens in may last one every couple years, and would still be using it after 10 years, except I dropped it and broke the head hinge mechanism -- it still works but the trimmer is a bit questionable.  So, I bought this refurbished unit.  It works great, and if it lasts like my previous Brauns, it will be a great value.</li>
    <li> Tired of razor burn, I was looking for an electric razor for tender skin. And this is the one. Plus, Amazon delivered it on time.</li>
    <li> I have this Braun electric shaver for close to two years.  It works like the day I purchased it.  I changed the blades once as directed in the manual.  The battery maintains it power as it did when it was brand new.  I have a tough beard, and I get a better shave with this razor as apposed to using a razor blade. If this model is no longer offered, I&#x27;m sure they offer a comparable model. When I checked out the prices of electric razors in stores, I realized that I got a great deal.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a couple of years, I noticed from the start it did not have as much power or speed as my existing shaver.</li>
