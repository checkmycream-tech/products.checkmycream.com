<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this powder. It has nooooo color. Very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Powder caked in pores and in smile lines. Expected so much better from Laura Mercier product. Tried it with puff and brush and was not pleased. Will return.</li>
    <li> I like the translucent powder because it finishes the makeup process. without changing my foundation color...I love it. This is my 2nd order.</li>
    <li> This is the first loose powder that I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;m not sure how it rates with other powders but I can tell you this, it is very silky (for a lack of a better word) feeling against my skin. I love it and I will continue to buy it. The translucent is wonderful because the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer I bought is a little to dark for my skin but this applied after the moisturizer evens it out perfectly.</li>
    <li> this is a great face powder.........very light on the face and colorless....my skin is acne prone and sensitive and this powder does not irritate it at all....i&#x27;ve been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands and this is by far the best loose powder that I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and arrived on time</li>
    <li> Best translucent powder I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> this powder is simply perfect!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s light, yet has enough presence to create  the perfect polished look.&lt;br /&gt;day or evening, this is a must have!</li>
    <li> I use it every day. Similar products are available in other brands but this is the best.  Three more words.</li>
    <li> In general this is a great product.  I purchased this specific shade because I am very fair with minor pink in my cheeks.  I feel that this color is too dark for me and I plan on trying a different shade :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Laura Mercier products, but this is simply not good. The quality of the power is just weird/grey-ish, reminds me of expired baby formula. I don&#x27;t use it, I can give it to you for free.</li>
    <li> great for over foundation! doesnt have a cake texture to it. I have very oily skin and a few scars, this product covers it well and leave my skin flawless!!</li>
    <li> Only powder I use.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This powder goes on like silk!  It doesn&#x27;t add additional color, you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on, but it sets and protects my make-up all day!</li>
    <li> I use this every day! Out of all the setting powders I&#x27;ve tried this one does not give me that &amp;#34;ghost face&amp;#34; in pictures.</li>
    <li> I swear by this powder. I put it on after my liquid foundation/tinted moisturizer to set it. It gives a smooth, bright appearance.</li>
    <li> I received the product quickly and in good shape.  This powder is the best and all worked out great.  I would order with this company again.</li>
    <li> I wanted a lightweight powder that did not feel so dry on my face. This product was exactly what I wanted. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing it stops my face from being oily and it makes me have a flawless face i will probably buy another but you only need very minimal amount</li>
    <li> Never disappointed in LM products, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how this powder made a huge difference in my makeup routine. Even my husband noticed how light the make up looks on me. When using other pressed powders, my face looks cakey, but this powder just made my face seem flawless with a perfect finish. Its lighter on the face than any other product I have used. Altogether, I would suggest people to buy this product. I am in love with it &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of a Laura Mercier product but I&#x27;ve heard so many wonderful things about this product I had to try it... and I luv it.  It glides on so well and really smooths the skin.</li>
    <li> Powder is great, but only 3 stars for poor packaging.  My powder container arrived broken.</li>
    <li> The powder texture was good,it was the color and translucent that was not.The color was too yellow and not light enough.After two or three applications during the day  I noted  my skin turning yellowish and you could see the powder</li>
    <li> Best powder I have used.  I have oily skin and this works great.  I only apply in the morning and it lasts all day without getting oily.  It has a light, silky feeling to it.  Does not seep into pores or wrinkles.  Just perfect!</li>
    <li> It is the perfect color for my skin, I mean I know its translucent.... but yeah its awesome, I put on my foundation and concealer and then submerge my face with this stuff and after my bronzer and blush it doesn&#x27;t look too cakey. I always get asked what foundations/powders I use and Im glad to have this as a part of my everyday makeup. Also if you are thinking about buying the powder puff by Laura Mercier, don&#x27;t, there is no point, you don&#x27;t need it, just go buy a cheap one from Walmart or wherever, it will do the same thing! Just a tip. What I noticed works the best for me, is if I take my powder puff and put it under my eyes first to set that concealer then grab my beauty blender and blend that out, and I pretty much do that all over my face. Sometimes I only use my beauty blender and not even the powder puff. Anyways, hope this helped someone out &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Not a good setting powder for medium skin tones :(</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!!  It is sheer and gives you that awesome matte polished look.  It is not caky or heavy. It pairs up well with foundation and concealer.  And, did I say I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I rarely write reviews unless the product &amp;#34;wows&amp;#34; me in such a way that I feel compelled to share my thoughts. This is well worth the thirty some dollars! I typically can find drug store brands that have the product similar to the higher end one I&#x27;m looking for. In this case, I couldn&#x27;t find a product that set my makeup perfectly in place ALL day and absorbed the oil. The oil absorbtion qualities of this product were my reason for buying it and I&#x27;m so glad I did. A little goes a long way. I probably use a pea size amount every day and the shine from oil that used to inevitably be on my face by the end of the day is NO LONGER and I&#x27;ve also noticed a significant decrease in my blemishes and acne as a result of this product. This is a must-have for anyone who wears makeup. Period. I hope this review was helpful and persuades you to buy a product that has literally changed my skin!</li>
    <li> Love it. Quite the sticker shock, but thus far seems to be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m blonde with pale skin with pinkish undertones - and this sets my makeup without any trace of powder. Some reviewers talk about getting \\&quot;ghost face\\&quot; - maybe they&#x27;re putting way too much on? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;ve never had any such problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on translucent, but keeps me from getting \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; - which normally happens really quickly for me. Love it.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I have tried many loose powders.  Some are good, some are better but they all made my skin look &#x27;cakey&#x27; and left&lt;br /&gt;powder anywhere there were old age wrinkles.  This product I found you did not have to use as much and made my skin look&lt;br /&gt;smoother and more flawless without the &#x27;cakey&#x27; effect.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this product.  It is the only one I use.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this setting powder. I bought translucent and it truley is perfect. Does not cake, no color helps keep foundation true, and can reapply all day with no buildup. I will never use another powder again.</li>
    <li> OMG I&#x27;m in love with this product! I don&#x27;t have a lot of holy grail products but boy did I find my ride or die. I have used different setting powder and either they were too ashy on me didn&#x27;t set well but this one is just right! I have no clue what she uses in this miracle jar but please DO NOT change the formula... It&#x27;s magic!</li>
    <li> I wanted a setting powder that was translucent and not in any shade and this fills the bill.  Put it on and cannot notice that I have any powder on.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A great powder! I really like this setting powder. It goes on great! I would recommend this to anyone that loves make-up!</li>
    <li> This will keep your make up flawless longer.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, works great for anti-shine.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy so I have to be careful around the eye area on myself and clients so it doesn&#x27;t look chalky but other than that its awesome!</li>
    <li> Nice quality but I have a revlon powder I paid much less for that I feel works just as good.</li>
    <li> This powder is wonderful and leaves the skin flawless. My only reason for deducting one star was because my package was missing a velour puff :( I don&#x27;t wish to spend extra money on one-- luckily, this powder works just as well when applying it with a small brush.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to powder and I have purchased it time and time again. Perfect color for me with ivory skin. Keeps the oil at bay and still in place at the end of the workday, which I appreciate. This product came recommended by my sister. It is expensive, but lasts a good amount of time and worth the money. You get what you pay for. Buy a good fluffy round brunch for application and when you get toward the end, pry off the inside lid and get every last speck out.</li>
    <li> This powder is perfect! It sets my makeup, absorbs excess oil and I even use it after I conceal blemishes but before I add bronzer and blush. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t lighten the face and really lives up to the &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34; it touts. You won&#x27;t regret this buy!</li>
    <li> I have porous, combination skin and foundation does not look well on me. This powder is light and has a lovely matt finish but never looks dry or artificial. I apply this after a light moisturizer in the morning, with a soft brush, and it keeps my skin looking fresh and even toned most of the day. It&#x27;s worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Great product. It is soft and perfect to take off that makeup shine. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love all Laura Mercier products</li>
    <li> It absorbs the oil and helps the foundation stays on long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not all that. I feel like other powders that are less money do about the same.</li>
    <li> This powder is light, goes on well, and looks beautiful on my face. I have tried other mineral powder and this powder is the best by far. It gives the face a nice matte look. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best setting powder I have ever used! This is truly translucent and doesn&#x27;t affect my foundation color at all, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday setting for underwhelming and T zone-for oily skin</li>
    <li> Best lightweight powder in the market. This powder is more milk than other powder is out there which I love.</li>
    <li> Lovely finish for a flawlwaa cookplexion.  Holds up all day.  I will use this again.</li>
    <li> Good price and good powder for hiding shine BUT it seems to make me break out with pimples a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I am usually acne free for the most part, but a day or two after starting to use this I started to notice&lt;br /&gt;pimples.  Will see if that goes away...hopefully or I will have to go back to the Mary Kay loose translucent powder.</li>
    <li> Happy with the seller and the product!</li>
    <li> Bought this powder due to reviews I read &amp; because I wanted something more natural, not heavy.  This product is just that.  Natural looking, does not cake up &amp; helps keep make up in place.  Very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> This powder goes on like silk and leaves a wonderful look. Use it with the Silk Creme Foundation and LM Secret Camouflage. You&#x27;ll look and feel like a new person. Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this powder helps keep the oily shine away.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Good on literally any skin color. I use it as a finishing powder and find it really minimizes flaws. A must have in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,but I can&#x27;t find the production date and the expiration date anywhere！</li>
    <li> Best. Powder. Ever. Great translucent color. Easy to apply. Smooth, clean finish. Doesn&#x27;t set too heavy. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few translucent powders from drugstores but this by far was worth the money and not too cakey , its light and buildable. The shipping was quick and price was fair I&#x27;ve seen far more expensive. Definitely want to buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this powder. It gives your make up a finished look without having a powdery look to it.</li>
    <li> I usually use the Starlight powder and since I am used to the shimmer in that, this was a little hard for me to get used to, but the matte finish is nice and it works for any skin tone. I am olive and get very dark in the summer, but am fair in the winter, and I can use it year round with a little bronzer added to it in summer. Love Laura Mercier and when I use my Beautycounter Lustro Oil as a primer, I don&#x27;t have to worry about any settling.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, she loves it! Uses it daily for her finishing touches on her makeup. Says it is the best she has ever used.</li>
    <li> This product smoothes out skin and makes it left soft and uniform. From what it seems to be doing, I would say it would work as an excellent blemish concealer. Definitely great for normal to humid weather. Keeps you feeling wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this powder for a couple years now and it&#x27;s a great loose powder.  Laura&#x27;s products are always quality - this was shipped quickly and I would recommend this seller.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> great stuff and feels good on my face</li>
    <li> Purchased after reading all the rave reviews here on Amazon. Personally I have decent skin with minimal shine spots, forehead and chin area, and thought this would work well to set my cc cream, as I no longer use harsh foundations. First time I used this I was impressed for the first half of the day. Checked to see how much shine got through to find my forehead and between my eyes even more slick than normal, also this powder sits in your pores and wrinkles, so my forehead and under eye area looked awful. My mascara also transferred and got messy, which never happend to me. Day two I try to use even less, change technique, etc. Same shine in a few hours, same gross creasing at laugh lines and forehead. Wash it off that night to find red bumps all under my eyes, down my cheeks. At this point I am very disappointed in this powder and the hundreds of people who aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s sad when you pay $40 for makeup that barely works better than $5 drug store brands, and leaves you with a face of acne. NEVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Perfect setting powder.  Use it everyday.  Very light!</li>
    <li> this make my face oily i don&#x27;t understand</li>
    <li> Laura Mercier&#x27;s Loose Setting Powder has been a favorite now for about two years. It has no odor, and helps the makeup stay &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; with no re-doing it during the day. A terrific product!</li>
    <li> Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Powder is a great product.  It sets foundation or moisturizer without looking like you have on powder. I use the LM Tinted Moisturizer, also with the powder over it and love the results.</li>
    <li> A great powder that doesn&#x27;t make my tanned skin look ashy.  I apply with a big brush rather than the puff.  Much more natural.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon and I love it. I use it every day to set my under eyes I just dab a whole bunch with my beauty blender after applying concealer and it doesn&#x27;t smudge all day! Now, for setting my face it&#x27;s ok my foundation appears a little lighter when I use this to set my face. I bought specifically for setting my under eyes concealer. I use the Nars concealer.</li>
    <li> No different from store-bought brands.  Store-bought brands are less expensive and provide the same results.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product again.</li>
    <li> You need to use very little when you put your foundation on and it&#x27;s good for all day.  I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;Marian</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it looks like the one I bought before so I anticipate only good things!</li>
    <li> This is a staple! I have dark brown skin and it blends very well.  I can safely say that it is suitable for all skin tones.  Just, ensure that you don&#x27;t use too much.  I&#x27;ve had it over a year now and I&#x27;m not even halfway through.  A little goes a long way and makes a big impact</li>
    <li> A great, light setting powder.  Not TOO light.  Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Great translucent powder to have in your stash.  Though it is a bit pricey, remember you get what you pay for.  It is finely milled and does not settle into any lines in the face.  Can use on any skin tone from fair to deep.</li>
    <li> Great translucent powder, fluffy and smooth!! I have tried it all and this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Great powder. Not heavy at all.</li>
    <li> This has a fantastic silky texture that blends beautifully over the skin (and foundation) and leaves a satiny - smooth, dry finish. The formula is talc-based and also includes a small amount of corn starch for extra absorbency without a heavy feel.  Translucent is best for my fair to light skin tone, but it could probably work for darker skin tones if brushed on sheer. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This powder is awesome! It gives you an airbrushed finished look and really looks nice after applying foundation. Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Light luxurious powder that finishes beautifully and lasts all day. I get lots of compliments and mostly just smile and say thanks.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I will order it again</li>
    <li> This definitely helps me stay matte longer. (But NOT all day.) Its easy to use. Packaging is nice. I use the Laura Mercier velour puff with this product. (Which I REALLY like!) Overall, I think this product is just okay. You can probably find similar setting powders out there for cheaper prices.</li>
    <li> Love the product! I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I love Laura Mercier products...I absolutely live with her tinted moisturizer, so I knew that the setting powder would be lovely.  And it is.</li>
    <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
    <li> This powder is translucent,light  and very thin. It does what it has to do-sets the foundation perfectly,without drying the skin. This powder does not interfere with the color of the foundation and makes skin look very silky and smooth. Great value for money.</li>
    <li> Perfect for setting liquid foudation and concealers! It makes a huge difference to the finished look and helps the makeup to stay in place for hours on end (I work 12+ hour shifts). A litle bit of this product goes a long way. I use the Laura Mercier velour puff to apply but you can use a brush too.I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite setting powder.  It doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look cakey. It is colorless which I love because it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my foundation.  The only thing that I can complain about would be the price.</li>
    <li> I have 1 in my home; 1 in my office; this powder puts the final touch on a makeup job; love it</li>
