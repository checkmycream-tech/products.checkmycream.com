      <li>After using it for a couple of months there is a very good improvement.</li>
      <li>great value.</li>
      <li>that was stated an the size is fairly good for the price.  </li>
      <li>Best thing ever works right away</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>and this one works just as amazing.</li>
      <li>I did swap out the products inside for something more suited to her skin issues, but I am using that and happy to report my skin looks better too.</li>
      <li>Really liked it.</li>
      <li>It feels nice, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>It was a nice kit.</li>
      <li>it makes my skin very nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t even be called a toy as most toys are made better!</li>
      <li>In my opinion Its better than the clarisonic, well certainly a better deal!</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with my results!</li>
      <li>It is working good, my skin feels softer and cleaner, and i my acne got less :) I am so thankful for this cleansing system!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;After just two nights of use, I notice a huge difference in the appearance of my nose blackheads!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
      <li>She love it.</li>
      <li>this cleans my face like tha claresonic one i had, but it&#x27;s way more cheaper.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it has helped so many people...</li>
      <li>It works more as an Exfoliator, in my opinion, and we know we&#x27;re not suppose to exfoliate our face daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve tried!!</li>
      <li>The one downside which I think a couple people mention is it doesn&#x27;t have a body attachment which I love on my clarisonic</li>
      <li>I recommend using your favorite face wash with this.</li>
      <li>As I was using the pro X, I could literally see blackheads emerging from my nose, and as I washed my face afterwards, I washed away many blackheads that my pro X was able to lift</li>
      <li>I bought this for my daughter, she likes it and says here skin is looking better from using it.</li>
      <li>its ok if you cant afford a cla-!sonic.  </li>
      <li>get the mid-range nutrasonic, its much better</li>
      <li>For the price,  I love this purchase.</li>
      <li>Tried all sorts of exfoliators, and some worked better than others.</li>
      <li>And I love how clean I feel after!</li>
      <li>love this product...makes my face glow and blemish free</li>
      <li>It is good, not like mia, but someone with budget concerns should appreciate it, I love it so far!</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my skin</li>
      <li>There is a huge difference in the products.</li>
      <li>My skin feels incredibly smooth afterwards and my skin drinks my moisturizer, its incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Ok it&#x27;s no clearsonic but for the price this little gadget is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>but I still love this one very much and maybe one day they will make that attachment.</li>
      <li>Worth the buy!</li>
      <li>Olay has never disappointed me.</li>
      <li>It works like a charm my face seems clean and refreshed everytime</li>
      <li>I use makeup remover and then clean my face with  the scrup and</li>
      <li>The micro-gel that comes with it does not have a pleasant aroma, but is abrasive enough as well where you can tell it is cleaning.</li>
      <li>Not feel something special yet.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>It comes with the cleanser, but if you prefer your own cleanser, you can also use that.&lt;br /&gt;The item was neatly packed and delivered/arrived early.</li>
      <li>The brush is soft but effective.  </li>
      <li>It is good stuff to use it even occasionally.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to clean your face and reduces black heads</li>
      <li>Enjoyed using this the last six months and plan to keep using as long as I am seeing these good results!</li>
      <li>This system fit a need for deeper cleaning that I felt would benefit my skin&#x27;s texture which it certainly did.</li>
      <li>3 weeks, and a camping trip later, i have fewer zits and the ones i did have healed nicely.</li>
      <li>This electric brush proved to be well worth it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth it.</li>
      <li>No exfoliator allowed me to use this every day and my skin started getting healthier right away.</li>
      <li>Ladies, you feel me right?</li>
      <li>it leaves my face soft and super clean.</li>
      <li>I actually use this one more.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t up to spending hundreds of dollars on a cleansing system, especially not being sure of the results.</li>
      <li>All of the stores have this exact same item listed for $100.00 or more.  </li>
      <li>This limited edition red cleansing is handy for travel and easy to use.</li>
      <li>So I really wanted a Clarosonic and after reading a few reviews it seemed like a good and affordable replacement to buy this item.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller and easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>I bought the red color and paid an extra $8 for it, the red color is such a gorgeous deep red, I&#x27;m glad I spent an extra $8 and got a cute color LOL!</li>
      <li>She is still saying thanks.  </li>
      <li>story short, I tried to use it a few more times to see if I would be pleased</li>
      <li>They work very well.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping, arrived with batteries etc.</li>
      <li>I would recommend investing in your skin and getting something that would improve the condition gently.</li>
      <li>Cleanses very well.</li>
      <li>I used it every night with a gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>I chose five stars because of the packaging really.</li>
      <li>Really like the brush.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;clogged pores mainly on chin and around mouth</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s battery operated and has a strong movement, without being abrasive or too rough on the skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>If i&#x27;m having a day where i feel like i do need exfoliator, i add a tsp of baking soda to my normal cleanser</li>
      <li>I wanted to go with a clear sonic, but after reading the reviews on this for more than half the price, I decided to go with this.</li>
      <li>In just 2 uses my face is almost completely clear of all impurities!</li>
      <li>The brush is exactly the same as the one in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed a little cheap looking when it arrived, but it serves the purpose.  </li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>The Clarosonic vibrates while this product goes in complete circles and there are options for bristles.</li>
      <li>My old brush stopped working, it was an off brand type that I had for quite some time.</li>
      <li>but it is noticeably soft.</li>
      <li>Its a little smaller than I expected but other than that its amazing!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it..it leaves my face soft and super clean.</li>
    <li> Not feel something special yet.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleaning system.  great value.</li>
    <li> My old brush stopped working, it was an off brand type that I had for quite some time. I wanted to go with a clear sonic, but after reading the reviews on this for more than half the price, I decided to go with this. And it does not disappoint! It has two speeds, so you can adjust with what type of cleanser you are using, or the location on your face. And I love how clean I feel after! The micro-gel that comes with it does not have a pleasant aroma, but is abrasive enough as well where you can tell it is cleaning. I recommend using your favorite face wash with this.</li>
    <li> I like the Olay limited edition cleansing facial brush. It works like a charm my face seems clean and refreshed everytime I use it. The only drawback is the price. I paid over 40 bucks for it when I saw the same product at Wal-Mart for 29.97 (limited edition red and all) I do recommend the product but just do some price comparison to get the best deal for the product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a scrub brush for my face.  All of the stores have this exact same item listed for $100.00 or more.  The brush is exactly the same as the one in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed a little cheap looking when it arrived, but it serves the purpose.  The products are over priced for the purpose they serve but that is the market these days.</li>
    <li> This system fit a need for deeper cleaning that I felt would benefit my skin&#x27;s texture which it certainly did.</li>
    <li> Olay has never disappointed me. This limited edition red cleansing is handy for travel and easy to use. It comes with the cleanser, but if you prefer your own cleanser, you can also use that.&lt;br /&gt;The item was neatly packed and delivered/arrived early.</li>
    <li> It is good, not like mia, but someone with budget concerns should appreciate it, I love it so far! Worths the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a moth now.  I like it.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my skin but it is noticeably soft.</li>
    <li> I have oily yet flaky skin. Go figure. Tried all sorts of exfoliators, and some worked better than others. But this.....wow. Immediate results. I found using the exfoliator every day, left my skin feeling hot and raw, so I stopped using that, and just opted for my usual Neutrogena Natural Cleanser. No exfoliator allowed me to use this every day and my skin started getting healthier right away. 3 weeks, and a camping trip later, i have fewer zits and the ones i did have healed nicely. All the flakiness disappeared. If i&#x27;m having a day where i feel like i do need exfoliator, i add a tsp of baking soda to my normal cleanser and it does the trick so i don&#x27;t have to keep buying their expensive product that my skin doesn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I chose five stars because of the packaging really. I Was really impressed as everthing was in it that was stated an the size is fairly good for the price.  I will however post another review after about a week of using it. I played around with the brush a lil and even without the cleanser applied, It feels awesome on my face. Kudos for now.</li>
    <li> its ok if you cant afford a cla-!sonic.  but it just spins.  save your money get the mid-range nutrasonic, its much better</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, I just wish the brush head was bigger. It&#x27;s battery operated and has a strong movement, without being abrasive or too rough on the skin. A great face washing tool!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the $200+ one. I have both and this one works just as amazing. I actually use this one more. It&#x27;s smaller and easy to travel with. The one downside which I think a couple people mention is it doesn&#x27;t have a body attachment which I love on my clarisonic but I still love this one very much and maybe one day they will make that attachment. Seriously buy this, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve tried!! Its a little smaller than I expected but other than that its amazing! In just 2 uses my face is almost completely clear of all impurities! In my opinion Its better than the clarisonic, well certainly a better deal!</li>
    <li> So I really wanted a Clarosonic and after reading a few reviews it seemed like a good and affordable replacement to buy this item. I gave this a one star for the fact that I received it as planned. But the product is harsh on my skin and I only used it a few times. I should probably see if I can get a refund. The brushes bristles are harsh on the skin and it doesn&#x27;t make my clean feel clean, it actually feels worst. I&#x27;m sorry to say that but it&#x27;s true. It works more as an Exfoliator, in my opinion, and we know we&#x27;re not suppose to exfoliate our face daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longer story short, I tried to use it a few more times to see if I would be pleased but it&#x27;s just too harsh. I gave in a brought a Clarosonic Mia at Dillard&#x27;s about a week ago and it&#x27;s so much better. There is a huge difference in the products. The Clarosonic vibrates while this product goes in complete circles and there are options for bristles. I would recommend investing in your skin and getting something that would improve the condition gently. I brought the Clarosonic And unlike this product I use it twice a day and I feel the improvement.</li>
    <li> Really like the brush. It was small so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use anywhere other than your face unless you have a lot of time in the shower.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! this cleans my face like tha claresonic one i had, but it&#x27;s way more cheaper. I use makeup remover and then clean my face with  the scrup and pro-x which is perfection!</li>
    <li> Ok it&#x27;s no clearsonic but for the price this little gadget is pretty awesome. So far I&#x27;m very happy with my results!</li>
    <li> I thought I had a great skin care routine, until I bought this! My skin feels incredibly smooth afterwards and my skin drinks my moisturizer, its incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my cetaphil face wash and what a world of a difference it makes when I apply it with my hands versus the pro X.&lt;br /&gt;After just two nights of use, I notice a huge difference in the appearance of my nose blackheads! As I was using the pro X, I could literally see blackheads emerging from my nose, and as I washed my face afterwards, I washed away many blackheads that my pro X was able to lift up.&lt;br /&gt;Incredible! Buy this!!!!&lt;br /&gt;....PS: I bought the red color and paid an extra $8 for it, the red color is such a gorgeous deep red, I&#x27;m glad I spent an extra $8 and got a cute color LOL! My boyfriend asked why I would pay EXTRA money for the same product but just in a different color. Ladies, you feel me right? Lol!</li>
    <li> love this product...makes my face glow and blemish free</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and my husband using it also.  It&#x27;s great to clean your face and reduces black heads</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth it. I wasn&#x27;t up to spending hundreds of dollars on a cleansing system, especially not being sure of the results. This electric brush proved to be well worth it. Cleanses very well. Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I like how it cleanses my face. Although I have never tried the expensive Sonic face brushes, I think this does the job. The only reason why I deducted a star is because the replacement brushes are expensive, but I have used generic brushes with it and it works fine.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter was fighting breakouts.  After using it for a couple of months there is a very good improvement. She is still saying thanks.  I did swap out the products inside for something more suited to her skin issues, but I am using that and happy to report my skin looks better too.</li>
    <li> it was a Christmas gift for my wife. She love it.</li>
    <li> Enjoyed using this the last six months and plan to keep using as long as I am seeing these good results! Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is working good, my skin feels softer and cleaner, and i my acne got less :) I am so thankful for this cleansing system!!!! Fast shipping, arrived with batteries etc. 5 STARS</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, she likes it and says here skin is looking better from using it. Try it!</li>
    <li> Not the worst, but it feels cheap</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of them, one for myself and one for my daughters.  The reviews helped me decide to purchase these without any prior knowledge of these products.  They work very well.  The brush is soft but effective.  It was a nice kit.</li>
    <li> Really liked it. Every-time I use it it makes my skin very nice and smooth. It is good stuff to use it even occasionally.</li>
    <li> Cheap piece of crap! Can&#x27;t even be called a toy as most toys are made better! Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever works right away</li>
    <li> For the price,  I love this purchase.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this has done nothing for my skin. It feels nice, but that&#x27;s about it. I don&#x27;t understand how it has helped so many people...A little info on me+ my skin:&lt;br /&gt;Combination-Oily&lt;br /&gt;20yo&lt;br /&gt;Have always gotten a few pimples around that time of months&lt;br /&gt;Sometime get those fat painful &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34; pimples&lt;br /&gt;lots of blackheads/pores with oxidized stuff on nose+around nose&lt;br /&gt;clogged pores mainly on chin and around mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the above issues improved at all. I used it every night with a gentle cleanser. Will continue using it, but am not hopeful it will help still.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and it does wonders for cleaning your face. Highly recommended</li>
</ol>
