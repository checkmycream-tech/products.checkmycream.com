<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First, let me say that I love the smell of this serum. It&#x27;s lovely! I also really like the feel of the serum as you spread it on your face. I have noticed that my skin is a little drier than it has been since using this product. It has not caused any redness or rashes on my sensitive skin and that&#x27;s a plus. To combat the dryness, I am using 100% pure Argan oil as a follow up. That does seem to help with the dryness. I am anxious to see what results that this product gives me over a longer period of time (a month or more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a week now. I really like it so far.  It smells like rose and when I put it on I can feel the difference almost instantly on my skin. I have tried different serums and so far this one has the quickest results.  The consistency is very nice, not sticky, heavy or greasy, and it spreads very evenly. A little bit goes a very long way too. I put it on in the morning, let it dry and put a light moisturizer on over it because I have dry skin. I am hoping that using it over a longer period of time I will see enhanced results.</li>
    <li> This serum goes on so lightly and soaks in so completely that it make my face (and my declotage and the backs of my hands) dewy soft but not greasy or shiny. It have a lovely soft rose scent and seems to be making a difference in my skin tone. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks but my skin is softer and the fine lines around my eyes are starting to look less noticeable.  I purchased this product thru a special offer in trade for my review but that has no bearing on the positivity of my review. This is a wonderful product and I&#x27;m excited to see what further results I have with more prolonged use. I sure do like my new dewy soft skin!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results after trying this product. It leaves skin smooth and radiant, wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable, and it has a great subtle smell of roses.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Received at discount price</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells just like a fresh rose and is very light. I don&#x27;t like heavy products on my face, especially in the summer, and the weight of this is perfect. As another reviewer said, it&#x27;s slightly thicker than water. I have only used the product for a week but can see a noticeable difference in my skin. It looks smoother all over and some of my fine lines seem to have gotten even finer. It dries very quickly and leaves your skin feeling taught and very soft.</li>
    <li> Like the way it feels on, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give a good  result from using it.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this product. Her skin is softer and she looks more youthful. This was a great gift, thank you.</li>
    <li> This serum is something special.  I adore skin care based on rose extracts, and this serum is the most concentrated product of this type to come my way.  Proposed to me for evaluation and review, it has blown me away with its intense aroma and visible firming action.  Two pumps is all I need for my whole face and neck.  The serum is very liquid and penetrates really quickly, so much so that I can often go over the same area (like around the eyes) adding more.  It has a pulling and firming action which seems to instantly diminish the appearance of deep lines and wrinkles.  My face is then more than ready to accept the nourishing and hydrating cream I happen to favour at the moment.  Whatever I apply, it will sink into my skin much more easily than without the preparatory step of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else which is typical of rose extract is the purifying action on skin impurities.  My mixed skin appears to be coping well with the drying effect of sun and wind, and I notice very little shine in my T zone.  I also find this preparation very soothing right after derma rolling, when my skin is somewhat tender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand may be new but everything I read about them reassured me:  solid science, powerful natural and, mostly organic ingredients, avoidance of toxic additives, full money-back guarantee and, very important to me, no animal testing.  The formulation of Rose Renew includes 10% Hyaluronic Acid Serum (anti-ageing ingredient par excellence), Rosewater, Rose Absolute (rose petal essential oil obtained through solvent extraction), Rosehip Seed Oil, MSM, Kojic Acid and Glycol Acid (these last three help with skin discolouration and loss of elasticity, and minimize the appearance of lines and wrinkles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of regular use, morning and night, I&#x27;m really pleased with the condition of my skin.  I have been using top quality skin care for over two years, so my gauge of effectiveness is to see my skin looking as good as before, which is certainly the case with this serum.  The other, even more important test, is that my face looks fresher and more hydrated AFTER the serum as compared to how it looks when I get up.  The toning and perking-up effect is very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean and sleek plastic bottle holds 33 ml (slightly above the usual for a face serum) and the pump works very well to accurately dispense the liquid.  The current price (less than $23) is extremely reasonable for such quality and a fraction of comparable products from well-known brands.  Based on my usage, I expect the bottle to last three months, which makes this great value for money.  Definitely one I will be buying again once my bottle is finished.h this serum.

    <li> i really like this item. The scent is light and pleasing. The formulation is smooth, light and easily absorbed by my skin. I have been using it every day in my routine for a couple of weeks and have had no break outs. My skin is feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced price for my opinion. My opinion is my own and based on my experience with this product thus far.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say ore good things about this serum.  First of all, the ingredients are top-notch - 70% organic and none of the harmful things I&#x27;m trying to phase out of my skin care regimen: no parabens, phlalates, sulfates, or petrochemical derivatives.  It&#x27;s a cruelty free and vegan formula, so I can feel good about using this and recommending this to my super-conscious friends.  Best of all this is made by an all-female team!  How many companies can you say that about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the results!  This light serum absorbs really quickly with no weird tightening effect that you can sometimes get with lighter serums.  The rose smell is divine, but not overpowering.  This is a great first layer under your moisturizer day or night.  I did notice some significant brightening, but no change on my fine lines or wrinkles.  I&#x27;m 35, so no deep furrows yet, but I do have my share of fine lines as a new mama and all that lovely sleep deprivation ;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightning fast shipping and would most definitely order from this seller again.  It also sounds like these gals are consign out with other formulations and I plan in being first in line to try them out, nit only because I love supporting an ethical and female-run company, but this serum is great!</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Heavenly, real rose scent. It comes from rose water (first ingredient) and rose absolute. Rose absolute costs a mint, so I’m always impressed by a product that uses it. Many “high end” skin care products have nothing in them that costs the manufacturer more than pennies a bottle. Not so here.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: It’s a thin gel with no real sticky, slippery, or oily feel.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Neutral.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: I think it should work for all. Doesn’t irritate my hypersensitive redness prone oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: Upscale-looking pump bottle. Designed like an airless pump but is a very controllable normal pump. Very classy looking.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Okay - we’re in tricky territory here. I try to evalute on strictly factual observations by applying products to the back of one hand and one side of my face. I then look for things like reduction in fine wrinkles, moist or glowing appearance, smoother skin, less flushed skin - anything I can objectively point to and say “that side looks better.” I don’t see anything like that with this product, BUT, I’ve used it on my full face a number of times and I swear when I look in the mirror next time I think, “my skin looks really good!” This could be a placebo effect because I love this product and want it to work. That’s the tricky part.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* What I said up above about few formulas using costly ingredients? This one is packed full of wildcrafted and organic natural oils and extracts that are known to be excellent for the skin, and many of them you don’t often find in skin care products because they’re expensive. Just a few I’m impressed with are melissa, rosewood, and rose geranium. Other excellent skin care ingredients include licorice, rosehip seed oil, ginseng, anise, horseradish, fennel, horsetail, and dandilion. More mainstream ingredients include hyaluronic acid, kojic acid, salicylic acid, and vitamin E. It’s an awesome broth of natural skin care goodies and should certainly help long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a personal note, I know quite a bit about skin care formulas and also review a boatload of them. It takes a lot for one to stand out and really impress me. A few of my test products end up getting used on my face along with my regular regimen. Most of the testers go on my neck, hands, and other areas until used up. I will be using every drop of this on my face and quite probably re-ordering it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.

My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer.

    <li> The scent was wonderful and the packing was great as well. My skin feels softer than before. Its amazing! I was given a discount to try this product, but I would buy this when I run out of this one! Great job! All I needed was 2 pumps to have my face feel a cooling sensation. It&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;My review are my own opinions and thoughts</li>
    <li> This Rose Renew Anti Aging serum helps to keep skin soft and moisturized, and has a lovely light floral scent.  We purchased the serum in a promotion for testing and review.  The Rose Renew serum  contains no parabens, no synthetic colors or fragrances, no petrochemicals, no sulphates, no EDTA, no Pegs and no phlalates.  The serum is 70% organic, contains natural ingredients and selected scientific ingredients to provide an ideal serum to brighten, tone and give you a softer face.  The packaging is very nice and would make for a terrific gift.  We gave the remainder of ours to my Mom, because she loved it so much.</li>
    <li> I must say I was/am VERY shocked. This product ACTUALLY WORKED!! Goes on very soft &amp; silky. I noticed a difference in my wrinkles in just a day. Especially those two lines between my eyes &amp; I had been fighting those for years &amp; was even considering Botox. Now I don&#x27;t have to. I am 54yrs old but NO-ONE can believe it.  This has a light Rose scent to it and at first I thought I wouldn&#x27;t use it bc I don&#x27;t like that scent. It dissipates shortly after being put on plus the RESULTS are worth it. I just can&#x27;t say enough GOOD things about this product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I have bought tons of products that Promise all kinds of younger looking, less wrinkled, pore reduction skin that Did NOTHING!! I was able to purchase this at a reduced cost for giving my review. I would have given the same one if I had paid full price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. It smells amazing, just like a rose. It makes your skins feel so soft and fragrant. It makes you feel like a movie star would use. Even though I got it for my unbiased opinion i absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Sorry. I never did get a chance to use the code and purchase this item</li>
    <li> I tried this as a review and I love it. It smells great, dries fast and even after using it for only a week, I have noticed a change in the fine lines. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just received rose renew serum two days ago. So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. Love the smell! It&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs well. My skin feels fresh and soft, and I have no reason to use any other moisturisers. Not sure about the plumping or wrinkle improvement, but I will keep up with using it in my daily routine and find out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally not a product girl but this eye cream is amazing. It&#x27;s light, refreshing and easy to use. I&#x27;m loving it and so impressed with the price!!!</li>
    <li> The Baie Botanique made my face nice and soft it makes me look a lot younger</li>
    <li> Been using it for a week and can already see the wrinkles around my eyes going away!!</li>
    <li> My face feels and looks great. Light weight and cant even tell I have it on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I received it and I absolutely love it. It smells like roses and seeps into your skin so quickly! I use it after I cleanse my face in the morning and night and pat it into my dry skin then following with my favorite moisturizer. My skin has been so smooth and radiant lately and I know this is a big reason why! It feels so refreshing on your skin. I am in love! You only need a tiny pump of this to cover your face so it will last a while!</li>
    <li> first time to use it.&lt;br /&gt;skin become more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;i got the coupon to buy this product and leave my true review.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have very sensitive skin, and this seems to even out some of the redness.  It smells good and is a nice base for foundation.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this firming serum!  It has the most lovely rosy scent.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly and best of all: it leaves my face silky soft.  It is paraben free, which is very important me.  Also, it has no sulphates, phlalates or petrochemicals.  I&#x27;ve found my go to anti-aging serum with Baie Botanique Rose Renew.  I cannot wait to try their rose face cream!</li>
    <li> I got this product through Amazon Reviewer and I was blown away. It made my skin feel amazing!  When I used it at night my skin was soft and moisturized and I used it this morning before my make up. A lot of times I get dry throughout the day but I didn&#x27;t today at all. My make up wore great the entire day. On top of that I got this product overnight when it should have taken 2 days. Great experience</li>
    <li> I am 51  &amp; recently lost 80 pounds. Wow, you would not believe the wrinkles in my face, not to mention my dark &amp; puffy under eyes that I inherited ! But, after using this 3 weeks, I look 35 ! Everyone needs to try this ! I LOVE IT ! Will keep using it. A+ product ! Greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used ! Unbelievable !</li>
    <li> Rose Renew Anti-Aging Serum has a pleasant odor (smells just like dried roses), absorbs very quickly without feeling greasy or messy and shows almost immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is a young-looking fifty-year-old, but like all of us was beginning to experience some wrinkles and discoloration in her skin due to aging. To top that off, she is working full-time and pursuing another degree in school, so she&#x27;s been burning the candle at both ends. As a result she was beginning to show some dark puffiness under her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my wife has been using this item for almost two weeks the dark bags under her eyes have totally disappeared, the little wrinkles around her eyes and lips are almost invisible, and her complexion has become much more youthful looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you sell this in gallons? (Disclaimer: I asked my wife about that last line and she thought it was funny!)</li>
    <li> Love the product not greasy - leaves skin smooth</li>
    <li> I love anything made with rose essences and this product does not fall short of expectation. I love the way it makes my face feel and I love the smell it leaves. It is a light fragrance that lingers for a while and is very pleasant. It isn&#x27;t oily nor does it dry out your face. It is the perfect medium for moisturization and feeling relaxed and pampered.</li>
