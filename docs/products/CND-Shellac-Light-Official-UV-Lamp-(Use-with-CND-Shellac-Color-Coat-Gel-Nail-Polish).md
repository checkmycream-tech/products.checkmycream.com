<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great!  I finally decided DYI was the way to go...Turns out like the too many to count manis and pedis I have paid for in salons, even better!  I am picky and like my nails done a certain way....this lamp &amp; the shellac polish are the cats meow!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  only complaint is the box was ripped on the side when we recieved it.</li>
    <li> exelent I use it a lot at the beauty salon, it might be expensive but saves you a lot of money in the end. They charge me about 20 dollars everytime it is applied. Just imagine having it at home.</li>
    <li> Even though I couldn&#x27;t get the cover off to install the light bulbs, the unit is easy to use and dries the top and base coats in the allotted times. A little expensive but cost effective in the long run. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> CND UV Lamp is junk do not buy,  we purchased 4 of these lamps and three weeks later two of them stopped working, each of them only lights on two bulbs, we contacted the distributor Direct Nails supply in Dorchester MA,  they said don&#x27;t have a return policy, the only thing they can do is sending back to CND to fix.  Waiting over four weeks with out nothing.  Just buy from Amazon directly you might save yourself some frustration.</li>
    <li> I bought the cheaper one (not CND brand) and it wouldn&#x27;t cure the CND polish, thus I returned it, and got this, works like the salon :)</li>
    <li> This is a great light for your nails.  When you don&#x27;t have time to go to the nail salon, it&#x27;s a great option.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry the gel even after tripling manufacturer suggestion uv session times and still smudges!  Very disappointed I would not recommend</li>
    <li> I really like because you can set whatever time you want for setting the Nail Shellac.  Its fast and easy!</li>
    <li> This works great and will save me money in the long run by not having to pay salon prices.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is the top of the line shellac machine on the market. I have saved hundreds just by doing my own nails.  If you can brush on regular polish on your nails this is no difference.  After 4 at home treatments the machine pays for itself.</li>
    <li> the best  you can get in the market.It works perfect. I used with CND but I guess it can be used with any other one</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> This is an industry quality Shellac Lamp and can be cumbersome unless you have an area to leave it out for quick and easy availability. I suggest a cover when not in use as I practice this with all of my electric products. Just keeps them clean and dust free. If you purchase this product, it would help to purchase CND Shellac colors, top and base coats as well. Being new with shellac nails, I&#x27;m trying to experiment with a variety of brands. Have found CND brands to work well, so far. Important: remember to fix any mistakes prior to &amp;#34;curing&amp;#34; under the lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Another product to have available is gloves to cover the hands and fingers below the tips. With your hands under the UV lamp for up to 6-10 minutes, no need for the extra damage. My hands following application of the shellac without using the gloves will appear discolored. I take this lamp on extended trips and would like to have a smaller version.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the lamp. Will also look for a smaller, less bulky lamp.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Light weight and efficient. I also like that it has a handle on the end of it for carrying it. Very handy.</li>
    <li> I love painting my own nails with the help of the UV Lamp. It&#x27;s super easy and the timer settings I need are already pre-programmed.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and finish product is very professional.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a UV lamp,</li>
    <li> Love this light. Fast shipping!! Grade AAA</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described. Nails last two weeks. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I read almost of the reviews prior to buying this lamp.  I would agree that maybe the buttons are slightly &amp;#34;worn looking&amp;#34; but since that has happened to so many people, it appears to be how it is from the mfg.  Works perfect, just read the instructions first before use.  I did have a heck of a time removing the lid intially to install the lamps and remove the protective plastic wrap, but once I did that I will know what to do next time.  My local nail salon has this lamp and also a new OPI lamp.  There are so unhappy with the OPI lamp and shellac system, they are returning it and sticking only to the CND products.  If you are going to use CND shellac, I woud recommend this CND lamp.  The entire system is amazing.  I am HARSH on my nails and my polish lasts PERFECT for 11-12 days  I use light colors and could probably even stretch it a day or two past that if I had too.  This is amazing technology.</li>
    <li> I love being able to do my nails at home.  They turn out beautifully and the light works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have been getting my nails done for a long time now. Thinking to get this and I have to say it is as easy as I thought it would be. I love it and U will too as U use it. Just be careful when removing the shellac sometime that can be rough. But for the rest I find it extremely easy.</li>
    <li> Nails completely dry in 10 seconds. Awesome</li>
    <li> This uv lamp is perfect for doing my own nails. I do recommend getting the gloves to protect your hands while under the lamp though.</li>
    <li> This light is the real thing and works very well to give your manicure that salon finish look.  very easy to assemble</li>
    <li> This is a great piece of equipment, I use it all the time (Im a professional nail tech). it works well and I have had no challenges at all.&lt;br /&gt;Im grateful</li>
    <li> You need this lamp in order to do gels or shellac, you can also do the Shellac on acrylics ypour polish will last longer, it helps not doing back fills. the lamps have settings so the tech only needs to push the botton!</li>
    <li> This lamp is amazing!!! I love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it! love it!</li>
    <li> I recently started using the CND shellac products at home. I am so glad I spent a little extra and got the official CND UV Lamp. This lamp is worth the price! I did my research and Amazon had the lowest price. The lamp is amazing and the preset drying times are great! I have been doing my own nails for over 15 years and absolutely love the shellac! I typically get anywhere from 14-17 days out of my manicure and this stuff is very durable. I recommend getting the anti UV gloves to protect your hands during your manicure.</li>
    <li> This lamp has lights both top &amp; side.  So, it cures completely.  It is easy to use, lightweight, and definitely professional quality.  However, after having the lamp for 2 months, and approximately 20 shellac cures, it quit working.  I contacted the seller, and they informed me that you could only return items within 30 days of purchase.  They only contacted me through e-mail, not knowing exactly what was wrong with the lamp.  I was not happy.  I contacted CND by the 800 number on the lamp.  They advised me that they do not warranty anything purchased on Amazon or Ebay, because they have no idea how long the seller had the machine before selling it to you, or if they refurbished the machine in any way.  Makes sense.  Then, she told me one time only, she would replace my lamp, but that I should only purchase CND products at reputable salons in the future.</li>
    <li> The lamp was easy to assemble and was ready to use in minutes. I will use this often and enjoy it.!!!</li>
    <li> After one month and several uses I am happy.  Over time, this product will save major dollars and give you total satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Received this product and it was supposed to be new in the box. Maybe it was new but a 2nd or something. The keypad looked wore out that you would select the time on. Although, this product works perfectly and I love it.</li>
    <li> CND did a great job with this lamp. Easy to use. Gets the job done great.  The pre set times and timer are very helpful when applying shellac.</li>
    <li> LOVE this dryer! I used it with OPI, Gelish Gelaze and  Shellac! Worth the investment! Speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought my lamp several months ago and would never want to be without it again.  It&#x27;s so much better than using regular nail polish.  The lamp works perfectly so far.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome machine it works great and is easy to use anyone could use it in their home</li>
    <li> Even though i had to watch a you tube video to assemble it i think it will be great. The buttons look like the paint was faulty and not the essiest to read it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this machine and I am very satisfied. It is more sophisticated than others (because it has a 4 different programmated timer that you can change for your needs).  Also, I saw that same machine for 189$ on the internet and 172$ in a store in Quebec.  I paid 117$ (shipping and handling included).  I really feel I made a good deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a year and a half ago.  I love it!  My nail polish stays on for two weeks - as long as I don&#x27;t get the polish too close to the skin.  Otherwise, it might lift.  I have taken this with me on many trips to do my friend&#x27;s nails or family and they love it.  I have definitely got my money out of this since it cost $40 bucks to have this done in the salon!</li>
    <li> great !! works good  shipping and everything was good !! i love this im saving a lot of money using it i recommend it!!</li>
    <li> The sipping took a little bit longer but the item is exactly a a described and good price .</li>
    <li> Great product. Just what I wanted</li>
    <li> I recently bought this lamp at a beauty supply store for $99!!!! Had to get it! Now I get to do my nails on my own whenever I need to. I justified my purchase by the fact that every salon visit is $30 plus tip.  I will make my $ back in 2 months if I out the polish and other items I bought. I highly recommend this lamp.</li>
    <li> This shellac machine is very sturdy and well made. It provides great results, just as any CND product does. It drys the shellac hard just as it promises and the polish stays on easily 2 weeks. I and so glad I went with CND.</li>
    <li> The best!!!!! Love this baby and beat those 35.00 manicure&#x27;s don&#x27;t ever want to be without it, love, love, love it!!!!1</li>
    <li> I purchased this light to go with my Shellac Starter Kit.  I have been very pleased with this light.  The quality of this light is very noticeable!  It has a little &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; behind it - meaning it isn&#x27;t light and cheap feeling.  Its definitely worth the extra money for the quality and features this light has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - There are instructions on how to set up the light before your first use.  Make sure to remove all of the blue protective film before installing the bulbs and turning on the light for the first time.  It&#x27;s a little tricky trying to place your fingers in the right place the first time to remove the top cover, but once I figured it out removing the film and installing the bulbs was a easy.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the CND UV light.  Reasonably priced.  Will have the purchase paid within the year or less by skipping the salon priced nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was shipped and received exceding my expectations.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I decided to spend a little more money and get this UV lamp.  It&#x27;s sturdy and really made  nice and it works great!  It has 4 different preset time settings that are needed for shellac manicures. You can also program it yourself if these times don&#x27;t suit your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a little hint...  Before using it, you need to take the top off of the unit to remove some protective blue film off of the insides.  It&#x27;s a little tricky to remove the lid.  Don&#x27;t force it.  I watched a CND official video on how to remove the top on youtube.  It was a big help!  You can find a lot of other how-to videos there for doing shellac manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this.  I was very pleased with the fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lamp quite a few times now. It has the removable bottom tray, should you decide to do pedicures. It also contains a fan to keep it ventilated while using. I find this product worth the price.</li>
    <li> This dryer will set gel polish.... Eventually.  36 watts is best to set gels.  But this dryer will work, it just takes longer to do so..</li>
