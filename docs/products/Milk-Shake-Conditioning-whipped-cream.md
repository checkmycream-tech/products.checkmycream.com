<li> It makes me hair soft, sleek, and manageable.</li>
<li> This mousse leave-in conditioner also seems to protect my hair while using my flat iron.</li>
<li> I like to flat iron my hair and this product</li>
<li> One cannister of this goes a long way, too; I think it lasted a year or so before I ran out of one bottle, and that was with regular usage.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not so frizzy or dry anymore</li>
<li> I have dry hair to start with</li>
<li> I usually start to frizz at the ends as the day progresses, but with this product, I can actually go two days before I have to shampoo and restyle!  </li>
<li> I have less frizz</li>
<li> Not worth the $5 savings at all!</li>
<li> So, while it&#x27;s a bit expensive, this&#x27;ll last you a while.</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend the product itself, but I don&#x27;t know how bad the shipping process may be.</li>

    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist of 12 years.  I have dry hair to start with and I highlight and color my hair adding to the dryness.  This product  makes my hair soft  and manageable. Love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the whole Milk Shake line! I can&#x27;t say I got it from Amazon; my salon recommended it for me, and I&#x27;m glad I use it.

I would definitely recommend the product itself, but I don&#x27;t know how bad the shipping process may be.</li>
