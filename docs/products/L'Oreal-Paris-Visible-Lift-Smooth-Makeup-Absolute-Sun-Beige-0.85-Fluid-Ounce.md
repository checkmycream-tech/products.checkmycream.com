      <li>I think this is the best make-up ever.  </li>
      <li>excellent makeup and  a discount from buying in the stores</li>
      <li>But the best part is the brush.  </li>

      <li>IT WENT ON VERY GOOD</li>
      <li>BUT AT THE END IT LOOKED GREAT ON ME.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Complexion without foundation doesn&#x27;t look great in photographs at any age...</li>
      <li>but otherwise very happy being able to buy it on Amazon since no longer sold in stores.</li>
      <li>Ummm I guess my sisters loved it, bought it for her</li>
      <li>This foundation is all that I will use since I discovered it,  the brush provides the perfect amount of product and my hands stay clean.</li>
      <li>AMAZING</li>
      <li>good price thanks you made my sister happy :)</li>
      <li>After giving up on &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; that emphasized rather than minimized fine lines on older skin, this is the best I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s  very cheaply priced on Amazon in comparison with the stores</li>
      <li>For all those &amp;#34;cruise&amp;#34; photographs, this works for older skin as well as youthful beautiful faces.</li>
      <li>I love this make up.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>and i LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>the brush in the bottle makes for an easy application.  </li>
      <li>smooth, no mess, great color</li>
      <li>and I can spread it around more evenly and quickly.  </li>
      <li>Loreal in general is a good brand , and as it was ecpected this one is perfect as well , brush is very soft and tender , i would recomed it for dry sckin as it makes it look softer and better</li>
      <li>I love this products, stays on you face very long, but what I love the most about it is the applicator.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery.</li>
      <li>it came quickly and was exactly s</li>
      <li>I have been using this same product in the pump bottle and love it, however I have had difficulty finding it in my color</li>
      <li>have mentioned difficulty with the makeup coming out too fast or too much of it.  </li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>Best makeup to bad</li>
      <li>so I purchased this new product with the built in application brush.  </li>
      <li>you stated color and all brand new still sealed</li>
      <li>I think this is brilliant - too bad</li>
      <li>and so far it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I rather buy make up directly from the store then on online.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s now only available by scouring the Internet for the last few bottles on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> I love this foundation for the mere fact you do not have to get makeup on your hands!</li>
<li> The color was to lite and it look very dry.</li>
<li> First of all it is difficult to control the amount that comes out.  </li>
<li> Small amount goes a long way.  </li>
<li> It took me a few tries before I mastered that</li>
<li> HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE BRUSH</li>
<li> Now after a few weeks use it no longer dispenses makeup.  </li>
<li> It covers lines and does not look heavy on.</li>
<li> It seemed to be like water, not satisfied with this product at all.</li>
<li> No more goop to wash off of my hands</li>
<li> Second after a few applications the brush feels yucky dirty with caked makeup.  </li>
<li> I hope I am wrong.  </li>

    <li> This is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS AND I APPLIED IT IT WENT ON VERY GOOD HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE BRUSH BUT AT THE END IT LOOKED GREAT ON ME.</li>
    <li> Loreal in general is a good brand , and as it was ecpected this one is perfect as well , brush is very soft and tender , i would recomed it for dry sckin as it makes it look softer and better</li>
    <li> I think this is the best make-up ever.  I believe it might be discontinued.  I hope I am wrong.  Great product.</li>
    <li> A very good product. Like the brush on the end of the applicator. Have used this foundation for 2 years now.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent.  Small amount goes a long way.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> The color was to lite and it look very dry. I rather buy make up directly from the store then on online.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A BEATIFUL FINISH FOUNDATION .I AM 44 AND THIS MAKE MY SKIN LOOK AMAZING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This foundation is all that I will use since I discovered it,  the brush provides the perfect amount of product and my hands stay clean.</li>
    <li> excellent makeup and  a discount from buying in the stores thank you it came quickly and was exactly s you stated color and all brand new still sealed</li>
    <li> When I received this product it was not useable. It seemed to be like water, not satisfied with this product at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The makeup covers well without looking like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  But the best part is the brush.  No more goop to wash off of my hands and I can spread it around more evenly and quickly.  I think this is brilliant - too bad it&#x27;s now only available by scouring the Internet for the last few bottles on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have mentioned difficulty with the makeup coming out too fast or too much of it.  It took me a few tries before I mastered that but in fairness one of my bottles did operate incorrectly.  Others had concerns about germs because the brush stays damp, etc.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem.  I don&#x27;t wash the brush and I cap it after use, I  do nothing else.</li>
    <li> Best makeup to bad they discontinued it</li>
    <li> I bought by accident and i LOVE IT.  I will not buy anything else.  Goes on smooth, no mess, great color</li>
    <li> I love this products, stays on you face very long, but what I love the most about it is the applicator.  It&#x27;s  very cheaply priced on Amazon in comparison with the stores</li>
    <li> I love this foundation for the mere fact you do not have to get makeup on your hands! I wish it did last longer and did not smudge but otherwise very happy being able to buy it on Amazon since no longer sold in stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this same product in the pump bottle and love it, however I have had difficulty finding it in my color so I purchased this new product with the built in application brush.  First of all it is difficult to control the amount that comes out.  Second after a few applications the brush feels yucky dirty with caked makeup.  Tried washing it off but water would not cut it.  Now after a few weeks use it no longer dispenses makeup.  I will return it for credit.  One final comment...this product feels oilier than the pump bottle product.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Ummm I guess my sisters loved it, bought it for her and so far it&#x27;s good price thanks you made my sister happy :)</li>
    <li> I love this make up.  the brush in the bottle makes for an easy application.  It covers lines and does not look heavy on.</li>

Complexion without foundation doesn&#x27;t look great in photographs at any age...
