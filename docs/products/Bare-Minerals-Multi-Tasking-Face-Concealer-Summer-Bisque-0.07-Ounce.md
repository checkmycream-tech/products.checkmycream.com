      <li>It stays smooth all day with no lines or \\&quot;oranginess\\&quot; to it.</li>
      <li>Use this daily, great product.</li>

      <li>The original box was thrown out accidently.</li>

      <li>It covers very well and doesn&#x27;t wear off at all.</li>
      <li>This Summer Bisque loose powder concealer is lighter easily blends.</li>
      <li>If you need even a decent concealer, go with something else.  </li>
      <li>Bare Minerals products have never failed me.</li>
      <li>Less work, less cost, FAR better and more natural coverage.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic - a little goes along way, it covers well, and it stays on throughout the day reasonably well.</li>
      <li>The color looks dark in the picture, but I have lighter skin and this still works fine for me.</li>

      <li>I normally use it for some discoloration left from breakouts and it does what ti should.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For someone who doesn&#x27;t care for the feel of heavy make-up, I was sold on this product from this very first time I used it.</li>
      <li>Always reliable product from bare minerals</li>

      <li>I ordered the shade summer bisque Bare Minerals Multi Tasking Face Concealer and received the shade &amp;#34;bisque&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I get all of the effects of the 4-5 step Bare Minerals program with one product.</li>

    <li> Love my BARE minerals. Covers very well without being heavy.</li>
    <li> This concealer makes all the difference under my makeup.  It brightens my under eye area, decreases the depth of my smile lines, and makes a couple of blotchy areas disappear before I put my foundation over it.  It is so much better than foundation alone.  I think I look so much more flawless!  Be careful, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Not quite the coverage I would prefer, but mix with Loreal mineral concealer it works well</li>
    <li> I ordered the shade summer bisque Bare Minerals Multi Tasking Face Concealer and received the shade &amp;#34;bisque&amp;#34;.  The original box was thrown out accidently. I ordered on line because family illness is consuming my time. I hope this shade will work ok. However I am very reluctant to order makeup on line again. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the entire set of Bare Minerals foundation and have been extremely disappointed in it overall.  I get all of the effects of the 4-5 step Bare Minerals program with one product.,  PUR 4 in 1 Tinted Moisturizer.  Less work, less cost, FAR better and more natural coverage.

The make-up feels weightless, but it provides excellent full-coverage, which is exactly what most are looking for in a make-up. The concealer covers red spots, blemishes, and dark circles with ease. I have used this product for about five years now, and I don&#x27;t plan on changing any time soon. This is also the best price I have found compared to both online and retail store shopping I have done in the past; plus, it&#x27;s delivered right to your door, so what else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I love this concealer! With bareminerals there is no reason I should go a day without a flawless look! I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Five stars.....very satisfied....thank you</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic - a little goes along way, it covers well, and it stays on throughout the day reasonably well.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>

If you need even a decent concealer, go with something else.  Maybeline makes a liquid all natural mineral concealer that is far superior to this junk.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Bare Minerals bisque--this product is good to use over the Amazonian Clay product by Tarte. I have always liked the bisque product.</li>
    <li> I love my Bare Minerals.  The Summer Bisque is a perfect color for my skin.  It&#x27;s like not wearing any make up at all.  It is all so natural.  It leaves my skin looking very smooth. BM is the best!</li>
    <li> Love the product, but not the size. It&#x27;s like a sample size.</li>
    <li> The best concealer I&#x27;ve found.  I have Rosecea and the summer beige is just right for me.</li>
    <li> i use it all the time.  hides woderfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for years now, probably around 5-6. I normally use it for some discoloration left from breakouts and it does what ti should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I need heavy coverage, I do have to couple this with a liquid concealer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Could not do without it.  I do not use foundation, only this product to cover the veins or red spots on my face.  I am 60 years old and this product blends beautifully with my face.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my face before putting on my regular Bare Minerals foundation.  Takes care of all the redness and gives me a flawless complexion.  Gotta love that!</li>
    <li> Conceals well but looks natural - not heavy make up but does the job! And it&#x27;s not bad for your skin.</li>
    <li> I usually have problems selecting the right color due to the fact that I have yellowish-tan skin . But this worked great!!</li>
    <li> The best concealer EVER! I&#x27;m a mineral/powder believer. The coverage is the best you&#x27;ll ever find.</li>
    <li> I have blemishes I want to conceal. This product is gentle on my skin and provides great coverage. A little goes a long way. I normally use BE&#x27;s medium beige loose powder foundation. This Summer Bisque loose powder concealer is lighter easily blends. I recommend using BE&#x27;s brushes for the best effect.</li>
