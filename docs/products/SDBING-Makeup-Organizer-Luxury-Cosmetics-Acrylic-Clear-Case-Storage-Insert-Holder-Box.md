      <li>I love both organizers that come with this.</li>
      <li>Not for this price thats for sure.</li>

      <li>top section rests within an inset to keep it from sliding off, but isn&#x27;t attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I truly love this organizer</li>
      <li>this is the perfect size for your dresser.holds all the basic makeup you will need.</li>
      <li>It came with just the top piece and one set of drawers.</li>
      <li>I am able to find my make up brushes, lip gloss and everything else without my glasses.</li>
      <li>I simply love my makeup organizer.</li>
      <li>now after 3 months the tray has many cracks.</li>
      <li>It also looks lovely and goes with any decor.</li>
      <li>I attached a photo to better see and understand the product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am extremely pleased with this case; it was able to hold practically all my makeup with some room to spare.</li>
      <li>and I can see what items I need to use in the morning more easily.</li>
      <li>Organizes my stuff well, better than living out of a makeup bag, but being plastic it does look a bit cheap.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to find everything now.</li>
      <li>, it holds all my brushes, foundations, lipsticks and gloss easily.</li>
      <li>top organizer is great for miscellaneous items, such as mini lotions or creams.</li>
      <li>but this one was just fine for the amount of makeup I have.</li>
      <li>Super cute way to store and display my makeup.  </li>
      <li>..not cheap.</li>
      <li>This item should be worth 10 bucks at the most.</li>
      <li>Looks nice on my bathroom counter without taking up too much space</li>
      <li>I barely fit three compact powders in one of the lower drawers.</li>
      <li>Since it was acrylic, I thought it might look cheap</li>
      <li>I do not have a huge collection of makeup but my thicker compact won&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>I used the free trial of amazon prime</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m looking for something that will fit my thicker makeups.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it holds everything really well, is sturdy and a wonderful organizer!</li>
      <li>The best perk, REASONABLE PRICE as compared to other vendors.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to hold a cosmetic bag full of stuff</li>
      <li>I love how it&#x27;s clear and everything is easy to find.</li>
      <li>Fabulous has everything right where I can grab it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for anyone that is wanting to get more organized.</li>
      <li>u can take the drawers out completely which is very comfortable.</li>
      <li>However for more advanced makeup applicators such as make up artist</li>
      <li>The storage box is useful for my home when used in the bathroom where it contains miscellaneous “stuff”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s clear</li>
      <li>This product arrived quickly and exactly like pictured and described.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it is just the right size for me.</li>
      <li>The smaller draws could fit a few small pieces of concealers and corrector&#x27;s storage looks better not too over crowded so that the light shines through the container beautifully :)</li>
      <li>The entire unit feels very sturdy and nice.</li>
      <li>Great organizer for makeup and drawers can be used for makeup or smaller necklace chains that get lost in a big jewelry chest.</li>
      <li>It holds a lot of things and looks pretty on display.  </li>
      <li>I wish it was offered with bigger drawers to place more items in them.</li>
      <li>If your storing palette&#x27;s it will take up most of the storage inside the larger draws.</li>
      <li>Really like this organizer!  </li>
      <li>It also helps me find things much easier than thrown in the drawer!</li>
      <li>The drawers are not cheap or flimsy, and they hold a good amount of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>i received a slightly damaged piece, so they refund me a nice discount.</li>
      <li>You can fit alit more if you have mostly small pieces to store.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t fit very much in there - the little drawers are very narrow/skinny - can&#x27;t fit much in them at all</li>
      <li>My daughter loves this product, plus it keeps her vanity looking a whole lot neater</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on my night stand</li>
      <li>Did not realize she had so much make-up.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>A lot of products are too big to fit in them.</li>
      <li>Who knew that my make up could be so organized which helps me save time when I&#x27;m getting ready to go to work</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much</li>
      <li>after a few weeks the top section started cracking on the right corner.</li>
      <li>This item definitely helps keep my &amp;#34;common&amp;#34; day to day make-up picks accessible.</li>
      <li>New York</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave this a four star is that sometimes, the drawers doesn&#x27;t glide back in smoothly- causing it to get stuck often</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In the beginning this product was great! However it quickly fell apart and the two bottom drawers do not fit properly. I will never purchase from this brand again. I am a firm believer in you get what you pay for, and thiproduct doesn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter for Christmas, wish I would have bought two. Did not realize she had so much make-up. Thanks</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it. Just as it looks.</li>
    <li> Received this a couple of days ago and love it! Good quality. ..not cheap. Compared price with other sites...This is the best price I found.</li>
    <li> Holds enough of my &#x27;daily use&#x27; products. Don&#x27;t expect this to hold a cosmetic bag full of stuff but it&#x27;s the perfect size for a bathroom countertop.  I paired this with the acrylic apothecary jars and my bathroom countertop clutter is history! This is not cheap thin plastic either, but quality heavy duty acrylic. You won&#x27;t be sorry to have this!</li>
    <li> This item should be worth 10 bucks at the most. The drawers get stuck on each other all the time and pull the other out while trying to pull only one out. There are cracks all along 2 sides of mine and a black mark on one of the drawers. It serves its purpose to organize some of my eyeliners and lipsticks and is a temporary place for my jewelry until I get a jewelry box but I wouldn&#x27;t say I would recommend it to anyone. Not for this price thats for sure.</li>
    <li> This case overall is 9.4 inches wide, 5.4 inches deep and 7.2 inches tall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two large lower drawers are 8.3 inches by 4.8 inches on the inside and the two upper are less than half that, they are all 1.1 inches deep. This bottom section with the drawers is 4.3 inches tall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top section rests within an inset to keep it from sliding off, but isn&#x27;t attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 12 small compartments are square, but about the size of a nickel. Next to those on the left is the largest compartment at 4 inches wide and 3.5 inches deep. Behind that there are two compartments about 2 inches wide x 1 inch deep x 3 inches tall. This leaves the compartment behind the twelve, which is 4.2 wide x 1.2 inches deep x 1 inch tall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These drawers work fine, but they are acrylic and not fine furniture. They contain non slip liners that can be removed. The storage box is useful for my home when used in the bathroom where it contains miscellaneous “stuff”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps when deciding this online purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sent for review.</li>
    <li> I wish it was alittle bigger cause i have SO MUCH but other than that it really is a space saver!</li>
    <li> I truly love this organizer it&#x27;s pretty durable and the dividers are great. Who knew that my make up could be so organized which helps me save time when I&#x27;m getting ready to go to work</li>
    <li> Got mine at Bed Bath and Beyond when I stumbled across the organizing section for only $19.99 plus tax. Smaller than what I expected. I do not have a huge collection of makeup but my thicker compact won&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s sturdy. Yet, the drawers do glide off when you try to pull it out. Will be returning this product but that&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m looking for something that will fit my thicker makeups.</li>
    <li> The drawers are small but it still fits what I need in them. Wish I could have afforded a bigger one but this one was just fine for the amount of makeup I have. If u have a lot of makeup GET A BIGGER ONE. I don&#x27;t have much and so I knew this would be perfect. Not the best one I know but it works out great for me. I love how it&#x27;s clear and everything is easy to find. Makes my room look cleaner as well without all the mess of looking at loose makeup</li>
    <li> I have been needing something like this for SO long!  I just didn&#x27;t know what to look for.  And for something that doesn&#x27;t take up much space, it definitely is a great place to put quite a bit of stuff!  I finally found a way to put things I need fastest right in front of me, so I don&#x27;t have to spend as long digging through the only 2 drawers I have in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Loved it! I am able to find my make up brushes, lip gloss and everything else without my glasses. I wish I had bought it sooner!</li>
    <li> I simply love my makeup organizer. It offers enough slots for my lipstick tubes, space for things like my concealer, foundation, brushes, etc. The best perk, REASONABLE PRICE as compared to other vendors.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and exactly like pictured and described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear plastic is thick and strong while the black mesh inserts in each drawer keep items from moving around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the drawers are not deep enough to hold thicker makeup items like large compacts and bulky pallets, they do fit standard sized items and thinner pallets. As other reviewers have said, the openings on the top do not fit standard sized nail polish bottles, only small sample sized ones. However, they are the perfect size for lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with this case; it was able to hold practically all my makeup with some room to spare.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product, plus it keeps her vanity looking a whole lot neater</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s perfect size for me and my bathroom counter. Its keeping my countertop organized and I can see what items I need to use in the morning more easily. I used the free trial of amazon prime so I got the product in 2 days as promised. Highly recommend for anyone that is wanting to get more organized.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers commented, the polish holders are tiny, they&#x27;re made for 0.125 oz polish. That&#x27;s the itsy, bitsy, tiny square polish bottles. However, all the polish I have fits in the square compartment next to it. Hair cutting scissors fit in the drawer. Nail files have a place in a drawer or upright in the back slots. If I had room, I&#x27;d buy another base. The size is correct, I measured before buying and it looks so much bigger than I expected.</li>
    <li> Fabulous has everything right where I can grab it.</li>
    <li> Awesome storage! It is a bit small but it fits all my mineral loose pigments and eyeliners! I love that it also has lipstick slots! Very good quality!</li>
    <li> So disappointed. I was anxiously waiting for my first makeup organizer. When I opened it one the sides of the acrylic case was cracked. I still set it up, because maybe I thought I could fix it. But when I put it all together and tried to open the drawers it was not what I expected it. You are not able to open one drawer at a time, they all just come out. And I also expected it to be bigger. I&#x27;m sadly returning the product!</li>
    <li> This item definitely helps keep my &amp;#34;common&amp;#34; day to day make-up picks accessible. I have a large inventory of make up on hand from previously working costmetics. The other organizers are near by with the rest of my make-up. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This was the perfect item to get for beginners. All of my make up fit perfectly and it&#x27;s so easy to find everything now. There was a scratch on the side, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> This organizer is small, but has many slots for make-up and eye shadow and all.  It is also good that you can see what is in the drawers.</li>
    <li> Great organizer for makeup and drawers can be used for makeup or smaller necklace chains that get lost in a big jewelry chest. I bought 2 of these to put side by side on my dresser and all of my makeup is neatly organized now.</li>
    <li> It had a lot of scratches on it came in a broken box</li>
    <li> this is the perfect size for your dresser.holds all the basic makeup you will need. and looks really nice.im  happy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Plenty of room for my items, and an attractive way to display your makeup collection. I would recommend to anyone looking to organize their products.</li>
    <li> Great organizer for my make-up, it holds all my brushes, foundations, lipsticks and gloss easily. Looks nice on my bathroom counter without taking up too much space</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup organizer. it is strong and looks very nice as pictured. I wish it was offered with bigger drawers to place more items in them. I barely fit three compact powders in one of the lower drawers. But I was happy to place a lot of the makeup in an organized setting. I complemented the case with some acrylic dividers in my dresser drawers from a local store.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t fit very much in there - the little drawers are very narrow/skinny - can&#x27;t fit much in them at all</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mother for her birthday, she once stored all her makeup in cosmetic bags but this item has since replaced them and she loves it! It stores all her makeup in an organized way and it looks chic on her dresser. This is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter she loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this as it has padding on the bottom of each drawer and fits all my makeup neatly!! The only reason I gave this a four star is that sometimes, the drawers doesn&#x27;t glide back in smoothly- causing it to get stuck often so I would have to take it out and put it back in which is rather annoying. Other than that, it holds everything really well, is sturdy and a wonderful organizer!</li>
    <li> This looks so nice on my bathroom counter! It also helps me find things much easier than thrown in the drawer!</li>
    <li> The item was smaller than what i imagined that it would be. However being that i have a fairly small collection of makeup  as a beginner it is just the right size for me. It doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on my night stand so it worked out well for me. However for more advanced makeup applicators such as make up artist this is to small. This would would for a beginner transitioning into a intermediate with not too much makeup to store but not too little either. You can fit alit more if you have mostly small pieces to store. If your storing palette&#x27;s it will take up most of the storage inside the larger draws. The smaller draws could fit a few small pieces of concealers and corrector&#x27;s storage looks better not too over crowded so that the light shines through the container beautifully :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Brooklyn) New York</li>
    <li> Super cute way to store and display my makeup.  I love that it&#x27;s clear so I can see where everything is.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> after a few weeks the top section started cracking on the right corner. now after 3 months the tray has many cracks. do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> This is just a little miracle box that made my life so much easier! I have a lot of stuff and it was messy and all over the place-now its all organized and neat. u can take the drawers out completely which is very comfortable. the seller is great- i received a slightly damaged piece, so they refund me a nice discount. thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Really like this organizer!  I purchased one for my daughter, when it arrived I immediately purchased one for myself.  It holds a lot of things and looks pretty on display.  Since it was acrylic, I thought it might look cheap but that is NOT the case.</li>
    <li> I bought this acrylic case to store my make-up products.  It sits nicely atop the backing on my loo.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 smaller drawers are thick enough for me to stack 2 of my Nars eyeshadow duos.&lt;br /&gt;For the make-up minimalist, I think this organizer would be sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;But for me.. a make-up lover, I crave slightly more drawers and more space..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted 1 star for the shallow lipstick cubbies on top.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had lipsticks/glosses and other items tilt and fall due to the wells not being deep enough.&lt;br /&gt;The wells really only support the standard lipstick tube.</li>
    <li> Organizes my stuff well, better than living out of a makeup bag, but being plastic it does look a bit cheap.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it if you have tons of makeup but for what I need it for is perfect!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with the product and supplier as I thought it will come with two pieces of organizer as shown in the picture, however it comes with only the upper part but not the case storage. If it is only one piece then the price I paid is excessively expensive.  Later on, I saw the same product combo of two organizer at less than USD18.00.</li>
    <li> I attached a photo to better see and understand the product. It came with just the top piece and one set of drawers. Ordered another set of drawers to sit them both on. Total was $60. Bought the exact thing at T.J Maxx a month later for 32 total. So check your local stores before buying. Other than the price my only complaint is the drawers are very shallow. A lot of products are too big to fit in them. So unless you have a very small makeup collection, and the packaging is all pretty tinyl, this isn&#x27;t going to work as your only organizer. However it is a good product and helped me organize my vanity quite a bit. It also looks lovely and goes with any decor. I definitely recommend investing in acrylic organizers.</li>
    <li> Nice for my collection</li>
    <li> I love both organizers that come with this. The entire unit feels very sturdy and nice. The drawers are not cheap or flimsy, and they hold a good amount of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The top organizer is great for miscellaneous items, such as mini lotions or creams.</li>
    <li> Love the makeup organizer!! It fits about all my makeup and some !</li>
