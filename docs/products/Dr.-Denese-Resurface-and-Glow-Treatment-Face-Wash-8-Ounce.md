    <li> wow! dr denese has the most superb product line. you can never go wrong with any of her products. wonderful exfoliant</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is gentle, yet thorough.  The scrubbing beads are very fine.  So it cleans well but does not cause big pores like some facial cleaners do.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser.  I use it every morning...  Does a great job...  This will be a standard in my morning cleansing.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Denese&#x27; products and especially this one.  I have very dry, sensitive, maturing skin.  Most products dry me out, make me itch or in some way irritate.  Alas!  This one does none of the above and it makes my skin smooth and soft.  I absolutely love it.  I use it once a day everyday in the mornings and twice (morning and night)on the weekends.  If you want a product that sloughs and smooths without any irritation at all, then this is the one for you.  I absolutely cannot live without it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve used this product for a week and so far it is leaving my skin soft as a baby&#x27;s after each wash. I can&#x27;t tell whether the exfoliation works well, yet, since it&#x27;s only been a week. But combined with my skin cream care, it&#x27;s leaving my 50+ year old face feeling and looking more youthful than ever.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Pool</li>
    <li> Really love this product.  It is a gentle exfoliant and cleanser but leaves the skin soft and moisturized.  I usually use this in the mornings.</li>
    <li> good and clean.....smells nice</li>
    <li> I have ben using this product for years and love the way it makes my face feel polished and soft after use.</li>
    <li> A very good face wash product</li>
    <li> The best cleanser from Dr. Denese. Her products are known to be chock full of the most expensive ingredients and this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;One pump is all it takes for exfoliation and stimulation of the skin. Unfortunately, it is getting so hard to find. Love this treatment wash!</li>
    <li> I agree it is an awesome product I will continue to use (it&#x27;s a true favorite) . . . I just wanted to add I use on my lips too and it keeps the dry flaky winter lips away.</li>
    <li> I switched to this because I have other Dr. Denese products and love them!  This is nice because it has a gentle exfoliant.  Love it, and love to find a good  price!</li>
    <li> REALLY GOOD PRODUCT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Denese products.  They do exactly what they claim to do.  Smooth skin, soft and fresh feeling.  I&#x27;m using these products to reduce my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this, the granules are very fine, too fine I thought. However I realized this is why it&#x27;s gentle and effective. Makes my skin glow. Use it a few times a week and always look forward to it. No irritation, only soft smooth glowing skin. Easy and great results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for about 6 months and I love it!  I have tried every cleanser on the market and this one is the best for my skin.  It gently exfoliates and takes off all makeup easily.  Leaves skin very smooth and radiant with no dryness.  I like the fact that it has a pump - very easy to use.  I&#x27;m sure all skin types will enjoy this product</li>
    <li> This is one of the two exfoliators that will not break out my picky/ sensitive acne prone skin.  I can rub firmly on my face with this and not end up with little bumps,  My pores on my upper cheeks are smaller after only a week of using.  Grit is fine enough to get rid of dead flakes of skin from acne treatments, but does not irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I like this wash.  It leaves your skin feeling cleansed and clean.  I use the hydrating cleanser by Dr. Denese and then use this every few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Denese products for years and especially like Resurface and Glow for its gentle, yet thorough cleansing.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Denise face care products. Worth the cost. Within just a few days of using this face wash, my skin is glowing. I have used other products that I&#x27;ve bought at CVS, but this is superior. I like the feel of the tiny tiny pieces that scrub and remove dead skin and make it possible to truly moisturize your skin. I pair with other Dr. D products.</li>
    <li> I read reviews so was surprised to see it was not a face wash at all. It is more like a makeup remover, then you have to wash off the remover. I immediately contacted to company to return it since it was not what was advertised. I was told sorry no returns. Very, very disappointed. My face felt so oily and dirty once putting this on my face. Yuck!</li>
    <li> Dr Denese products do what they say they will &amp; after I started the daily products someone asked if I got a face lift</li>
    <li> Hands down a wonderful face wash! Exfoliates wonderfully with the tiny sandlike consistency. Smells wonderful. Keeps oily skin under control and adds extra bonus of a glowy appearance.</li>
    <li> Great facial wash.  It has tiny particles that scrub your face and makes your face feel so clean &amp; smooth after use.  It doen&#x27;t lather at all, but it still does the job.</li>
    <li> I use this on a regular basis.  I keep it on hand for AM &amp; PM face cleansing.  I use all Dr. Denese skin care products &amp; really like the entire line.  Will continue to buy &amp; recommend...</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have used more products than I can count on my face and nothing has left it as smooth as this. I have extremely sensitive skin and had developed a small rash from my department store products that would not clear up until I used this. Even went out of town and did not take this with me, rash came back... Now I am home using my resurface scrub and area is clearing up. I also use the serum and the hydrating cream, I think it&#x27;s a good trio. I am a cheapskate and I feel like I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth... The bottle is a good size, and you don&#x27;t need much. I am totally sold on this and the other dr. Denese products.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and clean - it seems gentle enough for my skin. Anxious to see if this continues.  Thank you.</li>
