      <li>Living in a very dry climate it works so so much better on dry cuticles than anything else does.  </li>
      <li>Great for cold weather and sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need too much for daily use</li>
      <li>but no place seems to have it, also  googled it, but so far no luck.</li>

    <li> Great for cold weather and sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Great for cuticles--a bit thick as a hand cream.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream. It  instantly softens and makes your hands smoother, and it keeps them that way for hours. I also like the convenient travel size this 3 pack offers. You can have one in your purse, one for the car, work, suitcase etc . I recommend this hand cream.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the little purse sizes are so hard to find.  Was delighted when I saw these here, so in spite of the $4.99 shipping, I ordered.  The order arrived the next day!  But there was only one!  I e-mailed the vendor and they replied within 15 minutes.  They agreed the photo was probably misleading and I am thinking they are going to change it.  But they made it right and shipped me 2 more for no charge.  They too arrived the next day.  I tried to pay for the extra 2, but they would not take payment as they wanted a happy customer.  Well, I am very happy.  I would much rather they sold a bigger quantity, adjusting to a higher price for the items, then the $4.99 shipping doesn&#x27;t hurt so much.  Anyway, I am very happy and hoping they fix the photo.</li>
    <li> This cream was amazing...Cleared up my cracked hands.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and have been very satisfied.  The 0.5 oz. size is good for traveling.  For home use the 2 oz. size is more economical.</li>
    <li> The cream is nice.  However, I didn&#x27;t realize these are TINY TINY sample sizes. Really not worth the money. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Living in a very dry climate it works so so much better on dry cuticles than anything else does.  Having travel size is great.  I prefer to pack less and any space saved is good.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and it always had a clean fragrance. Have even used the fragrance free version of the product as well and been very happy. It was a no brainer to buy the travel size for convenience. But when the travel size arrived and I used it, I was very disappointed. Rather than the product I know and love to use, this item has a very unappealing perfumey fragrance. Very mysterious as to why it is not the same as Neutrogena&#x27;s product. Really confusing.</li>
    <li> This was a gift but my wife loves this stuff and we got this for my mom who loves the Norwegian formula.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use Neutrogena hand cream because it keeps our hand nice and hydrated in the cold days of winter..</li>
    <li> I use and used this for years.....they changed the black bar to black from blue, and added an AWFUL fragrance to it that smells like Paris and men&#x27;s cheap cologne.  It is awful!  Why did they do that?  Order just the fragrance-free</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this hand creme and these trave sized packages are great -- can&#x27;t find often in the stores.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot, so buying them in bulk really helps. Great product. Not sticky and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these are TINY sample sizes.  Really not worth the money though a nice hand cream.  I should have read better</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Perfect travel size.</li>
    <li> Received the creams promptly.  However it seems that someone at Amazon packed it with a bunch of other things and 2 of the 3 tubes were cracked.  Seller immediately refunded them, very professionally.  However in the future it would be best to order alone or with lighter things in the same order.&lt;br /&gt;Cream itself is fine.  Doesn&#x27;t flow out or leave your hands feeling sticky or slick.  Don&#x27;t need too much for daily use so don&#x27;t squeeze too much out.  Tubing hasn&#x27;t broken in my purse either, so it isn&#x27;t like the tubing itself is super fragile.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist because my hands were so chapped in the winter that they would actually bleed.&lt;br /&gt;I used all kinds of hand creams, never realizing that there was a better one and this is it!</li>
    <li> Best on the market for the price!</li>
    <li> The formula is excellent but the little tubes are just too small. I have been trying to find the regular size  but no place seems to have it, also  googled it, but so far no luck.</li>
