### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am very happy with the comb.  </li>
      <li>Looks great.</li>
      <li>Great service.</li>
      <li>A good choice.</li>
      <li>More impressive still, the ensumble stayed sculpturally intact and remarkably stylish for the rest of the day.  </li>
      <li>Got it for a friend and think she will be very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>It looks nice too.</li>
      <li>I find this home very easy to use.</li>
      <li>What I don&#x27;t love is the quality of the plastic.  </li>
      <li>I love this comb.  </li>
      <li>I just love these.. out of all the carvan french combs this one seems to give me the best grip and the best curls when I take my hair down..</li>
      <li>But this may be more secure.</li>
      <li>Well designed, strong and flexible.</li>
      <li>This stays put all day, is quick and easy, and looks cute both at work and on the weekends.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, about shoulder length.</li>
      <li>They keep my fine hair in place.  </li>
      <li>Voila - it&#x27;s a quick and easy beautiful French Twist.</li>
      <li>First I love the wavy teeth.  </li>
      <li>It is very pretty</li>
      <li>If you need a fast French Twist that still looks elegant, these French Twist combs are great.  </li>
      <li>This item does not seem very durable and the wavy teeth don&#x27;t really help with gripping hair.  </li>
      <li>In the first couple of days, it was a disaster.  </li>
      <li>Once upon a time I had a French twist comb with wavy teeth that held the twist really securely.</li>
      <li>It holds very securely, and it&#x27;s a nice size for holding up thick long hair.</li>
      <li>Its strong with long teeth.</li>
      <li>Gather your hair, like you&#x27;re doing a ponytail, twist it tight and up, slide the comb over and under the twist, tuck the top.  </li>
      <li>Works as promised, although personally I prefer the straight comb.</li>
      <li>I use this nearly every day.  </li>
      <li>Pretty, but not very sturdy.</li>
      <li>This comb does a fair job of holding my hair, it is quite uncomfortable next to your head.</li>
      <li>Having the hair wet while setting the tooth in certainly helped.</li>
      <li>I start with a french twist and when I get to the top, I push this comb straight down under (teeth pointing down the back of my head) and then use a hair elastic on the outside of the twist, hooked under the sides of the comb on each side.</li>

<li> My hair is thick, but the comb stays in.  </li>
<li> I felt I&#x27;d have turned my head into a needlepoint pillow before managing to tuck any hair behind the seven wavy tooth.  </li>

    <li> Works as promised, although personally I prefer the straight comb. But this may be more secure. Due to the twists in the comb, it just needs some extra jiggling as you insert. It holds very securely, and it&#x27;s a nice size for holding up thick long hair. It&#x27;s made in France.</li>
    <li> Once upon a time I had a French twist comb with wavy teeth that held the twist really securely. Since it broke I&#x27;ve tried a few combs with straight teeth but none of them held my hair. When I saw this comb I had high hopes that its wavy teeth would work, but I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair at all. My hair is medium long, about 3 inches below shoulder line.</li>
    <li> Got it for a friend and think she will be very pleased with it. Great service.</li>
    <li> I waited a while to post this review as I was concerned about the teeth breaking (as they so often do with this type of hair comb).  I use this nearly every day.  I start with a french twist and when I get to the top, I push this comb straight down under (teeth pointing down the back of my head) and then use a hair elastic on the outside of the twist, hooked under the sides of the comb on each side. This stays put all day, is quick and easy, and looks cute both at work and on the weekends.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the comb.  My hair is thick, but the comb stays in.  The comb is glossy so it shows well in your hair.</li>
    <li> This item does not seem very durable and the wavy teeth don&#x27;t really help with gripping hair.  I also don&#x27;t like the color. It looks cheap and ugly compared to products from France Luxe or even Scunci or Goody.</li>
    <li> I just love these.. out of all the carvan french combs this one seems to give me the best grip and the best curls when I take my hair down..</li>
    <li> First I love the wavy teeth.  They keep my fine hair in place.  What I don&#x27;t love is the quality of the plastic.  Unlike the straight tooth french twist combs I have which are a slightly flexible plastic, this plastic is the hard, brittle type.  I predict the teeth will break sooner rather than later because of the way you but this comb in place with a slight flip/twist motion.</li>
    <li> This comb does a fair job of holding my hair, it is quite uncomfortable next to your head. Could not wear long before headache.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair as well as I thought it would but kept it to continue to try to use it.</li>
    <li> This comb was orange when it arrived, not traditional tortoise shell coloring.</li>
    <li> A good choice.Its strong with long teeth.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, about shoulder length. Its wavy / curly, so a little on the dry side. Not super voluminous. I find this home very easy to use. It hold my hair well, doesn&#x27;t scratch my scalp war cause breakage.</li>
    <li> If you need a fast French Twist that still looks elegant, these French Twist combs are great.  Gather your hair, like you&#x27;re doing a ponytail, twist it tight and up, slide the comb over and under the twist, tuck the top.  Voila - it&#x27;s a quick and easy beautiful French Twist.</li>
    <li> Well designed, strong and flexible. Hold well. Looks great.</li>
    <li> I love this comb.  It is very pretty</li>
    <li> I like this because it&#x27;s the only comb that will keep my hair up in a French twist without falling out.  It looks nice too.</li>
    <li> Pretty, but not very sturdy.</li>
    <li> In the first couple of days, it was a disaster.  I felt I&#x27;d have turned my head into a needlepoint pillow before managing to tuck any hair behind the seven wavy tooth.  One morning, it miraculously worked!  Having the hair wet while setting the tooth in certainly helped. More impressive still, the ensumble stayed sculpturally intact and remarkably stylish for the rest of the day.  I pay all the credit to having just read Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s Outliers where he claimed that 10,000 hours of practice turns one into a master in any field.</li>
