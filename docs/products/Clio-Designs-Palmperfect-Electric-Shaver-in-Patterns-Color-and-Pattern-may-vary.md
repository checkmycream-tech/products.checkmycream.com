<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like these razors, when they work.  Which seems like less then 50% of the time.  I&#x27;ve gone through 3 so far.  I love how small they are and how easy they are to use.  What I hate is that half the time they don&#x27;t come on.  My first one lasted about 9 months, then stopped turning on.  They are super cheap so I ordered 2 more thinking I&#x27;d be prepared for when one stopped working.  The 2nd one worked once- I used it one time in the shower, then took it out so it wouldn&#x27;t always be getting wet.  They NEVER turn on right away.  It&#x27;s like you have to hit the button several times or even bang it on something.  I just opened the 2nd one to get that batteries out to charge and it&#x27;s all rusted and my re-chargeable batteries that were in it are ruined too.  So I opened the package of my 3rd one.  It won&#x27;t even turn on.  I&#x27;m getting pretty sick of messing with these pieces of junk.  Why do they have to work so nice when they actually do work?  They are so cheap that for a while I figured I don&#x27;t mind replacing them.  But now it&#x27;s just getting annoying.  I think I&#x27;m going to look for something more expensive and rechargeable.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and am very pleased with it</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for here.  I have very thick coarse hair on my legs so it&#x27;s difficult to find a razor that gets rid of my hair without irritating my skin.  This razor did absolutely nothing for me! Bigggg disappointment</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite the noob when it comes to electric shavers (this is my first one, in fact), but I have to say that it does a decent job. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a regular manual razor would, but it&#x27;s decent enough to run it across my legs and put on a pair of shorts or a bathing suit, and not be self-conscious about looking like Bigfoot. lol I do not recommend it for the bikini area though, as so many others have raved it was good for. All I can say is OUCH! Overall, great product.</li>
    <li> Its better than a lot of other razors but you will still be able to feel stubble. Very good for this price.</li>
    <li> I looked at features and reviews for women&#x27;s cordless electric shavers for a good while before purchasing this product.  I chose this one partly on price, but mostly because the one thing all the rest had in common is that the batteries give out after a time, and you have to have a soldering gun and a fairly steady hand if you want to try to replace the batteries yourself.  My conclusion was, if I was going to have to replace the unit within a year or two anyway, might as well get the best value I could.  The Clio uses batteries you buy and install yourself - and I have a battery recharger, so this seemed to be the best value for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day my shaver arrived, I put it to use.  I don&#x27;t like to shave in the shower because we&#x27;re trying to be as conservative with water use as we can.  So my leg hair was fairly long when I used the shaver.  I experienced no nicks, pulls or discomfort as I shaved perfectly dry and didn&#x27;t push down hard.  The shaver did a decent job of eliminating visible hair, though I won&#x27;t go so far as to say it was a \\&quot;close shave.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the shaver so far.  It comes with a cord that attaches to the battery compartment lock, and I use it to hang the shaver up in my bathroom - handy but out of the way.  I can use it in the morning, apply lotion, and be able to wear my capris to work with confidence. If that&#x27;s the only benefit I get from it - I feel I&#x27;ve gotten my money&#x27;s worth if it lasts a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review after a few months when I have an idea of the product&#x27;s longevity and effectiveness of its other features.</li>
    <li> It works. But really hard to clean. And the blade breaks easily when you remove it to clean. Definitely there&#x27;s room for improvement here. And why oh why can&#x27;t I easily find blade replacements?</li>
    <li> These are great for on the road and you are a truck driver. If it is awhile in between showers and you need to shave, these come in handy and you can shave in the truck while waiting. It is great on the bikini lines, and it hasn&#x27;t even cut me like regular razors. The hair doesn&#x27;t have to be short, but it helps if it is, then just fine comb it (if you want) with a regular razor. I have had it for about 6 months and it still works great. I bought it through Walgreens, but I don&#x27;t like how you have to buy their replacement blades through their site instead of going to the store and getting them.</li>
    <li> Great.i recommend buying a few.</li>
    <li> I love these shavers. just wish more blades would come with them.</li>
    <li> One of my \\&quot;favorite things\\&quot;!  Doesn&#x27;t give me a &#x27;perfect&#x27; shave (perfectly smooth to the touch), but it gives me a \\&quot;nice enough\\&quot; shave!  I&#x27;m living in an RV in Arizona for the winter and don&#x27;t like to shave my legs in the shower stall of the RV...this is perfect!  I shave my legs, THEN get in the shower!  Piece of cake!  My legs LOOK great and it&#x27;s not a hassle!  Just a smidge of stubble, but hey, only me and the hubby are actually \\&quot;touching\\&quot; my legs anyway and he hasn&#x27;t noticed the difference!  Gave one of these to two of my (11 &amp; 12 year old) grand daughters. They and their moms are happy with them, as the girls are a bit young (and afraid) to use &#x27;straight edge&#x27; or multi-blade razors, but sooo wanted to shave their &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; legs!</li>
    <li> I bought one for my 14 year old daughter. She just likes it alot.  You do not have to get in the shower to use it which saves time in the morning.  She can still take a shower in the evening, if necessary.  I bought a pink one for her at a store near where I live but the colors of these are cool.  It was great when we went to the beach as she only had to take a shower once a day instead of twice.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughter saw me looking over cordless razors to use in the shower,I must say the only thing going for this razor is it&#x27;s clever design other wise thought my old shaver did a much better job!</li>
    <li> This electric razor does a nice job. While not as close a shave as with a bladed razor, it&#x27;s adequate for when you&#x27;re in a hurry, and those in-between touchups. I like the fit in my hand, and it&#x27;s amazingly powerful for something that works on two AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish Amazon offered a choice of patterns and also the replacement blades. Seems as if right now, the only place to get the blades is from the manufacturer&#x27;s web site.</li>
    <li> This shaver really works well...even on dry skin. Best to use it with light pressure as the instructions suggest.  Easy peasy.  Great that it uses batteries.</li>
    <li> This product is great but I didnt get to pick my color or pattern. Kinda bummed about that because my design looks like apintball splatters. Would have preferred something plain but other then that the product is great.</li>
    <li> I was suspicious from the minute I left the store with this razor in my shopping bag--I kept thinking that this razor was too cheap to be any good.  And guess what?  It is.  I would have benefited from reading all the reviews first that say people bought this for their eleven year old daughters.  Not good for much more than peach fuzz.  I am returning mine right now!</li>
    <li> For the money, it works great!  As well as some full size electric shavers I&#x27;ve had!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nifty little thing.  I don&#x27;t think that it was designed to replace my razor, and that&#x27;s just fine.  I use it when I don&#x27;t have time to shave or if I had forgotten.  I&#x27;ve kinda noticed that it more trims hair than shaves it.. but I&#x27;m not picky and it does exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> My wife is using it and its great. No more complaints on the Paining part</li>
    <li> i like this as a travel option but the batteries die after two uses. i suggest packing batteries.</li>
    <li> Will be buying more for gifts&lt;br /&gt;Great colors and it does a great job. Great first razor for young girls.</li>
    <li> A nice sized little personal razor</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this shaver, but it shaves closer than the full size electric shavers I have owned. Great size to tuck into a travel bag. The batteries do run out quickly though. I wish it was rechargeable.</li>
    <li> Pros: Cheap, small, cute/colorful designs, shaves very nicely without cuts and nicks, waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Eats those AAA batteries pronto!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 11 yr old. I thought she would like one of the cool patterns. They sent me a plain pink one and I am not too excited about it. She hasn&#x27;t tried it yet because it is a Christmas gift, so I will update this review on performance later. But as far as getting what I ordered - I am not satisfied! And I certainly won&#x27;t be returning it and have any hope of having a new one by Christmas...</li>
    <li> These are cute shavers that seem to be very well-made and do a decent job. They seem to be much better made than a similar type of shaver that is pink and white and costs more. I&#x27;m not sure how long the batteries will last, but this shaver works fine and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do -- SHAVE! (It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find shavers that use batteries, so I ordered two more.)</li>
    <li> ah finally a shaver that works i&#x27;ve been trying to find a good one for months my last one crapped out after 4 yrs and they dont sell it anymore. of course i bought 2 new ones from norelco one for men and one for women both werent good at all! i didnt think this shaver would work out good at all it shavers close,doesnt pull,and doesnt leave razor burn! great price and you can find razor refills which i love!</li>
    <li> This is really a great product.  My 11 year old needed something besides a standard womans razor to shave under her arms and this has been great for a first time razor for her.  Thank you for making this and she loves using it and very confident in the use of the product.  I would buy it again.  Great price also.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product it doesn&#x27;t even shave it all off and by the next day the hairs come out and thick</li>
    <li> I bought this item for moments when I am in a rush and can&#x27;t shave in the shower and it works pretty good.  Its small and portable and even cute looking.  Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a trimmer than a razor</li>
    <li> Good little travel razor, but doesn&#x27;t shave very closely compared to the Panasonic that I have at home.</li>
    <li> This does exactly as stated.  I can pop in a pair of rechargeable batteries, and shave my legs, pits, and bikini area with no problems.  The trimmers do not get in the way of tight areas, and the single foil really works well for curvy bodies.  I am very happy I decided to try this razor, and I plan to continue to use it unlike the other electric shaver I ordered.  This product delivers!  Please note that you will not get as close of a shave as with a razor, but this gets as close as possible for an electric shaver.  I have very sensitive skin, and this does not irritate my skin at all, and I like to use it dry the most.  Know that if using wet you have to use some kind of shaving cream otherwise electric shavers tug at the skin and make it difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on ordering the rechargeable version I like this so much!</li>
    <li> It is not the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but it&#x27;s not bad for something so small light, and well, frankly -- cheap!  I love cheap!  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love these for my teenage daughter.  I do not worry about her cutting up her legs!</li>
    <li> This little thing is perfect! I have never had an electric razor before and I am absolute awe of how great this does. The batteries last a few times, but I&#x27;ve seen other people who said it only lasted twice, so I don&#x27;t know. I shaved my legs and underarms 4 times before needing new batteries. I&#x27;m sad that Amazon doesn&#x27;t have replacement blades on here, but I&#x27;ll live (just order from their site). Awesome and absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> The first one I had bought a long time ago still works, I gave it away because it was noisy. The 2nd one I had bought was not as noisy (but still), and started losing contact with batteries in a year and a half probably, so I bought a 3rd one. Now this 3rd came with a slight modification in battery size as I cannot use my old regular rechargeable AAAs, but I need branded AAAs, because apparently they are, like, half a millimeter longer. Not satisfied with this at all as now not all batteries fit and it doesn&#x27;t switch on.  But the worst part is that the blades are COMPLETELY dull on this one and are ripping my hair out! It doesn&#x27;t shave, it tortures and annoys, and makes you question why the hell you trusted and bought it.  I want a replacement.   Yes, it works. The design is really nice. Although ergonomically it could have a different shape. The slider instead of a button would be more comfortable to turn it on and off. Well you know, for the price it is definitely worth it and it uses only two AAA batteries, I bought the rechargeable ones. And yes, it is noisy.</li>
    <li> For the price this little razor well exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> I paid under six dollars for this electric shaver and I would say it is worth every penny. The Clio gives a nice smooth shave and is very easy to use and clean. There is a rope type cord attached so you can hang it almost anywhere. I also like the way it looks. It is light and is easy to handle too. I would buy this again and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for women!  The only problem is getting a refill blade for it.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before but I had been thinking about trying one for a few months now. When I came across one of these at the store, I decided to go ahead and buy it because of the low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am neither super-impressed nor totally unimpressed with this shaver. It is a nice size and shape that makes it easy to hold. It isn&#x27;t super loud, which I was worried about because I&#x27;ve read that some shavers are loud. The shaver did an okay job of shaving my legs. It didn&#x27;t pull my hair or cut my skin, but it also didn&#x27;t give me a very close shave. It left my legs feeling the way they normally feel about two days after I shave with a regular razor (a bit stubbly). You couldn&#x27;t see any hair from a distance, but could easily feel it. The shaver also gave me a little bit of razor burn despite saying that you could shave dry. It also took a lot longer than shaving with a regular razor because I had to go over most areas a few times to get missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this razor is okay and it&#x27;s probably worth it for the price. In my opinion, it is better suited for those times when you forget to shave your legs before realizing that you have something important to do than to use as an everyday shaver. It&#x27;s not bad and it&#x27;s not great. I&#x27;ll probably go back to regular razors and use this for those days when I&#x27;m just too lazy to shave my legs in the shower.</li>
    <li> These are so not worth it! The blades dull very quickly and they go through batteries even faster and as the batteries die, the blades slow down so hair can get caught in the dulling blades. Very painful. Keep looking.</li>
    <li> I got mine today in the mail(the green, paisley one), and hoped that the good reviews here on Amazon would benefit me also. They did!       I had about 4-5 days since razor shaving in growth, and tried a small leg area. Batteries were easy to load,(takes AAA style) and fits the hand well for use on the legs(not too bulky).It&#x27;s got what feels like a rubberized coating, which keeps it from slipping in your grip as well.       It&#x27;s tough to get a super clean shave like using a using a disposable razor in the shower, but this is a very reasonable 2nd choice. Especially if you don&#x27;t want to spend the extra time in the tub, and need to grab it and take off, shaving on the run.(Haven&#x27;t tried the bikini trimmer feature, but look forward to it.)       I agree with what a previous user said, that the price does not reflect the performance. I am pleasantly surprised, as it does just what I need it to. :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE this little shaver! I have spent so much on electric shavers before, but they always lose their ability to recharge after a while. These are battery operated, and are so small and lightweight. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a really close smooth shave so you can wear a bikini, you&#x27;re likely to be disappointed with this shaver. If your looking for a shaver that will do a quick and pretty good job that will allow you to \\&quot;shave and go\\&quot; so you can just look decent with shorts or a dress without too much fuss, you&#x27;ll like this. The manufacturer says you can get it wet but I wouldn&#x27;t take it in the shower because as much as it seems sturdy enough it is just a ten dollar shaver and I don&#x27;t think it will hold up as long.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because its portable, easy to clean and small. It&#x27;s just right for my toiletry bag on trips.</li>
    <li> This is a good little razor. It&#x27;s perfect for when you forgot to shave any are short on time. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for daily shaves or anything. It also fits in my purse nicely.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for myself from a drugstore sometime ago, just for the bikini line, and am very pleased with it.  It takes care of what I need and has a long battery life.  My daughters wanted their own and state it gives a nice leg-shave, but doesn&#x27;t get as close as they would like.  However, my husband has taken mine and uses it for his face.  He likes the close shave it provides.  The two units purchased through Amazon had a nice design but you did not know what you were getting before they came -- there is no way to choose your design.</li>
    <li> bought this for my 15 year old daughter to use ....when I was showing her how to use it it just stopped working... not worth the money</li>
    <li> Heck of a shaver. Other one lasted years and still going. Just wanted a spare.</li>
    <li> Ok for a quick shave!&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive, and works as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel!</li>
    <li> This thing was awesome for one month before it just stopped working completely.  I guess with the price so low you get what you pay for...still cheaper than three or four waxes??!&lt;br /&gt;:o(</li>
    <li> easy to use and easy to insert batteries.&lt;br /&gt;coverdoes not fit and continuously falls off, not protecting blades.&lt;br /&gt;package was very hard to open.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and one for my daughter. We love them!great shaver</li>
    <li> This device sucks.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have shaved after using it.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the best electric razor you&#x27;ll ever buy -- but at this price, that should come as no surprise. As someone who primarily uses a blade razor, I do like to keep an electric around for occasional use. This is perfect for that. It works well and reliably -- for a while. My last one lasted about a year, and for a $5ish product, that&#x27;s just fine. I get a close shave on my legs with no nicks.</li>
    <li> To be clear, this should not be anyone&#x27;s primary shaver.  It is, however, exactly what I needed for travel.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to haul along my Panasonic[[ASIN:B0018A32XS Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, Mauve]] or borrow my husband&#x27;s shaver, (or worse, resort to blades - I&#x27;m prone to terrible razor burn).  The shave is a little slow but it&#x27;s reasonably close and it&#x27;s comfortable to hold.  I received the pink and orange argyle.  Cute!  I can&#x27;t yet speak as to battery life.  It&#x27;s easy enough, though, to bring a spare pair.</li>
    <li> i have been using this brand of razor for more than ten years and finally had to buy a new one.  great for underarms  not too wide and the shape is easy to hold  batteries last a good long time</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 10 years, ordered my first online and the power button works only intermittently. Design has not changed much.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 9 year old since she refused to wear shorts because of the hair on her legs.  I tried Neet, and she said it burned, but I was not ready for her to have a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; razor.&lt;br /&gt;This does not give a razor close shave, but it is perfect for her.  She loves it, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about her cutting herself.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how long the batteries will last but she has only used it twice since it arrived several weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is a great item, and perfect as a first razor for girls.</li>
    <li> i love these shavers. they are super handy, cheap, and actually do a better job on my bikini line than expensive razors. plus they are worth replacing when it starts to rust. easy to care for, lasts months, and super compact. this is the first time buying them from amazon, my pharmacy no longer carries them. it&#x27;s at least $6 cheaper on this site as an add-on item, which is super helpful</li>
    <li> It works for a quick dryshave of your underarms and it will shave legs too. Good deal, got mine for under 5 bucks.</li>
    <li> This is the most cute &amp; compact little shaver! no mess &amp; It gets the job done!</li>
    <li> well since i only paid $10 for it i didnt expect much, it gets the job done but it jus sucks the life out of your batteries. something weird happened and my batteries got wet and it works when it wants to. but its ok if u want something to travel with</li>
    <li> I have never spent the money for electric razors  but always wanted one.  I&#x27;m thrilled!  As I&#x27;m getting on up in my senior years I don&#x27;t have as much to shave anymore.  What I do have is still course and this fits the bill!  Easy to hold and use, attractive and small.</li>
    <li> I liked it for the convenience and because in comparison to using a regular razor in my tiny shower it was less...um gymnastic...I can use it without water on the floor.  However, it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.  At that point I just switched to a regular razor and returned to my weekly yoga workout in my little shower- and may I add that my plow pose is coming along beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is a nice device, kinda noisy but not to the point of being unbearable. This has a nice close shave but not so well on my underarms or maybe it&#x27;s just me Lolz.</li>
    <li> I am glad i bought this its so cute and handy too!! i got a color i like purple thanx!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic and durable! I already bought one of them in an old discount store in MA (near Cape Cod). I kept it for 3 or 4 years and when I broke it I was sad  :S  I finally found it here on Amazon.com and I ordered 2 of them! Nice quality-price ! I will write another comment after 1 month of use if there is a problem...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for on the go. not for a new clean shave. it&#x27;s a lil stubbly, but your hairs aren&#x27;t noticeable to the point where it&#x27;s like OMG that person didn&#x27;t shave. batteries die pretty fast. probs lasts around 5-6 uses before the shaver doesn&#x27;t have enough strength to do it&#x27;s good so well. and the shaver blade can be replaced so that&#x27;s a plus! (:</li>
    <li> Great for travel.  It is a bit loud, and I wouldn&#x27;t actually use it in a gym (What is she doing in there!?) but for home or hotel use, it does a great job!</li>
    <li> I am rating this five stars because I have thick black hairs on my legs and pits. Sometimes I don&#x27;t have time to shower AND shave before going out(5 people family sharing one bathroom). Shaving is pretty time consuming in the shower so that&#x27;s where this little beauty comes in hand. You could easily dry shave with it every night before bed so if you need to shower fast in the am your legs and pits are already prepared. I have not tried it on my pubic area so I can&#x27;t rate it on that however I suppose it could be used there too. Now if you are expecting as close a shave as a razor you will be sadly disappointed. Electric razors just don&#x27;t give the same kind of shave as a razor does but it removes visible stubble &amp; could be great for a diabetic,tween just beginning to shave or a busy person on the go! This little razor works awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my grand daughter. She reported that the shaver is comfortable to use and does a good job without knicks.</li>
    <li> This is ok for travel.</li>
    <li> Such a shame that this thing does absolutely nothing, as it is quite cute.  It died less than five minutes after turning it on.  Then I tried a few more pairs of batteries, in the off chance that the new batteries I put in were defective.  No, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the batteries.  I read somewhere else in a review here that you have to beat this shaver in order to get it to turn on, so I tried that a few times and now it does turn on for about a minute before shutting back off.  I was hoping I&#x27;d be one of the lucky few to get a decent machine, but alas, I&#x27;m going to have to figure out how to return something with shredded packaging (I had a hard time getting it out of the plastic bubble you see in the picture ).  Be warned, you will most likely get a lemon if you order this shaver.  And if it actually works, know that the little cap that is provided to protect the foil does not stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: In the hopes of not having to junk this thing, I picked up a pair of fancy schmancy lithium batteries in the off chance that all the alkaline batteries I tried were somehow magically dead.  Lithium batteries are meant for high drain devices, they last for 20+ years, and they cost more than this shaver.  THE SHAVER ATE THEM.  Apparently the shaver I got is some sort of battery succubus.  So don&#x27;t be like me and waste money on expensive batteries hoping this thing will work.  If it doesn&#x27;t work with new alkaline batteries, it won&#x27;t work period.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter who is handicapped. She couldn&#x27;t use regular razors. She has tremors.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GREAT OFFER</li>
    <li> Good little and convieneant razors.  Does eat through the batteries rather quickly, but I still love these!</li>
    <li> Works but does not do a smooth job</li>
    <li> great for the first time shaver.. i taught my daughter to shave her legs for the first time with this razor.</li>
    <li> bought for my mom to use so shr doesnt cut herself shaving legs, etc The only reason i didnt give 5 star is they need to mention batteries NOT included WHEN you buy it</li>
    <li> Not the closest shave you&#x27;ll ever experience, but not a bad electric razor.  I got one for my young teen daughter to learn to shave her legs. Really good for the money.  Got another for myself.</li>
    <li> I did not get the Clio brand electric shaver.  I received aTarget brand shaver comparable to the Clio.  If I had wanted the Target shaver I would have not bought it on online, I would have gone to Target and saved myself the shipping charges.</li>
    <li> Worked fine the first use, but it never turned on again afterwards. Thought it might be the batteries, but even after switching it still never turned back on.</li>
    <li> Works with Alkaline batteries. Does not work with rechargeable batteries (I guess they don&#x27;t put out enough voltage).&lt;br /&gt;This is a good first shaver for my teen who is too afraid of using razors. I originally bought her a rechargeable Panasonic wet/driver shaver, but it stopped working. The style of this shaver is appealing, the size is small and portable. Since it doesn&#x27;t get used that often, I expect the batteries to last a good time before needing replacement.  The plastic safety cover over the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on, however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved my legs with a disposable in the shower. But in the interests of saving water, I bought one of these razors. It works okay fully charged, but as the battery is less-than-full, it doesn&#x27;t do such a great job. It requires just the right angle and multiple passes, and it&#x27;s not that smooth afterwards either. I&#x27;m in the market for a replacement shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to &amp;#34;freshen up&amp;#34; any time.</li>
    <li> This was a COMPLETE waste of money. I went through a whole pack of batteries to try to even get this thing to turn on. I do NOT recommend ANYONE to buy this.</li>
    <li> Did not even work. I put bateries in and everything. Good thing it was cheap</li>
    <li> Works well. These were also at Target for nearly twice the price.</li>
    <li> A great alternative to a razor that works well when you need a quick shave. This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned in years, and I&#x27;m impressed with its performance.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  This razor works as well as the Conair rechargeable razor I own.  I find the batteries better for travel than packing the charger and everything.  The blades are not replaceable but for the price I just repurchase.  I also purchased one for my elderly mother.  She loves it and I don&#x27;t have to worry about safety with her using it.</li>
    <li> Very nice little electric shavers.  Work with batteries (not rechargeable).  Shaves well.  In my opinion, perfect for travel</li>
    <li> This little shaver works great for short term hair removal, doesn&#x27;t get as close as a wet razor but i understood that when i bought them, bought 2 of them to have in convenient places in the house (no excuses :) it get s the job done and i like the colors, the grip and ease of handling.</li>
    <li> I like it because it&#x27;s not a disposable but it tends to bite like it&#x27;s dull blade not that great</li>
    <li> got for my sis in law</li>
    <li> I needed an electric razor for quick shaves and delicate areas. This razor did not work for me. All it did was pull on my hair and it was painful. And it&#x27;s not like its just done this once or twice. That I could ignore. It pulls EVERYTIME I use it and it is sometimes excruciating. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Total waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I bought this figuring this would be better than the manual razors and it was nothing but crap. This thing died out very fast and it didn&#x27;t shave very well either. I ended up buying another razor.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric trimmer, and I&#x27;m loving it - I&#x27;m prone to terrible ingrown hairs on my bikini line if I shave or wax that area and I resemble a yeti if I don&#x27;t, so my usual solution has been to not shave and not go swimming. What&#x27;s the fun in that? No fun at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also discovered that this makes an EXCELLENT sweater shaver - I&#x27;ve used it on both fine gauge merino and two-ply light cashmere with no nicks or pulled threads. Works so much better than any &#x27;real&#x27; sweater shaver I&#x27;ve tried but you do have to be patient and get the angle just right.</li>
    <li> I have this shaver, and it&#x27;s terrible.  I contacted Clio Designs, and have tried to get a refund and they have long since refused to acknowledge my request.  I will never, ever, ever purchase anything from this company again.  They do NOT back up their product, they do NOT try to work with the customer.  Terrible customer service, terrible follow up.  Do not waste your money on their products, they are inferior.  The price is cheap and so is the product.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I buy these for my tween girls, so they can shave their legs and armpits.  They cut close enough that the girls are satisfied, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about actual blades.</li>
    <li> Never worked right, only runs if I take the blade out, which kind of defeats the purpose. I had one of these that lasted for years, but this was really cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Very simply, it doesn&#x27;t work.  Put in the batteries and tried it dry and wet.  After going over the same area three times (wet and dry), I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had tried to shave.  Don&#x27;t waste your money,</li>
    <li> I had owned two of these before and got them from a rite aid store. I really liked those ones. They only lasted a couple years but I bought them for $10 each. The one I ordered from Amazon works ok for what it is but it can sometimes pull the hair and of course you can&#x27;t get the close shave that you do with a razor but is ok for a quick go over. Just don&#x27;t let your hair get too long in between shaves.</li>
    <li> This broke down after using it for a month or so. I wasn&#x27;t going to try to return it even though it was prime because I just felt like...maybe it was my fault? I don&#x27;t know. It stayed in my bathroom but I did not take it into the shower. It just stopped turning on one day.</li>
    <li> Not up to the task. Pity, it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
    <li> Works ok.  Not as short as I would like but it works.  Also the battery department it took forever to get the thing to work</li>
    <li> Works great wet or dry!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Good product for the $$$$</li>
    <li> the idea is great, functionality leaves something to be desired. i have to hit it to get it to run and it doesnt get all the hair</li>
    <li> This shaver does a nice job.....it&#x27;s a great price and it is so darn cute.  I&#x27;m ordering another for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Great for a quick shave. The blades cut real close too. I am very happy to find this product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Very dull.  Barely cuts fine underarm hair and misses most. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Perfect for tweens, teens and every woman who wants to quickly remove hair. I use it more than my more expensive products.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all and is a waste of money. This product removes barely any hair at all.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quick to use, and works pretty well.  You don&#x27;t need many different blades, and it lasts long.  Great for on the go.</li>
    <li> for the price-- totally served its purpose!</li>
    <li> I have copied over my review of the [[ASIN:B000V4QZG8 Clio Palmperfect Cordless Shaver for Women]] that I originally posted on 11/24/08.  It is no longer sold here on Amazon, but this new one is. I own both models and I cannot tell the difference between the two shavers. Because they also use the same refill blades, the only real difference seems to be the colorful new designs offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Original review w/ updates*&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to order this razor based on the cost alone. I love a bargain, but quite often you get what you pay for. In this case though I feel I got much more than that and couldn&#x27;t be happier about finding this deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to ordering this I had used the [[ASIN:B00006WNQZ Remington WDF-1100 Smooth &amp; Silky Women Body Contour Shaver]] It performed just fine, but I had always considered it a bit bulky. Recently though it went *kaput* so I was in search for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to the Clio. Although I had not heard of this brand before, the reviews her were mostly positive and for the price is was worth the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I like?&lt;br /&gt;~ Can be used both wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;~ Provides a close shave in all areas and I haven&#x27;t received one nick, which I had problems with using my other razor&lt;br /&gt;~ Small palm size, makes it easy to hold especially when wet&lt;br /&gt;~ Takes just 2 AAA batteries and they seem to last quite awhile&lt;br /&gt;~ Small enough that it&#x27;ll be easy to take for travel or to the gym&lt;br /&gt;~ Removable wrist strap or shower hanger keeps it handy&lt;br /&gt;~ Replacement blades that don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  [[ASIN:B000XPV5SI Clio Designs Refill Blades for all Clio 3800 Series Shavers (2 Packs of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What don&#x27;t I like?&lt;br /&gt;~ I still believe most electric razors are too noisy, this one is no exception&lt;br /&gt;~ Would love to pick my own design, but not a big deal&lt;br /&gt;~ And finally...that I didn&#x27;t find this razor a year ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend this [[ASIN:B002HWS4R0 Clio Designs Palmperfect Electric Shaver]] to any woman out there looking to change razors or add one in to her routine. It&#x27;s a great bargain, easy to use and also very cute!r routine. It&#x27;s a great bargain, easy to use and also very cute!</li>
    <li> Easy to use little razor that shaves competently; not as close as a blade, but it also doesn&#x27;t nick and cut. I like electric razors. I had one that lasted twenty years but after that one died, the replacements available were of much lesser quality. I tried this little razor out of desperation and to me it is superior to much more expensive electric razors. You pop in two AAA batteries and you are good to go. Perfect for home, travel, the gym. I keep a couple spares because they are so inexpensive, but one will usually last two years or more until the motor just wears out. One of my favorite products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews but OMG! I can honestly say this is the last brand shaver I will ever buy again. It gets EVERYTHING with NO cuts! I thought about waxing but the thought of the pain made me get this. It&#x27;s 6am and I&#x27;m txtn my sisters to go order them one lol</li>
    <li> Bought one lasted 2 months now bought second one company was nice when I called and told abt 1 st one said send in receipt and they will refund money...nice company to deal with&lt;br /&gt;Shaver works wonderful</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews and I have never given one star, but this thing deserves it. I always give the benefit of the doubt, but damn is this thing disappointing. I didn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d have problems with it turning on but lo and behold, I put new batteries in and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Fifteen minutes later, after hitting it a bunch like other reviewers said, it turned on, and seemed to be decently powerful. But as soon as I touched it to my skin, it dulled down to barely a rumble. I maybe got three hairs off total. I give up, I&#x27;m going to try a Remington or Panasonic before giving up on electric shavers.</li>
    <li> It was a pretty good razor but it broke not too long after I purchased it. First the button seemed to not be that responsive, so I changed the batteries... now it just won&#x27;t work at all, even with fresh batteries. I would buy another one but I&#x27;m afraid of the same thing happening!</li>
    <li> I got this to save myself the trouble of having to wet shave. After about 5 or so minutes of trying the shaver in every direction, the hair was still there. That&#x27;s as far as I got - the battery died. Fresh batteries and it drained them. Yep. I hope they didn&#x27;t invest a crap ton in these because it&#x27;s a terrible waste. I returned mine for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my tween-ager; she immediately complained that it hurt. I tried it myself, and yes, the outer four corners are pretty sharp. It&#x27;s brand new, and there is no obvious damage, so I assume this is just how it&#x27;s made. Whether you use it dry or with soap , it still hurts. We have not been able to use it. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great and great price!</li>
    <li> shaves closer than you would think</li>
    <li> this is by far the smartest little razor ever... works as well as any electric/ razor I have ever bought.  I leave this in my purse for emergencys(ha ha) I give this a ten, it lasts forever on on round of batteries</li>
    <li> Works well, haven&#x27;t cut myself at all.</li>
    <li> Really surprised by the reviews.  I tried this after not shaving for several days (my legs grow hair quickly), and it made no difference.  Not a hair on my legs was shorter.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was defective or just an awful product, but I sent it back.</li>
    <li> It works well, I mainly use it for underarms and stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work well on legs though, it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough and leaves you with that &amp;#34; I haven&#x27;t shaved in 2 days &amp;#34; feel afterward.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter...tween age. Perfect size and cute color/design. Not so great for an adult who wants the close shave but close shave for tween newbies. My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat what you get for the price and the shipping was super fast.</li>
    <li> Works great! Wouldn&#x27;t expect anything better. Better than a Panasonic wet/dry razor.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap electric shaver!!! I think it&#x27;s pretty worth the money for when you&#x27;re in a hurry or for those that don&#x27;t need to shave too often. I think it works best dry, but that&#x27;s just my preference. It doesn&#x27;t give you too close of a shave, so I tend to get a bit prickly a few hours later. However, I think it is extremely fast and very easy to use for travel and etc. A few things I do not like about this product is that it needs batteries and it tends to eat those batteries up pretty fast. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I feel like I am constantly changing the batteries. I don&#x27;t really even use this that often, but the batteries are always empty when I try to use it!!! Batteries are pretty expensive so I think that might be one really big negative for this product. Other than that, I think that this would be good for travel and for emergency uses. I would probably think of getting rechargeable batteries or something for this though.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a decent shaver.  I wish it could give you a little bit of a closer shave, as you kinda have to take it over your legs several times but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price and size.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for travel.  I loaded up the batteries and gave it a whirl, only to find that it did not, in fact, shave anything.  The hair stayed in place despite several determined passes with the shaver.  Useless.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for traveling and you don&#x27;t have to plug them in to recharge them.</li>
    <li> Does the job after several strokes, non-irritating</li>
    <li> This is a really cute little shaver that&#x27;s great for travel. Unfortunately it stopped working after only a few uses even after putting in new batteries. Maybe we just got a faulty one??? The price is right but I&#x27;m not sure if we&#x27;ll order another.</li>
    <li> This is a handy little shaver, especially for 8 bucks. I bought this because I had brain surgery and I can&#x27;t bend over for 4 to 6 weeks. It&#x27;s not the closest shave or anything, it leaves the barest amount of stubble behind, but it&#x27;s so minuscule that you can&#x27;t even see it, and my hair is DARK, thick, and very noticeable usually. It had a foil in the middle and trimmers on each side for your bikini area. This is good for getting the forest under control before shaving with an expensive razor. I read that it&#x27;s not good to use on your underarms so I haven&#x27;t tried it there and really it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would feel the best either. Anyways, if you want something to cut down the extra growth until you can use a real razor this is for you. If you&#x27;re looking for a 50 dollar close shave electric razor then scroll on by.</li>
    <li> I just got mine so I&#x27;m not sure what the battery life will be.  I used dry on my arms and legs - no pulling or scraping.  Not the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had - but very good for an electric.  Then - I used wet in the shower under my arms and in other areas I won&#x27;t mention.  Still great results.  No razor burn anywhere.  A razor or waxing is going to give you the closest results - but this is fab.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave. The reasoning behind the 4 stars is because the shaver gets caught on the hair. Overall it gets the job done and I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I bought three.  One daughters stopped working properly after a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> These are handy inexpensive battery powered shavers.</li>
    <li> Cute device, works well too</li>
    <li> This functions at least as well as more expensive electric razors I have used, and I love that it&#x27;s battery powered and that you can replace the blades when they get dull.  The batteries seem to hold up for quite a while.  There is a plastic guard over the top so that you can travel safely with it, which I like, and a rope to hang it from, which I&#x27;m not a fan of (because I don&#x27;t hang it).  The biggest con I have is that it doesn&#x27;t come with very specific directions or any sort of cleaning brush or anything, so I&#x27;ve been shaking it and blowing on it to get the hair out.</li>
    <li> Not a very close shave, but works great for its price and you can use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I am unable to use a straight edge due to health reasons.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy and comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Works well</li>
    <li> I own about 4 of these right now, and I love them!  They&#x27;re inexpensive enough, and they last a pretty good amount of time.  My first one is probably 4 years old.  I use it twice a week on my legs, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I keep one in my travel case, and one as a spare.  I tend to pick one up every few months, just to have on hand.  I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews, but I&#x27;ve shared these with all my family members.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of crap!!! Went and brought new batteries and it doesn&#x27;t work!! You have to turn battery door the wrong way to get it to work and mind you the door won&#x27;t fit that way.... Such a waste give me my money ASAP</li>
    <li> I am a woman of color and I wanted to try an alternative for shaving. I tried it on my legs and NO LUCK WHATSOEVER.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave on legs, but when I give my legs a once over they look shaved. I tried it on my armpits and didn&#x27;t really like it because it doesn&#x27;t give a close enough shave. Works really well for a trim on your bikini area.</li>
    <li> Refills are available at Walmart.com.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll all be happy to hear this ... I sure was : )</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because the rechargeable battery on my old razor died after several years.  I came back to Amazon to buy a replacement only to find (for some inexplicable reason) that they will not ship it to Hawaii.  This was the only \\&quot;electric\\&quot; razor they were willing to ship, and it was inexpensive so I thought I would give it a try.  Now, having done that, I can say without reservation that it is the worst razor I have used in 30 years.  it reminds me of a cheap disposable razor which I had as a teenager.  After shaving (twice!) it felt like I had a day or 2 worth of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;I am guessing both because of the price and cute designs that this is targeted towards teenagers.  Who knows, maybe they will find an \\&quot;audience\\&quot; in people who have no experience with electric razors.  If this is your first electric, do not judge the others by this, it is absolutely worst in class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time was I did not think I could get a good shave from an electric razor (thinking back to my first razor which was pretty ineffective).  *But* I was happily proved wrong by my experience with both [[ASIN:B000Q9A15Y Remington WDF-1100 Smooth &amp; Silky Women&#x27;s Shaver, WDF1100]] and [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]  Both of these products are very good, give a nice smooth &amp; safe shave.  In fact, I have had several Remingtons at this point and would recommend their electric razors unequivocally.  Granted, these are more expensive, but not very much more (the Panasonic can be found for around $20), and there is nothing more expensive than a useless product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s cute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is safe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;VERY poor shave; worst of any razor I have tried to include 99 cent disposables&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less environmentally friendly than disposables as it uses batteries which must  be replaced/ throw out and which are pretty noxious in landfills (not to mention expensive, relative to a rechargeable)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, it is really hard to get past the big issue, that it gives an awful shave.  Even after 2 passes it is still not as good as any other razor I have used.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t know how much \\&quot;cute\\&quot; is worth to you in a razor.  Are you going to wear or display it?&lt;br /&gt;It is only cheap if it is useful, does not require the purchase of something else.  For me, this was an expensive purchase as it will likely never be used again, or maybe only in a pinch... if my primary dies and I do not have a disposable at hand.  Even for those who do use it on a regular basis, replacing batteries is more expensive than using a rechargeable (or a blade disposable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe: yes it is that, but so is any electric, and this one does chafe/ scratch making it less safe than other electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;portable: more so than a rechargeable, no more so than a disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have found some electric razors which provide a shave as close as a blade I have given up the  blade razors (because I have cut myself too many times).  I had not bought one in over 10 years, until I used this.  Then I went out &amp; bought a disposable until my *real* razor arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this is the first time in many years that Amazon has disappointed me (no, I do not hold them accountable for this product ;  But why on earth will you not ship me an electric razor when you have shipped a reel lawn mower (which is obviously much larger, heavier and more costly to ship).  that is a real puzzle... and so I was forced to go buy a real razor somewhere else.  My experience buying from Amazon is so much better than other stores, from the ease of ordering, great prices, great customer service, fast (and free) delivery and tracking... that I always shop here first (and consequently it is usually my last stop) *BUT* if it means winding up with a product so inferior that I throw or give it away and then have togo and find a suitable replacement, that&#x27;s no bargain.  This is such a product. and hmmm, now that I think about it, where is that razor I ordered (to replace this)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Please Amazon, make one or more of the real electric razors available to us in the islands.)azor I ordered (to replace this)?  (Please Amazon, make one or more of the real electric razors available to us in the islands.)</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp; it worked great for about a day. After that it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. Total waste of my money. Had to buy a different one. The size on this was perfect too but it died too fast &amp; I tried a whole pack of batteries!</li>
    <li> this is the second purchased for our daughter; the first one finally dulled after a year of very frequent use. other reviews said didn&#x27;t work well, but no problems with ours. Will continue to buy more when this one wears out!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it for we use even though it says you can.  I put in the batteries per the directions and used it in the shower.  Then the next time I went to use it, it didn&#x27;t work and the battery compartment was filled with water.</li>
    <li> Smartest cosmetic purchase ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little thing works like a charm! I love it because I used to only use razors to shave my bikini area, and afterwards I would get really bad razors bumps almost every time. Now with this shaver I can get a clean shave that isn&#x27;t pulling and tugging at my hairs leaving me with unsightly bumps. Please buy! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was contemplating buying one of these through Amazon, and happened upon the purple patterned Clio for $9.99 at my grocery store, so I just went ahead and bought it for the convenience. So far this is the best little shaver I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s so cheap, I was blown away with how close of a shave I could get. I hate shaving my legs, and I&#x27;m about 22 weeks pregnant, so it&#x27;s difficult to bend over in the shower. This is really a life saver! Obviously it&#x27;s not a perfectly smooth shave like with a razor, but it works better than any shaver my husband has ever had, and in fact, I urged him to use it when he just couldn&#x27;t get at a spot on his neck...BAM! my Clio worked like a charm. I have medium dark hair, but the shave is close enough that I can wear cropped pants without being able to actually see any hair (even if I can feel the slightest stubble). It also works great on armpits and on those little hairs at the edge of your mouth if they are looking a little dark! It never pulls or nicks, and that&#x27;s after I tested it around my bikini line to see. I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet after a few weeks of using it every other day or so, but I&#x27;m betting I will need to soon. Either way, great deal, and I&#x27;d rather buy this in bulk than store up razors and waste water. I&#x27;m clumsy and always cut myself anyway, and it will be nice to have fewer of those hazards around when our son is born!  *Update* Yep, I definitely need a battery change! It&#x27;s been another week or so of using it slightly less often (it&#x27;s cold and snowy outside, who cares about leg hair?!). I can tell the batteries are low because the shaver is not working as well, it&#x27;s just a different sound and is a bit sluggish, meaning it is starting to pull at hairs (nothing bad, though I wouldn&#x27;t test my bikini line right now!). I&#x27;m confident that with a fresh batch of batteries, it will be in perfect working order. As soon as I get some and test, I&#x27;ll update again. As previously stated, I don&#x27;t even care if it doesn&#x27;t work so great anymore, because I&#x27;ve saved money on razors and water, and saved plenty of time in the process  *2nd Update* Well over a year later, this is still a favorite in my body care arsenal. With fresh batteries, this puppy does an excellent job. I use it all the time and always take it in my bag for travel. Not the smoothest shave you&#x27;ll ever get, but you can&#x27;t see the stubble, which is honestly all I care about.</li>
    <li> Meh. Didn&#x27;t do a great job on my legs, and is useless in the shower.</li>
    <li> This shaver works just as good, if not better, than shavers triple the price. It takes 2 AAA batteries (I use rechargeable) and leaves my legs as smooth as you can expect from an electric shaver. Great for the winter when I avoid long showers due to dry, winter skin.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. I bought these so that my daughters (11 and 14) could shave safely without the risk of cutting themselves with a blade. I kept the extra one for myself. I have tried using it in the shower with shaving gel, and out of the shower dry and I didn&#x27;t get very good results either way. I don&#x27;t recommend unless you have EXTREMELY fine body hair.</li>
    <li> picked one up to try it because i got sick of having to replace my razor heads on my Venus for like 26 a month great razor gets you smooth and fits in a purse.</li>
    <li> I love this little shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my pits, but I&#x27;ve been using it on my chin whiskers (yes, I&#x27;m an old woman).  It does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> ...and at a price that can&#x27;t be beat!  The razor fits my hand well and feels solid.  I needed a razor with a replaceablle rather than rechargeable, battery, and it had to be water tolerant.  The Clio fits the bill.  The shave could be closer, I guess, but as the alternative is doing without....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered 4 and will be ordering more.  One for the house, one for the boat.  One for the suitcase, one for the overnight bag....  Now I&#x27;m thinking about gifting Clios to all my camping friends!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for myself, so far I am liking it. Fast shipping and product as described.</li>
    <li> This product works way better than a regular shaver it gets deep down to the root of the hair, leaving behind nothing but smoothness</li>
    <li> Horrible. I get that an electric razor can&#x27;t get as close as a regular one. But this was a waste of my money. It doesn&#x27;t even shave my pits and kinda shaves my legs. Pointless.</li>
    <li> Eats batteries. Id suggest using for a quick touch up and bring a big pack of batteries! Though it does a good job while it has charge.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute and it worked fine at first. It left me a little irritated and sometimes even cut me, though. Then it broke  about 6 mos in. I traded up and got a [[ASIN:B0018A32XS Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver, Mauve]]. So much better.</li>
    <li> It did not remove or trim leg hair. It quit in the first use. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> These work better than the drawer I have of more expensive electic shavers. I haven&#x27;t tried them in the shower so I can&#x27;t say how they are in water, but dry they are just fine!</li>
    <li> These inexpensive electric shavers have replace everything else I owned for legs and underarm shaving.  Better than any disposable non-electric razor.  Far cheaper yet more effective and less abrasive than any expensive electric shaver.  And go a long way before having to replace batteries.  I keep one at home and one ready to pack for travel.  Surprisingly well made and attractive for the price.  And last a long, long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used. I have never used it in the shower, but it is excellent dry. It is a very close shave.</li>
    <li> Initially, I bought one of these as as impulse buy at a local drug store.  Due to a disability, I have a really difficult time shaving my legs &amp; under my arms.  With NO electrical cord to hinder my work, I&#x27;ve found this razor to be PERFECT for getting both my under arms &amp; legs clean as a whistle!!!  It uses only 2 AAA batteries &amp; they seem to last forever!!!  My first razor lasted well over 2 years.  The replacement blades cost more than the razor &amp; when time came to change my blades, I headed back to my local drug store only to discover they no longer carried this razor.  So, I came straight home &amp; jumped on Amazon THRILLED to see that I could buy them here!!!  I bought 2; &amp; assuming these last as long as my last one did, I&#x27;m good to go for the next 4 maybe 5 years!!!  I love that I can shave my under arms WITHOUT ever nicking myself &amp; it glides over my knees WITHOUT cutting myself!!!</li>
    <li> Great little starter razor for my tween daughter.  Very cute design, fits in the palm of your hand very comfortably and a small enough to tuck away in a bathroom vanity drawer.  I just wish it was a little more powerful.  But for this price I can&#x27;t expect a perfect razor.  Good value.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending all my hard earned cash buying razor packs for $30. I figured the ease of an electric razor would be a welcomed change. I haven&#x27;t had it long so I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of the item, however I can say I absolutely LOVE this product. Your shave isn&#x27;t as close as with a razor, but you can get the job done (legs,underarms,bikini line) in under five minutes and I no longer have to hassle with hopping in the shower to shave. I also love that you can hang it from the attached string and my skin does not get any irritation like I do with traditional razors around my bikini area. Get it! For the price and cute print it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
    <li> I got this for my 11 year old daughter who was hesitant to start shaving her legs with the traditional razor and shaving cream.  Understandable so, I&#x27;m a grown woman and still sometimes nick myself.  This little shaver is portable, and the perfect size for her to handle.  You will not get a super close shave with this, like with a razor and shave gel/cream, but I think this is a good, safe, and fun option for tween and teen girls who are learning how to shave.  She really likes that her pink and purple shaver reflects her style.  If you are looking for a close shave, or very smooth skin, this won&#x27;t be your best bet.  It seems to remove only the very surface hair, and even then can feel slightly stubbly.  I suggest pressing firmly with the shaver with small strokes and changing directions.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this little shaver.  I bought it at W*A*L*M*A*R*T only because it was the only cordless one they had in stock.  I have a very expensive Remington Ladies shaver and it nicked my underarm so I NEVER use it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that I could use everywhere.  As noted, this not going to give you a soft as a baby&#x27;s butt shave.  But it will definitely give you a VERY acceptable shave, I am VERY surprised.  Especially for the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST OF ALL - I can now safely do my underarms! NO NICKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they made one with lithium batteries! But I DO have I rechargable battery system so I just need to pick up some AAA&#x27;s and some extra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Cute and fun Electric -- BATTERY operated Shaver.  I bought two of these due to cost, and my teen daughters use them.  They were excited to get them, and use them for the quick touch ups, or places they missed, as well as in the shower.  No Cords to mess with - they need 3 AAA batteries that are not included.  The colors and patterns are nice, and bright making it a hip thing to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent price me and my husband use it, the excellent thing is that you can use it in the shower and clean and sterilize it very well....I&#x27;ll order one for him lol</li>
    <li> The shavers only last about a year and a half.  New batteries don&#x27;t help.  It just stops working.  I&#x27;ve bought several packs because they are inexpensive and work well....for as long as they work.  So for the price, I gave it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product *Does* work, but it is slow going. It works much better in the shower than as a dry shaver. Over all, it&#x27;s a good product and I would buy it again. As a plus, it is lightweight and super cute!!</li>
    <li> Very cool style and was very excited to receive it. I &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34; one leg and that was enough to make use my old razor. It was a decent product for the price but def not a good shave.</li>
    <li> The item I received did not work.  Fresh batteries installed as instructed, but nothing happened.  I can&#x27;t be bothered to go through the trouble of shipping it back for a replacement or a refund, since it was (thankfully) so cheap.  But buyer beware, it may not even work when you get it :/</li>
    <li> I loved this for 6 weeks. Especially since it worked really well both in and out of the shower. Then it just quit. It did not slow down or get dull or give me any warning it just died one day. I tried new batteries. Nothing not even a hum. I was Lucy enough to get the purple color which I really loved and now I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this little beauty because I have a habit of forgetting to charge my razor.This is so much easier because I can just throw batteries in it if I need to. Okay, well that is a theory because I actually haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet. It works just as well as my $80 shaver. Yes, it does miss hairs and you have to go over the area again, just like the more expensive ones. It also doesn&#x27;t have as close a shave as using a disposable razor, but then, none of the electric ones do either. One of the nice things about this one is that it doesn&#x27;t pinch the skin in my armpits or other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas. I highly recommend for the price and would actually recommend over the more expensive shavers.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver over a year ago and it still works as good as the first day I got it. I&#x27;ve only had to change the batteries once. There is NO better deal on the market. I love this shaver. And it&#x27;s a dollar less then when I bought mine. I&#x27;m buying one for my suitcase!</li>
    <li> Amazon price several dollars cheaper than retail stores.  A good touch up shaver as they don&#x27;t get close and need to go over spots several times to get smooth.  Bought this one for my cruise as a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; and works fine for that.  Never used in water so can&#x27;t comment.  Had several thru the yrs, they last about a yr or less.</li>
    <li> The first one of these would not turn on at all. I exchanged for another unit and that one would stay on for about 7 seconds after you would hit it. Returned that one as well. I don&#x27;t know if they function to actually cut hair because they wouldn&#x27;t stay on or turn on.</li>
    <li> Works well. Never as close as s standard razor.</li>
    <li> A good, low-cost option for travel or for when you don&#x27;t have time to commit to thorough hair removal.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver. Its good. it shaves most of my hair but not all of it. Its still a good shaver and the price is very affordable.</li>
    <li> I love this little shaver,it works very well and easy to handle,great for travel.</li>
    <li> A great portable razor, stays sharp longer than you would think it would, easy to use, quiet, batteries last forever, what more can I say?  This one was a replacement for my first one.</li>
    <li> I really need to return these items. VERY DISSATISFIED WITH PRODUCT. Missed return date by a few days online. This item is garbage. I bought 3 (one for each of my kids) only one was opened. Packaging is intact. Need help processing return immediately!!! Gave one star only because review requires at least one star.</li>
    <li> This is my new little buddy, it is easy and quick to use. I use it for my face and chin (also works for peach fuzz on upper lip!!) because I like a smooth surface for my makeup. Its definitely something I don&#x27;t regret buying, and if I ever need a new one, its a no-brainer. The vibrations of it actually feel very nice on my face, so it gets the job done as well as feeling good. Also, as somebody who suffers with excessive facial hair, this works WONDERS. I&#x27;ve always been embarrassed about the hair on my face and this has given me a new found confidence in how I look and feel. So get this, whether you want a nicer makeup application or you have excessive facial hair, its really nice and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go get &#x27;em girls!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item for bikini area. Let&#x27;s just say that I gave my &amp;#34;little sister&amp;#34; a haircut and now girlfriend is bald! Like to leave a little to the imagination - so a little too close of a shave and not able to adjust blades. Then used shaver on underarms and legs - works perfectly (for me) for underarms - good shave for the legs too, but I still prefer to use a blade. Recommend the product, but not for bikini area!</li>
    <li> Scratched me and pulled out hairs. It does shave fairly close to the skin though.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this product for over 10 years now. I love this razor, hold up well and last for a good amount of time. I buy this on amazon because its cheaper on here than in the store and I will continue to order it online for as long as I use this. It works great and fast and even in the shower with the water. Must buy for all women.</li>
    <li> This little razor was a great deal as an add on.  With the random assortment I figured it would be ugly colors but I got such a pretty one!  Where the razor it shows is white mine is a pretty lavendar color with a blue button and pretty tiny flowers along the edges.  It has a light rubbery feel for a solid grip.  It is comfortable to hold because of it&#x27;s size and works great.  I am very satisfied couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal for the price.  I normally just use an electric razor for spots i miss in the shower and quick touch ups.  Works great for that!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. quit working after a couple weeks and didn&#x27;t shave well when it did operate.</li>
    <li> i read some decent reviews on this and found it at walmart for the same price wouldn&#x27;t turn on tried the exchange it and got the same problem they removed it from the shelves at that location for that reason</li>
    <li> I was very satistified.  I got what I was look for and a good price.  The package came within time frame.</li>
    <li> PERFECT PRICE, SIZE AND SHAPE!! I have a muscle disorder that causes spasms and I have carpal tunnel syndrome so using a regular razor is problematic. The shape, size and smooth rubberized surface solve my problems. I use it dry every 2-3 days under my arms and get a smooth clean shave without pressing hard. I started wearing my favorite sleeveless shirts again with no embarrassment!! When my friend saw it she had me order one for her too!! (Note: It&#x27;s water resistant not waterproof so don&#x27;t submerge it!)</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR TRAVELLING!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an ok shaver.  Tried to use it under my arms and on my legs.  It did not shave away the hair in one nor two strokes.</li>
    <li> This is the second electric razor I have ever owned. The first was a Remington that I paid something over $40 for more many years ago, and I never really liked it much, but I used it until it died. I also had borrowed my sisters and mom&#x27;s electric razors and never was thrilled with any of them either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With most cordless razors they have batteries that the consumer cannot replace if they go bad. I read so many reviews of cordless razors where the battery went bad shortly after purchase. So I liked that with the Clio I could just use rechargeable batteries that I can replace myself if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ended up deciding to take a chance on this and I actually love it, especially in comparison to my old, more expensive razor. The first batteries I used with this did die very quickly, but I got some rechargeable batteries and it has been doing great so far. While the shave is not as close as a blade, my legs are very smooth for an electric shave, and a lot smoother with it than my old electric razor which always left a noticeable stubble, even when it was brand new. Also, I&#x27;ve used it on really long leg hair (when I first got this it was winter, since my legs were covered most of the time so I didn&#x27;t bother shaving much) and on short hair and it seems to work really well on both. I use it out of the shower, dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little clear plastic/guard cover that came with it wouldn&#x27;t stay on at all...it was useless...but I used my hair drier to heat up the plastic (less than 30 seconds) and then pinched the &amp;#34;tabs&amp;#34; on sides in with my fingers until it cooled. Now it stays on fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I only paid about $8 for this, I am super impressed with is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the reviews I had also considered the Panasonic ES2207P &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34;...my mom ended up buying that kind so I borrowed it for comparison and I would say it is very good too. If I were to purchase a razor again the Panasonic ES2207P would be my second choice and this Clio my first.</li>
    <li> The shaver sometimes needs a few passes and swirling over an area; light-weight and very easy to use--and pretty, too</li>
    <li> I bought one as the first shaver for my 12 year old and found I like it so I bought myself one too! I don&#x27;t worry about her scurrying herself and it gives her more confidence to wear sleeveless tops in the summer. Its not as close as a traditional shave with shaving cream and blade but for&lt;br /&gt;quick touch ups I found it really useful.</li>
    <li> Put four stars because when I first got it, I put fresh batteries in it and it didn&#x27;t work! My dad had to bang it against the table for it to finally start working. You get what you pay for.  Updating..less than 6 months after I got it, the foul started coming out...now it&#x27;s completely useless...I would suggest the Remington version.. Its so much better</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product. I decided to try it since my last (conair) razor broke. The Clio is strong and loud, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to be quiet about shaving my legs. Great for between shave touch ups. Also works well on the bikini line, it actually gets pretty close! I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but so far it&#x27;s been nice! It says that you can take the razor part out and clean it, but I&#x27;m not sure how to do so, that&#x27;s the only down side!</li>
    <li> Poor.  Broken and gone in just a few tries</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about three years. It&#x27;s quick, easy and painless. If you are looking for a shaver that gets the skin totally hair free, this isn&#x27;t it. The only way to get such a close shave is with a razor. If you want your legs,  pits and bikini area to look presentable, this is for you. Need to do your legs in a hurry? Take five minutes and you&#x27;re done. Finish with a little lotion. I do not recommend using this as a wet shaver. It works best on dry skin to avoid dragging. You can purchase a twin pack of replacement foils on Clio&#x27;s website for about five dollars. If you have reasonable expectations, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Not exactly happy with this product I bought it as a back up for when I run out of razors and forget to buy more and this razor kills battery&#x27;s extremely fast and I have tried 4 different kinds of batteries including rechargeable ones nothing seems to work in the razor long enough ie: more then a minute then it dies</li>
    <li> About what I expected for 6 dollars.  I can use it in the shower, which is nice...but don&#x27;t expect a close shave.  Works out well for me, because close shaves cause ingrown hairs on my sensitive leg and underarm skin.  So I like it very much.  I&#x27;m a single, old lady, though.  Young, and married women...if your significant other likes smooth shaven skin, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> 13th birthday gift. easy to use</li>
    <li> Got 2 of these for my granddaughters. They use them quite a bit so hoping they hold up for a long while. Haven&#x27;t heard them say too much against them.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver for about a year. I bought it largely on the strength of the great reviews here on Amazon. My experience with this shaver, though, was not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The round holes in the foil are a big weakness. They make it impossible to get a close shave. This shaver is good for trimming things down before epilating, or before shaving with a real blade, but on its own, I was always left with stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: there are better shavers out there. They cost a bit more, but are worth it.</li>
    <li> It eats batteries like mad &amp; pinches at times, but for the price it&#x27;s not a bad emergency or travel. I would not buy as a daily use shaver.</li>
    <li> Woks ok but could be bette</li>
    <li> bought this for my 12 year old.  Extremely safe and close enough to skin, however, nothing like a razor.  This works just fine for a beginner shaver.</li>
    <li> They are the perfect size and work well on my face (I have a light girl mustache). I hate paying to get waxed and this is the perfect solution. It shaves closely enough that no one knows my secret! (Until now, of course) It works well for the little hairs on my fingers. I hate those darn things.</li>
    <li> It did not work when I got it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, quiet shaver that&#x27;s simple and works fairly well. As a guy who shaved his legs for the first time, this shaver stopped working effectively about halfway through one of my legs, but a few weeks after manually clipping off the hair this shaver has worked well to keep everything under control. It&#x27;s also fairly quiet and has a nice design with a loop of rope at the end for hanging it over a shower head or in my room.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these razors a few years ago at target I use it all the time. I wanted to get another for a back up and could not find them at any of my local stores, so I looked on Amazon and was happy to find them. Great for quick shaves and works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the reviews.  These DON&#x27;T work!  they are cheap and do not give you a close shave</li>
    <li> Wont order this again. If you want the smoothness of a razor, stick to a razor.</li>
    <li> for the price, can&#x27;t beat it!  Does a good job, battery operated so no need to worry about recharging (especially when traveling), and head snaps off to clean.  Sometimes when you put the head back on, if you do not line it up properly it does not work, but just adjust the positions of the head and base to meet, and it should be fine.  I also tied the cord into a tight knot so it does not get tangled in the blades. I have a few of these now, one for the house, one for the suitcase, and a spare.  At this price even having 6 is cheaper than one rechargeable and the batteries seem to last well in this. I hope this item continues to be available for as long as I need one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;additional review-several months of good service and then sporadic periods when it does not work,  Changed batteries, cleaned thoroughly, replaced head many times and sometimes the connection worked well and other times no proper contact so no shaver.  Fine for use as backup but would not depend on it.  New one I had bought works perfectly so I can see the difference.  I think after a few months of light use it just is not like new.  Cleaning makes no difference.  I bought a rechargeable one and will see how that works out. I got a 5 star rated one so hopefully it will be good!</li>
    <li> I got this and was so happy to try it,well after one use it did not work.I changed the batteries and bought new batteries and still nothing,not good at all.</li>
    <li> Never new they made something so simple to use. Carry anywhere and light and it really works. I  Love it</li>
    <li> I saw this little guy at my local CVS for 10 bucks, looked online here and paid 8. I&#x27;ve been looking for an electric shaver, to save time and cut closer than normal blades do. I was really intrigued, too, when someone said they were able to &#x27;shave dry&#x27; without a problem. So why not go for it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing&#x27;s almost perfect. It&#x27;s compact, and adorable. All it needs is two triple A batteries, and it works like a charm. I was able to get a much closer shave, and in less time. My legs looked phenominal! And i still had time to get other things done, without the mess (tried it dry). And on top of this, it&#x27;s small, so it&#x27;s perfect for travel. Or on the run if you want to touch up in a bathroom or something (not that I would, but good to know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s only ONE drawback, and the reason for my four star rating: it sucks batteries when its off. At least that&#x27;s what it did for me. I went to turn it one the second time I tried it, and it didn&#x27;t budge. I opened the bottom and put new batteries in, and it suddenly worked like a charm. I keep it in my bedside drawer with the bottom removed, and put it back on when I need to to use it again. It&#x27;s a good solution, but not the most ideal. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great shaver and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I  have had this just a couple of weeks and it doesn&#x27;t work.  I have replaced the batteries twice thinking I had worn out or stale batteries.  It either won&#x27;t come on at all or starts very weakly and then stops after just seconds.  Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as we had hoped, but for the price it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those young ladies!</li>
    <li> My daughter has a bleeding disorder- she is entering puberty and we were told by the pediatrician that we may need to look into getting an electric shaver for her. As I have never used an electric shaver I decided that I should make the switch over too- just in case she should need advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found the Clio Palm Perfect at walmart for 8.97. I was skeptical but I bought one for her and one for me. This is now the ONLY shaver I use- both her and I LOVE it! Works better than my traditional razor! Thank You Clio! Very close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice that it seems to work better on dry skin than wet... but that may just be me as I am unaccustomed to using an electric shaver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT use rechargeable batteries in this- better strength when using regular batteries. However, they DO NOT drain the regular batteries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cuts through week old thick growth with little problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so upset with this product. I used it about 3-4 times and now it does not work anymore!  What a disappointment after such good reviews.</li>
    <li> Used these for stocking stuffers for the girls this year.  They&#x27;ll make great for traveling and the beach!</li>
    <li> Worked very well for my armpits 👌.</li>
    <li> Performance of the razor: Decent. Not the closest shave, but I only bought it for those times when you haven&#x27;t shaved in a while and hair it too thick for a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve gone through three of these. None of them lasted through 10 uses. When I purchased it the description and the packaging stated that it could be used in the shower, so I assumed it was somewhat \\&quot;waterproof.\\&quot; Now for $10 I didn&#x27;t expect it to be able to be submerged under water, but I expected for it to at least be safe sitting in the back corner of my shower. Nope. Water still leaked in through to the battery compartment, rusting the batteries and the components inside rendering the razor useless. The last razor I bought I left outside the shower and only brought it into the stall when I was ready to use it. I tried to keep it as dry as possible, but water still got inside and ruined the batteries and the components in the battery compartment. I would only suggest this razor if you don&#x27;t need a super close shave and plan on keeping it 100% dry.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Fine if all you want is a quick shave, but it still left some stubble on my legs and left razor burn.</li>
    <li> It works well so far. I have only used it one time but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> A nice little shaver. They get onto us at work for people not being shaved on.the face especially the women. So I seen this and thought hmm. Lets give it a shot. Works great for the women and men. Haven&#x27;t heard no complaints from my boss since I started shaving everyone with this.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This Clico design for women sinsitive areas battery shaver are great for the man too,like the sinsitive areas like man landscaping,when down there are way to much over grown to much also great needed for way a lot more to shorten those arm pits hair too,that great for it,better than most shavers.One star taken away because the shaver stop making replacement cartriges for the head must buy a whole new shaver now.</li>
