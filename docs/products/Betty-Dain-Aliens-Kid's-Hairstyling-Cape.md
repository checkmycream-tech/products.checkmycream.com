    <li> Very nice little cape for the grandchiildren&#x27;s haircuts. I&#x27;m sure it would work just as well on an adult (just wouldn&#x27;t be as long). I love that it snaps around the neck instead of tying.</li>
    <li> Wish that it is a bit bigger. Nice material and color.</li>
    <li> This cape is so cheap. It barely covers the back. Hair sticks to it and does not come off unless washed.</li>
    <li> there is no fabric on the back, how do they expect the hair to get caught???</li>
    <li> Using for two boys haircuts at home, ages 5 and 7. Worked as expected. No complaints.</li>
    <li> good product. Thank you</li>
    <li> Works great for kids. Snap is better than velcro</li>
    <li> This product works as described and fits perfectly on my kids. The snaps work great to keep the cape on my kids and provides a good snug fit. The product does keep the hair off them and does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> Good products, quick delivery</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 1 and 3 year old!</li>
    <li> The cape works perfectly. I use it to protect my elderly mother&#x27;s shirt while she is eating. Makes for less of a mess on her shirt, makes for an easy clean-up and wash.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cape to use at home when I do hair cuts on my children. I take care of all our hair needs at home. This cape came exactly as described and exceeded my expectations. The children love the fun alien print. The cape is very light weight with plastic adjustable snaps at the neck. It stays secure while cutting hair and removes easily. The only draw back is the clingy cloth holds onto hair even after vigorous shaking. It does not brush off or pick off easily. A wet paper towel does not help much either. I washed the cape in cold water and that removed the hair but of course left hair all over my washing machine. Since I don&#x27;t do hair cuts frequently I can live with needing to wash it after use each time.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but looks like it will work</li>
    <li> Cape is small good for kids 3 and under.  Kids love the aliens graphic. Helps excite them about the haircut. Light weight and snaps are good fit for children&#x27;s neck.</li>
    <li> Adorable. I do my stepdaughter&#x27;s hair and this cape makes her feel pretty and special. Perfect for kids.</li>
    <li> The cape is fun looking for a kid, but as other posted there is a gap behind even around a preschooler&#x27;s neck.</li>
    <li> Very cute and bright kid&#x27;s cape for hair cuts. It fit my kids well and kept them clean below the neck.</li>
    <li> I have three year olds twin boys, and I needed a way to keep them happy with a cape on so I could quickly cut their hair with clippers. They love it, I love it. It&#x27;s a win. The snaps keep the neck nice and tight, and it keeps the hair clippings from going down their neck into their shirts, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Love it, great buy.</li>
