      <li>Sensationail seems to be the one polish I like best.  </li>
      <li>Perfect neutral shade</li>
      <li>This is a great gel polish product with an absolutely beautiful color.</li>
      <li>Great color</li>
      <li>Great color, works great</li>
      <li>But this color is not that great.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous! !!</li>
      <li>This color fits me quite well and holds up very nice.</li>
      <li>it was no stars, but I want to be fair.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful color, it&#x27;s a bit more orange than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful color and the new Gel polishes are awesome!</li>
      <li>This color looks great on and perfect if you work at a professional setting and want to look tasteful.</li>
      <li>and I have received many compliments!  </li>
      <li>I bought 3 shades by this company and love all three!</li>
      <li>I think it looks nice.</li>
      <li>Nice shine.</li>
      <li>Nice color.</li>
      <li>Love this polish nice color.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the color at first, but after it was on I was happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I think the picture shows the color very accurately.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay on my fingers more than a day.</li>
      <li>I love the color, but it chips in one day.</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>A bit lighter orange than I expected but still a beautiful color!</li>
      <li>It does take longer to put on though because of the uv light.</li>
      <li>Did not know you need an led light kit to use this polish.</li>
      <li>I would like to try the polish that says it doesn&#x27;t need a light...</li>
      <li>Great polish but was more peachy colored when I was looking for a pink shade.</li>
      <li>color I think is perfect, as I was applying I thought it may be too pink for my tastes, but after the second coat it turned out to be the perfect balance of pink and peach.</li>
      <li>My second application - starting with clean nails - has been on for almost two weeks and is still perfect.  </li>
      <li>But is a very nice peachy pink shade if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>The actual product is fine - I use the brand to do my own gel manicure all the time.  </li>
      <li>It peals right off.</li>
      <li>I have tried every drug store gel nail polish that my local stores sell, and Sensationail is by far my favorite, easy to apply and lasts the longest in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Buyers be aware that .25 oz.</li>
      <li>The color is lovely and very similar to the box.</li>
      <li>Color is more orange than expected.  </li>
      <li>A real winner.</li>
      <li>This looks salmon pink, but is really more peachy, which is not my thing.  </li>
      <li>Very streaky color.</li>
      <li>It is also more opaque than the two other colors I have tried, so</li>
      <li>It was a little darker on my nails than pictured, so I would call it more of a coral color with a sparkle.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have any &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; like it shows and it&#x27;s more dull than coral looking.  </li>
      <li>One caution: it is harder to remove - had to use full strength &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>And the price is much cheaper than my local stores.</li>
      <li>After doing dish, a half polish of 3 right side nails have gone..  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t care as much for the color as I expected.</li>
      <li>it definitely does not have the natural effect I was after.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>Works fine but very very small.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no long drying time and it lasts me about 9-10 days.  </li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on my fingers more than a day. I don&#x27;t need nail polish remover. It peals right off.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Sensationail for a few years now.  I will never go back to regular nail polish. I&#x27;m hard on my nails, and this polish stands up to it. There&#x27;s no long drying time and it lasts me about 9-10 days.  It does take longer to put on though because of the uv light. Sensationail seems to be the one polish I like best.  I would like to try the polish that says it doesn&#x27;t need a light... We&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t sure I liked the color at first, but after it was on I was happy with it.  I&#x27;m 61 and like my colors somewhat demure.  This color fits me quite well and holds up very nice.</li>
    <li> Great color and I have received many compliments!  It was a little darker on my nails than pictured, so I would call it more of a coral color with a sparkle.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Perfect neutral shade</li>
    <li> Color is more orange than expected.  There is a lot of luster in product.</li>
    <li> This is a great gel polish product with an absolutely beautiful color. A real winner.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color and the new Gel polishes are awesome! I can use a gel polish and go out and work in my garden and come in and wash my hands and my polish still looks shiny.</li>
    <li> This is tough stuff!  My second application - starting with clean nails - has been on for almost two weeks and is still perfect.  One caution: it is harder to remove - had to use full strength &amp;#34;over the counter&amp;#34; remover - cotton square soaked in remover wrapped in foil for just over 10 minutes and then some scraping with an orange stick. But I have very delicate, thin nails and they were not damaged. Nice shine.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 shades by this company and love all three!</li>
    <li> This color looks great on and perfect if you work at a professional setting and want to look tasteful. I will buy again</li>
    <li> the color is actually darker than on picture, it has pink- browniesh color</li>
    <li> Great color, works great</li>
    <li> Fabulous! !!.. tons of compliments on my polish color when I wear it</li>
    <li> A bit lighter orange than I expected but still a beautiful color!</li>
    <li> Bought. Did not know you need an led light kit to use this polish. Nice color.</li>
    <li> I love the color, but it chips in one day. I have tried other colors of the maker and others, it never have happened.  I tried everything same, but only this color chips in a day.  After doing dish, a half polish of 3 right side nails have gone..  Tried multiple times and similar result.  Very disappointing..</li>
    <li> Great polish but was more peachy colored when I was looking for a pink shade. But is a very nice peachy pink shade if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. I&#x27;ll still wear it when I&#x27;m planning an outfit in that color.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care as much for the color as I expected.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, it&#x27;s a bit more orange than I thought it would be. It has a bit of shimmer which you can&#x27;t see in the image.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this color is chipping off in a few days. Don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I have tried every drug store gel nail polish that my local stores sell, and Sensationail is by far my favorite, easy to apply and lasts the longest in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color I think is perfect, as I was applying I thought it may be too pink for my tastes, but after the second coat it turned out to be the perfect balance of pink and peach. I think the picture shows the color very accurately. And the price is much cheaper than my local stores. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on it!</li>

It is also more opaque than the two other colors I have tried, so it definitely does not have the natural effect I was after.&lt;br /&gt;For me it was no stars, but I want to be fair.  If this is the look you are seeking then, doubtless, you would like it.</li>
    <li> Very streaky color. Hard to remove and pricey</li>
    <li> The actual product is fine - I use the brand to do my own gel manicure all the time.  But this color is not that great.

    <li> Love this polish nice color.</li>
    <li> The color is lovely and very similar to the box. I think it looks nice.</li>
    <li> Buyers be aware that .25 oz. is not very big !</li>
    <li> The best gel polish out there.</li>
