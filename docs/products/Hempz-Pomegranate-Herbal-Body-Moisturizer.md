<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> SUPER FAST Shipping - Great item - Thanks</li>
    <li> I love HEMPZ anything! The lotion is very moisturizing and not oily or sticky. it is a winter must have for me! Pomegranate was not my favourite smell but I still used up the bottle to the very last drop! I suggest trying Hempz Vanilla Plum! It is my favourite smell in the world!</li>
    <li> I order this cream for my husbands dry skin. Very soothing!</li>
    <li> Hempz products are always very nice to use.  They have wonderful &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  I have used these products for many years and have also given them as gifts often.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff from the fragrance to the feel. Makes skin soft all day long. We live in the high desert and it is hard on your skin, this product is a must have in our home.</li>
    <li> I have replaced my store bought body lotion with Hempz. This is the best and smells great. This item arrived fast and before expected.</li>
    <li> Search no more!  I have been using this lotion for years.  You know that little elbow dry patch that never seems to go away?  Well this takes care of it!  That was a side benefit I noticed while using this lotion - strange - it just disappeared.  The fragrance with all of the Hempz is wonderful - I can never make up my mind which to buy.  I try to use this one and the cucumber more for summer but the original is still my favorite.  Moisturizes skin without leaving it feeling greasy - really soaks in and seems to last all day.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I mistakenly ordered the pomegranate scented cream when I always get the original hempz.  The lotion is equally good I believe but I miss the nice fragrance of the original.  I will definitely go back to it when this one is gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over 5 years now. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s non-greasy, super fast absorbing and lasts my body all day. I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every scent they have and the pomegranate is always my go-to for the summer! I tan frequently in a salon and find that this lotion acutally keeps my tan looking great for longer as well. You can&#x27;t beat this amazon deal, Ulta has these exact same lotions for $23 a bottle!!</li>
    <li> the best been using this for awhile now and by far its the best that i ever used</li>
    <li> Great product, smells good and great body moisturizer</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME.  I AM SO GLAD I CAN GET IT AT AMAZON NOW.  THIS MAKES IT VERY CONVENIENT FOR ME.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, will not use anything else, great for dry skin</li>
    <li> Nice consistency.  Fragrance close to what I was looking for, but not exactly.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion ordered more.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell and leaves skin feeling so soft</li>
    <li> I use it for my skin and in my hair as a substitute for product. I have extremely sensitive skin, so a lot of things bother me. Hempz is about the only thing I can use without having an allergic reaction. I also have extremely thick, curly hair, so taming that mess used to be a project, to say the least. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, in every kind of weather, and as a product substitute ( for mousse and creams and all that other junk normally used to tame the madness that is curly hair) it is absolutely stellar. My hair is manageable, it shines, and it doesn&#x27;t turn into a mass of tangles anymore. Use it. Best investment in health and beauty I ever made.</li>
    <li> smells good and feels good in body.</li>
    <li> Oh god. The smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the huge pot leaf and the name of the product itself, you wouldn&#x27;t think they would engineer this smell for 70 year old cat ladies. But you&#x27;d be wrong.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest moisturizer I have found in a long time. The scent is undescribable, but is one of the reasons I purchased this after using this at my daughter&#x27;s home. Hands feel smoother and softer and the scent lasts for a very long time. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, soaks in fast. A lovely product..</li>
    <li> I love the Hempz products and this was delivered quickly and has an amazing scent.  It makes my skin feel silky soft.</li>
    <li> My coworker has this at her desk. Every day I walk over and use a little. I have eczema and lotions irritate my skin if overly perfumed. This lotion does have a strong smell to it, and I LOVE that, but, the lotion does not irritate my skin at all. In fact, the lotion has helped clear up a lot of my dry skin issues. I went to a store to purchase this and it was $28 a bottle!. I looked on Amazon, and saved a bunch!.. So happy to have found this. Will be buying again..</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is not greasy or sticky.  Works well for me and my dry skin.</li>
    <li> My eczema used to be pretty bad, I discovered this by my friend telling me how good this lotion was in general (she didn&#x27;t know I had eczema) and when I started using it, not only did I notice how well it moisturized but also how it made my skin a lot less irritated and itchy! I can&#x27;t believe how good of a deal this is on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, this was a lot more effective than even Eucerin and other similar high rated products. Even over the counter creams designed specifically for eczema haven&#x27;t been as good as Hempz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say the least, this lotion is awesome!</li>
    <li> I have tons of lotions in my cabinet - now that I have discovered this one, the rest can go away</li>
    <li> I really really like the Hempz body lotions. I just started using the pomegranate one and it smells delicious. This is one of the few body lotions that does not irritate my skin when I use it after shaving. It also feels light after applying it on your skin which is a refresher. My skin feels moisturized and and firm and smells wonderfully after I use this lotion.</li>
    <li> I just love, love this lotion! Smells fantastic, keeps my winter moisture thirsty dry skin in check, and is perfect after a lap swim in the pool. It goes on like a cream, sinks in like a lotion and is just the right weight and consistancy not greasy like some lotions and/or creams that I&#x27;ve tried. I will be ordering some more of this ......</li>
    <li> Great lotion at a great price.</li>
    <li> It smells reallyyy nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. My friends go straight for this product when they come over even though I have a pretty good selection of lotions, this seems to be everyone&#x27;s top choice ;)</li>
    <li> Great product works very good and has a good smell, very creamy and thick but works into your skin fairly easy.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion because it has a nice fragrance.  Usually, I cannot use scented lotions and must use only hypoallergenic products.  If it were less expensive and had a different name (Don&#x27;t like the Hempz name/Logo, I would give it a five star review.  Also, box lotions was shipped in had racy slogan on it which did not please me as I had the order shipped to my office!</li>
    <li> One of the only lotions I can say has honestly made a lasting difference to my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Best Lotion Ever!  Have tried many different brands of lotion and creams, but all are no comparison to Hempz.  My skins is not normally dry, but this year my hands became noticibly dry.  This lotion does not have a greasy feeling but when applied, absorbs into your skin, leaving a wonderfully smooth feeling that stays on.  Liked the original so much, purchased Pomegranate scent.  This scent is a refreshing clean smell and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Great scent and very hydrating!</li>
    <li> It makes your skin soft ,  absorbs quickly , and has a great smile .</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS HORRIBLE!  BUT THE HEMPZ LOTION IS GOOD...STILL LOOKING FOR ONE THAT DOESN&#x27;T GIVE ME A HEADACHE FROM THE SMELL.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 3 years...I just love it! Goes on thin and not at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend! I have very dry skin and this seems to be the perfect product.</li>
    <li> Not the smell I was thinking it was</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It smells good. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again though. It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for the dry climate in Arizona.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is absorbs fast into the skin, makes skin soft and gives a slight sheen without being greasy. It has a stronger scent than I like which is why I only gave it 4 stars. It is effective and easy to use. The pump top actually works (I have sucky luck with them usually) and it is a good value for the price. It really does work great at hydrating my skin. I will choose a different scent next time because I really like this lotion.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. It smells amazing and really works to soften the skin. I just wish they sold it in my local stores.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever! Light scent, perfect moisturizer!</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer ever.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion ever! Totally worth the price</li>
    <li> Great! i love the lotion, keeps my skin soft. I would refer it to a friend to use.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
    <li> It smells great and works pretty well but I have super dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t always do the job moisturizing my face.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the original scent, nothing better then walking around smelling lightly of candy. This pomegranate however is overpowering and has a floral scent, not the fruity I was hoping for. My girlfriend also said the scent is overwhelming as well, so it isn&#x27;t just my complete distaste for the floral scent.    The lotion itself is top notch 5star Hempz as always, no complaints on that front.</li>
    <li> smells so friggen good! and moisturizes well too</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. My only complaint is that the bottle pump stops working (every single time) when there is still about a third of the bottle left, which means I have to take pump off and turn it upside down to get lotion out of the bottle - which is annoying.</li>
    <li> I ordered the pomegranate lotion, but received the regular lotion.  I was disappointed because I prefer the pomegranate, but I will use the regular.  It&#x27;s too much of a hastle to return it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Leaves skin soft and smooth.  Great for body massages and foot rubs.  Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! :)</li>
    <li> Great smell and thick consistency!</li>
    <li> Hemp pomegranate lotion leaves your skin feeling very smooth and fresh. Absorbs quickly into your skin and does not leave a greasy feeling.. Pomegranate scent is very subtle and not over powering and almost smells edible. For problematic dry skin that is sensitive to lotion I would recommend this product! Will be ordering and trying other scents once this one runs out</li>
    <li> Oh my god this smells so good</li>
    <li> It moisturizes well, is not greasy and absorbs fairly well. Unlike some other reviewers, I find the aroma off putting. It smells artificial.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but I almost feel like I have to.  I suffer from exzema all over!! My face, my arms, my legs.  I&#x27;ve had dermatologist prescription and recommendations but really, they didn&#x27;t help.  I have dry red patches and this year and last year I got them pretty badly on my face.  I&#x27;ve been using Elizabeth Arden-the original moisturizing lotion.  It worked pretty well, for a little while.  And then it seemed to not work anymore.  It felt like it sat on my face and didn&#x27;t penetrate.  Now I&#x27;ve used the Hempz Pomegranate before on my body.  Loved the feeling and how well it absorbed in my skin.  Made it sooo soft.  I ran out of my face lotion and its so expensive that I was putting it off.  I got desperate and used this lotion on my face.  I don&#x27;t really recommend using regular body lotion on ones face since it&#x27;s so sensitive.  NOT SO WITH THIS LOTION!!  My dry red itchy flakey patches were gone within 12 hours.  Normally with others it was a couple days.  I wish I had used this earlier.  Everyone is noticing how much better my skin is. . .I feel so much better.  I definitely recommend this lotion for those who suffer with dry skin, or even exzema!!</li>
    <li> Fabulous lotion, great scent and great moisture.  I highly recommend this hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Everything about this product is as it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;my main problem is that it leave your skin feeling oily.</li>
    <li> as always, this hempz moisturizer takes the &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; out of sunburn, and keeps my skin from peeling. this particular scent is okay, but i definitley prefer the citrus smell better!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! smells YUMMY and love how soft it makes my dry skin feel. not greasy and fast absorbing. did I mention smells YUMMY?!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best lotion I have ever used to keep my hands free from dryness and splitting. I don&#x27;t use anythng else now. It was so confenient to be able to get this on the internet.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!! I up until this point have been only able to use Curel lotion on my skin. Most lotions don&#x27;t soak in for some reason on me. But this lotion is wonderful and it has such a nice scent to it.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and the lotion easily spreads to the body when you apply.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I purchased it for the first time and I&#x27;m in love. I will definitely keep buying it. Keep my body nice and moist and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my hands only as I like it to last. I love the way it feels and the smell of it. However, could only purchase it when I was in the States as now have returned home in Australia Amazon won&#x27;t ship. Would be great if you could change that</li>
    <li> This lotion is very nice on the skin, not oily yet very moisturizing.  It definately does not smell like pomegranate!  It is more like a sweet watermelon or floral scent, definately girly.  Overall, I like the lotion but did not give it 5 stars due to the scent, not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It really hydrates my skin and has a really great smell! I tried to get it at a big box beauty store and it was DOUBLE amazons price!</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. It feels really nice on my skin and helps to moisturize. It also smells really good.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Worked as expected and I recommend it to anyone who needs to use it. I will buy some more.</li>
    <li> Feels fine. Goes on easy. Smell is to sweet and overpowering for me. Smells like bees would love it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find hempz brand lotion all too often so I&#x27;m tickled just to have some again. I think, however, that I will go w/ a different scent next time. I&#x27;m not too crazy about this scent. It&#x27;s kind of overkill for my nose. The packaging also needs to be more thought out. The lotion was packaged loosely &amp; the first few douses of it was melted inside the bag because of the heat. I&#x27;m glad I picked it up out of my mail box the same morning or I might have had to get half my lotion from the bag it came in &amp; not the lotion bottle! Weather needs to be considered when packaging this product. Overall, though, I&#x27;m satisfied w/ this item. I definitely love the Hempz brand lotion &amp; will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong for me.  It does moisturize really well. My husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell either, especially before bed.  Says the scent is too strong and &amp;#34;awakening&amp;#34;.  I agree.  Maybe for daytime if you don&#x27;t wear perfume it&#x27;d be ok.  I&#x27;m going to try just the original scent and see if I like it better, because the formula is great.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent!. It is a very light fruity scent. Not strong and overpowering. good for body and just as a hand cream</li>
    <li> I am glad with my purchase of this lotion.  It does the job of soothing and moisturizing my skin.  I have rough skin and I need to lotion up myself often during the day.  This lotion has allowed me to apply it only twice a day because it does a good job keeping moisture in.  It does pack a strong smell and throughout the day, you can get whiffs of the scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything, it&#x27;s just strong.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin and living in Chicago, Land of Hard Water, doesn&#x27;t help. Using natural, paraben-free products is important to me and over the past year or so since I first tried this lotion, it is the best natural lotion I have found for my skin. I apply it in the morning after showering and my skin stays hydrated and soft all day (even my elbows). It is more expensive than other lotions (especially grocery store stuff), but a little goes a long way and for my dry skin it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra few bucks. The scent is floral and feminine, which I don&#x27;t mind, but others may find it obnoxious or unwanted. I&#x27;ve smelled the regular Hemp scent in the store, though, and I did not care for it.</li>
    <li> Watery will not purchase again, bad seller!</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! It provides lots of moisture without being greasy.  It also has a very pleasant light smell that is not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Love Hempz  I always use this scent in the body butter. Thought id try the lotion</li>
    <li> The cap was loose and spilled all over. Returned with a refund.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, not too greasy, nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and nongreasy. It smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> This product is creamy and hydrating with out leaving any oily residue. My skin just drinks it up, and I love the clean pomegranate scent.</li>
    <li> My husband has extremely dry skin, this works great, it has a light fragrance so he does not smell girly, like it very much</li>
    <li> I love pomegranate and its benefits it provides for the body as well as cannabis seed oil. This product is a win win.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this rich, thick moisturizing cream.  It has a wonderful fruity, fresh fragrance and is very effective on dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was given this first as a gift and then was amazed at the results.  I work in food industry so hands are in water and chemicals all the time.  This is one of the best I have every used.</li>
    <li> I have severe dry skin all year and this lotion is perfect for me, it feels like no lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried, perfect!</li>
    <li> The Hempz lotion is great stuff, I just wish there was a version that was not so darn fragrant!  The scents are just way too overpowering, and everywhere you go, everyone else is hit with the scent as well.  If you are looking to cover up some of the worst BO, this is the stuff will do it and then some.  Remove the strong scent and make a guy scent, and I will order a bunch along with 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to most lotion scents, but this one is perfect! Just a light fruity scent while providing awesome moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  I try other kinds of lotions but always come back to this one.  It keeps my skin soft and hydrated.  It never leaves a greasy feeling on my skin.  I have psoriasis and love the way it keeps the breakouts in check somewhat.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It is perfect for my dry skin.  It smells wonderful but not overpowering.  I had to buy this one so my husband would stop using all of it ;)  I buy him the original sent now and I get the pomegranate.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I also don&#x27;t feel like I have to reapply every hour.</li>
    <li> A co-worker of mine gave me a gift bag including this moisturiser.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Smells great and works even better than I thought.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when you slather it on, and absorbs quickly into your skin. Doesn&#x27;t appear to leave any of that pesky residue you get with most lotions, and it doesn&#x27;t get on my keyboard or mouse (which is a pet peeve of mine). Effectively moisturizes the skin but one of the things that I love the most...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;is that it smells absolutely divine. While I can&#x27;t say it smells exactly like pomegranate, it smells great. I would compare it to smelling like a Starburst. Maybe that&#x27;s a bit overwhelming for some, but I like it. I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, the scent is not my favorite. My mother in law loves this one. I purchased all the different scents to give them a shot, I just personally prefer the original. Works well.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot and smell is great!!! but didn&#x27;t work wonders for dry skin - more of a light lotion applies great and absorbs nicely not oily</li>
    <li> I bought this because i was having allergic reaction to different lotions and this one is great. it hydrates without causing an allergic reaction. love the smell!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this but I have had better moisturizing from other lotions.</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking that I could trust the ad claiming it was 100% natural, organic, bla bla bla.  Turns out they top off the mix of organic ingredients with a nauseating artificial fragrance!  Gag me!  Don&#x27;t buy this is my advice.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this moisturizer at Ulta.  But did some searching and found it for 1/2 the price on Amazon.  I love the scent of Pomegranate.  I live in the desert, Arizona, so moisturizing is just a fact of life.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products... some too thick that you couldn&#x27;t type for several minutes after applying to others that were just too watery and all you did all day was moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hempz moisturizer is that happy medium.  I have a large container at work, one at home and a travel size in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Favorite Hempz scent thus far!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion ever! Keeps me soft all day and the smell lasts too! I originally bought it at a store but I went on vacation and lost it :( I&#x27;ll continue to purchase my favorite lotion online :)</li>
    <li> This Hempz Pomegranate lotion is the best! I will order again, and hopefully will use it for years to come.  It is creamy and smells great.  Also nice texture, hydrates the skin well!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing. Not too thick a bit creamy but that&#x27;s how I like my lotions. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  While I have used this for a long time, it is difficult to find.  For some reason, you can only find it in places like tanning salons.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon is carrying it.  Since the last time I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve noticed that the pomegranate seems to smell a little more perfumey.  That just may be my nose.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it doesn&#x27;t overpower, I just noticed a difference.  The lotion itself is great because it isn&#x27;t greasy, it absorbs into your skin easily, and you don&#x27;t have to constantly apply.  I bought several of the small bottles to put one at my bedside, in my car, by the kitchen sink, etc. and I just refill them from the bigger bottle.  This lasts me a few months.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the product received was not the product ordered (received Citrus instead of Pomegranate) so I cannot rate the product itself.  I requested an exchange for the correct product, however that did not happen either. We ended up having to keep the citrus...not my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for after shower moisturizing. This is now my second bottle. Nice light scent and absorbs nicely...no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> Soft on your skin.  I gave it 4 because the scent.  It&#x27;s not a super overpowering scent but a tiny bit.  I have the coconut watermelon and that scent is a bit more tame.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and have been using it for years, however it always seems to be pretty pricy at the salons.  The price online is right, and the lotion is as spectacular as ever.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever.  And....the price is unbelievable so I will definitely be ordering more.  The shipping was also free so it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;no brainer!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love the size and price for this moisturizer it smells fantastic will be buying more hopefully soon by July......</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the absorption; does not leave my skin feeling greasy!  I also love their body butter, especially for my feet!</li>
    <li> Using for past 3 moths . i like this, only  negative is when the bottle is 70% empty ,remaining cream is not coming out when you press!! i think the design of the bottle is very bad.</li>
    <li> I love the scent this lotion has..</li>
    <li> Love the Hempz Pomegranate Moisturizer, it goes on very smooth &amp; the scent it Awesome!!  The price was great too.</li>
    <li> Smells great and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Fantastic lotion!  Immediately moisturizers your whole body and the pomegranate scent is heavenly!!  The moisture lasts all day long!! Its magic!</li>
    <li> I use this daily,its the best moisturizer.I have psorisis and it helps it.it is the only lotion i use when in the sun.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this plenty of times and just love how it makes your skin feel and the scent is not strong just right.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought Hempz with Pomegranate and I highly recommend it.  I used the original Hempz and it keeps disappearing from my bathroom!  Great, not oily, and your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!! It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky and greasy and the smell is wonderful too. Grrat product!!</li>
    <li> We live in Utah, it is dry, this is a perfect combo. You don&#x27;t feel greasy after applying and you don&#x27;t feel too dry either.</li>
    <li> Great gift that fit perfectly in the stocking. The person I gave this as a gift to really liked the scent as well.</li>
    <li> The lotion was broken and was in a ziploc. The lotion was a mess. Not a good idea to buy.</li>
    <li> The bottle&#x27;s pump came broken which was a little frustrating but the lotion itself has a sweet, not overpowering scent. I love that it&#x27;s all natural as well!</li>
    <li> I love love love this lotion! Fantastic smelling and great on the skin. Lasts a long time too. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  I bought this at the tanning salon and LOVED it.  However, I found this online much cheaper so decided to purchase it.  However, it is watered down compared to at the salon.  I would rather get lotion that is the real deal.  If you are going to water it down don&#x27;t sell it as an original product.</li>
    <li> The first Hempz Pomegranate lotion I received was from a hair dresser. I just loved the feel and scent! It is so rich and makes your skin feel so soft! I can&#x27;t buy &#x27;over the counter&#x27; lotion now. It does one no good because it just seems to evaporate off your skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever tried. I use it every day. I live in AZ and need a good hydrating lotion daily. It goes on like satin and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected !</li>
    <li> Wife is very happy with this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this almost everyday for the past 3 months.  I live on a farm, and this made my skin super soft!  I&#x27;ve never had a lotion that worked this well!  Yeah, it&#x27;s a little expensive, but when something works the way it should, it&#x27;ll be a little more expensive:)</li>
    <li> I love all the lotions from this company, and even though it sounds gay, yes I have all three smelling lotions in my bathroom and alternate them. My girlfriend also digs them.</li>
    <li> Love this it keeps my hands super soft</li>
    <li> I love this co. cream ,but this one has too strong of a smell. I can only use it on my feet.</li>
    <li> After trying a sample from my hair salon, I was hooked.  Leaves my hands feeling smooth and refreshed.  I use it on my legs, feet, arms, and hands.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this lotion before and it is very cheap for a 17 oz. Shipping was very fast!! But the package was dented and when I opened it the pump didn&#x27;t work!!</li>
    <li> Great Price! Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this lotion. It works as well as any other lotion but it&#x27;s the smell that keeps me buying it. Plus I think pomegranates have mystical significance so I like using lotion derived from them.</li>
    <li> Thick n creamy, substantial, with a great fragrance. It was becoming very difficult to buy this in store - and it is a much better deal online here!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy, clammy feeling on your hands.  It rubs in nicely and makes your skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Arrived when it said it would. I love that this doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
    <li> Besides this being a good natural lotion, I absolutely love the fresh flowery scent. Rubs in very easily yet is not greasy. Its my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It has a delightful scent and  provides excellent hydration for the skin all day. I also appreciate that it is gluten free, all natural, and contains no animal ingredients.</li>
    <li> Thick, smells heavenly, stays on. Perfect blend to moisturize dry skin with a great fragrance!</li>
    <li> Love the pomegranate!  Not &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; at all. Very subtle and pleasing. Great for foot rubs, too. Want to try others. P</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer ever, friend gave it to me as a gift, and I am hooked, just replenished my supply.</li>
    <li> Used this product all the time but the new bottle I ordered seems like it&#x27;s been watered down. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Hempz lotions! The pomegranate scent and also the citrus sent is amazing! Leaves my skin silky smooth without the grease!</li>
    <li> i get compliments all the time on how good i smell which is nice ! i love that this lotion is pink which is my favorite color &amp; i think its a great moisturizer. leave me feeling soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Love the Hempz products, this one smells flowery to me. I prefer the sweet smell of the vanilla plum.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and smell of this moisturizer. Not greasy as some moisturizers are!  Definitely recommend and will use again!</li>
    <li> The best lotion ever!  It does not make your skin oily and soaks right in.. Smells great too!  I would buy this lotion again</li>
    <li> I received this Hempz product from a friend for a birthday gift.  Pretty funny, since I don&#x27;t smoke dope, and yet this product is made from a marijuana leaf-clearly visible- on the product!  I was apprehensive, and then tried it and LOVED the smell.  I have tried 3 different scents from Hempz line and have enjoyed all three of the smells/odors!  I recommend this product to most anyone, unless you have a great sensitivity to odors, if so you may not like this product!  Personally, I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> People always ask why I smell so good all the time.  It&#x27;s because I use this amazing lotion.  It&#x27;s highly moisturizing, absorbs quickly, and of course smells great.  I usually hate fruit scented products (I don&#x27;t want to smell like food thankyouverymuch) but this is a very light and clean albeit sweet scent.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> love everything about this cream, love the fragrances, the original scent is my favorite. Will definetally be trying other Hempz products</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It has made my skin the softest of any lotion I have ever used and I no longer have dry skin. I have had so many many people tell me how soft my skin is; friends, doctors, husband, hair stylist, men who accidentally brushed up against me.😏</li>
    <li> Great size lotion bottle and good smelling. Doesn&#x27;t make your skin soft or anything, but it&#x27;s a good quality lotion.</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever!!!! My skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Love the way this lotion smells and is wonderful on my skin.</li>
    <li> Has a nice light scent and is a high quality moisturizer that feels great on the skin. It does not have a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Love that this lotion does not leave you feeling greasy and the scent is fresh but not overpowering. The original formula is still my favorite but the pomegranate has a refreshing feel.</li>
    <li> I received a sample in a gift bag over the holidays. It lasts for a long time and smells great!!!! I work in the medical field and need something light in scent and will keep me moisturized...thankfully Amazon had it at a lower price than in my local stores so now I can enjoy a larger bottle!!!!! Yay Amazon!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It smells great and it&#x27;s very easily and fast absorbed in your skin.  I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
    <li> Very Happy with the Service &amp; product. Will order again when it is empty.</li>
    <li> quick shipping and delivery, great smell, fast absorbing, moisturizing, excellent price</li>
    <li> OMG! This is the best lotion I have ever bought! My skin was dry, itchy, driving me crazy! Ordered this, within a couple of weeks, it looks, feels so much better! And the scent, pomegranate, wow! Even my husband, who is completely clueless and don&#x27;t notice nothing, remarks how great it smells! Wish they&#x27;d make a body spray with this scent!!</li>
    <li> My manicurist uses this and I loved it.  Soaks in quickly and smells great.  I was able to find it recently at our local TJ Maxx.  Price was a little cheaper there, but either way it is a nice hand/body lotion.</li>
    <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I guess you could say I&#x27;m pretty picky about my lotions. I use to use Olay because it was not greasy and hydrated my skin the best. I bought this product because of the wonderful review. It by far tops any lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Wonderful product and would recommend to everyone &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love the product&lt;br /&gt;But I had to throw it out the cap came off and the lotion was all over inside the plastic wrap and the wrapping had a hole in it and it was all absorbed into the card board packaging.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes so well! Love it so much. It doesn&#x27;t smell that much like pomegranate though; I wish it had a better scent.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful and the delivery center earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> Subtle but lovely smell, keeps skin moisturized without that greasy residual. Bottle came wrapped in plastic and properly shut. Absolutely love this brand</li>
    <li> i love this lotion but i like the regular scent better,i gave this to my mom she loves it alot</li>
    <li> This moisturizer really absorbs into the skin leaving smooth, soft hands&lt;br /&gt;with neither dryness nor a film.  The fragrance is mild, almost un-noticeable unless hands are brought to the face.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first and only moisturizer/lotion that I have felt &amp;#34;did the job&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon, especially, is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> Cannot tell if this product is watered down or a complete counterfeit. Completely different viscosity from previous orders of same lotion</li>
    <li> Very happy with this lotion. It smells good and has a nice application texture. It does keep the hands very smooth and looking healthy. For those who don&#x27;t like &amp;#34;greasy feeling&amp;#34; lotions, you might want to try something else.</li>
    <li> Such a great lotion! The smell is subtle and floral which is nice to wear as a daily lotion. Pump is easy and stands up well. The lotion is very moisturizing even in the winter months, and it also absorbs quickly. I used this throughout my pregnancy and had very little skin discomfort or stretch marks. I will continue to purchase this and completely recommend this for others!</li>
    <li> Fell in love with a sample of this in the pomegranate scent</li>
    <li> The product itself is excellent. I&#x27;ve used it for a long time. I was a little nervous about the pomegranate but when I got it and opened it up I was very pleased with it. The smell is noticeable without being overwhelming. It helps my dry skin, especially my hands. I love the lotion. The only issue I have is with the bottle. The pump is broken on both of the bottles I bought. When I push the nozzle down, it pops and the lotion comes out of the base of the pump (at the top of the part that screws onto the bottle), instead of the nozzle. I just used the pump from the empty bottle I had before. No big thing. All in all it&#x27;s a great company and a great product.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a sample of pomegranate lotion from a different manufacturer and I loved the scent. I searched for another pomegranate lotion and found Hemptz. I&#x27;ve had this lotion brand used on me in salons for pedicures but never bought any for myself. Now its my new favorite. It’s a great moisturizer and smells fantastic. I love it and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Purchased this lotion after trying it at my office.  A co-worker received a bottle as a gift and I asked to try some.  Lotion is thick and creamy and smells absolutely divine!  Before getting back to my desk, I had purchased a bottle on Amazon with my phone I loved it so much.  Arrived 2 days later (thanks Amazon Prime) and still love it!</li>
    <li> smells great love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Your skin feels so soft after you use this even once. It even helped with my patches of psoriasis!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I get very dry, itchy skin in the winter. I won a sample if this lotion at a raffle and will never go back to &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; lotions again. Definitely recommend to anyone, dry skin or not.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! It smells great and works great. It&#x27;s thick but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. I use it everyday after I shower and after using this product I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch to another product.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Makes your skin soft, smells good, light, and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the lotion, but the pump broke within MINUTES of opening it. It&#x27;s a huge bummer that I have to open up the bottle and wipe the wand on my hand...</li>
    <li> Smells so good and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light weight, not greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t over powering yet it adds a nice touch to your natural body &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this! The scent is my favorite and it was a bit cheaper than getting it at the beauty supply shop near me. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever found.  My skin is so soft and the wrinkles on my arms have seemed to disapear.  I use it on my upper chest to keep the wrinkles away too.</li>
    <li> I had been given a smaller size of this lotion and reluctantly had used the last smidge in the purse size bottle. I saw this large size and ordered it. The scent is wonderful and the lotion is very moisturizing. The package came right on time and was packaged well. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed using it every day. So glad that a friend introduced me to this lotion. I have problems with certain scents, but not this one! It isn&#x27;t a strong fruity scent at all.... Not exactly sure what it smells like.... but it is a light, delightful scent that smells good enough to eat. Each time you see the bottle, you&#x27;ll want to put more of it on!</li>
    <li> Hempz lotion is great. Moisturizes without leaving that nasty greasy feeling. The pomegranate is a nice fruity smell without being too strong.</li>
    <li> Great!!!  Especially since it comes in good scents.  Highly recommend getting this for a female friend that could use a really good lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven... and it is so soft and silky on my skin</li>
    <li> used to buying the regular non scented version.  But I smelled this at Ulta (which they have selling for $23!!!) and it smelled really nice.  I love this, especially at this price.</li>
    <li> my favorite lotion brand! goes on so smooth and has a light scent</li>
    <li> Great price and quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smells really good. I think it might help against my acne. But I haven&#x27;t found the right scrub yet. My skin does feel smoother when i use it. Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> overall good lotion. but i was hoping it would go smoother and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;love the smell and after feeling though..</li>
    <li> The girl that gives me manicures was using this on my hands, so I ordered it. It is Wonderful and smells terrific. My hands are very dry and this takes care of that problem and isn&#x27;t greasy. I LOVE THIS!!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice light pomegranate scent. Very moisturizing and easy to apply. Will order more soon. Currently my most favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> Best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever purchased.... Ever. Its rich and creamy and has a nice feminine scent. Get it!</li>
    <li> L--o--v--e this lotion.  It has a light  &amp; pleasant scent and moisturizes all day long.  Love the other scents just as much. I buy what&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as scheduled</li>
    <li> Its a great price and awesome product.</li>
    <li> Great body lotion with w protective cover that leaves sh&#x3D;weet softness.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, smells so good and it dries up quickly! Will continue to use and buy this body lotion. Thank you amazon</li>
    <li> Saw this product in a salon, saved $6.00 ordering from Amazon and I have prime so shipping was free.  Got it on time.  Love the lotion not greasy.  Don&#x27;t have to wipe my hands on a towel after I use.  Keeps my hands soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I layer a generous amount of this lotion all around my cuticles and fingernails, let it soak for about 5 min, it really helps with the dry cuticles.</li>
    <li> Okay...bizarre, but I&#x27;m in love with cream...this cream. I, personally, love the delicate fragrance, not overbearing. Love the way it feels, love that it&#x27;s not &#x27;sticky&#x27;...I hate &#x27;sticky&#x27;! The bottle is a good shape, doesn&#x27;t tip over easily. The cream is a delightful soft PINK...how good does it get? And, I buy everything Pomegranate that I can find...juice, deodorant, lotion, soap, etc. because of the health benefits demonstrated in scientific studies too numerous to mention. As far as the hemp ingredient, I have to assume this contributes to the good &#x27;feel&#x27; that this cream has, and it at least gives another financial outlet for hemp in addition to rope and dope...I believe this is a good thing, because the dope is detrimental to human brain chemistry and human bodies. The dispenser plunger works great, too...just mentioned this because sometimes these things can be sooo annoying. Overall, everything is good including the price for this large bottle and shipping.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and use it daily.  It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy, has a pleasant fragrance, and works well.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t always leave about 1&amp;#34; of lotion at the bottom of the container, because the lotion is too thick to flow and the pick-up tube is too short.  This makes it a waste or a PITA to get the last of it.</li>
    <li> Great ! Second time I&#x27;ve ordered this , very nice and smells great .</li>
    <li> Great feel with no oily feeling after. Smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really good. It&#x27;s fast absorbing and it has a soothing scent. I would recommend it to anyone that likes pomegranate flavor.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. It&#x27;s a sweet smell. Not over bearing, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like some lotions, and makes your skin soft :3 I would recommend and I will definitely be buying this product again and others.</li>
    <li> best scented moisturizer for the price</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer in the world with a lite pomegranate scent.  Not greasy, moisturizing to the max!!  Great pricing too!</li>
    <li> I am not a pomegraaite junkie at all, but I love love love this scent.  It makes my skin really soft and the scent is pleasant.  Not overpowering like Bath and Body shop products.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion after every tanning session.  It cools and soothes my skin immediately.  It goes on smooth and is not one bit greasy so you can put your clothes on right after.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion because it is not overbearing and I like how smooth it makes my skin feel! It is a great product and a good price!</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever used! A little expensive but worth every penny! I will never use anything else</li>
    <li> I am in loveee!... I have found my favorite body cream!. The smells is unbelievable. The consistency is lovely. It absorbs to the skin super fast and it leaves the skin shinny and soft. I will be repurchasing this on and on!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have psoriasis really bad so I have to keep my skin hydrated at all times and for some reason every single type of lotion I use burns my skin even the ones for psoriasis and eczema and sensitive skin. Hempz is the only lotion I can use because of the natural herbal hemp oil. Doesn&#x27;t have all that fake stuff in it. So I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and love the way it makes my hands feel soft, and does not leave a greasy film once it&#x27;s applied.  The Pomegranate fragrance is not over powering.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion ever. It soothes and smoothes the skin without feeling greasy, and does not leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on the skin. It is also one of the very few lotions on the market that I am NOT allergic to. I love that I only have to buy about 1 bottle per year, and I&#x27;m thrilled that Amazon carries it for about 1/2 the price the salon charges for the same size bottle. And it&#x27;s getting harder to find a salon that carries more than the travel size bottle, so I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on Amazon to make sure they keep it in stock! I also really like that this lotion has very little smell, due to the fact of not having added perfumes or dyes. Any color in the lotion is simply from the pomegranate or cucumbers or other such things that naturally have a color and are used to make the lotion. I will buy Hempz lotion for years to come!</li>
    <li> I love hempz. I love hemp products in general. My only complaint is the polysorbate. We try to avoid it as I believe it&#x27;s linked to infertility but it&#x27;s in everything. I don&#x27;t use it on my toddler and don&#x27;t use it on the bottom of my feet or my breasts because I believe it&#x27;s harmful. If Hempz would remove that I would buy 10 of these because it smells good and it leave my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Hempz lotion. This pomegranate scent is amazing. The product arrived in great condition (the top wasn&#x27;t broken off or anything like that, I&#x27;ve had experiences where they break off during the car ride from the store to home, but that was certainly not the case here.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this same product before and it arrived safely.  This time it came in a new type of packaging and one of the two bottles had a broken pump.  I was going to give this as a gift but didn&#x27;t have time to exchange it.  I thought I had an old bottle that I could use the pump and replace the broken one.  I didn&#x27;t.  So, now I don&#x27;t know what to do with this.  If I return it, it will continue to leak out. I hope you will reconsider the type of packaging you put this in.  Sent me a new pump!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! BEST LOTION! I don&#x27;t buy anything other than HEMPZ. Once you try it you won&#x27;t be able to go back to the crappy lotion they sell at super stores.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the satiny feel. Hempz is not greasy, which is what I look for in a moisturizer. Gold stars all around.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin and nothing helps... use this moisturizer its wonderful and smells great!!!  :-)  This is a must buy for everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Hampz for several years.  My mom was given a bottle as a gift and I tried it and was immediately hooked.  Very nice lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It smells so good and does wonders for my skin! I love using it after tanning! I recommend you go buy! Cheaper on amazon then in salons!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin so I have to be picky about what lotion I put on my face &amp; this works wonders and doesn&#x27;t break you out. I even had a terrible sunburn on my face where it was peeling &amp; this lotion helped it recover in just a day &amp; it smells amazing! (:</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave you hands feeling greasy.  I would recommend this lotion to anyone who has a problem with dry hands.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion! I love all of the fragrances, but I would say that the Pomegranate and Vanilla Plum are my favorite. It&#x27;s a great lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave a film or oil. Great for after shaving your legs, or just for casual use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite a while and absolutely love it.  The fragrance lingers on your skin for such a long time and is so pleasant.  It softens beautifully.  The site I usually purchase this thru no longer carried the Hempze so was tickled pink to find it on Amazon and for such a decent price.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer I use when we go skiing because it goes on like silk and stays in your skin with a delicious light fragrance and NO greasiness.</li>
    <li> This product arrived with in a week of ordering and i absolutely love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Ulta is selling this for over 30 dollars its such a great price online and smells amazing it comes in a nice size bottle too!</li>
    <li> First let me preface my review by saying 5 stars for the product. For anyone that has never heard or tried this line, take the leap of faith. That said, I stumbled on this product in our local TJ Maxx and thought I would try it for much less than advertised here on Amazon.  For me using a daily skin moisturizer is part of my daily routine, whether anti-aging or for care or the skin in general.  Well since any savvy shopper knows, TJ Maxx or any of the sister stores don&#x27;t always have or stock items that you find there, so thought Amazon would stock, and of course they list many vendors.  This product is well worth the purchase, does not go on greasy or make you feel slimy like some higher end products. The smell is amazing, and your skin will absorb rapidly.  Would recommend for dry/normal skin, for me this is one of the better moisturizers.  As a side note: after continued daily use for 7 months have noticed my skin is softer healthier looking, even has helped with chicken skin, the bumps on the back of my arms. Can&#x27;t give an actual testimonial but for me this has worked.  As for the seller I always try to write a fair  review, so others can decide. There are many vendors for this product, so my review is for &amp;#34;MyBeautyCenter&amp;#34; aka or dba Cosmetic Center.  The product arrived in a USPS mailer bag folded over, opened the bag to find the product was not wrapped the nozzle was broken off and the lotion spilled/emptied completely,  Contacted the seller and they made it right, asked for photos which I honored. All in all will consider ordering from this vendor in the future, positive and pleasant customer response.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Especially this time of year when my skin gets so dry. This product has a lovely scent and is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I opened the package and lotion was everywhere I am disappointed so much product was wasted I was going to use as a gift and now have to find something different.</li>
    <li> Great Smell That Last For Hours. Im Love With It.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion exclusively for the last 2.5 years and I still have not found another product that compares. the scent is so nice I have received so many compliments. I have a bottle on my desk at work and all my coworkers stop by to use it because it is the best! i have psoriasis one my hands and use this lotion without pain and stinging. best of all it doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy or uncomfortable. on top of me buying bottles, it&#x27;s become a tradition for family members to gift to me for the holidays. I love hempz!!</li>
    <li> This is nice, I like Hempz brand and it has a nice light scent.  However, the pump did not work from day 1, so I&#x27;m not happy with that.  I have to keep the lid unscrewed and use it that way.  I should have returned it, but didn&#x27;t want to bother.  I hope this was an isolated incident!</li>
    <li> Seems watered down. I have ordered this before and it was more creamy. It makes me think they are adding water to save money.</li>
    <li> I love Hempz, but some of their lotions are just too strongly scented, including the Pomegranate. I do find it to be nourishing to my skin and the effects last for quite a while. I will continue to purchase Hempz products, including the Pomegranate, but I do hope they ease up on some of the potent scents.</li>
    <li> Love how well the lotion works but the pomegranate does NOT smell good. get the original or the vanilla plum not this one in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for myself but it is such a hit in the household that my husband has taken over the use of this lotion.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this lotion and it smells great so i am happy also.. It seems to work her hands feel like silk.</li>
    <li> Got a sample size one year as a stocking stuffer, have used it ever since - I absolutely love this lotion! Smells great, absorbs completely without feeling greasy, seems to last longer than other lotions.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product.  I had received a small bottle from my hair stylist at Christmas, so I was already familiar with the scent and texture. I live in a dry climate and can never overdo on moisturizers! This product is wonderful and is rich and creamy...I recommend it to anyone, who wants to improve their skin condition.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest lotion in the World. My daughters, some of their friends and myself absolutely LOVE IT !  Nowadays with all the Parabens, sulphates and other junk in the lotions it&#x27;s refreshing to have one like this with more natural and less harming ingredients.  I will continue to purchase it .  It was very expensive at first  when I found it  in a Beauty supply a couple of years ago.  But I am so thankful that I found it on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion. Nice fragrance. Non-greasy and absorbs quickly. Have used this lotion for a couple of years and haven&#x27;t found a better product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Moisturizer it smells good and it works. I tan and every night before bed I put this on ... It is the best I love it.</li>
    <li> love love love this is love in a bottel first shipment did not get for some reason but seller was quick to send me a replacement with no problems I would recomend to everyone</li>
    <li> Great product, smells amazing and very moisturizing. This and the original are my favorite hempz products. I will be buying more when it runs out!</li>
    <li> I love Hempz original all around. I was disappointed with the smell of this product. I also have sensitive skin and this stung whereas the original never does.  I won&#x27;t order this scent again.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Only other place I have ever found this lotion is at Younkers for more than double the price!</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful. It leaves my skin feeling fantastic plus it has a great, light scent. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing great moisterisure I always get compliments and its a great price :D</li>
    <li> This ia one of the best moisturizers I have tried so far. No harmful chemicals and great for sensitive skin. Also used it as facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Quick delivery too. Thanks</li>
    <li> I like the hand lotion but when I sent the review back when I got it I had told them that the bottles were coming busted.  I even sent pictures but never heard from Amazon.  Will not order them again</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My mom gave this to me as it was recommended to her by a woman who used it during her previous pregnancies for stretch marks and has none present today. It has a pleasant scent (as most lotions and perfumes are much too strong for my sensitive nose in this pregnancy).  It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or too thick. It also really helps with the itchiness of my stretch marks. Hands down my favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> it was exactly what i wanted! Thank you for offering it at a great price! Would buy again and will buy again when im out</li>
    <li> Smells great. Moisturizes amazingly. I go tanning 1-3 days a week, without this product i wouldnt be able to go more than once!&lt;br /&gt;This evens out the tan and takes away the redness from the skin!&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED FOR EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> Great product and the delivery was fast. I love the Hempz brand and would buy for this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice pleasant lotion but i prefer the original formula.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on Amazon after testing it at Ulta. The same size was $23.00. I am pleased with the product and would order it again. The shipper packaged it carefully and it arrived intact without leakage and earlier than stated. I know smell is a personal thing so, test them and then find the best price. After searching, the best price was on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Most scented moisturizers are too scented; this one is a mild scent and a very nice moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful and smells divine. I especially like having the pump.&lt;br /&gt;I am already running out and will need more.</li>
    <li> left my skin feeling very soft and moursurized, I&#x27;m in the sun alot so I applied morining and night. I could tell a difference in my skin after only 2 days of use.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! I purchased it to help maintain my tan and although I&#x27;m still tanning regularly, it seems to do the job. It smells wonderful and my skin stays hydrated with this lotion hours after I apply it. I will definitely be purchasing this again. May even try the other scents out next time!</li>
    <li> It is a good dry skin lotion. I did order it a second time but found one locally that I like better.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful.  I especially like using the sugar scrub in the shower and applying the lotion afterward. It&#x27;s a recipe for great feeling skin.  I have super dry skin and this makes my skin feel great.  😄</li>
    <li> smells great, have really dry skin, this takes care of any skin issues I&#x27;ve had. plenty of different scents to choose from</li>
    <li> I was first interested in this product when I used it at the tanning salon I go to. Apparently it&#x27;s really good for after you tan. However, at the tanning salon it was selling for $22 and found it much cheaper on amazon. Glad I bought it! Makes my skin smell delicious and feel really soft. Not oily at all.</li>
    <li> The package arrived in good condition</li>
    <li> I absolutely LoVE hempz pomegranate lotion. I&#x27;ve never experienced a lotion like this before. Past lotions have been either too light, smelled too strong, or not offering enough moisture for my skin throughout the day. I always look forward to using it after a shower. The smell is sweet, delicate, and not very powerful. The way it absorbs quickly on my skin is a dream, because I am a busy student who needs to dress up quick in the mornings. Love it so much, will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Hempz is my favorite moisturizer!  Great price</li>
    <li> the scent is nice, but i find the lotion to not last long, i live in germany and i dont know what it is about the water here but it dries me out so so bad, and i have to end up applying this lotion 5 times atleast a day to my arms and hads cause my skin dries out fast sigh. but overall the smell is really nice</li>
    <li> Bought it for a christmas gift for my wife and it&#x27;s half gone because she loves using it! She likes the scent and loves how quickly it absorbs, not leaving her skin feeling weird.</li>
    <li> I order this lotion regularly and always try to keep it stocked... I switched over from using Soap &amp; Glory&#x27;s The Righteous Body Butter lotion ;)</li>
    <li> I love the size of that lotion and how it simply disappears in the skin, leaving it soft. Good moisturizer and the pump works great when you need only a tiny bit. However, I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent. It&#x27;s fruity (which I generally like) but instead of smelling just fresh, it&#x27;s kind of heavy. Well, I am quite sensitive to the aromas since I never wear perfumes and am therefore able to notice subtle details of the scent.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried when I ordered this because a few people had said that their bottle broke in the mail. When i received mine I was so happy because it was still great packaging! Also the lotion is amazing, very hydrating and really does make it so I don&#x27;t have to reapply lotion during the day. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion! It smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling great.  The price is better than in stores.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it makes your skin so very soft. I use it after I shower and after tanning - I can&#x27;t say that it helped my tan any but it makes my skin feel so satiny soft - LOVE that!</li>
    <li> this moisturizer is great for dry skin &amp; it has a great scent hempz is a great moisturizer once you try it you will be hooked</li>
    <li> Best lotion - doesnt feel sticky and keeps skin moist - wont use any other lotion now</li>
    <li> The pump was broken when I received the item.</li>
    <li> What I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. The smell is subtle but delicious and it soaks right into my skin. It goes on light, not heavy like some lotions. I can get dressed within a minute or two of putting it on and not worry about getting heavy lotion all over my clothes. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This was a gift to me - and I am very pleased with it.  This is the first time I have used this product but will not hesitate to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me and I am glad or I would have never tried it.  I love it and will buy more as gifts for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old man and I really like this lotion, it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling too oily, it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and it really helps my dry skin after a hot shower. Although it does smell kind of girly, however my girlfriend loves the smell of it and wants to kiss me even more after I use it on my face. Double win &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a review on here saying something like... &amp;#34;this lotion is fake, they put different lotion in this hemp bottle and re-sell it&amp;#34;. While I don&#x27;t know anything about all that, even if it&#x27;s true, this lotion is still epic and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Softens like no other.  So glad that I found HEMPZ.  I use it after the shower and it keeps me soft.</li>
    <li> love this moisturizer. makes skin so soft. Smells good also. Isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy. I suggest everyone to try this.</li>
    <li> This lotion IS authentic as I can smell the original scent undertones of this lotion. I was worried I was going to get a fake after reading reviews on other Hempz products sold online but now I&#x27;m completely at ease because I have the original from the salon and compared the scents minus the pomegranate. The only thing I&#x27;m questioning is the thickness of it. It does seem a little thinner than the original. However, my original bottle is several years old. It goes on nice and smooth and absorbs very quickly. I just put it on not 5 minutes ago and my skin is already soft and the lotion is dry and smells great! After a few minutes I smell the original scent more than the pomegranate and it&#x27;s light and feminine and not to overpowering. I hope this helps anyone who was worried about getting a bottle of this and was concerned it was fake because this is the real deal at a great price! I will absolutely buy again!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a very lovely scent and a dainty light pink color.  The bottle comes completely full and it is easy to dispense the lotion.  The lotion absorbs very easily and leaves my skin very supple.  I gave the item four stars because I have to use more of the lotion since it absorbs so easily (I have very dry skin).  Overall a nice product.</li>
    <li> FOR ME THIS IS THE PERFECT BODY/HAND LOTION THAT ACTUALLY PROTECTS MY ITCY HANDS!  I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANY OTHER BRAND!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Hempz products at the salon before and have always been impressed. This is a very nice body lotion that noticeably improves the texture of the skin.  One or two small pumps is enough to lotion an entire arm and the lotion just glides over the skin, but also lasts for most of the day, making the skin feel silky.  There is also a noticeable texture difference in the lower layers of the skin.  This pomegranate smell is pleasant- floral and fruity- and not overpowering.  I am very pleased with this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and this stuff is wonderful for my skin. Super stuff, would like to buy more when I run out!</li>
    <li> This lotion spells so good! I love that it is thick enough to moisturize but it absorbs so fast. Doesnt make my hands greasy afterwards either.</li>
    <li> My order came quickly and the lotion was as I expected. It has a nice fragrance. It soaks into skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite Hempz product. My wife has been using Hempz for years and she gave it thumbs down.</li>
    <li> Really love this lotion.  It is an excellent product.  Works well and keeps your skin very soft in our cold climate.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve used so far, and I&#x27;ve used many lotions. I first bought this lotion at my beauty supply house and the price was cheaper using this seller, but I had to pay $5.95 shipping which surpassed the price at my supply house. I received the lotion sooner than expected, but it was freezing outside and the plastic top broke off as soon as I pumped the first pump. I can still use the pump, but it&#x27;s messy. Will buy from my supply house in the future unless I can get free shipping.</li>
    <li> I love these moisturizers! These were on sale just after Christmas so I stocked up. They arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I tried the Pomegranate lotion by Hempz and instantly fell in love. The scent is great (not too overpowering, and not weird like other pomegranate scents that I&#x27;ve tried). It soaked into my skin wonderfully. It costs about $23 at Ulta, so really a steal to get it here on Amazon! I only smelled the Citrus one at Ulta, and it smelled wonderful too!</li>
    <li> I love all Hempz products! I have only used their regular Hempz body lotion in the past but I am glad I decided to order the pomegranate scent because it smells great! I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve used a different scent lotion by Hempz before and really liked it. I was worried about this one because some of the reviews said that it smelled bad. I took the risk anyway, and I am happy with what I got. The smell is sweet, not fruity or really flowery, but nice. Even a little more mellow than what I was expecting from reading the comments. I now use it everyday and have received several comments of smelling good when I show up for work. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I would buy another scent from Hempz when this one runs out, which looks like it should be a few months from now. I still have a ton left.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! Makes your skin so soft and smells good!</li>
    <li> Totally love this product.  Also go the Pomegranate Body Butter which is also awesome.  This is the third type I&#x27;ve had (Pineapple Lily and Spun Sugar also great).  I&#x27;m sticking with this product!&lt;br /&gt;Tamara</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  My hands get dry and split around the nails every winter.  After using this lotion frequently during the day, my splits healed up in just a few days.  I also love it because I work on the computer everyday and the lotion absorbs quickly and does not stay greasy on my hands.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful!  Smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling super soft.  I love all of the natural ingredients too.  I would highly recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> Great lotion.. Use it to massages my wife&#x27;s feet and she loves it. Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry up fast.  A little goes a long way. Would recommend to anyone needing a moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Such an excellent price compared to what my salon charges!! I will be purchasing this online as long as I can!! The price was so good that I was able to get some for myself and also as Christmas gifts!</li>
    <li> Love this and the fragrance.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and the package was intact. The moisturizer works great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has had issues with their skin due to the rough winter. It brings back your glow and it&#x27;s absorbs very fast.</li>
    <li> I use this brand of lotion all the time at work. It is usually very thick and creamy. I was disappointed that the lotion I received from this seller was watery....as if it was watered down.</li>
    <li> Seems to be authentic and it smells nice. Came from Deva Concepts.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion and it goes on real nice, makes skin soft and gets rid of dry spots. Would buy no other</li>
    <li> Hempz is my favorite lotion. I live too far away from a beauty supply house to get it there at cost, but this price was pretty complarable to what I can get it at as a nail tech.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  The fragrance is light and wonderful and the lotion keeps my skin soft and smooth all day long.  I bought the gallon container and use it to refill the bottles I have at home and work.</li>
    <li> Not greasy or heavy and I like including natural ingredients into my beauty products. Much better price here than in stores! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Love the lotion, the frangrance isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
    <li> Hempz is incredible! Where other lotions take 5 pumps to moisturize my hands hempz takes only one! I hear that the original scent smells better but my guess is that is just personal preference. Either way I plan to try it!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion for everyday use the smell is light not overpowering. It is a thicker lotion but skin absorbs it so nice,not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many lotions and this is the only one I have found that works and pricing is affordable</li>
    <li> Love the light pomegranite fragrance.  Very nice smell and feels wonderful on the skin!  Will most certainly order this item again!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so clean and it actually moisturizes. It&#x27;s not watery and cheap this is the real deal period! If you are a dry and have a hard time funding great smelling lotions that work. Purchase this one because it does the job period.</li>
    <li> The smell is good but the lack of greasiness and the good moisturizing power makes this stuff usable by my man hands.</li>
    <li> We have used the Hempz Pomegranate Herbal Moisturizer for several years now.  It is the best moisturizing lotion we have found.  My husband makes sure we have it on hand at all times, and especially in winter.</li>
    <li> I was NOT impressed when i recieved by Hempz Pomegranate Herbal Moisturizer from Green Webz Inc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to recieve my package. However, upon opening it and taking out the lotion, I discovered something unacceptable.  The pump was detached from the cove and pulled out slightly, and some of the potion was caked onto the pump and some of the packaging.  I was also unimpressed when I went to return the item and discovered that it is not eligible for return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, however, I contacted Amazon through their &#x27;chat&#x27; option.  I explained the situation, and after looking into it for a minute or two, they got back to me and told me they would give me a full refund.  I am not pleased with Gree Webs Inc., however I thank Amazon for their help.</li>
    <li> Thought this product would be all natural it has too many ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce and if I can&#x27;t pronounce it I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Bought this a while back.  Keep thinking I&#x27;ll grow to use it.  It&#x27;s scent is too sweet for me.  I put it in my guest bathroom, but likely it will get thrown out eventually.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion in the citrus scent. This scent was nice, but I like the other better. It does absorb very quickly and I feel moisturized hours later. Also nice that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergy prone skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very refreshing, smells absolutely wonderful, and truly moisturizes my hands.</li>
    <li> I always use this after I shower....love how it makes my skin feel.  great scent as well...will definately buy again</li>
    <li> Great product, smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling so soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very effective, thicker lotion.  Perfect for winter and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.</li>
    <li> good stuff when it is a prime item</li>
    <li> Good lotion for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this cream daily for dry skin in winter.  It really seems to help much more than other kinds I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love the hempz brand. Ultra moisturizing &amp; has a fresh light scent. I was excited to get my order but unfortunately the plastic pump was broken &amp; the bottle was cracked, resulting in a large amount of lotion leaking out. I was extremely disappointed &amp; ended up scooping what I could out of the broken bottle &amp; putting it in another container.</li>
    <li> This is the beet lotion I have ever used. It keeps my skin from getting dry without being greasy. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion!</li>
    <li> Great item. Quickly shipped.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scent plus texture and rate of absorption without feeling greasy, absolutely love it and u will too.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic and makes hands/legs soft that have a problem with dryness</li>
    <li> Love the Lotion, it smells so good and leaves your skin re-hydrated!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  The fragrance is not overwhelming but very pleasant.  It really helps dry cracked hands and&lt;br /&gt;does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and is the best lotion I have ever used. We live in a dry climate and this stuff does the job.</li>
    <li> I have severely dry skin and have tried many lotions. This is the best lotion ever! It is so moisturizing but does not leave a greasy feeling. It also smells amazing but not overpowering. I love this lotion!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and smells great! Perfect for post-tanning bed :)</li>
    <li> Ridiculous! I get it in the mail today and the lotion is all in the bag and barely any in the bottle.. wtf? I WANT A REFUND!</li>
    <li> Product was rcvd in the wrong amt (short one) however, once reported, they were very very quick to correct their mistake. This kind of service is rare these days! Would recommend! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this all the time.  My nail salon charges twice this amount.  Will definately be buying more thru Amazon once it&#x27;s needed</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! It&#x27;s light but not to light also seems to hydrated well.</li>
    <li> Works well. Great transaction. Item as described.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. the smell is amazing and it leaves absolutely no greasy feel like some other lotions that are out there</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS LOTION!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to not be able to get this thinking that it was too expensive since I would normally buy it at other stores.... They usually charged around $20 for one bottle! But amazon has it for around $10??!?!?! Oh yes. Love the lotion. Like the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will forever and always rebuy this lotion!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nothing very special about the lotion.  I want organic products and I sometimes get bamboozled by what the front of the bottle says.  It also smells a little too strong.  I&#x27;m more of an earth tone scent person, lavender or sandalwood.  This is much more of a strong floral scent than I wanted it to be.</li>
    <li> My lotions came packaged well, and I had no doubt that they were genuine and not rip-offs. I really like how this lotion feels and I like the scent. Yeah, maybe a guy would not want this lotion because of it&#x27;s kinda floral/fruity scent. I think this was a good price and was happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> First found this item in Marshalls and tried it, fell in love with the product.  Went onto Amazon to buy more at a discount price.  This product has a wonderful smell and leaves your skin silky soft.  I am a 52 year old female and I apply this product to my whole body (except face) after my shower.  I love the smell and the way is feels on my skin.  My hubby of 25 years has stated on many times how incrediably soft my skin is, making me a frequent buyer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it was but the lotion ended up feeling sticky and greasy. The smell is fantastic and seems to work well as a moisturizer but I didn&#x27;t finish the whole bottle because of the greasy feel of it. Maybe to much coconut oil or something. If it wasn&#x27;t for that it would have 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The lotion is great. Smells good and absorbs fast. But the last time I ordered was a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hemps lotion bottle from the info printed on the back. This new bottle has a hot pink pump so I know it&#x27;s not an original hemp brand with the black pump. Also the back of the new bottle has lots of different language sentences.  I&#x27;m confused ): is this product fake?!</li>
    <li> Smells soooo gooodddd. I have really sensative skin and this feels amazing on it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate any sensative spots on my skin.</li>
    <li> got this for my sister - she loves it too</li>
    <li> This lotion has got to be the best lotion I have ever used. I choose Pomegranate. Softens my skin like never before. Wonderful citrus smell. I have brought 10 bottles already and plan to share.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and it comes quickly</li>
    <li> This Hempz Pomegranate lotion has a soft scent that is not overpowering. It is not a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; or \\&quot;perfume-y\\&quot; scent. To me, it smells much better than the \\&quot;Original\\&quot; Hempz lotion. It is an excellent moisturizer; it prevents itchiness even in the dry Midwestern winters.</li>
    <li> nothing too special just a nice smell</li>
    <li> I love this lotion until I get to the bottom of the bottle. It is hard to get out so you have to turn upside down to get the rest of the lotion out. Otherwise it is the best lotion I use.</li>
    <li> Wonderful price for this product. I use a lot of hemp lotion so it&#x27;s nice to find a great deal.</li>
    <li> Good lot in at a great price. Much cheaper than buying in the salons.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this lotion. It smells great and to top it off it makes my hands feel great. It&#x27;s not too greasy which I LOVE! Definitely worth what I payed for, maybe even more. I am completely satisfied :)</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer that I have ever found.  Sells for much more in the mall shops.  I use this all the time and have recommended this to my friends,....they all love it.  Great after tanning too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years now. I love the smell and more I love the non greasy way it moistens my hands. I use it at least twice a day. Most lotions I can&#x27;t do anything for a while until it dries...this soaks in right away.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 1. Because it was cheaper than anywhere else and 2. Because my mother wanted this more than her lexus dream car! I made her a gift basket and gave it to her on my birthday as a thank u to giving birth to me. Once she saw the lotion I new she couldn&#x27;t ask for a better daughter. It came slightly.damaged but I easily fixed it and my mother never even notice ;-) thanks hempz!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product ! Thanks !</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful...very smooth and silky with a wonderful smell.  No worries about greasiness or that &amp;#34;too sweet&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> The lotion goes a long way so a little is really a lot! Smells great too!</li>
