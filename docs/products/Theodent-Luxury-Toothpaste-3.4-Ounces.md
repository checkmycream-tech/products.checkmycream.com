      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>

      <li>By far the best toothpaste I have ever used!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to drink orange juice afterwards without that wierd after-taste.</li>
      <li>Best of all you are able to taste food like normal afterwards, and there is no sensitivity on the tongue.</li>
      <li>It tastes nothing like chocolate, with a pleasant mild, minty taste.  </li>
      <li>Which is a huge plus!</li>
      <li>Guess I need to do more research on that.  </li>

      <li>I also would like to mention that I did, during this year, floss much more than I have had so that also had an impact to the no cavities situation.</li>

      <li>It works better on my teeth than the crest pro health series.</li>

      <li>CRAPY top</li>
      <li>Interesting product.</li>
      <li>My favorite toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>#1: If you look at the picture, the toothpaste looks sleek and sexy, but all that goes away when you try and use it.  </li>
      <li>(Make sure you read up</li>
      <li>that my dentist had noticed was better.</li>
      <li>I like have an alternative to the chemicals but more protection than baking soda.</li>
      <li>I love Theodent and will continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>Love the way my teeth feel after using.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s that healthy.</li>
      <li>My family and I love this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re done the flavor doesn&#x27;t linger like most toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the mint.</li>
      <li>I love the way it make my teeth feel &amp;</li>
      <li>Better dental checkups using this.</li>
      <li>Plus, it has free shipping!</li>
      <li>My 2-year-old also uses it and loves it even more than his bubble-gum flouride-free toothepaste.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your teeth feeling very clean and has the added benefit of enamel growth.  </li>
      <li>It is great and is (reportedly) the only toothpaste of its kind.</li>
      <li>Cap is an issue, but it&#x27;s simply the best flouride free toothpaste in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Why is this marketed in a way where the looks of the toothpaste is more important than what&#x27;s in it?</li>
      <li>Most toothpaste is overwhelming to me - it&#x27;s too gooey, too sweet, and too minty.</li>
      <li>so glad Theodent is available.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a great help for my sensitive teeth, too.</li>
      <li>This does not work most of the time because my hand slips off the slippery smooth</li>
      <li>It smells minty clean without being overwhelming in smell or taste.  </li>
      <li>Well, it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
      <li>The taste is spearmint (like the gum) and not too strong.  </li>
      <li>I like the taste as it is not too strong, nor does it burn my mouth or around my lips.  </li>
      <li>Strongly recommend redesign.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a floride free toothpaste that tasted good and really cleaned my teeth without a mighty squeeze to get it out of the tube.  </li>
      <li>It seems to work just fine.  </li>
      <li>My brother is a dentist, and he recommended it to us because it&#x27;s supposed to be twice as effective as fluoride toothpaste without the side effects, and it&#x27;s safe for my 3 yr old to swallow.</li>
      <li>We have been using this fluoride free toothpaste for our toddler.  </li>
      <li>Amazing toothpaste, but cheaper at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste has a light spearmint flavor.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think most of us have done that, because a normal tube of toothpaste works pretty good</li>
      <li>but it looks nice and who really cares.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the price, but purchased it after reading fellow customer reviews.</li>
      <li>but like a light chocolate.</li>
      <li>Kids\\&quot; that is fluoride free and contains calcium.</li>
      <li>This stuff is perfectly minty/white chocolate, but not strong.</li>
      <li>I leaves my teeth smooth, and clean, my mouth minty and even my gums</li>
      <li>You would also think that at $15 a tube that the company could afford packaging designers/engineers who could design a cap and tube that is user friendly.  </li>
      <li>#34;just came from the dentist&amp;#34; clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I stumbled upon Theodent months ago while looking for a fluoride-free, alternative toothpaste and have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It has been great for my sensitivity and has done a fantastic job at whitening my teeth (which says a lot given the fact I drink a lot of coffee). The taste is nice and pleasant but not overpowering like most toothpastes. The packaging alone deserves 5-Stars, it really makes you feel like someone put a lot of time and effort into this product...Theodent by no means comes across as some thrown together toothpaste that offers no value and is just trying to appeal to the fluoride-free crowd. Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been thoroughly impressed by the product and would recommend it to anyone and fully intend on purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;After seeing a few reviews regarding the taste of the toothpaste (especially the spoiled milk claim) I feel compelled to emphasize I think it tastes completely normal and very nice. It is a mint-style flavoring that you&#x27;d expect from a toothpaste that leaves your mouth feeling clean. Frankly, I&#x27;m really not sure where the criticisms over the taste stem from.</li>
    <li> Most toothpaste is overwhelming to me - it&#x27;s too gooey, too sweet, and too minty. I feel like I&#x27;m chewing mint cake frosting every time I brush my teeth with regular toothpaste. Confession: I am sick of gagging every morning noon and night on gross, candy-sweet blue slop. Theodent is a lovely and elegant alternative to standard fluoride toothpastes. I researched and tested toothpastes for months on end before I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theodent toothpaste is THE BEST TOOTHPASTE I have ever tried and fixes all that I find wrong with normal toothpastes:&lt;br /&gt;- Divinely smooth texture not grainy, gritty or sticky&lt;br /&gt;- Mint flavor comes from real mint oil, not some fake radiation-blue dye and artificial flavoring&lt;br /&gt;- whitens teeth and removes surface stains&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t froth uncontrollably - no added chemicals (i.e. no propylene glycol) to make foam&lt;br /&gt;- no fluoride: Theodent uses theobromine (derived from cacao) to protect teeth against cavities with the same efficacy as nasty fluoride and none of the potential health risks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is going to please the picky toothpaste hater in you. I&#x27;ll never go back. Try it.</li>
    <li> Calling it luxury over and over and charging as much as they do...I was unimpressed with the flavor and annoyed with the aftertaste.  I&#x27;d be more impressed with and ADA seal or something more than self proclamations and self funded  studies</li>
    <li> The taste of this toothpaste will keep me coming back for more! This stuff is perfectly minty/white chocolate, but not strong. When you&#x27;re done the flavor doesn&#x27;t linger like most toothpaste. No gross film in my mouth like Toms. It feels \\&quot;soft\\&quot; when I brush and my teeth feel super clean when I&#x27;m done and I can go about my day without any overpowering after taste. Awesome, awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> The product is great. The packaging is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the cap is frustratingly difficult to remove from the tube, even with dry hands. Forget it with wet hands. I usually have to pry my fingernails under the cap to get it off.  Occasionally, I am able to grab the top on the short sides and tilt the cap open. This does not work most of the time because my hand slips off the slippery smooth cap.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, because the cap is difficult to remove, you end up squeezing the plastic cap, which then cracks from top to bottom. You then have a broken cap.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the brown plastic tube does not stay flat after you squeeze the toothpaste out of it. The tube rebounds so you are constantly pushing the toothpaste from one end of the tube to the other every time you brush your teeth. This is a real pain. And because of this, you cannot tell how much toothpaste is left in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Fourthly, toothpaste builds up on the open end of the tube, unless you wipe off the end of the tube every time you use it. Because of the tip design, you cannot just cut off the toothpaste flow with your toothbrush like you can with other toothpaste tubes. You then end up wasting some of this very expensive toothpaste every time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Fifthly and lastly (for now), because the toothpaste builds up on the open end of the tube, it also builds up inside the cap, which you cannot get to with a toothbrush. A Q-tip will not even fit to the very end of the cap to get to the build-up of the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been in contact with company and they have informed me that they are working on their fourth generation cap with incremental improvements. This is their fourth opportunity at fixing the cap?! The Theodent staff and packaging designers/engineers should be required to use this toothpaste twice a day, then maybe they could come up with workable and useable packaging. You would think that with all the PhD&#x27;s and advanced degrees on the board and staff of the company,that they would do some basic focus groups and market testing before launching such botched packaging. You would also think that at $15 a tube that the company could afford packaging designers/engineers who could design a cap and tube that is user friendly.  Hmmm, maybe a screw off cap with grippy ridges like most other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just toothpaste, as far as I can tell.  Still, it&#x27;s good toothpaste and I like it.  I can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about it.  It has a slightly unusual texture, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. No cavities, gum disease, or any other problems. Love the fact that it&#x27;s not too minty or sudsy..</li>
    <li> I spent $12 bucks on toothpaste because my BF is addicted to chocolate. So I figured this would be the perfect gag gift.&lt;br /&gt;Problem is, IT DOESN&#x27;T TASTE LIKE CHOCOLATE.&lt;br /&gt;I put three stars because the product was shipped incredibly fast and it does whiten. The taste is kind of a chalky mint taste. I do like the decadent look of the toothpaste tube. It looks really expensive and would be nice as a display. But if you&#x27;re looking for a chocolate toothpaste, look elsewhere</li>
    <li> Only 1 grocery in our town sells it and it&#x27;s around $10 a tube. It&#x27;s very convenient to buy on Amazon but also pricier. I love the way it make my teeth feel &amp;#34;just came from the dentist&amp;#34; clean. I can&#x27;t stand conventional toothpastes now. They feel so foamy. I also found that after 7-10 days of first using the toothpaste that my sensitivity was gone. Sensodyne just wasn&#x27;t working so glad Theodent is available.</li>
    <li> The taste, and after-taste, was OK but not great.  I do NOT like the packaging - it is not easy to open if 1) your hands are wet or 2) if you have arthritis.</li>
    <li> It works better on my teeth than the crest pro health series. Firstly my breath is death if i do not brush them, i eat massive amounts of aromatic food( on average around 3 bulbs of garlic a day for instance, on top of lots of curry spices and onion). I have been looking for a non fluoride toothpaste for a long time. I found this tooth paste awhile ago at a local health food store, but where offering it at 23 dollars! and eventually stopped carrying it. I then tried a lot of different non fluoride toothpastes, including toms and some of the other major brands. With little success I finally gave up, bit the bullet(quite literally;).) and went back to the poison known as crest. I finally bought some off amazon, tried it and it killed my garlic breath cleaned plaque great and did not burn my tongue. Best of all you are able to taste food like normal afterwards, and there is no sensitivity on the tongue.</li>
    <li> it had an unpleasant under-taste; I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Amazing toothpaste, but cheaper at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> Love the way my teeth feel after using. The taste is unusual but not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> My family and I love this toothpaste.  We haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if the tube will bother us when it&#x27;s half full, but the paste is YUMMY!  The first time I used it for the girls, they were dancing around the house.  When I tried it on my toddler, he didn&#x27;t want to stop brushing.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the cost.  B/c it is expensive, it&#x27;s our \\&quot;dessert\\&quot; toothpaste.  Only to be used at night.  We&#x27;ll use a cheaper one in the mornings till it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the negative remarks about the taste or packaging. Granted I&#x27;m only on my first tube, but I  have no problems whatsoever with this toothpaste. The top pulls right off with hardly any effort and snaps right back on, no problem. The taste and texture are far better that any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, not too strong but mild and smooth. It&#x27;s been a great help for my sensitive teeth, too. Besides that, it&#x27;s fluoride free!! I started using Theodent a few weeks ago after a routine dental cleaning and can&#x27;t wait till my next cleaning to see what my hygienist says. I know everybody&#x27;s tastes are different, but, so far, I give this stuff five stars!</li>
    <li> This is excellent toothpaste.  It leaves your teeth feeling very clean and has the added benefit of enamel growth.  Good taste too.  The price is ridiculous as is the almost unusable packaging.</li>
    <li> I have heard of the Theobromine research for a couple of years and I had been looking for a toothpaste that would have it.  So, despite my skepticism about whether or not this really works, I figured if it was only $15, why not try this paste out?  I can sacrifice going out to lunch a couple days to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it, there was a very noticeable difference with how the toothpaste sits on your teeth.  It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling, but I can guarantee you&#x27;ll feel something different with this toothpaste when you first try it.  It has a soft minty feel and the best part is that you don&#x27;t have to rinse after brushing your teeth since it&#x27;s perfectly safe to swallow.  In fact, I&#x27;ve changed my dental hygiene routine as follows: Floss, then Mouthwash, then Brush.  I leave the brushing last so I don&#x27;t have to rinse my mouth and let the toothpaste take as long as it wants working on my teeth (I&#x27;m not sure if that really works, but it can&#x27;t hurt in this case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing about this toothpaste (and might throw some people off at first) is that you don&#x27;t have that strong &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;great-smelling-breath&amp;#34; type of feeling you&#x27;d normally have with regular toothpaste.  Don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;ll just have to scrape your tongue with your toothbrush and/or use mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste comes in a regular sized tube, if not slightly thinner.  The paste comes out of the tube pretty thin, so you won&#x27;t be using a lot at once.  I suspect that this tube can last 2 or 3 months with one person using it.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised when I noticed in a little over a week of brushing 2X a day that my teeth were noticeably whiter. I never wanted to professionally whiten my teeth because of the chemicals they use.  I like the fact that there are no harmful chemicals or fluoride and I like the way it tastes. It is different.  It took a little while to figure out how to take the cap on and off easily, small design flaw in the cap. After over 60 years of trying different toothpastes, the whitening and lack of toxic chemicals in this one have sold me.</li>
    <li> Love the toothpaste but lid is impossible to take on and off w wet hands.need to resolve issue or it will not last</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame because the product itself is wonderful....the packaging sucks....metal cap is hard to get off even with dry fingers and the plastic tube is very difficult because it rebounds so you can&#x27;t tell how much product is left...spoke to the company and it does not seem like they are going to change the packaging</li>
    <li> By far the best toothpaste I have ever used! It took a few uses to get used to the taste...but all in all, impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought this many months ago because I have horrible enamel and I am not a fan of fluoride. I had gone to the dentist last year and I had about 6 small cavities that were there but did nothing about them ( I know, I know). Today I went to get a check up and cleaning and I have NO cavities and the small gingivitis that my dentist had noticed was better. So let&#x27;s say that I am not going back to another toothpaste ever. I also would like to mention that I did, during this year, floss much more than I have had so that also had an impact to the no cavities situation. It is a rather expensive toothpaste but I will gladly pay the fee and not have to deal with the exorbitant fees associated with dentists!!!</li>
    <li> Interesting product. Just started using it after my dental hygienist recommended it. Too soon to know how it works for me, but I have high hopes.</li>
    <li> IT TASTES VAGUELY LIKE WHITE CHOCOLATE, AND YES IT IS WHITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE IT AFTER DEPPLAQUING WITH A LITTLE RUBBER SHARP POINT TIP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST FACT IS THAT IT WORKED TO ELIMINATE MY PERIODONTAL DISEASE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU GOT TO HAVE THE PHILLIPS ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSH. USE THE SMALL BRUSH SO YOU CAN DO ONE TOOTH AT A TIME.</li>
    <li> I cannot find a reason to dislike this product. Unless there is some harmful side effect to an ingredient that is yet unkown, this product is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is a plus!</li>
    <li> nice toothpast !! thanks!!</li>
    <li> I loved my Theodent toothpaste. It made my teeth far less sensitive, and I believe, whiter. Then Whole Foods stopped selling it. I can&#x27;t find any online either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope that they are redesigning their tube, very pretty, but dysfunctional (I cut my tubes open and dip my toothbrush in the leftover paste, which was quite a bit).</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try it our as I really  care about the fluoride  and want to have a product free from the  bad effects of the fluoride for my family.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I had the effect like I had regurgitated a sour burp or threw up in my mouth.  I thought I must have eaten something bad.  Unfortunately every time I have brushed I have had the same effect almost coming through my nose it is so harsh.  I never review anything, but felt it necessary to tell people to save their money and buy Tom&#x27;s Toothpaste which is cheaper and so much better.</li>
    <li> It is too early to tell yet if this toothpaste will actually make my periodontal maintenance any better, but I do like the toothpaste, taste is good, feels fresh after brushing. Here&#x27;s the thing. My wife said don&#x27;t get her any more, too hard to get the cap off the tube. I am okay with that, but after I squeezed the tube to the utmost, I wondered how much was left. (My mother taught us well, waste not, want not.)I cut the tube in half and started dipping into the bottom and top with brush head to get the last vestiges out, which turned out to be 1 1/2 weeks of twice a day brushing with the amount proscribed by dentists, that small pearl size. That is an awful lot of waste. It is all about design of the tube, regular toothpastes, with their roll up tubes, leave almost nothing behind, most of paste was in head on this one, but couldn&#x27;t be squeezed out. Love the contents, ditch that packaging</li>
    <li> Good tasting flouride-free toothpaste. Waaay too expensive. Cap is difficult to remove, does not unscrew but is compression fit. As you can imagine, after some use, toothpaste acts almost like glue to hold cap in place. There is a reason why screw caps have been used on toothpaste for the past 70 years...it works! Suspect designer of this cap was trying to make tube/cap look cool, and it does, but at the expense of usefulness. Strongly recommend redesign.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a floride free toothpaste that tasted good and really cleaned my teeth without a mighty squeeze to get it out of the tube.  This stuff is wonderful and met every parameter I&#x27;ve just set forth.  Yay!</li>
    <li> Although it made my teeth whiter, it made my gums and teeth more sensitive.  It did not leave my mouth feeling fresh for more than a few minutes.  I woke up in the morning with bad breath.  My previous tooth paste left my mouth and breath feeling cleaner for a lot longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Mild mint taste. Teeth feel clean but not filmy. CRAPY top but it looks nice and who really cares. I like have an alternative to the chemicals but more protection than baking soda. Old design old recipe but the toothpaste of the future.</li>
    <li> Many reviewers have pointed out the problem with the toothpaste tube: very hard to get at the last 20% of so of the paste.... until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just stick your tube (and toothbrush if you like) in a glass or mug. Make sure the cap is facing down and let gravity do the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing!</li>
    <li> Got rid of my sensitive teeth!  Taste great, works great.  Cap is an issue, but it&#x27;s simply the best flouride free toothpaste in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try not to even spit it out until I have to.  It&#x27;s that healthy.</li>
    <li> Wow, i got this for Christmas and it is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;Theodent toothpaste taste great and smells like chocolate, but like a light chocolate. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have ridiculously sensitive teeth. I have used this toothpaste once and I was able to drink an ice cold liquid without excruciating pain. It was actually tolerable. I will continue to buy this product; however, i will buy it from the theodent website. On the website it is $9.99 and $5.69 shipping. On Amazon I paid $14.99 and $7.99 shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using Theodent exclusively for 3 months (I&#x27;m on my second tube) and I will not go back to any other toothepaste.  Upon looking for a flouride-free toothepaste, I was intrigued when I saw Theodent.  It comes in a brown tube, with a gold cap that looks like a chocolate bar.  It tastes nothing like chocolate, with a pleasant mild, minty taste.  The consistency is good, with a slight grit (like any good toothepaste), but not too gritty.  I love Theodent and will continue to use it.  My 2-year-old also uses it and loves it even more than his bubble-gum flouride-free toothepaste.  I think it was the packaging that got him to try it, as he wouldn&#x27;t even try a more conventional adult toothepaste.  My only complaint is that the cap on the tube is hard to remove with wet hands.  I would recommend the makers switch to a screw or flip-top tube design or use a traditional-style tube.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste pretty well. The foaming property of other toothpastes tend to make me gag. I like that this toothpaste gets the job done without the foam. I also had people telling me my teeth looked whiter.</li>
    <li> I heard about this toothpaste in a magazine I subscribe to. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the price, but purchased it after reading fellow customer reviews. It is great and is (reportedly) the only toothpaste of its kind. My teeth have become sensitive over the past year and I&#x27;m always looking for easy ways to whiten, and so far this has not disappointed. It has an interesting taste and doesn&#x27;t foam a lot and is, overall, less harsh than drug store toothpastes. Plus, it has free shipping! I say give it a try, and I know I&#x27;ll be buying more (especially from this seller) in the future.</li>
    <li> We think it has reduced sensitivity and improved our gum health. Better dental checkups using this.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product because I was looking for a natural alternative. When I received it, I thought the product looked like chocolate bar, which was rather misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I did not like the taste at all. At first, it has a minty feel but then quickly turns into a soapy bitter taste that leaves your mouth with a very bad after taste. I was expecting something very different based on the look of the toothpaste. I know you should not judge a book by its cover, but the outside does not reflect the inside at all.</li>
    <li> --------Update 11 Jan 14---------&lt;br /&gt;I received a free tube of their new 300 line and just like before, the toothpaste is great, but the tube and cap are STILL, absolutely, 100% terrible.  They did put 4 ridges on the cap (2 on each side) on the small end of the cap and it&#x27;s just not enough.  Perhaps if the ridges were on the wider side it&#x27;d be easier to grip, but since it isn&#x27;t you have to rely solely on the pinching strength (not grip strength) of 2 fingers, 3 if you have small hands.  Still, it&#x27;ll be better than nothing for some I suppose, but it shouldn&#x27;t be this hard to create a cap that can be EASILY removed.  At the end of the day it&#x27;s still NOT EASY to pull the cap off and I&#x27;m still using my fingernails to get into the crack between the tube and cap to pull it off because it&#x27;s just easier.  Because of where they&#x27;ve placed the ridges, they&#x27;ll be useless for most people I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the tube still does not flatten when you use it and self-inflates to the original shape, so you never know how much is left inside and you&#x27;re always squeezing out air wondering where the toothpaste is inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, it seems as though they&#x27;ve listened to some of their customers complain about the cap and tube, but are still failing with both.  Oh, Theodent... I&#x27;m amazed at how you&#x27;ve handled these issues.... Let me know when the 3rd redesign comes out, or better yet, let me know when you fire the current design team as it&#x27;s clear they have no idea what they&#x27;re doing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------Original Review------------------&lt;br /&gt;I find the toothpaste great and the taste doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I&#x27;m a little confused as to why people are comparing it to sour milk, it tastes pretty much like normal toothpaste to me and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why did I give this product 2 stars?  Well, it&#x27;s easy.  You don&#x27;t really think about product design much because it normally just works.  How many of you have used a normal tube of toothpaste and looked at it wondering how to improve it?  I don&#x27;t think most of us have done that, because a normal tube of toothpaste works pretty good, the design is, for the most part, completely solid.  That being said, the thing that drives me absolutely insane in using this product is how unbelievably horrible and non-functional the design is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem #1: If you look at the picture, the toothpaste looks sleek and sexy, but all that goes away when you try and use it.  Look at the cap on the tube... It&#x27;s completely slick, there&#x27;s absolutely nowhere for you to grip the cap; if you&#x27;re lucky, you&#x27;ll be able to get 3 fingers on it, 2 if you have big hands.  Even if you can grip the cap, it&#x27;s really small and not designed to be gripped.  You have to rely on friction in trying to pull off the cap.  Doesn&#x27;t sound so bad?  Well, if you get out of the shower and then go to brush your teeth, you can&#x27;t pull off the cap because you can&#x27;t grip that slick cap with wet hands.  You have to completely dry off your hands and ensure no moisture is on them at all in order to get the cap off.  Sometimes I&#x27;ve had to use my fingernail to try and get in the crack between the tube and the cap to get the cap off.  You can&#x27;t twist the cap off either, it has to be pulled off.  I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how frustrating it is trying to use this toothpaste every morning.  Everyday when I&#x27;m brushing my teeth I feel like throwing this tube across the room.  I&#x27;ve discovered that if I get some toothpaste caked-on inside the cap, then that helps a little bit in pulling it off, but only because it prevents the cap from going on all the way.  I&#x27;m not old and weak either, I&#x27;m a very fit soldier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem #2: You know how a normal tube of toothpaste flattens out when you use it, so that you can easily press up the toothpaste in the tube as you use it, or even roll up the bottom the tube?  Well, they&#x27;ve chosen to use a plastic that keeps it&#x27;s shape as you use it.  What that means is that if you had an empty tube and a full tube right next to each other, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell which one is empty.  There are a few problems with this, with the first being that you never know how much toothpaste you have left.  The second problem which I think is bigger, is that once you get about halfway done with the tube (and you can&#x27;t roll up the tube), you have to always work the toothpaste up from the bottom, not really knowing where in the tube it starts/ends.  It&#x27;s absolutely annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I had mentioned earlier, most people don&#x27;t think about toothpaste/toothpaste tube product design, and I was one of those people.  However, when a product comes along that is designed this poorly, you can&#x27;t help but say to yourself in the bathroom mirror, &amp;#34;What the %@#$ were they thinking!&amp;#34;  As far as the product goes, it&#x27;s good, but the design of the product is a complete, 100% design disaster that I&#x27;m CERTAIN will make people stop using it.  If you have small children or arthritis in your hands, just forget it, you will not be able to get the cap off.  There&#x27;s simply no way I can continue to use this toothpaste; I refuse to fight with that cap everyday.  I bought 4 tubes and sadly, can&#x27;t get through them quickly enough.  If they come up with a product design that is actually functional and just doesn&#x27;t look good, I&#x27;ll come back to using it, but I&#x27;ll NEVER buy this product again in its current design.  It completely boggles my mind how this product got out the door in its current design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone would like to start a Theodent Anger Management Group, consider me in.wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell which one is empty.

    <li> It tastes great and leaves my teeth feeling smooth. I use this for my toddler and myself as it is flouride-free. It&#x27;s nice to be able to drink orange juice afterwards without that wierd after-taste. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price-tag. It would be nice if the manufacturer offered coupons or incentives to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was just regular toothpaste with fancy packaging at first. I heard folks talk about it&#x27;s ability to mitigate sensitivity. This peaked my interest as I have somewhat severe sensitivity, particularly to cold temperatures. After using it for about 3 weeks, I... was... amazed. I can now eat ice cream again! Oh how I&#x27;ve missed ice cream! The effect this product has is nothing short of a miracle. I feel like my teeth are made of steel now. The mint flavor is pleasant and the texture is smooth. I love the tube too. I like the fine ribbon of toothpaste it dispenses instead of the globs of toothpaste normal toothpaste tubes put out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone use a fluoride toothpaste ever again? No more poison for me or my family!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve left my \\&quot;feedback\\&quot; a while ago on their facebook page, but it got deleted. It wasn&#x27;t that bad! All I said was that whoever designed this product did a bad job with the cap, it&#x27;s dreadful to get off and in the meantime the outer layer of the cap is permanently off, the glue&#x27;s not that good. Also, once it&#x27;s a bit empty, the paste hard to squeeze out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I asked them why this product is SO expensive in Europe, they&#x27;re making it impossible for \\&quot;commoners\\&quot; to buy it. Is this a product for the rich only? Why can&#x27;t we simple people buy this? Why is this marketed in a way where the looks of the toothpaste is more important than what&#x27;s in it? It&#x27;s a shame that we have to pay for a fancy looking toothpaste when all we want is a good paste without fluoride. If they really created the BEST toothpaste out there, they wouldn&#x27;t have to market it like this and dress it up an a ball gown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be watching them to see how this develops.</li>
    <li> I recently ran across this toothpaste in Whole Foods.  I have to say that I really like it.  I like the taste as it is not too strong, nor does it burn my mouth or around my lips.  The taste is like a creamy soft mint, not overpowering.  I also like that it does not majorly distort the taste of food if you are eating soon after.  It really helps with my sensitivity too!  I agree with other reviewers that the lid is a bit difficult.  Instead of twisting I gripped the tube and popped the lid off sideways.  This helped a lot as twisting will get you no where fast!  I also agree that it is nice that it comes out in a thin fairly even strip rather than a glob like other toothpaste.  I would definitely by again!</li>
    <li> The toothpaste has a light spearmint flavor.  It doesn&#x27;t seem quite as abrasive as my regular toothpaste, but it does seem to whiten my teeth better than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  Overall, I really like it, but I absolutely HATE their choice of packaging.  The fact that you can&#x27;t tell how much remains in the tube is a minor inconvenience.  My chief complaint is the fact that tube is VERY difficult to open.  The cap is tapered, mirror-smooth and snaps on- making it almost impossible to pull off, even with dry hands.  And the shape of the cap (thinner along one axis) essentially forces you to squeeze the cap such that you&#x27;re actually reinforcing the holding ability of the internal snap-fit ridges.  VERY POOR design.  As it stands, I&#x27;ve superglued a few plastic ridges to the cap, just to reduce my frustration each day.  I like the toothpaste, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be re-ordering it- for that reason alone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only toothpaste I trust for my little one. However the cap sucks to take off so most times I leave it off which means the next use has a rock hard plug I have to clear out. (Still easier than removing the cap). Doesn&#x27;t really freshen the breath so it keeps you on your toes with your dieting choices. But again I get this for my little one, and for him this is a great alternative to fluoride and harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so Aug 2014 just found a new toothpaste called \\&quot;Coral Kids\\&quot; that is fluoride free and contains calcium. After a cavity, I decided to switch to try out a new paste. Other than peroxide it is relatively safe. Also, I can buy it local; that was a major selling point. Theodent is still nice, but for a lower cost and availability I switched.</li>
    <li> I like it. A No fluoride, Whitening Crystal Mint good tasting non-toxic toothpaste using a patented &amp;#34; RennouTM&amp;#34; from the cocoa bean to replace the toxic flouride which is bad for everybody. How cool is that?  I use it regularly and it is good for me, why would I not use it instead of the flouride toxic toothpastes, oh NO not toxins for my family.  AND, about the cap, yes it is hard to take off when your hands are wet, so dry your hands off before you start to brush your teeth, problem solved, I have very little problem removing the cap. So what, it&#x27;s about the product not the container, they can improve on the container design later as things progress, great product overall, I highly recommend this product to everyone for better living.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was recommended to me by my son.  He swears by it.  After using it for a few months, he declares his teeth are no longer sensitive when he drinks cold water.  I have not used Theodent long enough to tell anything but the slightest difference; therefore, I give four stars on the testimony of my son.  I have used theodent for months now.  Earlier I said my son swears by Theodent.  Today, I can say with confidence that I swear by it too.</li>
    <li> The taste is spearmint (like the gum) and not too strong.  It seems to work just fine.  At least, I am not swallowing fluoride, which I know to be a toxic substance.  I do wonder though, not being a newspaper reader, whether I somehow have missed all those obituaries attributed to chronic fluoride poisoning.  Guess I need to do more research on that.  The tube is a redesign and the top won&#x27;t slip down the drain.  I dinged it a star for price.  Hopefully they will ramp up production and the price will come down.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this product got out the door.  Beautiful packaging but disgusting contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of spoiled milk or liver, I have never tasted anything this disgusting.</li>
    <li> So I had a terribly sensitive tooth several months ago. I began using the 300, and within 2 weeks my tooth was back to normal. It definitely leaves your teeth feeling fresh and clean. Expensive but cheaper than a filling at the dentist. My favorite toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great Toothpaste.  Love the flavor and it was a great price.  I really enjoy using this because it is unique and different from other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Picture shows 3 toothpaste tubes, I thought that&#x27;s what I was ordering, and since I am buying it online, I didn&#x27;t mind buying in bulk. Oops, only one bottle of toothpaste! (Make sure you read up so you know what you&#x27;re getting!)</li>
    <li> The toothpaste tastes pretty good, but unfortunately no major difference was noted by our dentist from previously, when we were told to start using fluoride to six months later after buying &amp; using this instead. So, I definitely can&#x27;t speak for it being a fluoride replacement. My husband may have given this four stars because he likes it a little better than me and has a little more faith that it&#x27;s working as advertised. The packaging is a chore. The lid pulls off rather than twists off and sometimes detaches with ease and sometimes requires dried hands with pulling and wiggling and squeezing and cursing all at once to get it off. Also, the tube does not stay collapsed so the paste can be pushed from the bottom with ease. We had to put one of those plastic gizmos that squeeze the tube and stays on so the paste keeps toward the opening. It&#x27;s hard to dislike the actual paste because it tastes great and leaves the mouth fresh, but the expensive price and non-functional (but pretty) packaging don&#x27;t justify this non-fluoride toothpaste when the dentist didn&#x27;t notice a difference in our tooth hardening as advertised.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the mint. It reminds me of what toms was when I was a kid. Whole foods sells it for 11.99 though ;) (I do not work there or have any affiliation)</li>
    <li> We have been using this fluoride free toothpaste for our toddler.  It smells minty clean without being overwhelming in smell or taste.  I&#x27;ve tried it myself a couple of times, and in conjunction with my sonicare toothbrush, it leaves my teeth smoother than any traditional toothpastes I have ever used, with less than one third the amount of paste.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up a lot, which helps me as I can be a bit gaggy, especially in the mornings.  I would buy this for my entire family for the rest of my lives if it became a bit more affordable.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste after reading about it.  The 5 stars are for the paste.  No fluoride, excellent cleaning, marvelous taste. For the price I would give it one star as this high price is way too much and no need for it.  The packaging is worth minus 3 stars since it is close to impossible to remove the cap with arthritic fingers.  Obviously the design team are in their 20&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have a clue.  I really do like the paste but will not buy again since it is such a struggle to get at it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately after purchasing this toothpaste, I read the ingredients list and became aware that it contains titanium dioxide, while not metallic in nature titanium dioxide has been suspected to be carcinogenic to humans. While it&#x27;s not entirely proven to cause cancer in humans, I don&#x27;t feel safe putting any more titan dioxide in my body than I already unknowingly do.  Take out the titanium dioxide and I&#x27;ll buy it again to try.</li>
    <li> This is a really great non-fluoride toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: perfect sweetness and flavor as well as consistency and froth. Decent price and stylish design.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: pretty poor tube cap design. There is not much grip and I find it hard to open, a screw top or ridges on the cap would work better.</li>
    <li> So I would give this 5 stars in a heartbeat if they redesign the cap (worst cap ever, hard to open, hard to close) and gave you free shipping. I accumulate tartar on my teeth despite fanatical oral hygiene. Until I tried Theodent, I was using an Arm and Hammer paste that still didn&#x27;t do a great job. Theodent almost completely prevents my tartar. It&#x27;s amazing. I will NEVER use another brand of toothpaste again. Other great things about Theodent: the tube is flat, so it doesn&#x27;t roll around the sink, it tastes great, it foams up in a pleasing way, a little goes a long way. Am steeling myself to try Theodent 300 which costs $99.</li>
    <li> I didnt like this toothpaste. It tastes really bad, very bitter and strange taste. Very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a natural fluoride-free toothpaste but do not reccommend this one.</li>
    <li> I came from a website that said it cost 300 dollars ridiculous price for a toothpaste ,but it was a false advertisement and it led me to search more about it. The reviews I&#x27;ve read so far shows that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a good toothpaste hopefully I could try it in the near future.</li>
    <li> Now I just got this toothpaste a few days ago, but I love it! I leaves my teeth smooth, and clean, my mouth minty and even my gums look way happier! And bright pink! (*not red...just a super healthy looking pink!) I know it has only been a few days, but I also wanted to let people know I think they changed the cap!   It seemed to be a big complaint, but mine is made of plastic and comes on and off super easily, so I think they changed it! We&#x27;ll see how it continues to go, but so far I really like it! *The toothpaste I mean!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Theodent for a few months now, and love the way it makes our teeth feel polished after brushing! My brother is a dentist, and he recommended it to us because it&#x27;s supposed to be twice as effective as fluoride toothpaste without the side effects, and it&#x27;s safe for my 3 yr old to swallow. Not only do your teeth feel polished, but in the morning your teeth still feel clean! Which is a huge plus!</li>
    <li> not really....and the cap is bizarrely hard to remove....but I like the paste anyway....and I thought I was getting three not one....thats $15 for one tube???</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5 year old as an alternate to flouride toothpaste. He has thyroid problems that cause tooth problems, and the flouride can interfere with medication. I was worried about the effectiveness of the theobromine, but after a year of using it, he was cavity-free at the dentist! What a difference from the previous visit. He (and I) both love the chocolate flavor too.</li>
    <li> The wonderful picture that shows up when you see this shows 3 tubes of toothpaste.  That&#x27;s what I thought I would get.  I was foolish, I admit, but who in their right mind would expect to pay three times as much for one tube of toothpaste?  Seriously?  It looks like toothpaste.  It tastes like some minty style toothpaste...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really alarmed me the most is that nowhere on this tube of toothpaste does it actually says that it does one lick of good to prevent cavities.  The wording is carefully done so that you THINK it prevents cavities, but they weasel out of the claim very nicely.  So what is the point of paying an arm and a leg for this over the more reasonably priced and equally fluoride free Coral White or Coral Kids toothpaste?  I have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; update 4/30/2013 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Actually the box it comes in and the tube that the toothpaste comes out of make no claims of any benefit whatsoever.</li>
