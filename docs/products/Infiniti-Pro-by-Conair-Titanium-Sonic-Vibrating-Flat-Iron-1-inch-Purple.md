      <li>The bright purple color helps us find it again easily.</li>
      <li>The color purple is nice but not the most inspiring color choice I have seen, but the application of a quick warm up, plus the good ability of this iron to actually straighten hair after one pass is great.  </li>
      <li>I used 400 degrees and was able to straighten with the one pass.  </li>
      <li>Naturally, I love her hair, and she&#x27;s gotten many, many complements over the years.</li>

      <li>The fast warm up to a suitable tempature is true.  </li>
      <li>I found this iron lighter than most and easy to use because of the swivel cord and the one inch is good for me because I have short hair.  </li>
      <li>The buttons are all on the inside, which is interesting, and the last nice point is the court is attach&amp;eacute;d to a swivel, which means that the cord doedn&#x27;t twist around, but is free to move as you use the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>that I can feel a burn on my scalp when I first use it at the top of my head.</li>
      <li>Overall, this seems like a very good and reasonably priced iron.  </li>

      <li>:  This is a good, basic, hair flattening iron.  </li>

      <li>Infiniti Pro is good flat iron</li>
      <li>I found this iron heated up as quickly as promised 15 seconds.  </li>
      <li>&gt;* Heats up QUICKLY.</li>
      <li>Very good straightener other than the fact that it pulls clumps of my hair out every time I straighten my hair by the very tip of the straightener</li>
      <li>Super easy and fast.</li>
      <li>It stays straight for a couple of days, which is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>But on rare occasions she&#x27;s had her hair straightened at the salon, to the amazement of myself and all our kids.</li>
      <li>The color purple here is not my first choice I color, but it is not bad at all.  </li>
      <li>She looks great, everyone notices right away, and she gets a fresh round of complements on her looks from her friends.</li>
      <li>She looks great, everyone notices right away, and she gets a fresh round of complements on her looks from her friends.</li>
      <li>By being able to choose my own temperature, I don’t have to worry as much about damage to my hair due to overheating.  </li>
      <li>To be fair the hair dresser does use a different flat iron where the vibration is much more pronounced.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am quite impressed with both the ease of use of the Infiniti Pro Conair Sonic Titanium Flat Iron and the results achieved with a minimal amount of time and effort.  </li>
      <li>This straightener&#x27;s not expensive at all, and it&#x27;s been a lot of fun.</li>
      <li>This straightener&#x27;s not expensive at all, and it&#x27;s been a lot of fun.</li>
      <li>would recommend this flat iron, it is light has a swirl,cord and is easy to maneuver which helps you get the results that you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
      <li>Until then I get to enjoy a new aspect of her beauty.</li>
      <li>Until then I get to enjoy a new aspect of her beauty.</li>
      <li>First off, this product does exactly what is says it will do.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to try this item out because I figured any company willing to make this product in purple must be saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A pretty color</li>
      <li>My wife consistently said that you can have some clutch of hair fall through the bottom of the iron during use and get caught as you use this on yourself.  </li>
      <li>For a celebrity comparison, think Gisele Bundchen, although Gisele&#x27;s not quite as pretty.</li>
      <li>But like most women sometimes she hates it and longs for something different.</li>
      <li>Second, the product does very quickly work after being powered up.  </li>
      <li>However,my here is one design flaw high any buyer should be aware of.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to roll.</li>
      <li>I expected much more out of it.</li>
      <li>, she hasn’t burned herself once, and how much easier and faster it is than the flatiron it is replacing.  </li>
      <li>This straightener heats us SO FAST.</li>
      <li>A real treat.</li>
      <li>and I would recommend it because does keep the hair straight.</li>
      <li>I get a better response on this than the one I talked about above, although that is an older (but many times more expensive)</li>
      <li>It is definitely a huge step up from the antiquated flat iron I’d been using.</li>
      <li>This straightener gets very, very hot, which is good for someone like me with such thick hair.  </li>
      <li>My wife has an astonishing mane of thick, curly, Irish dirty-blonde hair, the kind that gives glory to God, the kind that would turn into a Caucasian &#x27;fro if she cut it too short, which is why she keeps it at or below shoulder length; so the weight of it pulls down the pouf ball.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s been straightening my hair very well on the normal setting.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m sure its millimeters of difference, I have to be careful about placing it near my scalp because of the heat.</li>
      <li>15 SECOND heat up is FOR REAL and the sonic vibrations let it glide down your hair so quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>If she spent another fifteen minutes on it, I&#x27;m sure she could get it just as straight as the salon, but it wouldn&#x27;t make that much difference to the overall effect.</li>
      <li>If she spent another fifteen minutes on it, I&#x27;m sure she could get it just as straight as the salon, but it wouldn&#x27;t make that much difference to the overall effect.</li>
      <li>My teenage daughter raves about this flatiron – from the very fast heat up time</li>
      <li>flat iron really did heat up in literally seconds, and one pass-through was really all it took.  </li>
      <li>This is not a fatal flaw at all, but the sort of open bottom does allow this to happen and any user should be aware of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall?</li>
      <li>It stays straight even after sleeping on it, and doesn&#x27;t revert to its natural curliness until the next time she shampoos.</li>
      <li>It stays straight even after sleeping on it, and doesn&#x27;t revert to its natural curliness until the next time she shampoos.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basic and works very well.</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>No matter how early I get up, I&#x27;m rushing around.</li>
      <li>A real treat.of waviness in back where she can&#x27;t see.</li>
      <li>, i do have to do multiple passes to get it straight.</li>
      <li>Especially so since the style nowadays is straight and silky.</li>
      <li>I really like the results I receive using this flat iron.</li>
      <li>The finer temperature adjustment makes the iron easier to use by my daughter, who does not worry as much about &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; her hair using this flat</li>
      <li>I have a Conair flat iron that is probably close to ten years old, and I rarely use it because the whole ordeal of straightening my hair with it just takes too long.  </li>
      <li>We currently have Remington 1” flat iron, which does not get as hot and does not vibrate like the Infiniti pro.  </li>
      <li>I mean, super fast.</li>
      <li>(Karmin G3 Professional Flat Iron - NEW 2012 Model).</li>
      <li>/&gt;It only takes her about fifteen minutes, and when she&#x27;s done it&#x27;s almost as straight as a salon &#x27;do&#x27;, with just a bit of waviness in back where she can&#x27;t see.</li>
      <li>flat iron has multiple settings to allow her to choose how much heat</li>
      <li>It worked more efficiently on my granddaughter&#x27;s long, moderately thick hair.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s different is that there are specific settings for fine, normal, wavy, medium, thick, and coarse hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, does it&#x27;s job but it was not what I expected. I expected much more out of it. I have alot of hair and it&#x27;s really thick, i do have to do multiple passes to get it straight.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter raves about this flatiron – from the very fast heat up time, she hasn’t burned herself once, and how much easier and faster it is than the flatiron it is replacing.  We’re impressed with how much easier it is as well as the time savings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed! The iron heats up very quickly and is easy to use. It passes over my hair smoothly, no tugs, and one or two passes is usually sufficient to straighten. It&#x27;s basic and works very well. I think this will be a great addition to my hair styling regimen.</li>
    <li> We currently have Remington 1” flat iron, which does not get as hot and does not vibrate like the Infiniti pro.  There is no difference in the results. Both do a good job straightening curly hair.  My wife’s hair dresser swears by the vibration but we saw better results with the vibration off. To be fair the hair dresser does use a different flat iron where the vibration is much more pronounced. With the Infiniti Pro the vibration is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti Pro is good flat iron and I would recommend it because does keep the hair straight.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Works great, just as advertised! Super easy and fast.</li>
    <li> I really like the results I receive using this flat iron. I currently use a 1&amp;#34; flat iron by Karmin Professional (Karmin G3 Professional Flat Iron - NEW 2012 Model). It&#x27;s currently selling for $150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Heats up QUICKLY. I turn in on after I brush my teeth and it&#x27;s ready in just a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;* It has specific heat levels. I&#x27;m used to a flat iron with a continuum of heat settings (usually up to 450 degrees). What&#x27;s different is that there are specific settings for fine, normal, wavy, medium, thick, and coarse hair. With a regular flat iron you select the setting and hope you don&#x27;t burn your hair.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s purple. A pretty color always helps.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s been straightening my hair very well on the normal setting. I get a better response on this than the one I talked about above, although that is an older (but many times more expensive) iron.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Button placement. Although I know in my mind that I won&#x27;t be burned by uses the control buttons, their placement did initially scare me. They&#x27;re so close to the heating element that I was scared.&lt;br /&gt;* Heat plate placement. It&#x27;s so close to the edge that I can feel a burn on my scalp when I first use it at the top of my head. With any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m burning my head when I start the &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34;. While I&#x27;m sure its millimeters of difference, I have to be careful about placing it near my scalp because of the heat. I know it&#x27;s not the temp because I use higher temps on other irons without the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration, I&#x27;m not sure about. Of course it&#x27;s weird because I&#x27;ve never had a flat iron that does it. But weird doesn&#x27;t mean bad, just different. I used the vibration on one side and no vibration on the other. I wasn&#x27;t able to tell a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results may be different than yours. I&#x27;m African-American and I have a relaxer.</li>
    <li> According to my daughter (who, along with my granddaughter, was one of the test subjects) this is a quality product. But its narrow width makes working on her long (below the shoulders) very thick hair, time-consuming. It worked more efficiently on my granddaughter&#x27;s long, moderately thick hair. But it took a while for both of them. The vibration was a plus - \\&quot;That tells me it&#x27;s working\\&quot; - as was the fact that it doesn&#x27;t catch (or pull) the hair. So she&#x27;ll be keeping it and using it in future when she isn&#x27;t rushing to get out the door in the morning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great on NATURAL HAIR!</li>
    <li> I have an old version of this flat iron in ceramic and it&#x27;s much better than the titanium.</li>
    <li> For those who can remember what straight irons were like 8years ago, here&#x27;s a blast from the past. While the quality of the hardware seems to stand to the test so far the vibrations and heating power failed to straighten my curly mane. I would recommend this maybe for your tween!</li>
    <li> love the color and style. works like a gem!</li>
    <li> 15 SECOND heat up is FOR REAL and the sonic vibrations let it glide down your hair so quick and easy.  And the shine!!  It put such a shine into my hair, I could not believe it.  This product is a lot more expensive than the cheapies I&#x27;ve used in the past, but now I can see it is worth every penny.  You will NOT be disappointed with this product.  It&#x27;s everything it advertises to be.  LOVE IT :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always in a rush for work. No matter how early I get up, I&#x27;m rushing around. This was a great item for me to try! Doing my hair is usually time consuming. This straightener heats us SO FAST. I mean, super fast. So instead of waiting to do my hair, I can just jump on in. It does a great job, also. I use to have to go over my hair multiple times for the effect that I wanted. With this straightener, I only have to go over it once and I&#x27;m ready to roll. Really happy to try this out! I&#x27;ll be recommending it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I have wavy short  thick hair which is hard to straighten.  I found this iron heated up as quickly as promised 15 seconds.  The temperature setting are from 320 to 455 degrees. I used 400 degrees and was able to straighten with the one pass.  This iron also boasts that it adds shine to your hair.  I was skeptical but I thought It did add shine when straighten.  I found this iron lighter than most and easy to use because of the swivel cord and the one inch is good for me because I have short hair.  I also have a lot of layers in my hair and like to add body by turning the iron under before I pull it throught the ends of my hair.  This adds body so my hair doesn&#x27;t lay flat.  The controls are on the inside of the iron and I had no problem using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this flat iron, it is light has a swirl,cord and is easy to maneuver which helps you get the results that you&#x27;re looking for.  I also like the purple color.</li>
    <li> Very good straightener other than the fact that it pulls clumps of my hair out every time I straighten my hair by the very tip of the straightener so I no longer use it. Don&#x27;t feel like getting my hair ripped out every time.</li>
    <li> With the ability to rapidly heat up, this flat iron has made my wife&#x27;s life simple and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron has multiple settings to allow her to choose how much heat she uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I like that its compact and easily stores away.  The bright purple color helps us find it again easily.</li>
    <li> Wow.  Color me impressed.  I have a Conair flat iron that is probably close to ten years old, and I rarely use it because the whole ordeal of straightening my hair with it just takes too long.  With the Infiniti Pro Conair Sonic Titanium Flat Iron, the flat iron has definitely gotten some upgrades.  A process that used to take me at least half-an-hour now takes me about five minutes, tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron really did heat up in literally seconds, and one pass-through was really all it took.  There are a couple features I especially like.  One is the ability to select my temperature, and I like that both the box and instructions include a temperature guide based on hair type.  By being able to choose my own temperature, I don’t have to worry as much about damage to my hair due to overheating.  I also like that there’s an automatic shut-off.  I have small children, so it’s reassuring to know that if I get distracted, this flat iron isn’t going to stay on indefinitely.  The only odd feature I found is that all the control buttons are on the inside.  I assume this is so you don’t bump them while styling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am quite impressed with both the ease of use of the Infiniti Pro Conair Sonic Titanium Flat Iron and the results achieved with a minimal amount of time and effort.  It is definitely a huge step up from the antiquated flat iron I’d been using.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this item out because I figured any company willing to make this product in purple must be saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  What&#x27;s in the box?:  You receive the product, with miminal instructions in a smaller box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Aesthetic?:  This is a utility product that has a nice look and feel to it&#x27;s form.  The weight of this is nice in that it is not heavy, but it does feel as if you have something in you hand.  The color purple here is not my first choice I color, but it is not bad at all.  The buttons are all on the inside, which is interesting, and the last nice point is the court is attach&amp;eacute;d to a swivel, which means that the cord doedn&#x27;t twist around, but is free to move as you use the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:?  First off, this product does exactly what is says it will do.  The fast warm up to a suitable tempature is true.  This warms up very quickly.  Second, the product does very quickly work after being powered up.  My wife indicated that the iron works easlily with one pass as it states it would.  She indicated that this works easily and without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife also really liked the buttons being on the inside, so that that buttons are out of the way. Overall, this seems like a very good and reasonably priced iron.  However,my here is one design flaw high any buyer should be aware of.  My wife consistently said that you can have some clutch of hair fall through the bottom of the iron during use and get caught as you use this on yourself.  This is not a fatal flaw at all, but the sort of open bottom does allow this to happen and any user should be aware of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall?:  This is a good, basic, hair flattening iron.  The color purple is nice but not the most inspiring color choice I have seen, but the application of a quick warm up, plus the good ability of this iron to actually straighten hair after one pass is great.  This is not a bad choice at all.</li>
    <li> We also have the Infinity Pro by Conair that does not have the Sonic vibration feature.  Compared to that one, this flat iron has the advantage of 6 temperature settings instead of 3.  The finer temperature adjustment makes the iron easier to use by my daughter, who does not worry as much about &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; her hair using this flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other Infinity Pro, it can be used to curl hair.  The better heat control gives my daughter the confidence to curl her hair by herself without help from mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also tried the sonic vibration and ended up not using it.  Could not see the benefit of it -- maybe it&#x27;s because we use this iron for curling hair instead of straightening hair.</li>
    <li> My wife has an astonishing mane of thick, curly, Irish dirty-blonde hair, the kind that gives glory to God, the kind that would turn into a Caucasian &#x27;fro if she cut it too short, which is why she keeps it at or below shoulder length; so the weight of it pulls down the pouf ball. For a celebrity comparison, think Gisele Bundchen, although Gisele&#x27;s not quite as pretty. Naturally, I love her hair, and she&#x27;s gotten many, many complements over the years. But like most women sometimes she hates it and longs for something different. Usually on those occasions she fantasizes about getting it cut short, which just as usually ends badly. But on rare occasions she&#x27;s had her hair straightened at the salon, to the amazement of myself and all our kids. She looks like a different woman! and she really feels great about it. Especially so since the style nowadays is straight and silky. So, when I saw this straightener on Amazon I thought I&#x27;d take a chance and see if it was really possible to get the same effect at home without all the expense and hassle. Here&#x27;s what she had to say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I have a thick, thick curly hair and have never had a hair straightener before, mostly due to the fact that every time I get my hair straightened at the salon, it takes forever!  This straightener gets very, very hot, which is good for someone like me with such thick hair.  The only problem with the high heat and clumsy first-time straightener users, is the burned fingers.  I have used this 3 times and have burned my fingers every single time.  I don&#x27;t know if the rate of burn will decrease the more I use it or not.  I have had to go over my hair, on average, twice before it&#x27;s straight.  It stays straight for a couple of days, which is fantastic.  Overall, from a novice user point of view, I like this straightener and would recommend it to those with hard to straighten hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes her about fifteen minutes, and when she&#x27;s done it&#x27;s almost as straight as a salon &#x27;do&#x27;, with just a bit of waviness in back where she can&#x27;t see. She looks great, everyone notices right away, and she gets a fresh round of complements on her looks from her friends. If she spent another fifteen minutes on it, I&#x27;m sure she could get it just as straight as the salon, but it wouldn&#x27;t make that much difference to the overall effect. It stays straight even after sleeping on it, and doesn&#x27;t revert to its natural curliness until the next time she shampoos. Until then I get to enjoy a new aspect of her beauty. This straightener&#x27;s not expensive at all, and it&#x27;s been a lot of fun. A real treat.of waviness in back where she can&#x27;t see.
