<li> I&#x27;d be very unhappy without it.</li>

    <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore. Got it for my grandma, she loves it.</li>
    <li> Good price..  Arrived quickly</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend this non-drying, effective soap any day. For years, I ignored the normal dermatologist recommendation for this product and used the expensive, department store or spa brands. I finally gave in expecting little from such a cheap product. My slight acne cleared right up as did my occasional dry skin.</li>
    <li> I use this product occassionally for a bubble bath.  I have sensitive skin so this is the only way for me to do so.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that there is anything wrong with this product, but it does not help to remove face makeup like I was hoping it would. It is a soothing cleanser, but it leaves my face feeling almost waxy after using it.</li>
    <li> Its ok, but i dotn feel it really cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Great been looking for it a long time!! Thank you😄</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that I have found that calms down my rosacea.  I hope I never have to be without it.</li>
    <li> My mom has been looking for this item for awhile.  She used it long ago and loved it.  Glad to have found it again.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says: it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.  It leaves my skin soft, moist, but not oily.  (For reference I have relatively oily skin around nose, forehead and chin.)  It is not a treatment for people with bad skin problems--and it doesn&#x27;t promise miracles either.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Mother always used it to wash cuts. I like to use it when I have minor skin issues.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on and off since I am 16. I am now 62.  I am often told I look like I am in my mid to late 40s.  I have sensitive skin, and it has become drier with age.  I have tried more expensive cleansers that have dried my skin or broken it out.  I have gone back to this product every time.&lt;br /&gt;It got 4 stars only because when I wear heavy makeup (which is rare), I have to apply it twice to get all the make up off. It does not dry my skin as much as most products. When I was younger I had combination skin with oil in the T zone.  My dermatologist told me PH balanced products are very good for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I should do a commercial for this product!</li>
    <li> I have used phisoderm for years but it is now hard to find it in stores any more. Glad yo have it so i can continue.</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle cleanser and works well on vrey sensitive areas.  I&#x27;d be very unhappy without it.</li>
    <li> Item was shipped promptly. It is working on skin prone to getting a rash from other soap products. Has  no perfume in it. So far very happy with product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Even though it is for sensitive skin, it will dry your skin. Bought for acne skin, did not help. Would not recommend it for bad acne, would probably do better on oily skin with occasional breakouts.</li>
    <li> never recieved product. I forgot all about this product untill seeing here in my reveiw bin...a year later. Probably my fault for not staying on top of my amazon orders... those impulse bulk orders get me everytime... this product fell through the cracks for me.  I ordered it because I had used it at a friends house while on vacation and absolutely loved the product.  I could not find it in stores inthe Chicago area.  I will consider ordering this product again in the fur\ture.</li>
    <li> Great price. Always a pleasure to do business with this seller!</li>
    <li> Works great when needing a sensitive face wash</li>
    <li> Best all over skin cleanser - no fragrance - ph balanced - residue. Have been using this product since childhood.</li>
    <li> used it many times, love it. its just hard to find. a dr suggested it years ago. so i always try to have it on hand.</li>
    <li> I used phisoderm in the 80&#x27;s and then it disappeared.  I was looking for a gentle cleanser and thought of phisoderm.  I checked online and found it, so I ordered it.  My skin looked and felt wonderful.  I ordered another one for my 91 year old mother who has very sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> this is the best face wash because it is mild and not harsh. As we get older we need mild cleansers and this one is very good. I first used it on my baby 35 years ago and I have baby soft skin thus it works well on my face.</li>
