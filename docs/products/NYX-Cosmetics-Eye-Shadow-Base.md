<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have oily skin. This stuff works like a charm.....for hours. Definitely my new must have.</li>
    <li> the product is thin and does not have a lot of pigment.</li>
    <li> This performs exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> This product works really well, my eyeshadow looked more pigmented and didn&#x27;t crease. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product made my eyelids oily and greasy. It made my eyeliner smear even more than if I hadn&#x27;t used it. Not sure how it got these good reviews, unless they&#x27;re fake. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> NYX Cosmetics are a great deal--good quality with reasonable prices, and this eyeshadow primer is no exception. Goes on smoothly, stays put all day, and prevents eyeshadow creases. Can&#x27;t ask for much more!</li>
    <li> No lid creasing. Only thing thing is there is not enough of it, I should have gotten a bigger size.</li>
    <li> It was really greasy one of the only NYX products I would not buy again. It was hard to apply eye shadow over it. I ended up buying some other NYX primer that comes in a jar that I had used before and was tried and trusted and I will be sticking to the eye shadow primer that comes in a little jar from now on.</li>
    <li> Look no further, this stuff stays on all day!!! You have to apply eye shadow immediately after applying the base, don&#x27;t wait for it to dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know man... I&#x27;d hide at home if I run out of this. It&#x27;s amazing. Here&#x27;s to never having smeared eyeshadow ever again.</li>
    <li> Works good provided you give it a min or 2 after application to set before applying eyeshadow. I have REALLY CRAZY oily skin and it barely creases after hours of use.</li>
    <li> Great dupe for urban Decay Primer Potion! use this everyday :-)</li>
    <li> honestly, I did not believe one bit that this would work. I know most base&#x27;s crease after about an hour but this one does not! I have previously had Bare Minerals primer and MAC primer - don&#x27;t get me wrong, they worked just fine, mac does harden after a while and feels like glue. This primer works just as well. And for the price! After buying this i wouldn&#x27;t bother spending 18+ on any primer again, there is no point :)</li>
    <li> Works very well under eye-shadow.  I use it for special evenings and it holds powder eye shadow all night.  I have somewhat oily skin but this product plus a little finishing powder keeps it in place.  Easy to apply but rub it in quickly to avoid any cakeiness.  This is true with any under shadow base.</li>
    <li> Nice product. easy to apply and spread all over the lead. Does not make the lead oily and the shades stay perfectly all day long.</li>
    <li> The NYX eye shadow base is the best i&#x27;ve ever used.  My eye shadow lasts ALL day..  My shadow colors use to fad into my skin and with this base the color stays true.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> By the time I left the office my make-up looked like crud - so I bought some face primer and this eye shadow base.  Why didn&#x27;t someone tell me we gals need this stuff keep our make-up from disappearing into thin air??  Now I arrive at work with a fresh face and it&#x27;s dang near the same when I leave...no primping during breaks.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...it works great!!!</li>
    <li> It is goopy and causes eye shadow to clump when applied.</li>
    <li> Love this primer ! Eye shadow stays VERY well and primer is smooth and creamy. High quality !</li>
    <li> My eye shadow doesn&#x27;t smudge, and it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I wanted a cheaper alternative to MAC and so after looking around I got this one.  I love the applicator, extremely easy to use and coats eyelid evenly.  I also love how awesome my eyeshadow pops with this underneath it and it stays ALL day with no creases even though I got creases with the more expensive MAC primers.  Just make sure you have eye makeup remover because it works so well it can be hard to get off ;0)  Wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I got a sample of TooFaced Shadow Insurance and was shocked to find that I got creases within a few hours of using it.  It&#x27;s way more expensive and didn&#x27;t work half as well as the NYX, which I switched back to immediately.</li>
    <li> I have always had nasty eyeshadow at the end of the day and runny eyeliner.  I found NYX eye shadow base a few years ago and it really works well in keeping your makeup in place ALL day long!  Absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> decreased creasing in my eye shadow. helps the look last through my 15 hour day.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 10 stars I would! I live in Arizona and eye shadows just don&#x27;t stay on very well in 110 degree heat. Plus I always had problems with creasing. This base lasted the entire day! At the end of the day my makeup looked like I&#x27;d just applied it. Fantastic! Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is great!&lt;br /&gt;It acted as sort of a concealer on my veiny lids. My eyeshadow lasted longer and popped a little more. It did its job quite nicely.</li>
    <li> My first eyelid primer and I really like it i&#x27;ve tried it on, and it stays on for more then 3 hrs while you&#x27;re running around, i haven&#x27;t tried it for an \\&quot;All day\\&quot; look , but i have high hopes for this in the near future. I also have sensitive skin, so it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyelids, and so far i&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Wow. Just... I am blown away. I&#x27;ve used quite a few different primers, up to Urban Decay and Too Faced products. This is just as good and works just as well. Superglues my eyeshadow into place (which is a chore with my oily eye sockets) at 1/3 the cost of Urban Decay or Too Faced. $6 and the same quality as higher brand stuff? SOLD!</li>
    <li> I have used with with my MAC eye shadow and it works pretty well at holding on the color. I did get some creasing though. However, if you use it with a cheap brand eye shadow, forget it. I&#x27;ve tried this with 2 or 3 different cheap brands and it smeared all over the place and wouldn&#x27;t go on evenly. It was all over my face by the end of the day. It&#x27;s also a bit oily for me, especially since my skin tends to me more on the oily side to begin with.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I was skeptical at first not believe it would work.  I know most base&#x27;s crease after about an hour or but this one does not!  This one last longer.  This primer works just as well. And for the price, it&#x27;s a great deal.  I don&#x27;t think i would ever want to spend over $20 for some other brands</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe this is actually better than Urban Decay&#x27;s Eyeshadow Primer Potion and Mac&#x27;s Painterly Pot‎! I use it everyday and my eyeshadow lasts all day! What a great deal!</li>
    <li> I just got my eyeshadow base a couple days ago and I love it. It matches my skin tone so before I apply shadow my eye area is brightened. It just takes a minute to apply and blend. I really like checking my makeup after a long day and finding it still there! Instead of disappearing into thin air like it usually does, my shadow was there on my eyes and still looked fresh. This is a very nice primer.</li>
    <li> I can wear eyeshadow all day long, I have pretty oily eyelids and my eyeshadow would smear together and leave lines, not with this!</li>
    <li> Oh this product is great! I have always used &amp;#34;department store&amp;#34; cosmetics since I have very sensitive skin and have to be-careful. On a recommendation, I tried this product (for the price, why not!) and I love it! I say it works just as well if not better than some higher end eye primers. I didn&#x27;t have any reaction at all to it. I really liked the applicator since I prefer not to use my fingers to put it on. I lasted all day and night, didn&#x27;t alter the color of my eye shadows, and was very easy to get off. The only things I noticed was it took longer to dry than some of my other primers so I had to get used to that. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love the stuff I would definitely buy it again. It was a great price and it goes on nicely!</li>
    <li> I love this base! It is smooth and very easy to apply. My eye makeup stays put! I would recommend to allow it to set and do one final blend before  applying your eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this primer!! I have been using another big name eyeshadow primer for the last couple of years. It worked great, but was incredibly expensive. I decided to try this primer, really not expecting much for something so cheap. It works amazing! I actually love it more than the previous product I was using, and it costs five times less. I have pretty oily eyelids, but you would never know it with this stuff... it holds my shadow on all day and night. There&#x27;s never any creasing or smudging. This product is a steal for the price. I will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I got the NYX brand to avoid paying $18 for a wand of Urban Decay (which I do LOVE) and I&#x27;m happy to say this is just as good!  So I highly recommend the product if you are looking for an easy application, all-day wear, cheaper product.  I don&#x27;t know that there is much difference between the high def and regular but to boost color, I got the high def.  It&#x27;s not noticeable if you use it alone, without shadow, which is nice.</li>
    <li> This product is really amazing! My eyeshadow and -liner lasts the whole day, and even become a bit waterproof! My order said that I would receive in a month, but I already got it in two weeks! I can highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Excellent primer base for the eyes, dries to nice soft finish, lasts all day for me and makes your eye shadow pop.</li>
    <li> This primer is comparable to (if not better than) the $40 primers you can buy in department stores or from expensive lines. WORKS SO WELL. I have oily skin and I live in Houston where the humidity is always high so I&#x27;ve lived with eyeshadow creasing for forever... BUT this product changed everything. I no longer crease, run, smudge, or fade. Colors of shadows are true to what they are on the palette, they apply easily, and they blend smoothly. I have to use makeup remover or baby oil to remove my shadow now. Such a wonderful buy!</li>
    <li> I will buy this over and over again great stuff! Lasts all day and fills in my tiny lines awesome</li>
    <li> I liked this eye shadow base at first, but it seemed to dry and flake off after about 12 hours of wear.</li>
    <li> it is really easy to use and keeps your eyeshadow on all day</li>
    <li> I really like this it just has a weird smell.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price and I&#x27;ve noticed my eyeshadow stays on a lot longer I would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> Now that most of the eye primers available at Sephora (including Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion) have managed to reach $20+, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a cheaper alternative.  I gave NYX&#x27;s primer a shot because of all the positive reviews, but I&#x27;m very disappointed with it.  My eyeshadow didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours before beginning to crease.  NYX eyeshadows are nice but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend their primer.  I had far better luck with L&#x27;Oreal DeCrease.</li>
    <li> Bought due to the great reviews.. This product is nothing more than a concealer, does absolutely nothing to set eyeshadow or liner. I am spoiled by Urban Decay... which this product shares no common factors. Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
    <li> Kind of runny. Made my eyeshadow and liner slide right off when it was made to make it stay in place.</li>
    <li> Its a little greasy and doesnt soak in very quickly but it does make the colors more vibrant and stay on longer.</li>
    <li> got this because my elf one was out and not so impressive. (still creasing and not holding eyeshadow long..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, i purchased this one because of the great reviews. great buy. easy to apply. (i untwist the bottle and spin it as i pull it out so i can get as much product as possible. i wipe it on my finger and apply it that way) it totally works just as good as ud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product is just what I needed to fix my problem- eyeshadow creasing and fading. This primer helps my eyeshadow last all day, and I no longer have to deal with the creasing or fading I was experiencing before. It&#x27;s, in my opinion, just about as good as the Urban Decay Primer Potion. I highly recommend this primer to anyone!</li>
    <li> I prefer my $3 elf primer to this. On the positive side, it does definitely improve pigmentation for your eyeshadows. However, the primer itself has a somewhat greasy, slippery texture that doesn&#x27;t dry out. The primer can crease on your lids before you put your shadow on. Because I&#x27;m not about to waste the whole bottle of primer, I make it work by applying my Rimmel Stay Matte powder over my eyelid after primer and before eyeshadow. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it goes on smooth and it makes my eye shadow pop! Great price, for a great long lasting primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product for others!</li>
    <li> It helps reflect light from the shadows under my eyes and brightens the lids of my deepest eyes. Oh, and if you put concealer or show or makeup on top---it glides on without clinging to the creases. Very nice! Have used the Korres brand and this is MUCH nicer and lasts much longer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It helps any eye shadow I have stand out and last longer! Definitely worth buying!!</li>
    <li> As good a product as the high end I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> For me the jury is still out on these products.  I&#x27;m uncertain if they really help.  But overall, it seems like it probably works as it should.</li>
    <li> I was moderately disappointed by the fact that you really need to blend the primer into your eyes and take time to let it dry (1.5-2 mins) before applying anything else. I was mildly disappointed that I had to sweep it over my upper lids twice, and unhappy when it creased in my epicanthic folds.</li>
    <li> Great eyeshadow primer. I used to use Lorac Eye primer and it is over $20. This one is way cheaper and seriously works the same. My eyeshadow stays on exactly the same and for the same amount of time (all and I mean ALL day). It&#x27;s great, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product and it came in the mail within a week of ordering it. I find that it creases a little but I think I might be using it wrong. Other than that this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this base because I only need to use a little bit and my eyeshadow lasts all day without creasing.  I also use it under my eyes to help my concealer work even better.  At this price, you will not find a better product!</li>
    <li> This creases and settles. I don&#x27;t understand how it is supposed to help prime the lids for crease-proof eyeshadow when it doesn&#x27;t even do that itself. I don&#x27;t have wrinkly lids by any means, and they&#x27;re not really oily but certainly not dry... but this product is so oily that it seems to bring out lines that I didn&#x27;t even know I had. Too bad, because the price is excellent and I love many other NYX products. If you have super dry eyelids, your experience may be different.</li>
    <li> Not bad for a fraction of the cost as UD Primer Potion but I&#x27;ll be going back to UD once this is gone.</li>
    <li> I am used to MAC&#x27;s paint pot, so the milky consistency threw me off a bit at first but I got used to it. The two are like the difference between cream and liquid foundation. Anyway, it kept my eye shadow looking fresh all day, and for a good price. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I noticed a strong odor as soon as I opened it. I thought it would burn when I put it on but it didn&#x27;t. It applys evenly and easily. I didn&#x27;t use the best eyeshadow with it so I can&#x27;t really say how long lasting it is. Over all happy customer.</li>
    <li> I guess I don&#x27;t like this as much as I thought I would but I do admit that it DEFINITELY makes your eye shadow stand out much more. I am able to use a really small amount of eye shadow and it looks like BAM!</li>
    <li> This is a good base and I like it but I didn&#x27;t purchase it again because I needed a tinted eye shadow base because my eyelids vary in color.</li>
    <li> I read an online review for all the primers out there and this one received top marks.  Skeptical I decided to try it and yes the reviews are true.  I do have oily skin and typically my eye shadow fades but this brand keeps my eye shadow flawless all day long!  I love it.  I will not waste more money on expensive primers when this does the trick!</li>
    <li> I bought this by review recommendation and I will say it does highlight in a subtle way. It&#x27;s moist and feels good on the eyelid and undereye area.  There&#x27;s not a lot of product in the tube for the money, however.  I  am still on the hunt for something better.</li>
    <li> It really enhances your eye shadow color .by the way, is great for your really light pibmintated eyeshadow colors.love it</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and excellent product.</li>
    <li> I like it and would pay again.. My make up last long which makes me a happy chick.and I also told my friend to pay some</li>
    <li> i love it when you can find a good deal off of Amazon, and this base can be purchased for a lot less expensive than what it normally retails for.  It has a thin consistency and is a little wet (it might take a little bit of time to dry). but I love the way this thing blends, the way it holds the eyeshadow, and I don&#x27;t mind the doe-foot applicator. I would consider this comparable to UDPP.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love NYX primer. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and NYX has definitely been the winner. I love how my eyeshadow lasts and stands out while using this product. I love how long it lasts too!</li>
    <li> The base is too oily and causes the makeup to look too runny.  I am going back to Loreal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow feels really greasy to apply, but my eyes don&#x27;t feel oily all day and the color lasts 12+ hours after applying eyeshadow to this base.  Big fan, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the expensive brands!</li>
    <li> What in the world?! A lot of people gave this product great reviews... When I put it, on my eyeshadow clumps a little... To make itvwork, I have to put it in WAY before I put on the rest of my makeup so it can dry out... My eyeshadow stays on all day w/out re-applying! MAC has a great eyeshadow base primers, which is a substance of cream/gel that dries smooth (fantastic, but expensive)!</li>
    <li> This item is great, I use this every day to apply my eyeshadow. It helps the color stay on all day and it does not crease.  I really love this product, I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Great product; great price.&lt;br /&gt;It is slightly light for my skin tone so I have to really blend it or it will show whittish if i&#x27;m using a a light eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Keeps shadow from &amp;#34;creasing,&amp;#34; spreading, smearing, and looking a general mess even after 12+ hours. It also makes my eye lids feel great! This will be a staple in my make up bag for sure.</li>
    <li> Great shadow base for us with oily lids.  Really keeps the shadow lasting all day long.  Wish it had more of a cover color though.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help avoid concealer caking in the fine lines under my eyes.  does not seem to help.</li>
    <li> Its a good buy for the money. Creamy without being oily and a good skin color. But it does not last as long as I would like it to and it could have better consistency (felt too transparent).</li>
    <li> Sorry I bought it.  I much prefer other brands, this simply didn&#x27;t make the cut in performance.  I&#x27;d avoid buying it.</li>
    <li> Unlike others, I can&#x27;t say this is as comparable to the Urban Decay eye primer. However, this works as a cheap solution should I ever run out. It&#x27;s definitely not a bad primer and does its job well!</li>
    <li> NYX Cosmetics knows what its doing, and they prove it again with this eye shadow base.  The wand makes it easy to apply and it really does make my eye shadow last all day.  The price is a bargain too!</li>
    <li> Great eyeshadow base, It stays on all day, It is very creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dupe for Urban Decay Primer Potion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must buy for this price</li>
    <li> Love it!  I use to only use a more expensive brand eye shadow potion base.  This stuff is just as good and half the price! My eye shadow lasts ALL DAY when I use this first! This is a new must have in my makeup bag!!</li>
    <li> I have a huge issue with my eyeshadow coming off within hours. With this primer my shadow stays on all day. Once the primer dries, you can&#x27;t even feel it.</li>
    <li> Just like urban decay primer potion. Not good for people with really oily eyelids, though. I&#x27;ve been using this product for like a year.</li>
    <li> eye shadows lasted all day for me in the office. Outdoor may not last as long as indoor. great product.</li>
    <li> I was in no way what so ever hired to right any of this. I am a 15 year old girl who has loved and been interesting in makeup for a few years now. I love highlighting natural beauty and just seeing what I can do with this. I absolutely love love love this product, and it has caused me to buy other products from this brand and I am very happy with what I get. Also, prices are cheap for such a high quality product. I use this base every day!</li>
    <li> I apply 1-2 drops and my eye shadow stays put even after a long day! its shocking for me b/c usually when i have  eye shadow, some of it fades away since I have oily skin. so deff recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Ok, but watery compared to other primers. Not my favorite. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Used it for my wedding (had a last minute headache with a scheduled MUA, so I had to do my own make-up). My eyeshadow showed beautifully on camera. I also love it for going out if I&#x27;m dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip: if you draw/fill in your brows, use a thin layer before going in with pencil or shadow. Will keep them looking on point all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extra long stay I recommend pairing with Ben Nye setting spray.</li>
    <li> My favorite primer. I prefer this over e.l.f.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m give this item four stars bacuese is not perfect as Urben Dcu primar but not bad and not clear the shadow on my lied</li>
    <li> This product definitely helps my eyeliner to stay on all day long. Without it my eyeliner (no matter what brand used) runs. No more! This product is a must.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this one again,  without a question.  If they ever get rid of it,  I&#x27;ll just cry and cry and cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several others including Smashbox and there&#x27;s simply no comparison -  NYX nailed this,  and they nailed it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right,  too.  While it&#x27;s not the cheapest,  it&#x27;s nowhere near the most expensive and as far as quality goes you can&#x27;t get more bang for your buck.  As a comparison,  NYX is around $25/ounce.  Smashbox runs around $250/ounce and Urban Decay comes in around $50/ounce.  Yes,  you read that right.  25 vs. 250 vs. 50 of my hard-earned dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I pointed this out to my husband,  he gave me one of his best &amp;#34;...so...tell me again why people would spend 10 times that?&amp;#34; looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly!</li>
    <li> it keeps my shadow and liner in place all day even through a 12 hour day of work. love it!</li>
    <li> My first experience was with UD Primer Potion and although it works okay, I still crease by the end of the day. Not so with this primer. Not only does it keep my eyeshadow on all day but it also conceals the discoloration on get on my eyelid, making a smooth base for my makeup. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> WORST primer EVER!!! I don&#x27;t know why this primer is so greasy, it doesn&#x27;t seem like primer at all. I&#x27;ll stick to my Urban Decay primer. A waste of time AND money!</li>
    <li> Similar in formulation to Smashbox&#x27;s primer. Amazing value for the price. Odor/color free and REALLY stays put,reduces fallout and does it&#x27;s job!!</li>
    <li> This eye shadow base is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve never used base before, so I decided to try it out and I can say that I am amazed by this product. You cannot beat the price either. I&#x27;ve slept with my makeup on at night and woke up with perfect eye makeup. No smears or smudges! Anytime a makeup product that can make your makeup last that long is a great product in my book. You will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best.  I got my mother hooked on it as well.  Eyeshadow will not move!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry like urban decay brand stays oily feeling not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love bright colored eyeshadows and this product makes every color I use super bright!  It goes on smoothly and is a staple in my makeup collection!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find that this product works as well as other products I have used. Would not buy again. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The only eyeshadow base i use period! NYX is the BOMB!!! Holds my eyeshadows all day and night and it never creases or gets oily on my lids!!!</li>
    <li> It keeps my eye shadow on nicely</li>
    <li> This product works great! I still have some crease lines at the end of the day which are noticeable if I&#x27;m wearing a darker eye shadow, but I think it works better than having no primer at all. Can&#x27;t beat the price! Applies easy too! I would compare this to the more expensive urban decay that I also use.</li>
    <li> I had to remove this eye shadow base in order to put on my shadow! It matted and caked as I was applying it. Threw it out....</li>
    <li> love it, goes on easy and helps eye shadow last and keep colors vivid...</li>
    <li> This is the first eye shadow base that I&#x27;ve used. But, it made my eye shadow pop and last longer. And, it&#x27;s very affordable. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Palladio e/s base was my low end staple for eye primer, but I decided to try this and couldn&#x27;t be happier. My eye lids are oily and e/s does not crease and looks more vibrant when this is used underneath. I love this! I will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> i bought this product at Ulta on kind of an impulse, I was looking for primer and this one was pretty cheap compared to other brands.  And let me just say that it is amazing!  It is so worth the money!  It truly does what it is supposed to do, and it kept my eyeshadow on all day long and even made it a little easier to take off at the end of a long day which is a huge plus! If you are looking for an eye primer definitely try this one.</li>
    <li> This helps my eyeshadow stay in place and makes the color more vibrant</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my eyeshadow pop on my eyes!  It also increases the wear time!</li>
    <li> I like the NYX HD eyeshadow base. When I put it on before i put on the eyeshadow, i have to let it dry a little. Anyways, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Great base for my oily eyelids</li>
    <li> Love love love this primer! I have slightly oily eyelids and I live in Colorado and it works just fine. I took a trip to Miami and decided to  take this with me. It was amazing!!! No creasing whatsoever and my eyeshadow lasted ALL day! Even if I was sweating lol.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it worked! I&#x27;m planning on buying a few more of these just so I make SURE I don&#x27;t run out. Lol&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> This primer is terrible, I&#x27;m really surprised at all the good reviews. I have average skin, not too oily, not too dry, and this primer seemed to make my eyelids a bit oily and my eyeshadow creased halfway through the day.  I really do like loreal decrease and will go back to using that.</li>
    <li> This really does what it is supposed to do- keeps your eyeshadow in place. Plus, it is an HD product, so no white glow in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is a creamy peach that isn&#x27;t super noticeable when you put it on your skin and it sets to a smooth matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;It is very affordable, and a great product for the price,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of eye shadow base and bought this based on other reviews. It&#x27;s much oilier than any other brand I&#x27;ve used - and the color is very light, almost white. Unless you leave a thicker layer (which pretty much gives you what looks like white eye shadow - and then will be thick if you add to the top of it) it doesn&#x27;t do much to provide a base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to use a lot of shadow and only put it on my lids, not up towards my eyebrows, so maybe this works well for those who go all out with their makeup. Personally, I&#x27;ll stick with L&#x27;Oreal or one of the other brands.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used to always use Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion, but at 20 dollars or more a pop, I had to figure out another solution. After doing research online about the cheapest eyeshadow primer that still performs at the same level as the high end products, I purchased the NYX Eye Shadow Base, and it is  a m a z i n g. My shadow lasted all day with no creasing. Definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I used this primer today under a Shany Eyeshadow palette. My eyeshadow was very defined and lasted at least 4 hours (I washed it off after that). My only complaint is that after I opened and closed it a few times, some of the primer got on the container and on the stick. When I closed it, some of the eye shadow base got on to the out side of the container. Overall, this is a good product and I would recommend it for someone looking for a good, cheap eye shadow base.</li>
    <li> Chalky and didn&#x27;t blend well at all. I would not purchase this item again although I love my other NYX products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always considered Urban Decay&#x27;s eyeshadow base the best around but then I tried this and loved it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primary reason:  cost! That product retails for around $30 Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nude skintone color. Not colorless. But works well for lighter skin types. Easiest way is take wand and dot several times over lid and brow bone, and gently blend in. Let sit for a minute in order for it to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; Then apply shadow. No creasing and shadows stays put all day. Yes, Urban Decay&#x27;s product is very good, but this performs just as well and costs a whole lot less.</li>
    <li> An ulta store recently opened up where i live and i bought this nyx eye shadow primer at the nyx section. i tried it shortly after i bought and WOW, this is another amazing primer. my eyeshadow stayed put and didn&#x27;t smudge and crease and since this is another reasonably priced eye primer i&#x27;m now in love with, there&#x27;s no need for me to shell out $30 for an eye primer.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try after coming across it on one of the &amp;#34;Top Ten&amp;#34; products lists that they&#x27;re always coming out with (I forget which magazine...sorry if that&#x27;s important).  I&#x27;ve been spending $20 a tube for similar products from Benefit and Smashbox, so I figured it was worth a shot. I&#x27;m actually really surprised at how much I like this stuff and how well it works. Your eye shadow stays on all day/night, just as well as the more expensive brands AND I don&#x27;t have the weird film that I get from the other two from where you can see the excess product on your eye lids. It does take some getting used to, because the consistency is a bit different - I kept trying to wait for it to dry before applying my shadow, but it never seems to. I recommend applying a layer of eye shadow right after putting on the NYX base, then wait five minutes and apply a second layer. Then you&#x27;re good to go all day.</li>
    <li> After moving to SC, nomatter what eyeshaddow I used, it always creased and faded due to the heat and humidity.  This product is great!! No creasing and no fading!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and i thought this product was going to be amazing.But no it&#x27;s just as good as elf eyelid primer.This product is not worth the money.It&#x27;s ok but there is nothing &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34; about it.</li>
    <li> This is a great primer. Blends well, just dont use too much. A little goes a long way. I use the applicator to put a little on my lid then I blend in with my finger. I use it only when I am going out or social events and it hold and makes my eyeshadow POP! And it stays all night long. Must have!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after reading some reviews about it. Honestly, I probably won&#x27;t re-buy it in the future. It&#x27;s alright for a cheaper eyeshadow base</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have oily skin, so maybe that&#x27;s why.  My eyeshadow didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> I was using a more expensive brand and when it ran out I switched to NYX, the only difference is the extra money in my wallet. Great product!</li>
    <li> IS SOOOOOO GOOD!!!! I will buy ALWAYS this one, I put it like at 7 am, and went to my company&#x27;s breakfast for the media, I was in middle of the heat in the street and running all over the place, then went to classes in the university and got back home at 11pm and my eyeshadow looked so great! like if i just applied it. I LOVE THIS PRIMER!!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye shadow base that works and is reasonably priced. I tried many brands. If they work they tend to be extremely pricey for the average budget. Sometimes they were pricey and didn&#x27;t even work well which was a double whammy. After reading an article on shadow base brands I decided to try NYX Eye Shadow Base High Definition. What did I have to lose considering it is inexpensive? I was concerned when I first applied it to my eyelids because it was really smooth and creamy and that is usually a sign that it won&#x27;t work well. I was pleasantly surprised though. My eyeshadow didn&#x27;t crease by the end of the day. I had to reapply some contour color shadow much later in the day to go out but that could just be because I wear it darker to go out at night. All in all I am pleased with how it holds my shadow on for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is a lot better than the eye shadow primer. It&#x27;s a bit more wetter and goes on more smoother. I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> It seems good. Nothing that special but it does do its job alright. My colors stay in place for a few hours,</li>
    <li> great primer, especially for the price. stays on all day, and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Works really well and keeps your make up on all day.</li>
    <li> Lousy product.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing to keep eyeshadow in place.  I have oily skin and this base didn&#x27;t do anything to stop the natural oils from interfering with my eye makeup.  Waste of $.</li>
    <li> I use a tinted moisturizer as my makeup base and it makes my eyelids greasy by the end of the day and my shadow/liner always creases. Not with this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t budge. I finally found a great product that is affordable and I would recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I&#x27;m a bit lazy and since this stuff works so well, I just leave my makeup on for a second days wear. It doesn&#x27;t come off with just washing alone.</li>
    <li> I really like it,  it makes my eye shadow stay longer and makes my color look beautiful :)</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and great shopping experience.</li>
    <li> I really like Nyx products.  I have been hooked on them since they were awarded to the Queen who won RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race.  A Lifetime supply no doubt...wish I was a queen...Might be kind of awkward in the dressing room though!  That being said, I really like the quality of this product.  My eyeshadow really POPs when I use this, and really that is the point right ladies??  Looking good at affordable prices.  Love Nyx, love this Base, love my look!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now, and my eye shadow creasing has stopped!  I don&#x27;t wear it every day, but when I know I&#x27;m going to have a long day I definitely put it on that morning and my eye makeup looks still fresh by the end of the day.  I haven&#x27;t tried the creams, but I love this liquid with wand applicator.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days, and there hasn&#x27;t been any creasing. Love it. The key is to use very little, you don&#x27;t want to overdo with this product, the less the better. Love it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the High Definition shade, and I&#x27;m impressed. It feels lotiony, not greasy, and is easy to apply -- and it really does make your eyeshadow colors pop! I see a dramatic difference (I like nudes and subtle shades, and without the primer they often disappear completely). On my very dry lids, this primer will hold shadow all day. Because of the texture, I do wonder if it might perform worse for oilier complexions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, is easy to use, comes in perfectly fine packaging, and is cheaper than dirt. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I really like this primer however I find it most helpful to wipe the majority of primer off of the applicator tip before applying.  This way I can prevent it from creasing on my eyelid before I get a chance to put on my eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I will certainly buy another one. It is very smooth eye shadow base, odorless, matches immediately with your skin and it is not sticky. I definitely recommend NYX eye shadow base.</li>
    <li> I like it, but now that I&#x27;ve tried the NYX Milk pencils I loooove the milk pencil way more.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing shadow base! Doesn&#x27;t crease, shadows stay in place at least 8-10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;And for the price, you just can&#x27;t wish more!</li>
    <li> This base does the job. It goes on smoothly and results in a creaseless application of your eyeshadow. Once I started using this base, I can&#x27;t live without it. It decreases the amount of fall out and less product is absorbed in your brushes.</li>
    <li> It does the job and I have noticed that my eye shadow stay on throughout the entire day. Pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works like it should! It leaves you&#x27;re eyeshadow looking fresh for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wear eyeshadow pretty much every day so I want something that is more affordable than UDPP. This is the only drugstore primer I can find that has got good reviews so I decided to give it a try. It works great. It makes my eye shadow stays on for at least eight hours without a slight smudge. And it is very easy to apply. There are couple reasons why I give it four stars instead of five. First of all, this primer has a weird consistency. It is kind of oily when I first apply it on my eyelid. However, it does dry matte. Second of all, it doesn&#x27;t make my eye shadow colors more vibrant like some other primers do. Also it claims to be a eye shadow base so I was expecting it to make my eye shadows pop. But for seven dollars it gets the job done and I will definitely repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because due to having an oily face my eyeshadow is always gone within a few hours. It tied this base a few days ago and I was so happy to see my shadow was almost intact after a full day at the office. No need for touch ups and didn&#x27;t come off until I washed my face before bed. I will be ordering more for myself and some for stocking stuffers!</li>
    <li> It works but you have to let it dry for a long time. Its way to runny for me. I shouldve stuck with urban decay.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found to keep eye shadow in place!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It works better than any other primer I&#x27;ve tried, keeping eye shadow on all day long and really not letting it accidentally get smudged at all. Easy enough to get off with eye makeup remover though so it&#x27;s not as though you have to scrub it off. Stays on even if you&#x27;re crying. It doesn&#x27;t take much of the product to get a good layer on your eyelids. One tube of this lasts a very long time. I don&#x27;t plan on trying any other bases/primers again anytime soon because this one has worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> The item was broken when I received it.  I threw it away.  However under your replacement section you are wanting me to return an item that could not be returned.  I would like a replacement.  Did not realize that it an item was broken and leaking all over the place that I should have kept it and returned it to you.</li>
    <li> I love this product, It definitely works for me. I would definitely recommend for you guys to buy this. It really works.</li>
    <li> This product was very oily for me, could be I got a bad tube.  Used it twice and through it out.</li>
    <li> Not the best I&#x27;ve used....just doesn&#x27;t work when used under eye to keep black eyeliner from smudging.</li>
    <li> I ended up giving this away because it creased within an hour.</li>
    <li> Literally the best eye shadow base/primer I have ever used.... I have always loved nyx products and this tops it off. My eyeshadow stays on all day with no creases or smudging</li>
    <li> I use this eye shadow base every single day but it seems as if there is an infinite amount inside the tube. The price is the lowest I have seen for a product of such good quality.</li>
    <li> Definitely gets to you soon after ordering! Haven&#x27;t tried it out much yet, but it appears to be a high quality product. The color of the product is also perfect for my complexion! Impressed, and very much worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye shadow base I have ever used!! It makes any color of eyeshadow vibrant and shimmery. I have never used NYX products before, and after using this shadow base, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to use another base again.</li>
    <li> Works just as good if not better than my expensive eyeshadow primer.  Definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I had no idea this little wand of magic could make my shadows pop! with zing! and More dazzle.  ,plus it stays put for as long as u want it too. Without that Horrible Oil and Shadow build-up in the creases ive, seen on ladies when they blink! after a long day.. ,i mainly bought it for that ..and what do u know? ..it worked. FAST shipping AUTHENTIC product! And HAPPY ME! YAY!</li>
    <li> This product prevents creasing and makes shadow stay on!  It should not be used if you&#x27;re experimenting with color, because you&#x27;ll need makeup remover to start over if you decide you don&#x27;t like the color eye shadow you&#x27;re using.  But blending is still possible with it (but you cannot wipe a color of shadow totally off without makeup remover) and it definitely prevents creasing which is why I tried it in the first place.  A little bit goes a long way, so the tube should last quite a while.  Overall, great value, great product, I highly recommend it.   2 years after my original purchase, I&#x27;m still working from the same tube! A little goes a long way! Great value</li>
    <li> The consistency of this primer is certainly different than others I&#x27;ve used, like that of Rimmel or Elf, which are usually quite thick like a concealer almost. This glides on like a very sheer BB Cream, though does little to cover any redness/discoloration in the eyelids. Nonetheless, it works like a charm! Your eyeshadow will stick like glue to this primer, and look vibrant and beautiful for hours! I even fell asleep with my makeup on one night (not recommended, kids!) and woke up with my green eyeshadow still as bright as ever. Lovely primer that feels a little odd but certainly does the job!</li>
    <li> Using this dramatically increases the pigmentation of my eyeshadows.  It&#x27;s essentially sheer once it goes on, but it seems to suck in the shadow and hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also REALLY increases the staying power of my shadows.  I used it as a base to swatch a bunch of colors on my forearm the other day.  After hours rubbing against the inside of my sleeve the colors still popped and only faint traces transferred onto the sleeve.  Even after running water and handsoap over it, a surprising amount of shadow stayed in place.  I had to use face wash to get the swatches to come all the way off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the downside is that when I wash my face at night I have to work a little more intensely over the lids, but it&#x27;s a pretty reasonable trade off for day-long pigment.</li>
    <li> I could defiantly tell the difference within the first time of using!&lt;br /&gt;it really brought out the color of darker and medium toned eyeshadows for me!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying from again!</li>
    <li> On the basis of perfectly blend the shade, not showered and not collected. Excellent! I&#x27;m recomended!!! Very good seller! My order came quickly! Will definitely order again and again.</li>
    <li> I know there are better working more expensive eye shadow primers but this worked well for me someone who was just learning how to do eye shadow.</li>
    <li> bought it for a 14 yr old girl and it suited its purpose, worked stayed on bright white and easy to apply</li>
    <li> This product is really smooth and lasts a long time without drying out, like other makeup bases I&#x27;ve owned.  It blends well into my natural skin fair skin color.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t worth the postage to get it... just didn&#x27;t do what an eyeshadow base is supposed to do..&lt;br /&gt;disappointed and returned product.</li>
    <li> It kept my shadow on for more than 12 hours!I can&#x27;t live without it! :)Before I used to use the elf eyelid primer...which sucked for me..</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was skeptical ordering this. I read over the customer reviews mostly good ones, but some customers  weren&#x27;t pleased. I tried other eyeshadow primers and was sadly disappointed, so I admit I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this one.  I have oily eyelids and nothing stays on long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I finally decided to go ahead and try this so I ordered it and I received it on a Saturday. It just so happens my fiancee and I were going out to run some errands and get some lunch.  So after I showered and sat down at the vanity to apply my makeup, I thought \\&quot;Ooh, that&#x27;s right I can try my primer today.\\&quot; So I put it on, applied my eyeshadow and went out around 11:00am.  It&#x27;s now 8:00pm and I am SO happy to report that my eyeshadow is still going strong. BUT this is what really sold me on this NYX shadow base. I fell asleep from about 9-11pm, woke up and went to the bathroom and as I was washing my hands, I looked at myself in the mirror and actually gasped!  My eyeshadow color was still vibrant, .no creasing, no smearing.  WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in days past, if I had applied my eyeshadow at 11am and came home at 8pm then fell asleep I&#x27;d have all kinds of creasing, smearing, diminished color.  All I can say is I&#x27;m sold.  This will definitely be my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; primer now.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Well not impressed at all. It goes on kind of watery.  My eyeshadows don&#x27;t last all day as it does with some higher priced primers. I have a wide assorment of eyeshadows, from expensive to inexpensive, and none seem to work with this primer.</li>
    <li> Yup, it is a base and does hold eye shadow color all day. I use it to mask the lines around my eyes and add a smudge to my inner eye making my eyes look brighter. Goes on very well, only use a little. Tried an experiment, one day with, one day without the base. Without the base, my shadow color became non-existent after 4 hours and with the base the color stayed on all day until I removed it at night. This will bring the color of your shadow out more so if wearing say a green shadow, with the base the green will have a shimmer to it. So if using shimmer shadow be aware that this will enhance the shimmer. With only using a little, this will probably last a few months.</li>
    <li> I had been using Smashbox eye primer, but found it to be slightly thick and dry. This was very sheer, very light, and it did not feel as if it \\&quot;primed\\&quot; my eye. I gave it a good shake and tried to rub the wand around in it just to make sure that the product hadn&#x27;t separated, but that didn&#x27;t change the consistency at all. I also didn&#x27;t think that it made my eyeshadow pop anymore than foundation. I will probably continue to use it under my eye since it&#x27;s so light. Hopefully, it will help keep my undereye concealer from creasing. Unless it helps with that, I will not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: for some reason this review is coming up in the wrong spot, but the above review is for the black tube of NYX primer. I bought the pots of primer in the White Base and Skin Tone Base, which I love! I use the white when I really want my colors to pop or contrast, and I use the skin tone when I&#x27;m using earth tone eye shadows. With both primers a little goes a long way. They go on smoothly, are easy to blend, and allow for seamless eye shadow application. I always blend my shadow with a blending brush after applying and the primer keeps it in place ALL DAY. I&#x27;ve used several brands of primer: MAC, SmashBox, and several store brands and these two are the best. The only one that is as good is the MAC, but why spend $16 or more when this is so much cheaper?</li>
    <li> I wear this under my eye shadows nearly every weekday and the eyeshadow has been creasing as well as rubbing off. Just as good as nothing. Shame, I really like NYX&#x27;s primer in the black tube!</li>
    <li> FYI, I have 50+ year old eyes.  They need all the help they can get.  This goes on moist and slick and holds the powders well.  It even has a bit of a foundation tint to it, so that helps with dark circles. It keeps my shadows from creasing or disappearing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> eyeshadow base/primer that actually keeps the shadow in place all day! I get no creasing, no smudging with this stuff, unlike other eyeshadows I&#x27;ve tried. You can get the same thing at CVS if you don&#x27;t want to wait for shipping, and it tends to be pretty cheap. Don&#x27;t pay through the nose for $20 top of the line eyeshadow base, this will get the job done and look pretty and natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;note: I have light-medium skin. this is tinted light-peach-colored, so on darker skin it might look weird.</li>
    <li> I purchased the HD Eye Shadow base and was not one of the lucky ones in this review pool. I applied the product and rubbed it on clean eyes with clean fingers. It applied smoothly with a very &#x27;creamy&#x27; slip. I could visibly see the stuff crease in my eye not one minute later. Next day, I try again. Same thing, except I wait a minute, and again massage it in with my finger, making sure it &#x27;dried&#x27; up. It disappeared nicely with a less slippery finish. But again it creased and still had a sheen, not at all what an eye primer should feel or look like. Eye primer should go on smooth and dry in a matte, almost chalky way. There should be no shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going to Target and got e.l.f. eye primer for a $1. Bingo bango, beautiful eyes!</li>
    <li> purchased through the Diversity A to Z seller.  looks used even though a sticker was on it sealing it as a new product.  the outside is all banged up with scratches. the inside looks okay i guess so i&#x27;m keeping it anyway since it was only $7 and i need a primer today.  tried a couple of swatches with and without the primer and it seems to work well.  next time, i&#x27;ll just spend the extra moeny and go back to the urban decay primer potion.</li>
    <li> Eye shadow seems to crease at the latter part of the day...not terribly, but not as many hours as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I gave up wearing eye shadow and just wore eyeliner because my skin is so oily that the eye shadow would crease within an hour of putting it on. It just wasn&#x27;t worth the time and effort. Finally, I found out about eye shadow primers and decided to give this one a whirl. It works! I can wear eye shadow, and it stays on all day! It also makes the colors truer when you put them on. This was another problem for me since my skin tone seems to negate any color I put on it. All in all, this primer works, although I can&#x27;t compare it to any others since this is the first one I have tried. It was a good first buy!</li>
    <li> This eye shadow base lasts all day. It&#x27;s the best product out there that I&#x27;ve found works on even oily skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this after reading the reviews but this product did nothing for me as a primer or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just does not work as well as Laura Geller or other brands i have tried.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Before my eyeshadow would always fade and go to my crease, but with this base, it never faded. Even sweating, trust me i went to a dance and it stayed on the whole night, and eyeliner too! Would recommend this to anyone wearing eyeshadow</li>
    <li> I bought this because the expensive eye shadow base is, well, expensive.  I figured I&#x27;d get the same thing at a fraction of the price.  Unfortunately all I did was waste money.  It did absolutely nothing for me.  I even tried it on one eyelid and nothing on the other.  No difference.  I ended up throwing it out.  I&#x27;m usually a big fan of NYX, which typically has quality products for tiny prices.  This just isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> Great base! SO happy I bought this!</li>
    <li> Great Dupe for Urban Decay Primer Potion! Love it! I am really pleased with the application of the product and it makes my eyeshadow last all day.</li>
    <li> This product leaves a crease line on eyelid even though says it does not.  I will throw it out.  Received two in this order</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried eye shadow base before so I tried this brand based on the reviews.  So far, it is working like everyone said and it makes my eyeshadow look brighter and it lasts much longer!</li>
    <li> First primer I ever used so can&#x27;t compare to others....&lt;br /&gt;I have eyelids that get oily w/ in a hour or so ( sooner depending on weather/ climate). W/ this primer, my shadows stay on longer and doesn&#x27;t smudge off/ get oily as quickly, but after few hours or so, I can still see that my shadow looks greasy.&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness, maybe it&#x27;s my heavy-handed ness w/ my cream...but I normally wait for it to absorb first...&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s better than just shadow alone, but definitely does not last all day or even half a day for me...&lt;br /&gt;Service was fine w/ this vendor.</li>
    <li> Great eyeshadow base! For me it works better than MAC, and it says a lot. For such a prise - run for it!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in 3 days with regular shipping!!!! I tried it on and it actually made my eyeshadow stand out even more. The colors looked beautiful, and it lasted all day!! Great buy! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  It seems to work well.  Though I haven&#x27;t noticed any drastic change.  I&#x27;ll probably buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Super unhappy with this product. It arrived broken with the top/wand snapped away from the base and product every where. The product its self doesn&#x27;t work well, its sticky and doesn&#x27;t make a difference in the pigmentation of eyeshadow or the amount of time it lasts.</li>
    <li> It needs a long time to dry before applying eyeshadow, and does not last nearly as long as others I have tried.</li>
    <li> One of the best eye primers out there. The price was not that bad, and shipping didn&#x27;t that long either. I recommend to everyone who are in a need to find a perfect eye primer.</li>
    <li> I brought this because someone told me it worked as well as Urban Decay Primer Potion and at first it appeared to. I have oily skin and while I don&#x27;t live somewhere like Florida where it&#x27;s extremely humid I do live near the Ohio River in a valley and it can get pretty humid. I noticed that while it helped my eye makeup look brighter when I put it on that it allowed creases much faster than my UD Potion and it just didn&#x27;t last as long. If I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy my UD Potion this would work in a pinch, but I would have to reapply my makeup more often during the day and if I can skip that process I will. It works and probably if you live in a dry place or you don&#x27;t have oily skin save yourself some money and just get this.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this primer.  What I was looking for was a product that would keep my eye makeup looking fresh all day, what I got was a product that creases, smears and is useless.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a low cost alternative to UD&#x27;s Primer potion and after using it today, I dont think I will ever go back. I used this primer this morning and even after showering, my eye makeup looked almost perfect (despite face wash and scrub). The only problem I can see will be the fact that it CAN be difficult to take off. Love it.</li>
    <li> smooths on nicely, does not flake or dry, makes eye shadow more even</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Well at least with this eye primer anyway. It started to crease after a couple of hours, for sure did not last as well as the urban decay. I had the same results just combining concealer and foundation together.</li>
    <li> This works okay - but it&#x27;s not something I would personally use everyday.  It makes the eye make up feel heavier on my eyes.</li>
    <li> Used to by this type of product at Bare Minerals - 15.00 this is fraction of the cost and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product! I love all NYX products! This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a eye shadow base and it definitely works really well!</li>
    <li> I Love It. My Eyeshadow Stays Put Alll Day And then Some! It Also Makes It pop More And Looks Amazing!</li>
    <li> It was about time I get one. This one is just wonderful! The colors are vibrant and stay longer. No creasing or anything. I&#x27;m sold</li>
    <li> Best i have used so far. Will buy again.</li>
