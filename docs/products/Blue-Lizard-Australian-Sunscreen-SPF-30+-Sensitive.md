<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best sunscreen you could ever purchase. I have been using it for years and I will never buy anything else.</li>
    <li> So happy to find. Great stuff</li>
    <li> Good product. Works well. Confident of sun protection once put on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become allergic to most sunscreens but this one works.  No more itchy hives all over!  Goes on smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t leave white residue on skin.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, rubs in easily, and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy. I&#x27;m a redhead so I&#x27;ve tried my share of sunscreens. This one will be a repeat buy.</li>
    <li> Knowing I was heading south and would be in the sun a lot, I researched sunscreens and chose the Blue Lizard Brand.  Considering I live in Pennsylvania and spent a week in New Mexico, I only got a slight burn on my forehead.  The sunscreen protected me very well.  I applied it in the morning after breakfast and in the afternoon after lunch.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the protection it offered.  It&#x27;s less toxic than most sunscreens.  Considering I haven&#x27;t used sunscreen in years and prefer not to use it, this was a wonderful product that protected me when I needed it.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my one year old when we were in Florida.  It also rubbed in easily and was not greasy.  I wish you could buy it in stores and that it was not so pricey, but we&#x27;ll keep using it anyway.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Blue Lizard Australian Suncream, Regular SPF 30+, 5-Ounce\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Misc.; $17.25&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Sunscreen Sensitive chemical frr, Fragrance free, SPF 30+, 3fl.oz\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt; Health and Beauty; $10.10&lt;br /&gt;i just was wondering why if those items were purchased at the same time the recipient just got 1 of them.&lt;br /&gt;regards&lt;br /&gt;anaeli</li>
    <li> This review is not of the product but the product page.  The photo used to show the product shows 2 bottles of sunscreen.  I had purchased this very quickly without reading the description and found that the price I paid was only for 1 bottle. Very misleading!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen as being very effective in blocking out the harmful affects from the sun. Not easy to apply, consequently I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried several \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; sunscreens but they still made me break out and turned my skin sort of leathery.  After finding this brand on the Safe Skin Cosmetics Database, and liked it&#x27;s broad spectrum coverage without chemicals, I decided to plop down more money for yet another sunscreen.  I was surprised when this one didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and actually made my skin softer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Points to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This sunscreen can be used on the face, as it will change from white to clear after you rub it in.  IMPORTANTLY though, in order for this to rub in you have to apply it to DRY SKIN (indicated on the bottle) and don&#x27;t use too much right away because you will have too much on your face to absorb (this stuff goes a long way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It uses a physical barrier to uv light compared to a chemical barrier.  You can read about the difference below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As described by Dr. Leslie Baumann in the textbook Cosmetic Dermatology, there are two different categories of sunscreens: physical sunscreens, which scatter or reflect UV radiation, and chemical sunscreens, which absorb UV radiation and then dissipate the radiation as either heat or light, usually of longer wavelength that does not affect the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two chemical sunscreens, avobenzone and oxybenzone (the latter present in 20-30% of sunscreens), have been demonstrated by Hayden et. al to be absorbed into the body and secreted into the urine of users. While avobenzone and oxybenzone are not considered to be toxic agents in the medical community, it is still not recommended that sunscreens with avobenzone or oxybenzone are used by pregnant or nursing women nor small children, as they are absorbed into the body. Physical sunscreens, like Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen Cream SPF 30 with 5.0% Titanium Dioxide and 10.0% Zinc Oxide, are a preferrable option, as they have not been shown to be excreted into the urine.</li>
    <li> Better than the cancer causing sunscreens, but the Neutragena variant is much better in my opinion, easier to put on, lasts longer and is not as smelly or greasy.</li>
    <li> Blue lizard is great for fair skin that burns easily.</li>
    <li> My 2-year-old is allergic to the typical chemical-based sunscreens.  Within 24 hours, his face breaks out in a terrible rash that lasts for days.  I was hesitant to try another sunscreen, but this one ended up working great.  I first put it on a little spot on his face and watched it for a few days... no reaction.  Now he uses it daily in the summer and it has not caused any issues at all.  I don&#x27;t consider it that hard to put on - it&#x27;s just a little thicker than your average sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is the first sun screen that has not broken out or stung my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried a couple different sunscreens on my 1 year old, and this is the best yet.  Others that I got at Whole Foods (we&#x27;re picky with what&#x27;s in our sunscreen) either gave our daughter a rash, were hard to squeeze out of the tube and rub into her skin as she tried to get away, or just plain didn&#x27;t protect her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was is a better thickness, does not bother her skin, and seems to work the best.  No sunburns yet!  And the smell is mild and pleasant.</li>
    <li> My husband wears this while running. He used to use &amp;#34;Neut&amp;#34; dry style sunscreen but it burned when it ran with sweat into his eyes and didn&#x27;t seem to keep his skin totally protected for an hour and a half of sweaty running. This BLOCKS the sun and is less irritation to his eyes. Love it.</li>
    <li> Finally!!!! My child did not break out!!!! My nine year old child is super allergic to some of the ingredients in sun protection lotions.  He would get severe skin rash all over his face and arms every time we applied sun protectors. After wasting my money on various brands of sun protectors, I found this product that is heaven sent. Its thick, but it covers well (so don&#x27;t use too much). Easy to spread. Once spread on the skin it turns into a white film, however it is well absorbed by the skin and the white film is not that noticible. Also, it does not leave film on his summer clothes. It stays on the skin for hours giving nice protection and less need to reapply. Besides my child I also use it on my face and I have very sensitive skin prone to break out and it has not clogged my facial pores after several uses. I have looked for this product in stores but nobody seems to carry it only Amazon and other online stores.  This is the second time using this product. The first time we bought the smaller tube of 2 oz., but upgraded to the 5 oz. bottle. No big difference in price. Although is just a bit more expensive than other popular brands in stores, it is well worth it. Will consider buying several more in near future.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen does contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. It also contains hydrogenated oils and about two dozen ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce. After successfully using it on my son&#x27;s very sensitive skin for three years, he is finally having an allergic reaction to it that necessitated a trip to Urgent Care and a regimen of steroid and allergy medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board....</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen for my baby.  I tried regular baby sunblocks and they all gave her chemical burns.  The pediatrician recommended zinc-based sunscreen, so this is what I bought.  It works so well that my baby doesn&#x27;t even have a tan and we live in Alabama where it is hot and sunny most of the time.  I put this sunscreen on her before I get her dressed in the morning and we spend lots of time outside without worrying about sunburn.  I have had sunburn this summer and now have a nice tan, but my 8 month old is still pasty white.</li>
    <li> This brand was recommended by my dermatologist (I&#x27;m using a topical medication that has photosensitivity as a side effect).  Not greasy or smelly.  Good for everyday use under makeup.</li>
    <li> If there is an anatase TiO2 in the formulation, this sunscreen can actually work in the opposite of its intended function.  Search for it on google -&gt; scientific papers out of Australia (no less) have shown substantial damage to coated metal roofing when coated with anatase TiO2.  I recommend Badger products, with ZnO2 only.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The first sunscreen that didn&#x27;t make my acne worse.  Usually sunscreens give me MORE pimples/breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin leathery or lifeless like chemical sunscreens do.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes don&#x27;t burn when using this if I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I5 dries clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not the easiest lotion to apply on your face.  It needs to be rubbed in a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a white film over my face for the first 10 minutes after I put it on.  The white reside gradually melts away.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sunscreen.  It works exceptional, doesn&#x27;t smell and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my derm dr.  Unfortunately, Ulta stopped selling it and everyone else that carries it charges way too much for this.  So now I purchase it on Amazon.  Really, the best sunblock ever!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame that there aren&#x27;t more affordable options for physical sunblocks. This is one of the most economical sunblocks for the category and it works, especially if you&#x27;re prone to burns. It lacks in the area of being water proof, but it&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase chemical sunblocks with active ingredients such as avobenzone, oxybenzone, or octisalate, please realize that the light is being absorbed and a chemical reaction diffuses the energy. These chemical reactions are happening on the skin, the largest organ of your body, and are believed to be carcinogenic. Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, which reflect light. It might be me, but the temperature of my skin feels cooler while wearing this sunblock. And what&#x27;s better, physical sunblocks aren&#x27;t as oily. There are people that worry about their complexion while wearing sunblock with \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; metals, but zinc oxide is often considered a natural remedy for acne and only adds to the benefits of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes! I&#x27;ve heard that there are better physical sunblocks, but usually they are about $20-$35 a bottle, which is flat out criminal. And considering that the sun is the number one factor in aging your skin, you want to be liberal with your sunblock. And when I say liberal, I mean you drive a hybrid while drinking a latte to drop off your vegan baked goods.</li>
    <li> Blue Lizard sunscreen makes me look like a ghost. No matter how much I try to rub it into my skin, it stays on in a dry, powdery white layer that makes it look like I just came in from the high Arctic. No, I didn&#x27;t walk out of a meat freezer, it&#x27;s just Blue Lizard sunscreen! Seriously, I&#x27;m all for using natural products, and to its credit, Blue Lizard sunscreen didn&#x27;t give me pimples or irritate my skin. Nor did I burn! But, at the cost of looking like a poltergeist. I threw it into the trash after a week of getting funny looks at work. I&#x27;m looking for a new sunscreen!</li>
    <li> This was a very difficult product to review.&lt;br /&gt;The blue lizard&#x27;s best feature is that it works great. It&#x27;s as good or better than any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I have baked myself in the Southern California heat and sun for days gathering data for this review and I never had so much as a pink spot. Also, it is 100% nonallergenic, at least for me. It has a faint smell of rosewater, but nothing like the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; Eucerin, which clearly has a scent (How can they say it&#x27;s unsented, then?) I don&#x27;t sneeze, and it seems to moisturize my skin, somewhat. Importantly, blue lizard is tenacious. It is difficult to wash off hours later. And finally, it has a cap that turns blue in UV light, to remind you when you need to put on sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, this product has some serious problems. I think the key issue is that this product is compounded with beeswax instead of an oil emulsion. It is very difficult to put on, unless you use the trick below. Otherwise, it blobs up and is \\&quot;stiff.\\&quot; It always leaves a faint white trace behind that doesn&#x27;t go away as with Eucerin and Solbar. And you can feel the wax on your skin--it&#x27;s not exactly oily but it is something.&lt;br /&gt;TRICK--Warm this product up before applying. Just let it sit outside or on a windowsill in the sun until the tube is warm. Then apply it in little dabs spread throughout the area you want to cover. Finally, rub the creme in with the flat of your hands or fingers, creating enough friction that the stuff warms up and spreads out evenly. If you do this, you will have an even application that will stay on and protect you from anything short of a solar flare.&lt;br /&gt;DANGER--Don&#x27;t mix this stuff with water or wet your skin before applying. That is the secret to getting a thin, even application and maximum moisture with most creme sunscreens, but blue lizard will gob up and stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE--it screens the sun very well.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GG13TU SOLBAR Zinc SPF38]][[ASIN:B000FKHNLO Eucerin Extra Protective Moisture Lotion, SPF 30, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]].ve Moisture Lotion, SPF 30, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]].</li>

In other words - she&#x27;s allergic to the sun, when her skin is exposed to the sun she develops blisters and an itchy, mealy red rash within minutes. Fortunately, for her, this is a mild allergy and she is able to go outside ONLY using THIS sunscreen! This is the FIRST sunscreen we have found that actually protects her skin from the sun and gives her the freedom to go out and enjoy a sunny day! Unfortunately, NONE of our local stores carry it and we are forced to order it online. I&#x27;m telling you that if you need good sun protection, this is the stuff to use!!</li>
    <li> I have used many sunscreens over my life, and am delighted to have found Blue Lizard.  I am of Irish-Welsh heritage with extremely pale and sensitive skin.  I am an active tennis player, hiker, and sailer, so am in the sun way too much.  However, Blue Lizard allows me to do this in comfort.  Zinc oxide is the main ingredient, so it&#x27;s white when you put it on your skin.  I rub it in as much as possible, which I think gives me even greater protection from the sun&#x27;s rays.  The really good news is that the product is not greasy.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Great product and I love that is natural but it is very thick and hard to apply.  I would certainly buy it again just because it works and it does not have all of those yucky ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I swim almost everyday and use Blue Lizard Sunscreen . The combination of Zinc and Titanium is what sold me on this product. Those two Ingredients are the most effective against the Sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have been searching for a zinc oxide/titanium dioxide sunscreen that rubs in easily, doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy white residue, is not greasy, contains no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes during sports, and really offers great sun protection.  Wow, for me, this product meets all of these criteria and I really loved it.  I was about to order more on Amazon when I discovered that Blue Lizard sunblocks all contain parabens (actually three different parabens) which essentially are preservatives used in the cosmetic industry.  One of the safety concerns is that parabens mimic estrogen in the body and could disrupt hormone activity.  I suppose this could be more of a concern for children, adolescents, pregnant women and men (I&#x27;m none of the above) but I don&#x27;t want to take the risk. More and more companies are dropping parabens from their products.  It may be one thing to put on a touch of eye shadow with parabens, but I spread this sunscreen liberally over my entire body.  So the search goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT dated 4/27/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few comments on the above review.  One person said that she was confused because Blue Lizard advertises that their products contain no parabens.  Another said he/she ordered the 5 oz. Blue Lizard Sensitive and it said on the label that it contained no parabens.  I recently purchased the 3oz. Sensitive because the Amazon description listed the ingredients and parabens were not included.  When I received the product, the package clearly stated it contained three separate parabens. The product was not expired, however. (As always, it was Amazon fulfilled so free shipping return and credit for product.)  This is all very confusing but what it does highlight is that the Amazon photos and descriptions (of all their products, not just sunscreens) are not necessarily correct.  I&#x27;ve run into this problem on more than one occasion. Here&#x27;s what I believe is going on.  Originally, all Blue Lizard Sunscreens contained parabens.  In 2010 the company said it was eliminating them from the \\&quot;Face\\&quot; product.  This year they announced they would be removing parabens from all products. Apparently Amazon or their vendors are shipping their inventories of the older products with parabens although Amazon is describing the product as paraben free.  It also appears that some vendors are shipping the newer product (see comment about the 5 oz sensitive) although the Amazon description does not describe it as paraben free. I guess it is a crap shoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT dated 6/11/12&lt;br /&gt;I finally got a response from the folks who manufacture Blue Lizard about the paraben issues.  Here is what they said:&lt;br /&gt;  \\&quot;Our Blue Lizard Face, Sensitive, and Baby formulas are now paraben free. We are updating our website but in the meantime the old formula is still in circulation through many websites and retail stores. When ordering from any website other than ours you will need to ask them to see which formula they have in stock. All Face, Sensitive, and Baby in our warehouse are the new paraben free formulas. Blue Lizard sunscreens have a three year expiration on them so the old formula could be around at least that long if not sold through since we released our last batches earlier this year. I have attached the new ingredients for you to look at.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, the Amazon descriptions and photos of the product are not always accurate; there is essentially no way to contact Amazon or the merchant vendors to ask whether they are shipping the paraben free version or not.  So without more accurate descriptions, the only way to be sure you get a paraben free version of the face, baby or sensitive formulas is to order from the mfgr. or buy retail where you can read the label. I received a face formula that was paraben free and a sensitive formula that was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the Blue Lizard folks again and asked where I can buy the product retail.  She said that in my area (DC area) it was availablein some Bye Bye Baby stores.  Drove to one today and sure enough they had Face, Sensitive, and Baby (essentially the same as Sensitive) all paraben free.  They have it in 8.75 oz. bottles which I prefer.  A little more costly than Amazon&#x27;s but at least I know I am getting the parben free inventory.</li>
    <li> Did not provide the protection I expected.</li>
    <li> Very good UV protection.  Contains both zinc and titanium oxide, ingredients recommended by my dermatologist. Slight blue tint when applied.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and usually break out with tiny, itchy bumps after using sunscreen and being in the sun.  After trying almost every sunscreen on the market, I purchased this Blue Lizard &#x27;Sensitive&#x27; Sunscreen because it&#x27;s chemical-free and received great reviews.  I was excited to try it (the first chemical-free sunscreen I&#x27;ve used), but ended up sorely disappointed with the results.  I applied the sunscreen about 15 minutes before going out to the pool, but was burned within 20 minutes of being outside!  I also broke out and was itchy for days after using this product.  Another downside was how greasy it was!  The only plus to this product, in my opinion, was that it had no fragrance - but that&#x27;s still not enough of a positive to make me use this product again.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunblock.  Goes on a little white, but clears up after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Blue Lizard Suncreen is great. My doctor recommende it and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the price is twice the cost of other sunscreens. The cost of the product coupled with the shipping made the cost very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to find the product other local stores but could not. Thank you for having it available.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin and being chemical free is a big plus in my book. A little bit goes a long way and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Its OKAY, a physical sunscreen like this really is the best, most stable sun protection, but it is so hard to find an affordable product without a white cast. This does leave a bit of a white cast and takes a while to sink in. Once it does sink in in does get a bit oily, which is great for dry or dehydrated skin ( as physical sunscreens can dry out dry skin) but I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have oily skin. The search for an affordable, perfect physical sunscreen continues but this is a decent compromise.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It does not smell anywhere as strong as other sun screens. I use it to shoot hoops and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not putting gunky chemicals in my body like other brands.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST sunscreen lotion I have ever found.&lt;br /&gt;I was getting horrible blisters where ever the skin is exposed to Sun. Used to get burning sensation. To cool down the burning sensation, I used to take cold bath and keep ice cubes on blisters :(...I stopped going out in the sun.Consulted physician and did blood check up. But of no use. Then consulted dermatologist. He recommended to use this before any further exams. And it worked :)...Thanks a ton to Blue lizard. Now I go out in the sun without any hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to do is: rub it very well into skin otherwise it looks whitish and odd.</li>
    <li> a good product but the seam on the tube split - what a mess.</li>
    <li> Great product, bought it twice and used on myself as well as on kids. Non-irritating, does not appear white once applied to skin. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen! We used it on a recent family trip to Bermuda. Love the no-scent, and the good coverage. You need to spend some time rubbing it in, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem. My toddler daughter, who has eczema, had no reaction to this cream. Love it!</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time in the sun and ocean!  This is the best sunscreen and a much better value than some other more expensive brands.  I don&#x27;t necessarily have sensitive skin but find the sensitive version of Blue Lizard has slightly better protection than the others.  I use it for my face, back, and shoulders and it works great in and out of the water!</li>
    <li> I have been reacting to sunscreens since I used a cosmetic product earlier this spring that seemed to sensitize my skin.  Even the dermatologist had no sunscreen recommendations for me -- then I found Blue Lizard.  Thank goodness, since I am outside many hours of the day.  I have been able to use this product without experiencing any reaction and will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Not waterproof!  Once touch water, gone!  Light on fragrance--true to its words.  Yeah, easily come off alright.  Not too oily (relatively  speaking)</li>
    <li> Our little guy has super-fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He needs Vampire Strength sun-block, the problem is that his skin is so sensitive that the regular stuff makes him break out in hives :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, no more trips to the ER after finding this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that was recommended by my kids&#x27; pediatrician. The downside is that it&#x27;s not waterproof. Bummer cause that&#x27;s what we really needed at the beach and pool.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive to dyes and perfumes. With \\&quot;regular\\&quot; sunscreen, I break out in an itchy rash that eventually leads to hives. This stuff does not make my skin react at all, though it has clogged my pores when I haven&#x27;t cleaned it off thoroughly. Plus, it lasts all day without re-application, even through a day of scuba diving. I thoroughly recommend this product. Just remember to scrub it off thoroughly!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen and less chemicals to boot. I finally DON&#x27;T break out with this sunscreen on.  This works and you don&#x27;t need as much lotion...a little goes a long way on your skin.  Your skin still breathes with this product on.  The Best!</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I can use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the California sun 5-6 hours when I teach folks how to ride motorcycles. I&#x27;ve tried all the USA brands of &amp;#34;sensitive-skin&amp;#34; and baby sunscreens that use zinc-oxide &amp; titanium-oxide. I thought they worked pretty good. Blue Lizard protects me noticeably better, and for longer time. I highly recommend Blue Lizard!</li>
    <li> I really like this produce because the ingredients are safe, and it is easy to apply.  I feel it gives me good protection. It does appear quite white when you first put it on but becomes more subtle over time. It was one of the recommendations by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Shockingly poor product. After reading the glowing reviews I expected to receive a sunscreen that actually WORKED! Much to my dismay it simply doesn&#x27;t. I was very badly burned earlier this summer and in order to keep from re-burning I researched and ordered Blue Lizard..however EVERY time (even for short visits) I went into the sun with Blue Lizard on I re-burned..over and over again..It was unbelievable. The Stuff is EXTREMELY heavy on your skin...it basically NEVER absorbs and left white streaks all over the car door from my arm. The first inactive ingredient in my bottle was Beeswax..imagine covering yourself in liquid beeswax on a hot sweaty day talk about over-heating sweating and heat rash...You do indeed look like a waxy ghost and you feel like your dipped in wax. When I read other reviews stating that this product seemed to make peoples sunburns WORSE! I couldn&#x27;t believe it...I do now! Trust me it doesn&#x27;t work and after nearly two months with a perpetual sunburn (my faith in this product obviously misplaced) I have given up on Blue Lizard...</li>
    <li> I am on a medication that causes extreme photo-sensitivity so I really needed a good sunscreen. I had given up wearing sunscreen on my face a few years ago because no matter what I tried, it always stung so badly when I applied it each morning. I was told by a cosmetics saleswoman that in my case I needed a physical sunblock or a chemical one that was encapsulated. The encapsulated chemical sunscreens are expensive. I had heard good things about this brand so I decided to give it a try. I use it on my face over my moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t sting at all. I haven&#x27;t noticed that it clogs pores, either. Overall I&#x27;m really happy to have found a suitable sunblock at a good price. I plan to reorder.</li>
    <li> It has no smell, it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, and it is not greasy. You can put it on and it is immediately effective. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this out of frustration with Banana Boat and other sunscreens that I have tried because they cause me to break out into a rash on my face. This is mild, does not have a strong smell, and a little goes a very long way.  It is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin. The regular store brand sunscreens were ok but sometimes made her skin bumpy. I really like the blue lizard brand. I feel like it was better for her skin and it did not cause her skin to react as much. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> If you want a sunscreen that WILL protect you, this is the one. You need to re-apply after you have been in the water 45 min of activity.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really thick and hard to rub in. I have very sensitive skin but this didn&#x27;t seem to be any better than the less expensive sun screen you can buy in store. I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money again.</li>
    <li> This works great on my kids, goes on pretty well, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film.  Satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a great product; free of lots of harmful chemicals that many sunscreens have and it works very well.  Needs reapplication after swimming, etc. but far better for you so definitely worth it.  The only thing that keeps me from a 5-star ratinig is that the photo showed 2 tubes but only 1 tube shipped.</li>
    <li> I am redhead, have rosacea and am allergic to the sun. After reading the reviews I thought finally a product I could use to venture outside. This sunscreen helped keep my arms from blistering but wreaked havoc on my face although I was careful to wear a hat with a wide brim. Going out was important to me as it was for my son&#x27;s wedding. Even after a week of special care my face is still broken out and my doctor doesn&#x27;t know what to do to help. I wish Blue Lizard was the answer for me...I guess not.</li>
    <li> My son is extremely allergic to chemical sunscreen and breaks out in a terrible rash, even in response to the types for babies or sensitive skin.  I went searching for a physical sunscreen and found this one and I am very pleased.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and only a little is needed.  The first bottle I bought was only 3 oz and it lasted through the entire summer.  It does leave a slightly pale tint to the skin but you barely notice it.  It&#x27;s not greasy and stays on great in the water and sand.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have to apply it every 20 minutes.  And it works!  No sunburn and no allergic reactions.  Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Really like it. It&#x27;s more of a physical sunblock than a chemical one. It goes on whitish, but that soon disappears. I use it in place of moisturizer - I have dry skin and live in a dry environment. It provides a lot of protection for my pale skin in an intensely sunny environment. It makes my skin look dewey - not greasy. People who don&#x27;t like heavy moisturizers would probably hate it.</li>
    <li> Rubs in easier than most.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did research after listening to an NPR segment on sunscreens (and other personal care products, including detergents) -- the NPR guest had the results of their research posted on silentspring.org.  Many sunscreens contain carcinogenic -- or potentially carcinogenic -- chemicals which undermine or offset, their protection from skin cancer.  Sunscreens with the active ingredients of Zinc Oxide and/or Titanium Dioxide -- both natural compounds -- are effective and absent carcinogenic chemicals, making them safer to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard goes on a little thick and white but the whiteness *mostly* fades as the lotion is absorbed. It&#x27;s a bit oily but it stays on well through activities like swimming.  I wore it during a week&#x27;s vacation at Cape Cod with a once daily application and it was very effective.  I have light blue eyes, a fair complexion and have always burned easily.  I have sensitive skin (though not highly sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy any other sunscreen now that I&#x27;ve discovered Blue Lizard.  From experience I know it&#x27;s effective and I feel confident it&#x27;s safer than sunscreens that contain carcinogenic chemicals or chemicals that often trigger reactions in those with skin sensitivities.</li>
    <li> stays on all day. used it to surf and to work outside and don&#x27;t have to constant;y re-apply. love that it is zinc lbock not chemical block and doesnt make your face (too) white-- a little yes but you won&#x27;t look like a mime. it&#x27;s by far my favorite sunscreen</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law recommended Blue Lizard for sun protection and I glad I listen to her.  Goes on easy and provides great protection.</li>
    <li> I love the Blue Lizard Sunscreen.  It is a hit with the kids because it is blue when it first is applied&lt;br /&gt;The company shipped the product on time and I would do business with them again.</li>
    <li> I like barrier sunscreens and was about to re-order the Glycolix I had been using, but thought I would check around for alternatives.  I happened across the Blue Lizard, read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  One consideration was that the Glycolix was $25 for 1.6 oz vs Blue Lizard @ $13.80 for 3 oz.  Interestingly, the 5 oz bottle is $11.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly, although at first it looks as if you are putting on clown face makeup, but as you rub it in, only the faintest pale cast remains. I have found that it is easiest to dab spots on forehead, cheeks, chin, neck then blend in.  It does feel a bit greasy initially, but that, too, disappears.  There is no odor, I have not had any problems with it coming off on my clothes and I have not had any breakouts . One caution--it is a liquid not a cream and if you aren&#x27;t careful when opening the tube, you will get more product than you bargained for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will definitely be a repeat purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I think this could of been a good sunscreen if it didn&#x27;t leave a white residue. The ingredients are pretty good. Only problem was the white cast especially on African-American skin.</li>
    <li> works fantastic for my husband who has sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Works great!  i feel very protected with this product.  Only downside is it is very white and hard to get off your hands :)</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it on my children. I have used it on myself too and I would apply when I want a total block like at the beach.</li>
    <li> After having melanoma, I have been extremely cautious about going in the sun. Blue Lizard is the only sunscreen I trust to block out all UVA and UVB rays without all of the harsh chemicals. It is zinc based but goes on nice and clear. It even stays on when I go running outside in the heat. Best sunscreen ever!</li>
    <li> Almost every summer I break out in a sun rash.  The dermatologist recommended Blue Lizard.  You can&#x27;t find it in regular stores.  This works for me and the new formula seems to go on much clearer than before.  It used to stay whitish for a long time.</li>
    <li> EASY TO CARRY. EXCELLENT FOR TRAVELING.THIS PRODUCT IS OUR FAVORITE WHEN THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THE LARGER BOTTLE ,GREAT STUFF</li>
    <li> one of the best sun screen I have ever used! stays on through sweat and major water contact pretty well. definitely recommend this for anyone living in the hot weather!</li>
    <li> Ok... he doesn&#x27;t tan -- he scorches.&lt;br /&gt;For the gardener, road cyclist, but a shade seeker&lt;br /&gt;any other time...</li>
    <li> I find this to be an overall good product. The kids thought the color changing lid was cool although if you are outdoors and applying sunscreen I&#x27;m sure you know uv rays are present and do not need a lid to tell you so. For me personally I did not like the white filmy layer it leaves on your skin I rubbed it in vigorously and if still showed</li>
    <li> It provides superior protection for sensitive skin.  Just what the dermatologist ordered.  The product is very hard to find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Worked for my sensitive skin - didn&#x27;t give me chicken skin like other sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> I have been using Blue Lizard for over two.  Not only when riding my bicycle during the summer, but also backpacking.  Sometimes I will mix it with a little Neutrogenia 30 to make it spread move evenly.  It works great alone or mixed.  I have never gotten a sunburn.</li>
    <li> Very good sun protection for my face..doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my face up like some of the other sunblocks with zinc and titanium ingredients.  It&#x27;s hard to spread on the skin because it is thick so I put a few dots of it on my face and wait a couple of seconds for it to warm up and spread easier.  I have used it for several years and haven&#x27;t found bettet sun protection than this one</li>
    <li> EWG.org gives this sunscreen a great rating, which means it has little to no harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Even better, it rubs in and does not leave a white film!!! LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so you do have to take time to rub it in if you don&#x27;t want to see the white, but it only takes an extra minute.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit greasy at first, but it will absorb and then it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and cannot use fragrances or other &amp;#34;additives&amp;#34;. I have an allergy to the sun, which makes my skin discolor and stiffen. This stuff works like a charm. Such a difference since I started using it. Worth the money for sure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ultra pale, so finding sunscreen that I like is a bit of an art form.  I&#x27;ve sort of accepted that there are different kind for different activities and this is my big poppa, day-at-the-lake-sunscreen.  It&#x27;s kind of spendy and goes on thick (does rub in clear after a moment, no worries there) but it truly works.  You can see the shine and feel this on which I don&#x27;t like for everyday, but I survived a whole day at an outdoor music festival drinking and not reapplying - no burn at all.  That&#x27;s basically unheard of for me, even with tons of sunscreen.  The only place I don&#x27;t use it is my face.  I think it&#x27;s too thick and I don&#x27;t want breakouts so I stick with cc cream.</li>
    <li> I have looked for sunscreen that does not sting my husbands eyes.  He would not wear sunscreen and get burnt.  Finally found one that works!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for my little blonde hair, blue eyed babies.  It was recommended by the doctor and is all we have used since they were 2 months old.  They have never burned and hardly get any color at all which is what we were looking for.  Lasts for hours, even in the bright Florida sun!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this sunscreen and I LOVE IT!!!  I have sensitive skin and I can wear it under my makeup and it does not break my face out.  I recommend it to all sensitive to Gulten-free product users.  Try it - you&#x27;ll like it!!</li>
    <li> We have used Blue Lizard in the Caribbean several times and it works. Now we use it in the US whenever we go out in the sun. Great sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, very spreadable, no scent, works great. The color-changing cap is pretty cool too. This is my new go-to sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Bought this to steer away from chemical sunscreens. Goes on white but quickly absorbs into skin. I like that I can see where I&#x27;m putting it on so I don&#x27;t miss a spot:) Also it absorbs clear when you run it in further. DOESNT STING YOUR EYES! Such a nice product.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t test it in extreme sun conditions, this product is what I was looking for. It had no odor that bothered my scent allergies and disappeared after rubbing it on my face and skin. Very happy with Blue Lizard Sensitive Sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Most sunscreens, even ones labeled &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; cause my eczema to flareup but this didn&#x27;t.  Gave me perfect protection without streaking or caking.</li>
    <li> I got this for myself because I&#x27;m allergic to every kind of sun block there is.  It was fine for me.  No burning no itching no rash.  But!  The tube is cool and macho so I thought my son might use it -- because of the packaging --for his window washing job. He loved it too.  Now I have to order another tube for me! i</li>
    <li> Best product on the market and SAFE! no harmful chemicals or ingredients that cause cancer!</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen every day.</li>
    <li> I like this natural sunscreen more than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried. It seems to protect well, rub in pretty easily and doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitve skin, you have to rub it in well.</li>
    <li> Rubs in clear and works for hours.  No annoying scent.</li>
    <li> I recently had surgery on my face and needed to protect a healing scar.  My plastic surgeon recommended Blue Lizard Sensitive because some sunscreens irritate my face.  I put this cream directly on my incision and it is not irritating at all.  No scent.  Not too thick--blends in easily.</li>
    <li> Finally found a sunscreen that does what it says.  It rubs in clear (not super fast but it doesn&#x27;t keep them looking white all day) it stays put and doesn&#x27;t run into their eyes, and most importantly they didn&#x27;t get burned! Love it for my kids and myself!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Love that it&#x27;s fragrance free. Bought for my trip to Machu Picchu in November.</li>
    <li> It feels wonderful and works great!</li>
    <li> Product contains parabens, despite site stating it doesn&#x27;t.  Ingredients list four parabens, and this product isn&#x27;t what I was looking for my infant. Very poor and misleading advertising.</li>
    <li> Good sunscreen will purchase again</li>
    <li> We have used this product many times and it is a very effective sun block.  My husband likes it because it is fragrance free. However, one of the tubes from this order arrived with a hole in it and leaked. We cannot take the tube anywhere because it has to be perfectly upright or else it leaks all over everything. I was not happy about that but it wasn&#x27;t worth the time to box it up and return it. I am not reducing the stars for the tube puncture problem because it isn&#x27;t the fault of the product that it occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I did reduce this order to 1-star because the other tube of this product was also punctured in the same place and leaked all over a summer gift basket I gave to a friend. Now I am upset.  The sunblock is normally a great product but I will not order from this seller anymore in case it is something they are doing to puncture the tubes.</li>
    <li> So many natural sunscreens out there leave you with a ghost complexion, won&#x27;t rub in, smell funny, run into your eyes...I could go on and on. But I hate the chemicals in drugstore sunscreen, and they inevitably make my eyes burn. I strongly suggest checking out your sunscreen&#x27;s ingredients on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website (prepare to be horrified at the side affects of most sunscreen&#x27;s chemicals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is great--never burns, works really well, has no real smell, rubs in great. I would put it on my baby nieces. As with any sunscreen, you must reapply, especially after long swims. Also, I do find that it is difficult to rub into wet skin, so follow the directions and only put it on dry skin or once you&#x27;ve toweled off well. A small price to pay for such a great product.</li>
    <li> I like it. Though most of the eco-friendly sunscreens can be rather &amp;#34;pasty and white&amp;#34; this is a better bet. It still needs to be applied carefully. It absorbs better than some of the similar products in the market.</li>
    <li> A little oily, but does the job. Hard to wash off. Great for sensitive skin and eyes. Had the two ingredients for sun protection that my dermatologist recommended.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most sun screens, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works well and no allergy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Just received my 5 oz bottle of Blue Lizard&#x27;s Sensitive sunscreen and the first thing under the lizard states \\&quot;Paraben Free\\&quot; then states it is also chemical and fragrance free.  This sunscreen is pretty awesome.  My wife is pretty fair and burns very easy, this stuff added with common sense prevents sunburn flat out.  Still, feel free to give your left leg for some burnout or other super expensive sunscreen that will not work as well, but for me and mine we&#x27;re plenty happy with BL.</li>
    <li> As a dermatologist with over a decade of experience caring for the skin of thousands, i have only ever seen ONE sunscreen that not one person had skin irritation from: blue lizard SENSITIVE or Baby (they are the same product in different packaging).  This is by far the best, safest, full-spectrum sunscreen available. I just wish it were easier to find in local stores. Come on manufacturers, can&#x27;t you get more chains to carry your product?</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0019MT7SY Blue Lizard Sunscreen Sensitive chemical frr, Fragrance free, SPF 30+, 3fl.oz]]&lt;br /&gt;My husband started using this product a few years ago and it&#x27;s the best sunscreen ever!&lt;br /&gt;if you live in the Hot Florida sunshine you must buy this product to protect you skin&lt;br /&gt;from the sun!</li>
    <li> After years of trying sunscreens that left my skin horribly itchy and burning, I was starting to think I would just have to severely limit my outside time.  Then I tried Blue Lizard and will be forever glad I did.  It is creamy and not greasy.  It goes on white but quickly dries clear, or nearly clear when I apply it liberally.  I love being outdoors and Blue Lizard Sensitive gives excellent protection.  No tans, no sunburn, no itchy, burning skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> wonderful product and recommended</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that my son can wear without getting a rash. He has sensitive skin and breaks out in a lacy rash with any other sunscreen. We tried this based on the commendation of the reviewers. We were scared at first, but low and behold, no rash. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Because of many positive reviews I was expecting a lot from this product. And I&#x27;m disappointed. First of all it is extremely havy - it takes 20 minutes or more before it sinks into a skin a bit to proceed with the make-up. But in fact putting make-up on it is mission impossible. And it caused whiteheads on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is good for using it on the beach but definitely it is not for all day city usage. Not for working girls.&lt;br /&gt;It was last American sunscrean I tried (I tried a lot of them). Never ever. Europeans are much better at sunscreans.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE. Blue Lizard changed its ingredients for the sensitive sunscreen, taking out the parabens.  Sure enough, the company (Forever Young Beauty Supply) is selling the old, DISCONTINUED item with parabens while listing the NEW sunscreen ingredients under the product description. Very shady (no pun intended).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different products.  The \\&quot;good\\&quot; sunscreens usually are not fully absorbed and leave a chalky sheen on the skin.  Blue Lizard, after a few minutes, is pretty nearly invisible.  And it is effective as a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I love Blue Lizard Sensitive because I do have sensitive skin and I believe that if it&#x27;s good for baby skin, it&#x27;s going to be fine for mine. And it is! When I use Blue Lizard, my skin looks and feels better afterwards. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I have ever used that protects my skin from the sun, and I look healthier for using it. I&#x27;ve tried many others and I always come back to Blue Lizard.</li>
    <li> This product is SO waterproof that it caused a severe case of heat rash when I applied it and and wore it under some high temps. Took 2 weeks to recover - won&#x27;t touch it again!</li>
    <li> This product is great for the both kids and adults as they splash about in the pool protecting one from the suns harsh rays BUT not effecting your fun times!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a fine sunscreen in general, but I just want folks to know it does not always agree with kids with eczema.  This was one of the brands our pediatrician recommended that would supposedly not aggravate our son&#x27;s eczema.  I also found it listed when I searched the web.  The first day I put it on him his skin flared up worse than it ever had before.  Thanks to some rainy weather and us traveling, I was able to take a break from putting anything of his skin for several days.  When I tried the Blue Lizard a second time he had the same reaction.  After trying several brands I ended up using Neutrogena Pure and Free Baby.</li>
    <li> This lotion is THICK. Takes time to rub in so if your kids are like mine, dying to get into the water, it won&#x27;t be a favorite. That said, it keeps the skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I wouldn&#x27;t use this on the face. Way too thick.</li>
    <li> We love this product!</li>
    <li> Great Sunscreen.  Perfect for kids and babies that have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> We were long fans of Neutrogena&#x27;s Sensitive Skin SPF 30 formula, but Neutrogena has decided to look for new customers, so we were left out in the sun. We&#x27;ve tried a few alternative products, and we particularly liked Blue Lizard&#x27;s Sensitive, Fragrance Free SPF 30+ formula. We aren&#x27;t fond of the various chemical sun block formulas. There is nothing like metal oxide based coverage. Blue Lizard provides the protection we need and has a nice feel when it goes on, great for our sensitive skin. Obviously, your preferences may be different, but we&#x27;re very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> We like the sun creen lotion.  If you take too much, yes, it makes you white face.  We usually put a little by little, then add more, so it won&#x27;t make us scary looking.  We like the fragrance free and well protected blue lizard sunscreen.  We also like to see the bottle color changes with sun light.</li>
    <li> Goes on white but soaks right in.  I have oily skin but this does NOT make my skin oiler. Will definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is the best at keeping the sun off your skin.  My husband  and I love it when we go to the islands for several weeks because you can enjoy more time in the sun without getting burned.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen my son can use without getting a rash. Today other sunscreens use so many chemicals it is hard to know what is actually going on the kids&#x27; skin and how it will effect them.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin and this sunscreen works amazing on me!! Not sticky, not oily, and no itchy skin! I think the zinc in it is actually calming my skin. I&#x27;m very happy that I tried it!</li>
    <li> Leaves white residue and didn&#x27;t work as well as the alba 15spf coconut oil did. I like that the ingredients are non toxic but will find another non toxic one on ewg.org sunscreen guide to try.</li>
    <li> I love Blue Lizard Sunscreen, it is a safe, full spectrum sunscreen that never, ever irritates my extremely sensitive skin. It&#x27;s white like most zinc/titaniam dioxide screens are, but smooths into the skin leaving a sheen that doesn&#x27;t look weirdly white. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love.  Only kind our family uses and safe for babies</li>
    <li> This is the first sunblock I&#x27;ve tried in 30 years that didn&#x27;t make my eyes water from the chemical scent or perfumes; nor does it sting even when placed on the eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some serious rubbing to work it all in, but it almost entirely soaks in after a few minutes and leaves your skin smooth and not at all grimy feeling like most blocks.  I can put it under makeup and not have an oil slick or gross makeup creases.  There is only the very faintest smell (like a tiny hint of orange rind?), but it&#x27;s got less smell than my unscented lotions do.  It keeps my paperwhite skin from burning, and I usually have to use a level 50+ block in the chemical variety to get the same level of protection (this is rated at 30 SPF).</li>
    <li> The product sent to me contained 3 different parabens in the ingredients list, despite the product description on Amazon making no mention of parabens.  I ended up getting a refund only after I paid to ship the item back to the seller.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  No burning at all.....</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen for my Polymorphic Light Eruption, a type of allergy to the sun.  I was advised to use a product with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which Blue Lizard contains.  Although you resemble a mime when you first apply it, it gradually absorbs and looks natural.  It totally blocks sun effectively.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another brand again.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great on little kiddos&#x27; sensitive skin, but the cool part is that the cap turns from clear to blue when exposed to UV light. This reminds you when you need to apply sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Goes on easily, not greasy, disappears quickly.  I have facial dermatitis and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it and it protects my skin. Very happy with this product since I am in the sun a lot.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product it is the only sunscreen that my boys do not get a rash from. We will and have referred this product to friends and family members.</li>
    <li> We tried a few different brands, but found Blue Lizard had the best balance of natural products and ease of use.</li>
    <li> My face is pretty sensitive to this type of stuff, and I was able to use it with no problem and no break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t have an odor, and it doesn&#x27;t have an oily residue.  When it comes to protection from sunburn, it does the job.  I&#x27;m a pale guy, and the sunscreen took a beating from the Florida sun for over a week without any redness.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have been searching for a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works. I&#x27;ve tried others and they leave me white and itchy. This absorbs quickly and provides great sun protection with its high percentage of zinc oxide! I don&#x27;t have to waste my time and money anymore!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist for my very fair, very sensitive skin which burns easily. Sunscreen is very lightweight; I did not find it to be greasy; there is no funny &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; scent, in fact there is no scent at all. I have a long family history of skin cancer, and I use this product (along with long sleeve shirts and hats) to help prevent me from carrying on this particular family tradition.</li>
    <li> It is a little thick, but works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, great coverage, excellent blocking even for very fair skin. Will continue to use this sunscreen</li>
    <li> THE BEST SUNSCREEN EVER.  I am the 2nd worst person for getting sunburned I have ever known (my sister is worse). Blue Lizard works better than any of the several SPF 50+ sunscreens I have ever used.  Even worked on my liver-pigmented dog&#x27;s nose!</li>
    <li> Thanks to the reviewers..&lt;br /&gt;If it contains patabens ....I don&#x27;t want it :(&lt;br /&gt;Please update site once parabens are removed</li>
    <li> I love Blue Lizard sunscreen for my face.  Other sunscreens, even those specifically for faces and/or sensitive skin (which I don&#x27;t actually have) seem to leave my face stinging a bit when at the beach for long stretches of time.  This is the only one I have found that does not do that.  It is thick - my son teases me because it takes a little extra to rub in.  However, at the beach I&#x27;m more focused on protecting my skin than whether or not there is white sunscreen showing up on my face!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is very nice for babies, once there is no additional chemicals, like frangancies and it is alergy free</li>
    <li> This is a must for my kiddo who is allergic to most sunscreens. This stuff works great and has no ill effects.</li>
    <li> My skin is so fair that I can burn in minutes. Blue Lizard prevents sunburn, and I can use it on my face with no allergic reaction. (Lots of sunscreens cause swelling and an itchy rash on my face.) Blue Lizard does not contain some of the questionable ingredients of many cheaper brands, which I appreciate. The product is a bit gluey in consistency; I have to use a soapy washcloth to remove it. And it leaves a white film on your skin, which is not as noticeable if you rub it in well. But if you want a safe, allergy-free way to prevent sunburn, Blue Lizard can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Loved the Blue Lizard Moisturizer with SPF 30 and wanted to try this product because it was for sensitive skin.  Your products never cause me eye irritation which was a problem even with SPF for babies/children.  Will order again and love that it arrived so quickly!  Also, with this sunscreen, you can see where you miss an area.  The white film disappears and I feel that I get great coverage.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Hard to find this affordably for my granddaughter who has polymorphic light eruption.  This is the sunscreen recommended by dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Getting any amount of sun without protection leaves me with an itchy, bumpy rash. But I&#x27;m also sensitive to fragrances (which are heavy in a lot of sunscreens), so I was excited to try this. The best thing that I can say about it is that it is fragrance-free. Apart from that it was oily, took forever to absorb into my skin, and did nothing to keep me from rashing up. It may work well enough to prevent a sunburn, but if you need an everyday product to fend off an itchy reaction to the sun then try elsewhere.</li>
    <li> bought this prior to going on vacation and didnt want to check bags so i purchased this size on purpose and just got a few extra tubes. great sunscreen for baby and adults. kids love it because it does not burn their eyes. Fairly easy to put on for a  Zinc based sunscreen. love it.</li>
    <li> Blue Lizard is a really good brand; all their products seem very effective. This was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I am allergic to fragrance, so this works well for me. I use it every day on my arms when I am going to be in the car. Sun coming through the windshield and windows in the car are very strong, and this is a huge help.</li>
    <li> I always breakout from sunscreen, even the sensitive ones for the face only. I did not breakout at all, after wearing this every day for 6 days in Mexico. No burns, it was great! Highly recommended.  I&#x27;m have very fair and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted...I love this sunscreen for me and my kids.  Not super white like some other sunscreens containing zinc.  Package snaps shut securely so I can carry this in my beach bag or purse without fear of it opening.  Works great to protect our family from the sun.</li>
    <li> What can I say but that this product works well. It&#x27;s slightly greasy, but most of it gets absorbed in the skin. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like consistency-felt my usual sunscreen did a better job.  Did a test using 2 different ones on separate legs.  This one caused a little bit of sun to get thru whereas my usual sunscreen did not.  Will not purchase again.  Also felt it was much pricier than a product I liked better.</li>
    <li> my stubborn fiance no longer burns when he&#x27;s working in the orchard or on the tractor :~)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sunscreens on the market. It has zinc oxide which is a must to prevent skin damage.</li>
    <li> Good water resistance, goes on smoothly, haven&#x27;t had a burn with it. One of our go-to sunscreen brands.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  I&#x27;ll tell you why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell, no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; or that uncomfortable feeling on my face when I put it on, and a cap that turns blue outside....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is above and beyond much better than anything I find at the local CVS or something.</li>
    <li> I did lots of research on sun screen and this got some of the best reviews. I wanted it sensitive enough for my 8 month old to use but good enough to stop my freckly skin burning. Blue Lizard is held up to a lot stronger standards that USA sun screen and it shows. It&#x27;s the only sun screen I&#x27;ve not burned with, it absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy mess on the skin. I also like the colour changing cap feature.</li>
    <li> I must used sunscreen on my face because of past medical issues. I used sunscreens for years and hated the experience. I found that I experienced strong reactions to other chemical-based sunscreens. The reactions were so strong that I had difficulty keeping my eyes open to see. I needed one with the physical block.  This one from Blue Lizard provides excellent protection and doesn&#x27;t produce an adverse reaction. I recommend that people be aware of what happens after you put on sunscreen and be alert to a potential allergic reaction. If you find you are getting a negative result, you should look for one that has the physical block instead of the chemical one. The Blue Lizard seems to be the best and I found it here at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! Our pediatrician recommended it for our baby and it&#x27;s awesome because it doesn&#x27;t have the scary stuff in it but it&#x27;s not all pasty and cakey like some of the physical block can be. Goes on very nicely, doesn&#x27;t feel gross, and baby&#x27;s skin seems to like it. I also use it since I&#x27;m holding her often and it works very well. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and burn easily. On top of that, I have sensitive skin overall. I bought this product for my recent trip to Aruba. It does come out of the bottle a little thick, and you have to rub it in rather thoroughly. But it works! No burn whatsoever all week! This sunscreen is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this product. As most of you parents may know, these more natural sunblocks can look like you have glowing white skin...but I am happy to report that this rubs in nicely and evenly without making you look like you have white washed your body. My kids are extremely sensitive to sunblock and break out into a rash with using any of those commonly seen brands on shelves. Highly recommend this brand! A little goes a long way, so worth the extra money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The Blue Lizard chemical free sunscreen is the best stuff around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been fair complected all of my life, so I have tried everything.  I think I must be allergic to most of the chemical sunscreens because as soon as I put them on, my skin gets irritated and lights up bright red like I have a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great because it&#x27;s not a chemical reaction that protects you, but an actual layer of block.  You know about zinc oxide that kids put on their noses to protect them.  Well, this is the same kind of stuff, except that it is formulated in some way that it becomes transparent shortly after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great because it stays put.  It&#x27;s not greasy.  It&#x27;s not thick and goopy.  It doesn&#x27;t give your skin that bluish glow that some sunscreens do.  With the right amount, it fades to clear and does as it promises.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I researched for a long time to find a safer choice for sun protection. I hate greasy white thick sunblock. This sunblock is none of those things. Yes, the sunblock goes on white but is easily rubbed in. It is not super thick so it is easily spread and rubbed in. My son has very sensitive skin and this formula did not bother his skin at all. As long as the formula does not change, this will be our sunblock for the family from now on. I have not tried this on myself yet so I can not say with confidence that it does not feel greasy on the body. When I apply it on my son, it does not feel greasy in my hands and it soaks into his skin without leaving him white, greasy, or sticky. His skin really just feels soft. I am so very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> First thought was, yuk this is all white and thick.&lt;br /&gt;Second thought, this is smooth, rubs in well and I can easily tell where is was placed initially.&lt;br /&gt;Does not dry the skin and so far, works well.&lt;br /&gt;The top turns blue in UV...time to slather up.&lt;br /&gt;5+ stars if you want to avoid painful skin cancer treatment in the future.</li>
    <li> I opened this bottle of sunscreen and was shocked to find that it did in fact contain a product, rather than vacuum space. Therefore, since the bottle contained a product, it cannot possibly be chemical free. The bottle is chock full of chemicals from this dangerous sounding, \\&quot;water\\&quot; and \\&quot;beeswax\\&quot; to \\&quot;castor oil\\&quot; and even polymers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have requested a refund, but the manufacturer has yet to respond.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work ad well ad they claim but better than ordinary stuff</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with finding safe sunscreen.  First, I want a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical sunscreen with Avobenzene, as physical sunscreens are found to be safer.  The physical sunscreens do not react with the sun to create bizarre carcinogenic chemical compounds.  Anything with Zinc Oxide or Titanium Dioxide is considered to be a physical sunscreen rather than chemical sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve noticed that most chemical sunscreens make me break out in a rash.  This year, I&#x27;ve only found 2 zinc oxide/titanium oxide formulas in local stores.  One is Avalon Organics, which isn&#x27;t water resistant.  The second is a Neutrogena formula, but it has Retinol Palmitate, which has been associated with the development of skin tumors.  And plus, the Neutrogena formula is 60+ spf, making it impossible to ever develop a natural tan or eventual semi-independence from sunscreen.  I&#x27;m happy with this formula but wish it was sold in local stores.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great.  I feel good putting it on my kids because there are no strong chemicals to harm them.  It rubs in easily and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this, for my kids faces at camp. However, it caused terrible dryness and peeling. Not sure what ingredient caused this...but we are back to Aveeno with usual success.</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used, and I have used them all!</li>
    <li> My daughter has always had problems with sunscreen for her face as they would all burn her eyes something terrible...even just putting cream on her cheeks and nose tip would burn her eyes from any perfume or fumes from the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen has been the first she can wear under her eyes and on her face with no problems. This was my first time buying this to test it out and I will def be buying more for the summer. So glad I found this : )</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this specific brand.  This usually raises red flags since drug companies shower doctors with all kinds of gifts, (Short of outright bribes) but having tried the product I do like it.  The key ingredient is Zinc Oxide which is the one ingredient that works the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this on a snow camping trip near the Carson Pass in the Sierras in Feb.  After three days in the sun at 9,000ft My face was only slightly burnt.  Note that I just re-apply once a day at lunch...not per the manufactures instructions, but seriously who does?  I missed a spot under my nose a couple of times and not only paid the price but know this product actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off because it still leaves a white residue when applied, but I consider that normal for any sunscreen with Zinc.</li>
    <li> I tend to be a bit sensitive to sunscreens and don&#x27;t always want to pay the $45 per small bottle that my facialist recommends. I Have found that this is easy on my skin. I gave 4 vs 5 stars as it my not be the best for using as an every day product as it is a bit thick. If they had a thinner version that could go on skin under make up, I would be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is fantastic. A lot of zinc oxide sunscreens are greasy or chalky but this has a great consistency - it&#x27;s thick and rubs in well. I prefer not to use chemical sunscreens because they don&#x27;t block the full UV spectrum.</li>
    <li> I loved it! I am so sensitive to any sunscreen on my face, but this was great and didn&#x27;t make my eyes sting. It also went on very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;thank you! I will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> not working that well  still allergic to the sun</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an endurance cyclist and have trouble finding a sunscreen that has staying power.  Blue Lizard fits the bill.  Also, it does not sting my eyes when I sweat, like some other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m a fan!  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals in it - Zinc and Titanium Oxides.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 10 and we have never been able to find a sunscreen that she was not allergic to. We were planning a trip to Hawaii so I wanted to see if I could finally something that would work. This is great. It&#x27;s a little thick and white but rubs in quickly and she was not allergic to it. Yeah!!</li>
    <li> Really like it - great sun protection especially in the southeast and along the coast line. Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and all other sunscreens make me break out. Blue Lizard does not and it keeps me protected. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a sunscreen recommended by my dermatologist.  I am so sensitive to all the chemicals in lotions as well as lanolins.  No reaction here! AND it prevents sunburn!</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market! No sunburn after boating 8 hours!</li>
    <li> Blue Lizard is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  I burn very easily and its the only one I trust out in the sun all day.  I still have to reapply after a few hours to avoid any burning.  But almost everything else I&#x27;ve tried I burn no matter how much or often I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is also my favorite, it&#x27;s not sticky, greasy, or too thick.  It runs in well and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a white film for me (although I&#x27;m very fair).  Completely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the top ranked EWG sunscreens including this one.  I like that it spreads fairly easily, but it does take some effort to rub in.  A little oily, but not as much as Badger or the Raw Elements body sunscreen. I also like the cap which turns blue in UV light.  Perhaps that&#x27;s just gimmicky, but it&#x27;s a neat idea.  So far though, Thinkbaby has been the best sunscreen on the EWG list in terms of the consistency and application.</li>
    <li> Perfect for our family&#x27;s needs for protection from sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s very thick and great for the beach and outdoor activities.  Made for sensitive skin and great for children and adults alike.  It&#x27;s not the sunscreen I&#x27;d use for daily wear as it&#x27;s super thick and requires a lot of rubbing in before it disappears into your skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent sunscreen protection. Perfect size for air travel regarding the 3oz. limit for liquids and creams.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen seems to work but it must be reapplied each time you get wet.  This can be annoying when children are the main users.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter. She had few spots on face. After consulting with Doctor, we were looking for good sun screen lotion/cream. We got reference for this from freind. After 2 -3 usage, all spot gone. Very good and effective result.</li>
    <li> This is a serious product.  It has both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which as far as I know, are the only two substances that block both UVA and UVB rays simultaneously.  I have been reading about and using sunscreens for a few decades since I am fair-skinned and very sensitive to the sun.  In most sunscreens, I usually find one or the other ingredient or neither - it is rare to find both ingredients in the same product.&lt;br /&gt;Also, Blue Lizard absorbs really well.  It feels great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Blue Lizard to everyone.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works great on my kids, especially their faces.  The product arrived as described and quickly.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This goes on a little thick and white but it is well worth the time it takes for it to put it on and the white to go away.  It is truly sweat proof because I perspire so much and nothing else keeps the perspiration down but this one so when I am working outside this is the one for me and I also like the chemical free because it doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Its the only chemical free sunscreen that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t sting my face and eyes.  Been using a couple of years and never had any problems.  It&#x27;s very thick but thats fine with me.</li>
