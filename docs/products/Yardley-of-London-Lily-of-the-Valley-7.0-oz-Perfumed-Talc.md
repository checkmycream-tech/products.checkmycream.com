      <li>A scent of spring after a nice warm bath.</li>
      <li>I have used the rose and lily of the valley talc.  </li>

      <li>I love lily of the valley and the scent is very accurate.</li>
      <li>I was so pleased to find this.</li>
      <li>and I love the floral scents.</li>
      <li>Yardley of London Lily of the Valley is one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>Smells lovely and heavenly.</li>
      <li>I was so glad to find this for my mother.</li>
      <li>It smells ok but not my favorite.  </li>
      <li>it was her favorite scent.</li>
      <li>it&#x60;s really good to use, leaves the skin silky smooth, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>My grandmother had a flower bed filled with lily of the valley.</li>
      <li>It is a light fragrance, very fresh and true to its name.</li>
      <li>I would go outside to sit near the flower bed and simply enjoy their wonderful fragrance.</li>
      <li>It goes on pleasant enough.</li>
      <li>However, after about 30 minutes  this smells a bit too sweet.</li>

      <li>The price was reasonable and the shipping was fast</li>
      <li>Not real crazy about the smell--personal choice.</li>
      <li>like this one a little better than their rose scented powder, which smells a little too much like bath soap for me.</li>
      <li>I would have my own flower bed of lily of the valley, but I live in a hot dry climate where the delicate flowers cannot tolerate such heat, so the fragrance of this lovely powder brings back fond memories.</li>
      <li>Upon first whiff I knew it was different</li>
      <li>Wondering if this is old stock as I have used this brand before !</li>
      <li>There are very few scented body powders made any more</li>
      <li>I enjoy dusting it on with a fluffy powder puff after my shower.</li>
      <li>The scent of Lily of the Valley should be bright and lively but this is dull and flat, with some other scent thrown in.  </li>
      <li>The Lily of the Valley scent is barely there.</li>
      <li>Either this is an old, old tin gone flat or the product has been changed to a different scent</li>

    <li> received in time. good practice</li>
    <li> Not real crazy about the smell--personal choice. Nothing wrong with product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Lily of the Valley scent since I was a teenager and my Grandpa gave me a bottle of Mugeut perfume. This talcum powder has a nice, long-lasting scent, not too heavy or overwhelming. I ordered 3 of these from the seller - they arrived individually wrapped, one was dented, but it was still intact.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this for my mother. She has been looking all over for this product and the price was amazing!</li>
    <li> Good quality product that last forever.&lt;br /&gt;I like this one a little better than their rose scented powder, which smells a little too much like bath soap for me.</li>
    <li> I returned this because it arrived with the metal can dented badly. Looked like it was used. The talc itself smelled good. I will order from another vendor.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find this. There are very few scented body powders made any more and I love the floral scents. This scent has always reminded me of my Mom-it was her favorite scent. The price was reasonable and the shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Not enough Lily o f the Valley scent</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and heavenly. I love lily of the valley and the scent is very accurate. I use this in my hair as a dry shampoo to keep my hair smelling fresh and looking clean. This is a classic!</li>
    <li> I have used the rose and lily of the valley talc.  Both smell and feel great.  If you like or use talc this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I received the two Yardley talcs in a short period of time.  These are hard to find and they smell so true to the Lily of the Valley and Rose fragrance. Thanks and appreciation to the seller.</li>
    <li> Fast and safe shipment, no problem with the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is just amazing:)not to strong, just the perfect amount of perfume,&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x60;s really good to use, leaves the skin silky smooth, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Grandma or just too feel pretty</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance and texture in convenient container.</li>
    <li> Delightful! Delicately scented but with many subtle notes. Will try others.</li>
    <li> I had gotten Lily of the Valley in another brand but could not find it.  I found Yardley and this is oh so wonderful!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time but there was very little&lt;br /&gt;fragrance .... Wondering if this is old stock as I have used this brand before ! I bought the Lavender too from this seller and have the same complaint with it!</li>
    <li> Smells so good, thank you.</li>
    <li> Yardley of London Lily of the Valley is one of my favorite fragrances. A scent of spring after a nice warm bath.</li>
    <li> Very good but goes along way, don&#x27;t have to use much, could be over powering</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and liked it, but this doesn&#x27;t seem like the same product.  Upon first whiff I knew it was different and I don&#x27;t like it.  The scent of Lily of the Valley should be bright and lively but this is dull and flat, with some other scent thrown in.  The Lily of the Valley scent is barely there. Either this is an old, old tin gone flat or the product has been changed to a different scent and I do not like it at all and will search for a different brand.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Yardley&#x27;s Bond Street in a box with a puff.  This was a substitution.  It smells ok but not my favorite.  Not having a powder puff means it gets all over the place instead of on me.</li>
    <li> Though the canister appears to be from Yardley, the talc does not have the fragrance of lilly of the valley which is what I hoped to buy.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the fragrance of lily of the valley. My grandmother had a flower bed filled with lily of the valley. I would go outside to sit near the flower bed and simply enjoy their wonderful fragrance. I would have my own flower bed of lily of the valley, but I live in a hot dry climate where the delicate flowers cannot tolerate such heat, so the fragrance of this lovely powder brings back fond memories. It is a light fragrance, very fresh and true to its name. The talcum leaves your skin soft and silky and keeps you feeling clean and fresh on a hot, summer day. It&#x27;s a delightful fragrance and a lovely powder. I enjoy dusting it on with a fluffy powder puff after my shower.</li>
    <li> Very nice scented powder. Recommend</li>
    <li> Yardley makes great talc. However, after about 30 minutes  this smells a bit too sweet. It may just be my body chemistry. It goes on pleasant enough.</li>
    <li> I did not smell the same as the last can I purchased.</li>
