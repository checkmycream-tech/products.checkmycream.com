<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A relative visiting from California gave me a jar of this product and I was amazed after just one use. My hands felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I also use this on my feet with the same results and it can be used on elbows and knees. This is a wonderful product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I keep it by my sink and use it as needed to smooth my hands out, as well as legs, arms, butt, etc. On the label it says it is fine to use anywhere except the face. Boy, does it make you feel great! I recommend following this product up with a moisturizing lotion for maximum softness. You won&#x27;t believe how soft your hands will be after using this one! My rep is Len Hales in Nashville. He is so sweet and knows a lot about all of the Beauticontrol products. He always emails me special announcements about discounts and info on their newest products. I am now a Beauticontrol fanatic! You can go directly to his page: [...] to order or just to get more info. Try it, and you will not regret it!!</li>
    <li> Love how smooth my skin feels on my hands and feet after using the instant manicure.  It is good for elbows and knees too!</li>
    <li> Fabulous. Fabulous! FABULOUS! This scrub smells so wonderful and works great. My hands are so smooth and silky after I use it and look 10 years younger. I have problems with hangnails and bleeding cuticles and this helps so much. Worth every penny! Buy some.</li>
    <li> Dry your hands , it is very hard on your skin . Expensive and harsh to your skin , I do not recommend this at all!</li>
    <li> This product really does the trick!  I rarely wear gloves and do a lot of cooking, cleaning, and gardening.  This product really helps take a few years off my hands.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product to make your hands feel soft and moisturized.  It&#x27;s just a bit messy and I wish it had come with some sort of stick or other method to stir it.

    <li> it works, pure and simple. Using a very small amount every other day keeps my nails looking healthy and groomed.</li>
    <li> Got hooked on this product some years ago when I worked with a BeutiControl rep.  It&#x27;s been hard to find and I was pleased to get it on Amazon.  I like the herbal much better than the &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; becuase the herbal smells a lot better.  Some people think it is greasy but, once you wash and dry your hands, it&#x27;s not at all.</li>
    <li> Love the Show of Hands Instant Manicure!</li>
    <li> Quite simply - I can&#x27;t live without Show of Hands. I use it mainly on my feet - especially my heels. It is the only product I have found to actually correct the cracked dry skin on feet - outside of an expensive pedicure.  Just like toe nail polish, an application of Show of Hands is a must for me during sandal weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night and every morning for 5 days and my hands look and feel so much better. I have been using this with Caswell-Massey Carmichaels Cuticle Cream and my hands and nails look fabulous. I love beuticontrol. There lip balm is perfect to apply before bed and wake up with super soft lips. You can use it during the day but I lip color lip balms and glosses.</li>
    <li> I used this a decade ago, but used up the jar and never bought more.  This winter has been extra cold in Virginia though, and so the heat is running constantly.  My hands have been feeling super rough due to the dry air.  i remembered this product and decided to see if it was as good as my memory of it was.  It is!  A little goes a long way, and after using it, my hands felt SOOO much better.  Now if I could find something that would help the dry hair!</li>
    <li> Good service.  Happy with product.  It is different in that it is gritty at first, but washess off to a smooth sily feeling.</li>
    <li> Exactly like I remember! This is the best scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. Cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> Called Instant Manicure for a reason!  I have really dry hands and cuticles and this stuff with ONE use softened it all.  I was so surprised after 5 or 6 more hand washings and washing up pots and pans, my hands were still soft!  Wish Beauticontrol would bring this product back into stock.  It doesn&#x27;t blow you away with sent either.  It is a lovely product!</li>
    <li> It is a great treatment. Helps your hands and you fingernails.</li>
    <li> Not sure about &amp;#34;instant manicure&amp;#34;; but your hands feel absolutely terrific after using. Love to wash with it right before going to bed. Just feels great and leaves hands feeling soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I used this at my daughter in laws hows about 2 years ago and am thrilled to get it again.</li>
    <li> The price was better than anywhere else, have used for years,  just like getting a manicure every day of the week</li>
    <li> I lost my Beauti Control person and was out of my &amp;#34;Show of Hands&amp;#34; stuff. As a nurse, my hands take a beating year round and this product saves them from most of that abuse.</li>
    <li> This is a basic hand scrub. It works as well as any other sugar/oil manicure scrub. It has a nice scent, and you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of product to achieve soft hands. It really should come with a stirrer of sorts so you can mix the product prior to use. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product &amp; is perfect for cold Michigan winters when my hands get dry and chapped.</li>
    <li> Bought for wife, she loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is one product I plan to keep on hand all the time. It&#x27;s created for hands but I apply to bottom of my feet and elbows.  It&#x27;s amazing!  Doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.</li>
    <li> Absolutely &amp;#34;divine&amp;#34;. I first used this product at a home party. I was extremely impressed after my first use. It is my everyday go to for soft, beautiful and well groomed hands.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to use, smells good, feels good especially after you rinse your hands and put on your hand lotion.  Really helps with &amp;#34;winterized&amp;#34; hands in cold weather.</li>
    <li> This product is absolute majic for your hands.  I&#x27;m not one for bath andf beauty products.  I found this during a beauticontrol home party and was actually impressed.  The results are immediate.  With long term weekly use, you have amazing results.This priduct is so good, I often buy several as Xmas presents every year for female friends and family.  I was really pleased to find this product for such a good price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have used this for a few yrs and I love it. Keeps my hands soft, with the help of a good Hand lotion!</li>
