<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My most reliable finishing product for my hair to be shiny and healthy. Handy size too.</li>
    <li> Just makes my hair feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble finding Sebastien Potion #9 in the stores. I was happy to find it on line.</li>
    <li> I am a natural hair wearing African-American woman, and this product was recommended to me by my sister in law. I am so happy that I found it! I apply this right after I wash my short hair and my curls pop so much! I am super excited to have found this product.</li>
    <li> Best on the market and have used it for years already. Could not find it locally, but found it on Amazon. Thanks for the quick service</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any earth shattering differences, but the product smelled good and was nice and silky to the touch. Good size to travel with as well.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, this is 4th bottle.  My husband uses daily and I use frequently.  He has curls and I have straight, product adds thickness and style to both types of hair.</li>
    <li> I have mature (grey) hair that has a mind of its own. I was hoping to tame flyaways and get some body and control, but my hair seemed lifeless and dull. I have used several other Sebastian products in the past; maybe this one is just not right for my hair.</li>
    <li> this stuff is like Magic my hair looks better than it ever has!  this stuff makes dry straw hair look healthy and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I had already used this product before, it ready maintains a good hair condition. However, I expected a refilling package as it is a travelling size. However, once it&#x27;s over, it&#x27;s over, so I find it hard to justify the value when compared to bigger quantity packages...</li>
    <li> I have natural hair (African American hair).  I loved the straight look but no longer wanted to use relaxers as they damaged my scalp.  This works great!

(Now obviously everyone will not get the exact same results for instance my daughters hair stayed straight for a week and a half). Definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products I used..&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Halo Mist&lt;br /&gt;Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian Hair Re-Shaper</li>
    <li> Only leave-in product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling gunky the next morning.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I use it as a light holding gel for my hair.  It smells great and it holds hair very lightly after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> My hait is curly and thin. cant use product. Use it before! I really liked it! I&#x27;ll use it again!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel dirty and sticky and did not do anything to make it look better.  I will not try again.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto...</li>
    <li> I like this product. It helps over treated hair; the ends especially. I recommend this to anyone looking to put something in their hair and not have the time to style. It works well with styling too.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  I recently traveled and didn&#x27;t want to check my luggage.  I ordered this travel size bottle and it worked great.  Fit well into my 1 quart zip lock with the rest of my products.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing but make your hair feel slippery.</li>
    <li> I read that this treatment would help with giving some volume to your hair. I tried it once and couldn&#x27;t tell if it helped. I guess I&#x27;ll continue to use it to see if it works.</li>
    <li> Really bad product.  Not helpful at all. Makes your hair frizzy and not helpful. Iwould never reccomend tjis product. d</li>
    <li> Love the product and love this size for travel. Couldn&#x27;t go on the road without it - under 3 oz for carry on. Good price and prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Received a free sample and loved it. I have used several styling products for my hair the past few years. Love the feel of my hair after drying. I apply to damp hair and style as usual. Not stiff at all or too soft, just right. I was so happy I was able to find on Amazon for such a great price. I bought 3 bottles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Potion 9 for years. I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s pretty long and gets tangled even just out of the shower. I let my hair dry for a while, then I put some Potion 9 and brush my hair out easily. You can also put it on already dry hair, or when you get out of a pool and it detangles well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging of this better than the old tube. No accidentally squirting way too much out and wasting it. I&#x27;ll definitely continue buying this.</li>
    <li> Great marketing ploy.  Didn&#x27;t really feel like it did anything.  I wouldnt buy it again or reccomend anyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo by Sebastian and as I was searching I came across this product. It is a small bottle but you don&#x27;t need alot. It smells great.</li>
    <li> a good styling treatment/ cream.  It smells great.  I got it because something on pinterest said that if you put this in your hair, it will give you beachy waves.  Well, it was worth a try.  We thought it might texturize my daughters long hair and give her some beachy waves.  As it turns out, it doesn&#x27;t really do that.  It does leave the hair very silky soft and smelling great but doesn&#x27;t do a lot for styling in my opinion.  We still need other products to create the style we want! but again, it smells fantastic!  I would buy it again for the smell and the softness....but not for &amp;#34;styling.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This works great in my hair I get frizzy dry hair a lot and have and am still trying different products I love the results after using this I put it on my wet hair and air dry you don&#x27;t need to much .Keeps my hair frizz free all day and leaves a nice shine also the scent is so nice.This is 1.7 ounces but should last a month .Compared to more expensive brands this gets a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> I used this treatment for years and then it became increasingly hard to find and expensive.  It&#x27;s great as a leave-in conditioner and now that my hair has become coarser in texture, it controls it beautifully.  I hope they haven&#x27;t changed the formula and that ordering on Amazon delivers the authentic product.  I now have an Ulta in my town and I&#x27;ve been able to find it there, although it has increased in price quite a bit since I first started using it.  It has numerous nutrients and oils that condition the hair and never leave it feeling greasy or weighed down. Just a little is all it takes.  It imparts quite a bit of shine, although it does nothing for frizz (the frizz factor in Florida is off the charts).  I have to use a separate silicone serum for that.  Although I always use a rich quick-acting mask after I shampoo, sometimes it&#x27;s not enough moisture for my very long hair.  I limit using heated styling tools, preferring instead to let my hair dry overnight and use a curling iron in the morning.  Because my hair is very hard to hold, I use the iron on the hottest setting.  This in turn tends to make my hair staticky and dry and this potion helps to alleviate that problem.  It&#x27;s perfect to use in the wintertime when hot, dry heating gives me flyaway tresses.  I really like Potion 9 and will continue to use it.  I&#x27;m just glad I can finally find it where I live.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Daughter used product hasn&#x27;t ask for anymore.</li>
    <li> Helped smooth hair but nothing too great for the price. Way too expensive.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this product!  Even over high end brands at twice the price.  I have used it for over 30 years.  But just switched to the wearable styling a year ago.  Conditions better than Purology.  I have curly hair so I like the wearable styling feature.  When I straightened my hair, colored it and/or permed it, it was the only product out of the dozens I tried that kept my hair from feeling like straw.</li>
    <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe how great this stuff works!  I use it on damp hair and blow my hair dry straight.  The results are incredible!  My fine hair has wonderful volume without being weighed down and is straight(frizz free).  What&#x27;s even better is that the style STAYS THAT WAY all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without Potion 9!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair, but this product does not seem to be as good as it use to be.  It is not a bad product, but it just does not perform on my hair the way it use to.</li>
    <li> I really love this!! Put it in when out of the shower and it helps (or if you&#x27;ve been swimming, my hairs always dry after swimming and it helps) the only down side is it makes it look greasy if you put too much in</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years. I have not found anything that is as good as this product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great Hair Product - Saw a difference in hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier with results. Definitely recommend. This has become a product that I always order more of when I am running low. It&#x27;s my secret weapon!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is perfect for my curly hair. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Like this, but I like the light version better.</li>
    <li> I love it-not too greasy, heavy but soft.</li>
</ol>
