    <li> Smells good. Works well. Helps you get good color with its built-in bronzers and makes your skin feel really soft. Much cheaper than buying in store.</li>
    <li> So I have been using JWOW for 2 1/2 weeks (with a mix of high and low beds) and I haven&#x27;t been seeing the results I want. I then tried the VIP by Playboy and after 2 uses I&#x27;m getting that sun kissed tan I have been trying to get. (1 time was with a low bed and the 2nd time I used a level 4 bed) I love the smell before and after tanning, it also goes on easy. I just got the Dazzling Legs by Playboy in the mail, look out for my review on that one :)</li>
    <li> This lotion is my absolute favorite and it doesn&#x27;t make me orange like other high bronzing lotions. Also, buying it here online saved me a ton of money whereas at my salon they charge $75 a pop. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I am not going to even open this as I have found out by using other lotions from Amazon that they are cut with chemicals that have been giving me rashes and burning me. Beware of all online lotions!</li>
    <li> Would have told how it works, takes some time. Several more times to wait after color shows up. Will catch up then.</li>
    <li> Great product for a smooth bronzed look. Wont leave you orange like other products and smells good too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad lotion. The reason I got it was because the girls at the tanning salon I go to kept saying how awesome it was and how much darker you&#x27;ll get. Theirs was selling for $75 after 20% off, so when I saw it on amazon for $30 I bought it. Will I ever buy it again? No. It&#x27;s not bad lotion but nowhere near as good as they made it out to be. It smells ok, gets you bit darker, but I still had better experience with Swedish beauty products. The way I see it is you pay for the name...</li>
    <li> Great stuff really love it just got my own Tanning bed and needed some lotion great pick!!Wasn&#x27;t sure what one to get but look&#x27;s like i did good..Thank You!!!</li>
    <li> Love how it feels after! So smooth and the smell isnt so bad either..I just can&#x27;t seem to get my legs the same color as my tummy :/ but Im guessing thats the bed im using not the lotions fault</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I got color just after the first time using it. There is no greasy feeling afterwards like many tanning lotions out there. Has a normal if not good smell, too. I love this lotion and I will continue to use it until they stop making it!</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on so smooth not a real dark thick lotion like others I have. Smells wonderful even after tanning too. I&#x27;m a mom age 24  of a 16 month old and a 2 month old so I need stuff that&#x27;s worth the time using and this qualified. I used it yesterday when I went tanning and can totally see a difference. Great product and so much better to buy online verses in salon at my place it was 79 n I get a 15 percent discount but it was way cheaper on amazon I love this site and has wonderful products too. Happy tanning kids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw this is not ocheck it&#x27;s his wife I use this cuz he&#x27;s prime lol</li>
    <li> The lotion had the expired smell to it, it streaked. It took forever to show any noticeable color. But it did have a nice consistency to it went on smooth (but streaky) overall wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Fantastic smell...  no lines after using.  Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  I will definitely purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> I havent been using this lotion very long but so far I love it, it has a nice smell also!!</li>
    <li> I just used a packet of this two days ago in a level 4 bed and let me tell you i was two shades darker that night and im not pale ether. I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 4moths now and didst think i could get any darker and i tan every other day in a high level bed too. So i was doing my research to try and find that perfect lotion that would break my tanning Plateau so i decided to try vip from playboy and wow!!!Super dark. The smell is good to. The after smell is just like any other high bronzing lotion, not to good but not so bab that u have to jump in the shower ether and it leave your skin really soft after tanning so there is no need to feel like you have to moisturize right after. No streaking or orange hands just great even tan. All in all a great lotion. Just bout a bottel online and cant wait till it gets here. Definitely going to put it in my tanning arsenal (ha ha ha) ;-) Also bout a bottel of dazzling legs too so can&#x27;t wait to see the results of the two. If your looking for a great lotion that gets you dark fast, look no further, this is it!! Would recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this lotion. it got me super dark so fast, and for a redhead thats hard to do. if i had one complaint it would be the smell. there isnt much of a perfumey scent which is the problem in my opinion because thats what covers up the \\&quot;ive just been tanning\\&quot; smell. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. I will definitely be purchasing this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I love it, smells great, feels great, I apply it 20 minutes before I hit the tanning bed and I get 2 shades darker, for all of you that haven&#x27;t gotton any results your useing it worng.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t produce color - had more going in the tanning session than I did coming out! I know Playboy makes good tanning lotions, this just isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
