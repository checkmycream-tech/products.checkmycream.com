    <li> I have been buying this for over 20 years and it is still my favorite - brings back memories every time hubby wears it.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell definitely old school flavor no one knows what it is but they all want it  !!! Wish there was a better set ! Glad to have squired this sent</li>
    <li> Been using Kouros since 1984, fortunately it&#x27;s still available. Very different to most other &#x27;Like&#x27; products -Distinctive.  The price has gone up, actually, though it&#x27;s probably a case of supply and demand now.  Solid product.</li>
    <li> I bought this present for my husband and he loves it. Very strong so one or two sprays is enough. The smell lasts all day on him. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Kouros. The first bottle I bought for myself and the second bottle I got for my dad for his 80 th birthday. This stuff is addictive! I keep smelling the bottle even when I am wearing something else. My 19 year old son likes Kouros. I am 48 years old  and of course my dad is very happy to have a bottle of Kouros too. This is the most manliest fragrance that I have ever had my nose on.  I also have other greats like Chanel Antaeus and Caron s Yatagan which I highly recommend. For some reason mine came without the silver rings although my dad s came with the rings. Perhaps his is a different formulation.  Thanks for shipping to Canada.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance ever! I can nevef find it in stores and so happy to get it for less thru Amazon that any other e-tailer. Shipped quick and came intact, well packaged. Thanks Amazon!!![[ASIN:B002DXWXBQ KOUROS by Yves Saint Laurent Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz]]</li>
    <li> I wore this in the 80&#x27;s and this is the same as I remember. I would recommend this cologne to anyone who likes to smell grown and sexy.</li>
    <li> Gift for my dad... he loves perfumes and when he smelt the kouros I was using, I saw his face brighten up.  So I got it for him... it arrived on time and in good shape.</li>
    <li> Smells good ... perfect traveling size.</li>
    <li> This cologne was my favority yrs ago, is not like yrs ago, Im not planning buying it anymore in my life</li>
    <li> This was not the same cologne it was either a phony or expired. Smelled awful, not the cologne i smelled in the store prior to purchasing this through amazon.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my brother-in-law and he loved it. Fell like I pulled it out of the WAAAAy Back machine. He loves it so it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>

    <li> Outstanding. I would buy this item again if needed. It fits just right with no problems at all. Buy It.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Kouros in my twenties. The scent is a very distinctive and not over powering. I have tried other colognes, but always come back to Kouros.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wearing this scent for years.  When he first puts it on I have to leave the room (I&#x27;d leave the house if I could).  But after about 20 minutes it smells really nice.  He gets compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Just beautiful!!! I have always loved this scent! its very unique and everyone notices the smell and comments even if your in a room full of different fragrances.. Love it.</li>
