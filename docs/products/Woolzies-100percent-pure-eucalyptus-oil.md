    <li> I am very happy with the smell it gives my towels, etc when they come out of dryer  Also my laundry room smells delightful  I like all Woolsie oils I have used so far  Priced right as well</li>
    <li> Has a very odd smell.</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing the trick!  Happy to not have to use harsh chemicals on the puppies!</li>
    <li> Smells great and is long lasting</li>
    <li> Using it it with the balls for the dryer.  Makes the clothes smell fresh.  I am going to use it in my diffusers .  Love the fresh smell, not over powering.</li>
    <li> I like to mix eucalyptus with peppermint in the humidifier when the kids have stuffy noses. They sleep so good when they can breathe! I think this product is a good value, and I like the pretty blue bottle. I&#x27;ve only bought eucalyptus one other time, but it cost 2 or 3 times more than this one for the same amount. Much happier with this one.</li>
    <li> Smells mostly like Citronella with very little other noticeable scent. but great to use for keeping bugs away!</li>

    <li> Just what I expected it to be!</li>
    <li> I buy Woolzies oil to use on my dryer balls.  This one is awful.  It smells like a horrible citronella candle.  Maybe this would work in an outdoor diffuser for repelling bugs, but not on my clothes.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible! I can&#x27;t imagine using it.</li>
    <li> Add to my homemade cleaning products.</li>
    <li> this oil is NOT as potent as Young Living Essential oils. I will NEVER order this brand again</li>
    <li> This product  was not as strong in the dryer I would like it to be, but it did help somewhat.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product in because of the winter season here in Ohio almost everyone in my family is complaining of congestion! You can buy vapor rub for $2-8 per bottle and that gets very very expensive. I took this oil and mixed it with some petro-jelly (i believe i did 20 drops to 2/3 cup of petro-jelly) and rubbed it into my chest and had fabulous results. If you don&#x27;t like the whole thick jelly feeling on your chest you can apply a drop of eucalyptus oil on an organic cotton ball and sniff it several times a day. You can also add a few drops to water or a nebulizer as steam therapy, or use a few drops in your bath water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff comes out very quick! So take caution when pouring the drops out if you don&#x27;t pay attention you will use the entire bottle super quick. The price offered by Woolzies is pretty great to when you compare other brands or even big box offerings. I recommend this product for not only price but also quality!</li>
    <li> Great stuff and if you suffer with headaches, put a drop or two on your pillow when laying down or sleeping.  Really good for showers. Good steamy shower with  drop of this in corner.</li>
