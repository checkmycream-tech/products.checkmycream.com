      <li>I like the colors good assortment for all seasons</li>

      <li>I am very pleased with the product and it is everything you need to get started doing your own nails at home.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time to try this at home and it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>Additionally, the colors are so amazing.</li>
      <li>But I must say, this kit is amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice selection of colors for a starter set.</li>
      <li>The colors are a good starter kit, but I&#x27;ll be getting some others that are more my style.</li>
      <li>After receiving my light , I&#x27;m now rockin my very own gel mani.</li>
      <li>This kit is very comprehensive, you won&#x27;t find any bright colors in this kit, but there are beautiful colors for fall and winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Some of the colors like Bubble Bath are light but good for summer season coming up.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I will not give this product all 5 stars because the kit I received did not have the OPI Instructional Brochure which is very important for me as a salón owner...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to do my own manicure now</li>
      <li>I purchased a $50ish light from Amazon as well, and I&#x27;ve been able to do my own quality manicures ever since.</li>
      <li>Everything is included to get started and I love these colors.</li>
      <li>OPI is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I really love the colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad they added those</li>
      <li>Love being able to do my nails at home</li>
      <li>I love this kit...</li>
      <li>Love the Opi gel polish.</li>
      <li>My favorite is Vampsterdam.</li>
      <li>I wish there was a wider color selection -- and more detailed directions.</li>
      <li>I am so happy I bough this kit, OPI has always had the best regular nail polish and the gel is no different.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Doing both fingers and toes takes about 2 hours, but I do it in front of the TV in the comfort of my own home, and the anticipated savings makes it well worth it.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t found OPI gel polish this cheap anywhere else.</li>
      <li>All you would need is a LED light</li>
      <li>Especially now that I know I can apply the gel myself and it looks great.</li>
      <li>Totally worth your money!</li>
      <li>I&#x27; new to doing my own Gel nails at home</li>
      <li>It was only one color like that so far, but everything otherwise is great!</li>
      <li>so you could see what my nails look like after using the chunky top coat it came with and then after using another OPI top coat with the same light.</li>
      <li>First it is FULL SIZE bottles.</li>
      <li>My favorite polish by far.</li>
      <li>Not a single regret :)</li>
      <li>Polish looks very nice but last only a day or two.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time</li>
      <li>My first try</li>
      <li>I really like the kit, but I had to contact the seller and exchange the top coat because it was chunky inside the bottle, all other polishes were fine though.  </li>
      <li>am usually a Gelish fan, in which I still am but OPI GelColor is a good change.</li>
      <li>My nails grow fast,  so unlike some women I can&#x27;t extend a manicure for a month.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Last week I received my products, they were securely packed.</li>
      <li>Just use cotton balls and tin foil - much easier and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I bought a 36 watt uv light setter (that&#x27;s what is recommended for the OPI gels) and total</li>
      <li>but they stay on really well.</li>
      <li>When you think about each OPI gel color is $17.50 ($13.25 for Gelish) at most professional stores like Cosmo Prof or Salon Centric.</li>
      <li>I have only used the kit once so far, but I love it.</li>
      <li>The only thing you could really be replacing soon is the acetone soak off, and the tin foil wrap things, but both you can purchase super cheap at your local drug store.</li>
      <li>Most of the time these gel kits come with the mini sizes of everything, which will still last you a long time, but these full sizes will last forever!</li>
      <li>A very complete starter kit with a various gel color polish!</li>
      <li>The colors are good and the polish  will stay on for way over 2 weeks without looking bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Everything you need except the drier is included in this set.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit. When you think about each OPI gel color is $17.50 ($13.25 for Gelish) at most professional stores like Cosmo Prof or Salon Centric. $17.50 x 6 colors (and base coat + top coat) you are looking at $140.00. This is a steal! This is the best collection of starter colors I have found. My favorite is Vampsterdam. In the sunlight there is little shimmer to the nail color. Some of the colors like Bubble Bath are light but good for summer season coming up.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I am not a big fan of is the tin foil gel removers. They were useless and just made more work for me to re-do and re-soak my nails in order to get the gel off. Everything else in this kit is great. I&#x27;m glad they added those so I could try them. But I would NOT buy again nor recommend. Just use cotton balls and tin foil - much easier and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I am usually a Gelish fan, in which I still am but OPI GelColor is a good change. GelColor seems thinner than Gelish. The top coat catches some of the nail color on the brush, however it does not transfer to another nail.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great starter kit. You have everything you need at a great price. All you would need is a LED light and you are set.</li>
    <li> I will not give this product all 5 stars because the kit I received did not have the OPI Instructional Brochure which is very important for me as a salón owner... everything else was just as expected</li>
    <li> Everything was perfectly packaged, great colors, works just as it should and it is going to save me a ton of money because I can do it all at home instead of having to go to the salon! Not a single regret :)</li>
    <li> OMG. I basically write generic posts when I review because I don&#x27;t have time. But I must say, this kit is amazing. First it is FULL SIZE bottles. Most of the time these gel kits come with the mini sizes of everything, which will still last you a long time, but these full sizes will last forever! Additionally, the colors are so amazing. they take me from Spring all the way through winter! I only wish that they had included a white for a french Manicure, but I can buy that separate. I am so happy I bough this kit, OPI has always had the best regular nail polish and the gel is no different.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this, and it was a really great deal at $99. All the products work beautifully. The colors are a good starter kit, but I&#x27;ll be getting some others that are more my style. Especially now that I know I can apply the gel myself and it looks great. This was my first time to try this at home and it worked perfectly. I bought a 36 watt uv light setter (that&#x27;s what is recommended for the OPI gels) and total I spent $130. My first try I did a gel pedi and mani and they turned out salon perfect, without the $90 price tag! I&#x27;m So happy to kiss my monthly nail salon bill, GOODBYE!</li>
    <li> I like the colors good assortment for all seasons</li>
    <li> Awesome. not so into the brown color, but they stay on really well.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Product was as expected. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I have only used the kit once so far, but I love it. Salon quality nails.</li>
    <li> Great kit! Has saved me a lot of money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. No breakage or spilling of any products. The colors are as described and everything was individually wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied with my purchase. Will purchase again. Thanks</li>
    <li> A very complete starter kit with a various gel color polish! I used it for the first time and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> Perfect for any beginner! I bought this to start doing my nails at home and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Colors came out great I use them with the OPI led lamp.</li>
    <li> love it , awesome product, fast ship, great price</li>
    <li> Great price for everything that is included, good color choices as well!</li>
    <li> Polish looks very nice but last only a day or two. I am in water daily so I am not sure if that is the reason why. Or the fact that I am not a professional. Strangely, the polish on my toes lasts for two weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit when I got a gel nail machine for Christmas. It has everything you need to do gel manicures, and will last you for a LONG time. The only thing you could really be replacing soon is the acetone soak off, and the tin foil wrap things, but both you can purchase super cheap at your local drug store. OPI has the best quality nail polish in my opinion, and this was perfect to start my at home gel nail adventure!</li>
    <li> I wish there was a wider color selection -- and more detailed directions.</li>
    <li> The gel polish is thicker than what I am use to using but after I learned how to apply it, I have not any problems. The colors are good and the polish  will stay on for way over 2 weeks without looking bad.  I am very pleased with the product and it is everything you need to get started doing your own nails at home.  It looks as good as any salon manicure.</li>
    <li> I really like the kit, but I had to contact the seller and exchange the top coat because it was chunky inside the bottle, all other polishes were fine though.  I added a before and after so you could see what my nails look like after using the chunky top coat it came with and then after using another OPI top coat with the same light.</li>
    <li> Has everything you need to get started, but really didn&#x27;t like a few of the nail colors.  Other than that it&#x27;s a good kit.</li>
    <li> Great set. It came with everything you could think of, though, which is great! One of the colors was very thin-more like liquid, which was disappointing. It was only one color like that so far, but everything otherwise is great!</li>
    <li> What a great deal for all this polish. I really love the colors. OPI is my favorite. Great starter kit for at home nails!</li>
    <li> Love being able to do my nails at home</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t imagine my nails would be polished and dried in less than 30 minutes!  Great investment.  It&#x27;s already paid for itself!</li>
    <li> Nice selection of colors for a starter set.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Last week I received my products, they were securely packed. After receiving my light , I&#x27;m now rockin my very own gel mani. 💅</li>
    <li> Love the Opi gel polish. My favorite polish by far. It looks great two weeks after the manicure it will still looks like it just was polished!</li>
    <li> I love this kit...I&#x27; new to doing my own Gel nails at home and this is the perfect starter kit with beautiful colors!</li>
    <li> I love gel manicures, but hated spending $40+ every 2 weeks to get them done. My nails grow fast,  so unlike some women I can&#x27;t extend a manicure for a month.

    <li> I recived the item on time, and it&#x27;s an exellent kit for opi beginers.</li>
    <li> I literally use this every week and constantly change my nail color. My step daughter loves it too.. Haven&#x27;t found OPI gel polish this cheap anywhere else. Another reason I&#x27;m obsessed with amazon !</li>
