    <li> When I received this package the shampoo and conditioner leaked almost half the bottles there was some other particles in the package as well that just grosses me out. I usually don&#x27;t rate anything low but for paying this much on a product, I don&#x27;t expect to only get half.</li>
    <li> Love this thick great smelling shampoo and conditioner. I have hair that is highlighted and regularly gets keratin treatments all while living in the humid south. This product keeps my hair smooth and healthy!  P.S. -- a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have tried countless products on my hair. I have very wavy/frizzy hair, and live in Louisiana so the humidity does not help. I can honestly say this product smooths the frizzies and leaves my hair silky smooth. It feels so much more healthy, and is a lot easier to manage. My hair has a lot of body and volume to it, but this smooths is down a lot. I use the Unite Boosta Volumizing Spray with this product so my hair does not look too flat at the roots.</li>
    <li> Love unite products!!</li>
    <li> I am so so happy to say that I&#x27;ve been using this plus the Unite Extra Moisturizing mask for about 3 months. My hair has started growing again!!! It takes YEARS for me to grow my hair. I cant believe this has worked so well for me. Worth every penny. I use the mask 1-2x a week, and I also use a TINY drop of WEN and run it through my hair as a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love and use all the unite products. They are a little pricey but well worth the quality and the scents</li>
    <li> Strange shampoo. Trying to get used to it. It makes my hair feel really good and clean but the no lather thing is hard to adjust to. Also, it has no smell.. which is OK...just not what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> Love this product works great leaves my hair soft &amp; smooth Will purchase it again &amp; recommend it to friends &amp; family</li>
    <li> First time I tried this product was at &amp;#34;BLOW&amp;#34; salon in LA. It had a meeting this day and planned on getting a blow out and style. The only products they use there are Unite. I&#x27;ve used numerous products and I was impressed with this brand. The smell is fabulous! Fruity yet up-lifting. It lathered up quite nicely and isn&#x27;t harsh on my scalp. After the style and blow out my hair was quite soft, smooth and had  more volume and bounce I didn&#x27;t know my hair had. I gave it a day and my scalp was still reaction free and my hair wasn&#x27;t oily the next day. LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. Both make my hair so healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> No bed head hair for me..EXCELLENT product...love it..i definitley will rebuy again!!..kept my hair super manageabley soft...love it, lathers well in the shampoo, and conditioner soften&#x27;s my hair excellently!!!</li>
    <li> Eorjs fabulous on tangled long hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey considering the size of the bottles, but I love the shampoo.  I have tried other brands after having the Keratin treatment done, but my hair always felt oily and not clean.  This brand actually lathers and leave my hair feeling clean!</li>
    <li> Unite makes excellent products for the hair.I only found out about them when my hair started to grow grey--actually when I decided to stop coloring it--some much healthier and easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these products makes me look like I went to a beauty salon.  The products actually do what they say they will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cheap--but to me well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, by the way,the products came early!</li>
    <li> I have natural wavy hair and have problems with frizz. This product smells good and feels great but I&#x27;m still dealing with frizziness. Definitely not as bad as before and I&#x27;m hoping as I continue to use these products they will improve the frizziness and give me smooth waves.</li>
    <li> Love it! I have thick, long, curly hair that I often straighten. With this product my hair comes out very soft and light, and almost zero frizz even in foggy/rainy weather. The scent is very subtle, I actually wish it was a little stronger because I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, but it&#x27;s a very nice slightly tropical clean scent. It&#x27;s my second time ordering it and I plan to keep using it, my hair has never been so consistently nice and I&#x27;ve tried almost all of the drug store brands. I&#x27;ve also found that I don&#x27;t need to use much for good results, in fact it came out greasy one time when I tried piling on more than usual (along these same lines, be sure to rinse well) my last order lasted about 3 months. I won&#x27;t ever go back to store brands. Both times I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller it has arrived early.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Makes my hair sleek and shiny.  Will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to get my hair as soft and smooth as the old Brazillian Blowouts used to do.  (I personally hate that I can&#x27;t still get a blowout that actually straightens my hair).  This shampoo and conditioner does a great job of bringing back that soft as silk and smooth feeling that I used to have.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t straighten.  But, nothing seems to do that anymore.  So, this is the best solution I&#x27;ve found!</li>
