      <li>There is a nice heft to the razor handle which feels good in the hand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This one holds a nice amount of water and has very fine dense bristles that lather great.</li>
      <li>He was impressed at the whole set and loved the chrome look.    </li>
      <li>After receiving my shaving set I was first off impressed with the feel of the razor handle.  </li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my husband two years ago, and it stands as his favorite gift ever!</li>
      <li>Was a nice quality and looked even better than the picture!</li>
      <li>The brush is nice.</li>
      <li>This is a nice shave set.  </li>
      <li>but the deal is, this is a nice shave set.</li>
      <li>it is a Nice Set ...&lt;</li>
      <li>It looked nice.</li>
      <li>The brush fits nicely in your hand and has some weight to it.</li>
      <li>This is a nice shaving kit otherwise.</li>
      <li>He uses his own razor, but keeps this one out for display.</li>
      <li>The brush and razor handle are nicely weighted</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really nice because the bowl has a holder for it</li>
      <li>Nice gift.</li>
      <li>THE BRUSH is a badger hair brush that works up a nice lather...</li>
      <li>and he really liked it.</li>
      <li>The shine holds well, plus the Gillette Mach 3 Razors are very easy to find everywhere.  </li>
      <li>However, the metal corrodes very easily when exposed to water, which makes the idea of keeping shaving soap in the shaving soap dish impractical.  </li>
      <li>Very nice, worth every penny.</li>
      <li>First off, this shave set looks great.</li>
      <li>It was very comfortable in my hand.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>You figure that something made for use in a bathroom would be more resistant to rust.</li>
      <li>And this causes more cuts on my face.</li>
      <li>Boyfriend Likes it :))</li>
      <li>It also looks nice, but the point where you attach the Mach 3 blade is cheap plastic, and looks like it might snap off one day.</li>
      <li>Although it may be real badger hair, it is not all that great quality.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be pleased as will your recipient.  </li>
      <li>The badger hair brush whips up lather better than I ever thought it would.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>The bowl is beautiful and he has had no problem with rust or tarnish because he dries it completely after each use.</li>
      <li>My husband loved the set from the first use.</li>
      <li>My husband says shaving is so much more enjoyable when he has the right tools!</li>
      <li>The brush is soft, and still in great shape.</li>
      <li>but I did make sure a blade would fit the handle.</li>
      <li>the most comfortable shave</li>
      <li>I enjoy being able to pull the shave pot out and whip the lather in my hand.</li>
      <li>It looks nice on the shelf right out of the box, but after a year of use it corroded/rusted and fell apart (brush, bowl and stand; the razor is holding up well).</li>
      <li>Even better, the pivot is more angled and flexible, which helps provide a closer, more exact shave.</li>
      <li>It is beautiful enough to keep on the bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>The first time I used the brush I also liked the thickness of the bristles and the amount of lather it generated from the shaving soap.  </li>
      <li>My Face shave cream and a squirt or two works fine for my two swipes.  </li>
      <li>And if that is your only purpose to buy it, then you will be happy.</li>
      <li>but it otherwise works fantastic.</li>
      <li>My sideburns do not end up chewed in spots, and my neck area is as smooth as the face.  </li>
      <li>Solid build and great  looking.</li>
      <li>I purchased this set, and without a doubt its very nice and attractive, but it is also not made to last very long.  </li>
      <li>also the heavy handle feels great in the hand and seems to perform better than a plastic handle.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure when my daughter suggested it, but it turned out to be something he really wanted but wouldn&#x27;t buy for himself.  </li>
      <li>The bowl and stand work great, which I enjoy since they now take up less counter space.</li>
      <li>Nice heavy razor that is balanced and fits in the hand nicely.  </li>
      <li>Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>THE HANDLE is nice and fits the Mach 3 (obviously.)  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read all 19 reviews that appear prior to my writing this and am amazed that most of the writers have experienced the same things I did but still felt compelled to give more than one star to this pitiful excuse for a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The price was right and it looks even nicer in person.     </li>
      <li>The shaving handle has a solid, heavy feel to it and gives a nice shave, a good quality brush as well.</li>
      <li>Brush is nice and heavy, actually everything has a good \\&quot;heft\\&quot; to it.  </li>
      <li>We are now on the lookout for a new handle that might still fit in the holder.</li>
      <li>However if you plan on using it almost daily as I do, I think you might not be satisfied.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, the bowl was beginning to rust.  </li>
      <li>I had dropped the razor one too many times and Trac II connection (also plastic) finally broke.  </li>
      <li>I also do agree with another review, that the brush does smell a bit funny</li>
      <li>better than several boar brushes I have used.  </li>
      <li>Bought this set about 3 months ago and it was exactly what I was hoping it would be.  </li>
      <li>smell at first, but I sprayed the brush with rosemary water, and the smell has diminished.  </li>
      <li>I may clean the bowl after a cake of soap or I may clean the bowl after several cakes of soap.  </li>
      <li>The stand is sturdy enough that it isn&#x27;t prone to tipping when you use the bowl, but the bowl does lift right out for easy cleaning.  </li>
      <li>Other than this major problem the set seems to be very nice.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Gave this to my husband for his B-day.  He loves it - so far no problems.  Brush is nice and heavy, actually everything has a good \\&quot;heft\\&quot; to it.  Nice gift.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance. He loved it and said with the brush and lather it was the most comfortable shave he&#x27;s ever had. It&#x27;s really nice because the bowl has a holder for it so you only have one whole stand to deal with. The brush and razor handle are nicely weighted and he said that helps the shaving process. A great Christmas gift!</li>
    <li> After receiving my shaving set I was first off impressed with the feel of the razor handle.  It was very comfortable in my hand.  The weight of the brush was also impressive.  The first time I used the brush I also liked the thickness of the bristles and the amount of lather it generated from the shaving soap.  Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He absolutely loves it. He&#x27;d talked about wanting to try something different than the usual razor and shaving cream in a can, so I bought him this and a starter set with different shaving products. He says this definitely gave him the closest shave he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> This set was a hit with my Dad.   He used to have a shaving set when I was younger, with the Badger Brush..and I would sit with him in the bathroom, watching him later up his face and make silly faces while putting it on and shaving.. I&#x27;m 28 now and would probably sit and watch him do it again if I could.   He was impressed at the whole set and loved the chrome look.    The brush fits nicely in your hand and has some weight to it. Which is a good thing.    I highly recommend this product. Great looking and at a great price!    -Happy Customer</li>
    <li> Bought this set about 3 months ago and it was exactly what I was hoping it would be.  Soft, thick badger hair brush that lathers up shaving soap nicely.  I had an older cheap brush with thick bristles that took a long time to lather shaving soap.  This one holds a nice amount of water and has very fine dense bristles that lather great. Nice heavy razor that is balanced and fits in the hand nicely.  I don&#x27;t use the soap cup much, because I use a soft soap to lather and shave.  Looks nice and has held up to everyday shaving.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but that is false advertising.  They call it a four piece shaving set with &#x27;mach 3&#x27; razor.  I didn&#x27;t get a razor.  I got a nice handle with a fake piece of plastic on top.  I don&#x27;t any comment like blades not included.    Other than this major problem the set seems to be very nice.  The bowl is a little small in my opinion but I will keep it as it&#x27;s part of the set.</li>
    <li> It is a nice looking set, the razor had the right heft, but unfortunately the brush is coming apart and he hasn&#x27;t used it an entire year yet.</li>
    <li> bought shaving kit for my son, because he likes the &#x27;old style&#x27; type of shaving accessories; bowl &amp; badger brush, single straight edge blade/leather sharpening strap, etc.</li>
    <li> Good looking shaving set, good heft and feel. The shaving handle has a solid, heavy feel to it and gives a nice shave, a good quality brush as well. The bowl lifts out of it&#x27;s holder for ease of lathering. My only complaint is that I have noticed some reaction in the bowl to a couple of the soaps that I have used and some minor flaking of the surface, otherwise 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I read through all of the reviews listed below. I would like to point out that the only complaints I read were, 1. The bowl is starting to rust after a year and a half. Well that&#x27;s a long time but the deal is, this is a nice shave set. I personally clean mine and dry it off after every use. If you do so, you will never see rust on your set. 2. I read a complaint about some sort of reaction to the soap? I find that hard to believe because if the soap is harsh enough to eat the bowl, you would likely feel discomfort on your face as well. At any rate I&#x27;m sure it boils down to maintaining your kit. If you are classy enough to use one you are certainly classy enough to clean one up.        I personally am impressed with the quality of this set. The badger hair brush whips up lather better than I ever thought it would. It takes a few trys to get it down to a science but it works great. I will never go back to cream in a can. also the heavy handle feels great in the hand and seems to perform better than a plastic handle. I enjoy being able to pull the shave pot out and whip the lather in my hand. I have not had a single problem with the brush. I also do agree with another review, that the brush does smell a bit funny the first couple uses, however it was to be expected, I mean it is an animals hair, kind of a wet dog smell at first however as soon as I got some of the soap in it for a couple days its fine. A few hairs also fell out at first, but again that&#x27;s to be expected. Once four or five fell out, that&#x27;s it. It works great.         I recommend this product to any mid aged man that wants a real durable long lasting shave kit.</li>
    <li> As background, let me say that I have been shaving with a shaving set like this one nearly every day for nearly thirty years.  Before that I used a shaving mug and brush, but much prefer having my razor hang to dry as the blades last much longer that way!  I received this set for Christmas 2011 to replace the one I&#x27;d been happily using for more than 25 years.  I had dropped the razor one too many times and Trac II connection (also plastic) finally broke.  I&#x27;ve read all 19 reviews that appear prior to my writing this and am amazed that most of the writers have experienced the same things I did but still felt compelled to give more than one star to this pitiful excuse for a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the positive points:  1.  The design is masculine and attractive, at least to me.  2.  There is a nice heft to the razor handle which feels good in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the negatives:  1.  The brush may be badger, but the \\&quot;slightly musty\\&quot; odor another writer reported was not \\&quot;slight\\&quot; and I would not call it \\&quot;musty\\&quot;!  I immediately thought of wet dog!  I practically gagged from the smell.  Since I did not want to embarass my wife, I said nothing and determined to wait to see if the smell would diminish in time.  Over the course of a month or so, it did.  2.  The bristles are much harsher than in any other shaving brush I have, all of which are \\&quot;badger\\&quot; but are a more reddish color than the one provided in this set.  In addition, the bristles do not lay down as they dry as much as my other brushes have.  They splay out until one starts brushing across the soap.  The splayed configuration, however, makes that much more difficult than it should be.  3.  Unlike one writer, I do not always wipe off the stand every day, particularly if I am rushed.  The chrome plating on the base started to rust within a week from a soapy drop left on it.  My previous set had no rust on its chrome base after over 25 years!  This is either NOT chrome plating or such a shoddy job of chrome plating as to be effectively useless.  4.  The bowl lasted a month before it started to rust and now I have brown soap to shave with!  While the writer who believes that wiping out the bowl after each use is a reasonable exercise, I put a cake of shaving soap (Williams in this case) in the bowl and use it until it is gone.  I may clean the bowl after a cake of soap or I may clean the bowl after several cakes of soap.  In any case, a cake of soap usually lasts me several months - one of the reasons I use this method of shaving is its economy as well as its lower footprint on solid waste disposal and of course the luxurious feel of the brush and lather (but not from this set as I detail above).  To have a bowl start to rust in a month is unconscionable!  5.  The plastic Mach 3 connector did not seem particularly well formed, but it did work.  After only a month or two of use, it is hard to be too critical.  However, I am suspect that it would have lasted anywhere near the 25+ years my last set did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI I have not contacted the retailer about this product and don&#x27;t intend to.  It is made in China!  My product may have been counterfeit, but it appears that all the other comments were along the same vein, just from people with much less experience with this line of consumer goods, so I believe that the vendor is simply bringing in shoddy, Chinese-made junk, to rip people off and to make a profit.  I would avoid any other product from this vendor for the same reason.</li>
    <li> First off, this shave set looks great. And if that is your only purpose to buy it, then you will be happy. However if you plan on using it almost daily as I do, I think you might not be satisfied. Let&#x27;s start with the brush. Although it may be real badger hair, it is not all that great quality. In fact, I have another shave brush made from synthetic hair that is MUCH softer and nicer to use. And it only cost $6 at the mall. Additionally, the hairs keep falling out. I have owned this product for over a month and have used it over a dozen times. Still there are five or so hairs that fall out each time I use it! At this rate I don&#x27;t think it will last six months! Next there is the razor....or the Mach 3 razor holder. It also looks nice, but the point where you attach the Mach 3 blade is cheap plastic, and looks like it might snap off one day. Furthermore, for some reason the attachment point allows the Mach 3 blade to bend further backwards (up to a 90-degree angle) to the handle. This does not happen with a normal Mach 3 handle, which only allows the razaor blade to bend back to around 45 or 60-degrees from the handle. This means that you have to push down harder on your face when you shave, otherwise the blade will bend so far back that you can&#x27;t really shave. And this causes more cuts on my face. Perhaps my handle is defective? In summary, I wished I would have bought another set and paid a few more dollars. It simply is not worth the price I paid for it, despite what all the other reviews say.</li>
    <li> This four piece shaving sets razor and brush both have good weight to it (not at all flimsy).  It&#x27;s very handsome looking and also looks more expensive than it&#x27;s price.   The shine holds well, plus the Gillette Mach 3 Razors are very easy to find everywhere.  If you&#x27;re considering purchasing this set for yourself or as a gift you&#x27;ll be pleased as will your recipient.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> It looks nice on the shelf right out of the box, but after a year of use it corroded/rusted and fell apart (brush, bowl and stand; the razor is holding up well). It works great up to the point it falls apart.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and the recipient was very pleased. Was a nice quality and looked even better than the picture!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality and price of this shave set.  The brush and razor handle are both heavy (in a good way) and feel solid in your hand.  The stand is sturdy enough that it isn&#x27;t prone to tipping when you use the bowl, but the bowl does lift right out for easy cleaning.  My boyfriend was using the Fusion razor, which will hang in the stand just fine, but went back to the Mach-3 so the set would look nicer - he reports that he really likes shaving with Mach-3 heads on the heavy handle.  A great purchase!</li>
    <li> Great shaving set, practical to use with shaving soap, plus it looks great on the shelve of the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> I like to shave.  After spending money on supposedly better shave products, including Injector-types, straight razors, and double-edged razors, my raw skin and mangy-looking beard always crawls back to Mach 3.  I decided to make the morning ritual a little nicer, and embrace the multi-blade hype so often derided by razor aficionados, and ordered this kit.  The price was right and it looks even nicer in person.     THE BRUSH is a badger hair brush that works up a nice lather...better than several boar brushes I have used.  There is a musky (?) smell at first, but I sprayed the brush with rosemary water, and the smell has diminished.  Maybe after a few more days the smell will dissipate.  It&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s not pleasant, either.     THE CUP is just a metal cup.  I used Kiss My Face shave cream and a squirt or two works fine for my two swipes.  I also just scoop the cream with the brush and lather my face, instead of mixing in the cup.     THE HANDLE is nice and fits the Mach 3 (obviously.)  An added bonus is the weight heavier than the standard Mach 3 handle and I do not need to press down as much.  Even better, the pivot is more angled and flexible, which helps provide a closer, more exact shave. My sideburns do not end up chewed in spots, and my neck area is as smooth as the face.  The pivot angle helps me get a shave as close as a straight-razor in a barbershop.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my son-in-law.  I wasn&#x27;t quite sure when my daughter suggested it, but it turned out to be something he really wanted but wouldn&#x27;t buy for himself.  He likes his very well trimmed beard, and really enjoys it.</li>
    <li> Solid build and great  looking. The razor sits a little wonky when shaving but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Nothing like a good shave. This kit will help you to have a great one. Looks impressive on the sink in my bathroom. The brush will shed in the beginning after a few shaves this will pass. I&#x27;ve had mine for 6 months no problems.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my finance for Christmas and he loved it.  However after the third use the handle on the brush broke - the brush section came out of the handle.  Rather than taking the time and trouble of sending it back, we used some epoxy glue to glue the brush back into the handle.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> Nice set, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.  My bowl is rusting and the mast is corroding where the bowl mounts after a year and a half.</li>
    <li> My husband loved the set from the first use. He noticed a big difference in the Razor from the standard Mach3 handle, which took a little getting used to.  It has now been only two months and the blade attachment point has broken. We would love to give this product another go, but are unable to get the handle by itself. We are now on the lookout for a new handle that might still fit in the holder. The bowl and stand work great, which I enjoy since they now take up less counter space.</li>
    <li> Very nice, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my husband as a Christmas present last year.  I like the way it is all in one solid unit and the shiny silver-plating is very attractive.  My husband tells me the brush is great and he likes the razor as well.  After 2-3 months though, the soap in the bowl began to get brown around the edges.  Sure enough, the bowl was beginning to rust.  I like this shaving kit so much that I just couldn&#x27;t throw it out so I decided to find a bowl to replace the silver-plated one.  We found a small white ceramic bowl at Crate &amp; Barrel that fits nicely in the ring,(Stockholm Ramekin SKU 320676), that once held the other one.  I hope this will be helpful to others who were/will be disappointed with the bowl rusting.  This is a nice shaving kit otherwise.</li>
    <li> I am very please with this shave kit. It was cheaper than buying  a stand/bowl combo for my safety razor. I am not using the mach III handle but I did make sure a blade would fit the handle.</li>
    <li> This set is very nice looking.  However, the metal corrodes very easily when exposed to water, which makes the idea of keeping shaving soap in the shaving soap dish impractical.  We&#x27;ve had the set for just about 7 months, and the dish and the base already have green splotches.  Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t stay very well in the holder. :(</li>
    <li> very good the brush needs better hears</li>
    <li> Very good piece at this price. Weight is just perfect and looks great. The brush is nice. Only concern is that after days or months of use or even unused it can begin to loose it shine and get stains all over. Particularly the cup. I have stopped using it since I upgraded to Fusion. But it is still lying in one corner of my washroom.</li>
    <li> All in all this is a good quality set that works well.  I find the lather cup a bit shallow and the brush has a habit of dropping hair into the cream but it otherwise works fantastic.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set, and without a doubt its very nice and attractive, but it is also not made to last very long.  My set is very rusted and has become a sort of eye sore in my bathroom.  I&#x27;m at the point where I need to get something new.  You figure that something made for use in a bathroom would be more resistant to rust.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shave set.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with rust.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year.  However, the razor is now broken.  The piece where you attach the blade to the handle, falls out so the blade doesn&#x27;t stay in place.  I&#x27;m trying to find a replacement.  I wish they would just sell the razor by itself so I could replace it.</li>
    <li> when i took this out of the box the bowl was already broken off the stand very disappointed in this item</li>
    <li> I Recived what I ordered ... The razor and brush have nice heavy handles it is a Nice Set ...&lt;br /&gt;My Boyfriend Likes it :))</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dad and husband for Christmas and they were a big hit. The brush is soft and long lasting, and the design and quality of the whole set is very high.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It goes from looking really spiffy to mangled and like it went through a dishwasher. the bowl rusts.</li>
    <li> My son loved it  I don&#x27;t know if he has used it yet or not but it is what he wanted</li>
    <li> The brush smelled and separated when wet.  It looked nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband two years ago, and it stands as his favorite gift ever! It is beautiful enough to keep on the bathroom counter. The brush is soft, and still in great shape. The bowl is beautiful and he has had no problem with rust or tarnish because he dries it completely after each use. He uses his own razor, but keeps this one out for display. My husband says shaving is so much more enjoyable when he has the right tools!</li>
    <li> Great fixture in the bathroom, handsome.  The handles are weighted and feel good in the hand, bottom of base has a foam pad for non slippage.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas. Within weeks, it literally started falling apart. I will not be buying anything like this again.</li>
    <li> Got it for my dad for christmas. He&#x27;s into the old school type stuff and he really liked it. Uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> Finally, it is badly rusted other wise I would have bought again from same manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! It feels expensive..heavy and sturdy. The only thing I can say is that the razor keeps slipping off which is annoying. My husband was really stoked on it. I HIGHLY recommend this as a gift!</li>
