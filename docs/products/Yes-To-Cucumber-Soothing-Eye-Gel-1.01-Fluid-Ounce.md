      <li>When I woke up my eyes looked way better.</li>
      <li>and I love them all</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s better stuff out there for you to try</li>
      <li>I had used it a couple of times and didn&#x27;t think it was any better than the moisturizer I used around the eye area.</li>
      <li>sholud give more effect.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>but my eyes might be darker than most since college leads to lack of sleep.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Makes eyes appear brighter, more awake.  </li>
      <li>I think cucumbers are meant for eyes :).</li>
      <li>This product feels extremely refreshing on</li>
      <li>but I absolutely love it as a night eye cream.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>much better option is the</li>
      <li>I use it more at night or for awhile in the morning than wash it off.</li>

      <li>I love the way it feels and the smell of cucumber every time I use it.  </li>

      <li>Overall, this product is amazing!!</li>
      <li>I am also excited to see that you can &amp;#34;subscribe&amp;#34; to the product, and it will send again in three months!</li>
      <li>I honestly thought I had a mild stroke or something the way</li>
      <li>I was not as impressed as I expected to be.</li>
      <li>It felt good and was soothing, but I didn&#x27;t really see any results.  </li>
      <li>good price, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>but it was great layer to de-puff your eyes do to allergies, lack of sleep, the occasional tear :).</li>
      <li>I like it, the price also cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light, it&#x27;s NOT sticky</li>
      <li>It has a light cucumber scent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing the soothing eye gel for years, and was excited to see it offered on Amazon for a discounted price than what I find in the store.</li>
      <li>I am well into my 2nd bottle and love the amazing results in the reduction of crows feet.  </li>
      <li>it work better than pure aloe vera gel (at a fraction of the price)?&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
      <li>It did a good job and it feels soothing and definitely increased the moisure level in the eye</li>
      <li>Rather than putting actual cucumber on your face, this is really a good alternative.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this eye gel, but there is nothing &#x27;soothing&#x27; about it.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad product by any means, but</li>
      <li>It works quickly to soothe the eye area and diminish puffiness.</li>
      <li>It feels so wonderful, smells terrific, and it does just what it claims to do-- Soothe tired peepers, but it&#x27;s so good for people with allergies which make their eyes itch.  </li>
      <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t go to bed with it on not realizing the issue with this new formula.  </li>
      <li>This product is pretty good, it definitely is soothing and tightens.  </li>
      <li>and when I wake up the next morning my under eye looks amazing.</li>
      <li>I absolutely adore the scent and love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and mostly natural.</li>
      <li>Really worth buying this eye gel.</li>
      <li>The Body Shop Elder flower Eye Gel; Fresh Lotus Eye Gel.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this from Whole Foods since one of the employees there recommended it.</li>
      <li>If you have redness around the eye area due to irritation this is a good product.</li>
      <li>It definitely feels cooling and nice going on, but it dries more than absorbs and left a &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; all around my eyes and lids.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, it took a few weeks for the redness to completely go away, but the gel made me feel so much better, I kept at it, and lo and behold, I am completely normal looking again and steroid free!  </li>
      <li>I like this eye gel; it is very soothing to apply in the morning when my eyes are a little puffy and it smells great.</li>
      <li>My left Eyelid droops much more than my right.</li>
      <li>The skin is really smooth, it&#x27;s very hydrated, and my fine lines appear much smaller.</li>
      <li>is most definitely a gel</li>
      <li>If they could remedy the consistency of the product, I would be willing to try it again.</li>
      <li>Personally, I&#x27;m willing to stick with it for now because it does help.</li>
      <li>I love the YTC daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I use this Gel consistently for one week</li>
      <li>Which is like double the cost (or more) and does not have cucumbers.</li>
      <li>and my eyes felt funny.  </li>
      <li>This has been a good solution for my normally dry and sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>This eye gel didn&#x27;t do much in terms of it&#x27;s advertised &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; powers and my eyes certainly didn&#x27;t look moisturized!</li>
      <li>it feels good going on and then leaves a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; after an hour or so which you definitely notice later.  </li>
      <li>So I used to love this stuff, bought a bottle a year ago and it lasted me a long time.  </li>
      <li>It feels nice at first, but it&#x27;s a little sticky.</li>
      <li>It does feel nice and cool after a late night, but I can&#x27;t go anywhere with stuff peeling off my eyes.</li>
      <li>worth using at night, since it&#x27;s a little sticky (as most gel formulations esp.</li>
      <li>It absorbs fast and keep my eyes refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s absorubeat fast</li>
      <li>and when you apply it to your under eye area it&#x27;s very cooling and relaxing.</li>
      <li>That probably becoz you use too much or your skin cannot fully absorb gel.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this.  </li>
      <li>; I probably could have applied straight aloe vera gel on my face and not have noticed a difference.</li>
      <li>and I really, really tried to like it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for maybe a month or two...I don&#x27;t notice anything dramatic to my eyes or tightening but my eyes might be darker than most since college leads to lack of sleep. But I will try to put it in the fridge and maybe that will do the trick...All in all it does the job, not irritating at all.</li>
    <li> I am well into my 2nd bottle and love the amazing results in the reduction of crows feet.  I have this on subscribe and save so that I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> Overall, this product is amazing!! It&#x27;s a gel and when you apply it to your under eye area it&#x27;s very cooling and relaxing. For whatever reason my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb this product. I can&#x27;t wear it during the day or with make up becuse it balls up. However, it&#x27;s great as a night eye cream. I apply a thick layer at night before I go to bed and when I wake up the next morning my under eye looks amazing. The skin is really smooth, it&#x27;s very hydrated, and my fine lines appear much smaller. I don&#x27;t like it for a day cream but I absolutely love it as a night eye cream.</li>
    <li> The allergy season is here and I have been rubbing my eyes l Ike crazy. The end result is that the area around my eyes has become red and irritated. It looked pretty bad and unless I wore sun glasses 24/7 I was doomed to the &#x27;red&#x27; look.&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this product a couple of months ago and tossed it into a drawer in the vanity. I had used it a couple of times and didn&#x27;t think it was any better than the moisturizer I used around the eye area. I was going to go to the store and see if there was some product available that would tame the evil looking red, but figured I&#x27;d give this a shot first.&lt;br /&gt;I dabbed it around the eyes and went to bed. When I woke up my eyes looked way better. Another application and the redness was gone. If you have redness around the eye area due to irritation this is a good product. It did a good job and it feels soothing and definitely increased the moisure level in the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer advised stashing this in the fridge. I tried it and it feels great.......very soothing and refreshing. Wish they would have suggested it on the packaging.</li>
    <li> Rather than putting actual cucumber on your face, this is really a good alternative.  You have to be patient to see the result.  It just won&#x27;t happen overnight.  After I have used it for a few months, I saw my dark circles under my eyes gradually fade away.  A little drop around each eye would be enough.  Despite it&#x27;s a small bottle, it lasts pretty long.  The price is affordable too.  I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I guess I must be allergic to this.  I started to get little bumps under my eyes after a few weeks of using it.  Also found a similar problem with yes to tomatoes gel cleanser.  I think I&#x27;m sensitive to whatever makes this a gel.  I had to give away the cucumber stuff and toss the tomato.  Doesn&#x27;t mean anyone else will have a problem, but had to say.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that it would help de-zombify my eyes. I could have just brushed on some egg whites instead; the effect was much the same. I put it on before bed a few times and within minutes my eyelids felt stretched and difficult to move. The next morning I encountered the well documented \\&quot;eye boogers\\&quot; mentioned by other reviewers, even after trying to wash all of it off (the side effect of that being irritation due to excessive scrubbing). The verdict? Skip this. Invest in a nice carton of grade A eggs and a pastry brush instead.</li>
    <li> I use 3 other yes to cucumbers products and I love them all (see my other reviews). This, however isn&#x27;t that great. I like the idea of it- cucumber and aloe, good stuff. But the texture is a little bit gummy. My guess is that it&#x27;s from the aloe. It feels nice at first, but it&#x27;s a little sticky. I can&#x27;t wear makeup over it. The product starts to peel off. If they could remedy the consistency of the product, I would be willing to try it again. It does feel nice and cool after a late night, but I can&#x27;t go anywhere with stuff peeling off my eyes.</li>
    <li> This product feels extremely refreshing on but unfortunately it peels off! I can use it at night before bed but not in the morning because once I put my makeup on I have peeling skin on my face! I was not as impressed as I expected to be.</li>
    <li> I agree that the texture is gummy when wet and tacky when dry, but I haven&#x27;t had problems with it flaking or throwing off little balls; perhaps those who have are slathering it on too thickly? I will say that you might not want to go bare-faced after applying because the product leaves a shine, even after drying. If you use enough makeup on top, it is possible to cover it. I&#x27;m talking black tie event makeup (i.e., on the heavy side for someone like me who normally wears zero makeup, though I did ask not to look overly done up). Alternatively, I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t apply it earlier and then rinse it off before leaving the house. Personally, I&#x27;m willing to stick with it for now because it does help.</li>
    <li> So I used to love this stuff, bought a bottle a year ago and it lasted me a long time.  It wasn&#x27;t a good eye moisturizer but it was great layer to de-puff your eyes do to allergies, lack of sleep, the occasional tear :). Finally running out I bought another bottle here on amazon, putting it on like usual and going about my evening I noticed within 15mins that my vision seemed a little off and my eyes felt funny.  I went to look into the mirror and a horrible red reaction was already in profess and my eyes were swollen.  I rinsed it off immediately and put some sensitive skin cream on it.  Luckily by morning the rash was gone and swelling down so I think I caught it in time.  So glad I didn&#x27;t go to bed with it on not realizing the issue with this new formula.  Bottle went in the trash, please be aware of this product when first using because I don&#x27;t have any allergies and can&#x27;t figure out what made me react so badly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they were thinking with this product - it goes on like a sticky gel and dries to a clear film that peels. Also not that soothing. You definitely can&#x27;t use this under makeup, and at night my skin sticks to the pillow. Yuck. Two stars because it didn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some sort of eye goo that would feel soothing, relieve the itchy eyelids, and is cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first two weeks, the eye gel was great. I noticed my eyes were less irritated after long days, and it really was soothing and refreshing (especially if you store it in the fridge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, about two weeks after I started using it, the eye gel started to sting, similar to the feel of a chemical burn. The first time this happened, I chalked it up to maybe accidentally leaving some face wash on near my eyes, but after a week of this, I&#x27;ve realized this product is just not for me. I will not be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address a few issues other reviewers have mentioned:&lt;br /&gt;*It is most definitely a gel and it&#x27;s listed as such. If you are looking for a cream or serum particularly, be advised.&lt;br /&gt;*Because of it&#x27;s thicker consistency, eye make up shouldn&#x27;t go over it. However, I found that I still got the same benefits if I applied it and ate breakfast or kept busy for 15ish minutes before washing it away in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;*Occasionally in the mornings I would find eye boogers (sorry, it&#x27;s the only way I know how to describe the crusty bits that show up in the corners of your eyes) where I had applied the gel.</li>
    <li> The orginal yes to cucumber was advertised as 99 % natural. I was sent a newer version of the product that does not reduce puffy eyes like the old product. The new one says its 97 % natural but it does not do the very thing it use to.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I really, really tried to like it.  It definitely feels cooling and nice going on, but it dries more than absorbs and left a &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; all around my eyes and lids.  It peels off like elmer&#x27;s glue or flaky sunburn skin.  Weird.  Maybe it works for somebody; that somebody isn&#x27;t me.  I had to toss it.</li>
    <li> The gel formula is  very easy t take on the eya and it&#x27;s absorubeat fast but I have hope it&#x27;s sholud give more effect.&lt;br /&gt;But good for allergy skin</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it every night on my eyes.  I love the way it feels and the smell of cucumber every time I use it.  I will continue to use it and hope that the product is not discontinued.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to fine cucumber eye GEL anywhere - this one rocks!  It&#x27;s so light, it&#x27;s NOT sticky and it really does the trick - both protecting and relieving puffy eyes from allergies or lack of sleep.</li>
    <li> I love the YTC daily moisturizer. I absolutely adore the scent and love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and mostly natural. However, this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell very strongly of the cucumber scent that I love, and it is literally mostly aloe vera gel! Not a bad product by any means, but not really what I think of as an &amp;#34;eye gel.&amp;#34; I probably could have applied straight aloe vera gel on my face and not have noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know if it works or not. it feels good going on and then leaves a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; after an hour or so which you definitely notice later.  i think it is a good moisturizing product just don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m getting young using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing the soothing eye gel for years, and was excited to see it offered on Amazon for a discounted price than what I find in the store. This is a great product which soothes my puffy eyes in the morning. For a person who uses this product once a day (half a pump per use), the bottle will last you at least 3 months, if not longer. When the product dries, it does have a almost sticky texture, and shine, but as soon as you put on a moisturizer, you can&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this product to everyone.  Say yes to has done it again with an amazing product and great customer services. I am also excited to see that you can &amp;#34;subscribe&amp;#34; to the product, and it will send again in three months!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good.  Was trying to find a replacement for St. Ives Cucumber Elastin (they stopped making it).&lt;br /&gt;Say Yes leaves a residue on your face after it dries.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like this&lt;br /&gt;always makes my eyes sting when i use it so i&#x27;ve thrown it away, such a waste</li>
    <li> Yes to Cucumbers/Blueberries has replaced everything else in my facial skin care.  This gel is AHHHHHHHmazing... It feels so wonderful, smells terrific, and it does just what it claims to do-- Soothe tired peepers, but it&#x27;s so good for people with allergies which make their eyes itch.  I love this product.  My 9 year old daughter loves it, too, and uses it daily.</li>
    <li> I am 22 and was looking for an eye gel that doesn&#x27;t have anti-aging features. I bought this product because of its good review. However, as far as I can tell, it is a real gel. After using it around my eye areas, that eye gel can form a thin membrane, which can become small white strings if you touch it back and forward. The worst thing is, sometimes when I use it after shower, my eye area hurts. I would definitely not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice light eye gel, smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this from Whole Foods since one of the employees there recommended it. I don&#x27;t know what the issue with this product is, but when I first used it, my eyes never looked red and irritated but never did the product dry up and leave gummy &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; around my eyes. Gross. It started to burn and sting so I decided to try something new, Avalon Organics eye creme which I&#x27;m currently experimenting with. This eye gel didn&#x27;t do much in terms of it&#x27;s advertised &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; powers and my eyes certainly didn&#x27;t look moisturized! They looked very irritated. I hated the residue it left and people thought I didn&#x27;t wash my face in the morning. I&#x27;d put this under my concealer and it was just a mess compared to other products I&#x27;ve used. There&#x27;s better stuff out there for you to try and I&#x27;d say this product is skippable. Try the Derma E or Andalou lines.</li>
    <li> I love Yes to cucumbers face wipes, and have been looking for an eye gel that is cooling to soothe my eyes when they feel tired. This one is great! It has a cooling sensation after you put it on (even cooler if you keep it in the fridge). I have only been using it for a few days now, but it really does seem to help. It definitely de-puffs, as my eyes are often puffy in the morning, and I wear contacts during the day, which I think also makes my eyes feel tired.  It also has good ingredients in it, and a neat little pump (HINT: pump only a tiny, tiny bit out, or else you will have WAY too much).  It also smells great (just like the wipes).  The only other eye gel I have liked this much is by Juice beauty. Which is like double the cost (or more) and does not have cucumbers. I think cucumbers are meant for eyes :). Eyes and salads.</li>
    <li> This truly does help keep those little under eye bags at bay everyone seems to have these days.  I refuse to run out of it and used it every night religiously!</li>
    <li> While the gel feels fine going on and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, it unfortunately doesn&#x27;t reduce my puffiness.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into my skin at all.  It dries into a thin, gummy-like film...which you wouldn&#x27;t want to go out in public with, or apply makeup over.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it Really good and soothing!</li>
    <li> To me this gel is not gummy!(I don&#x27;t wear make up) It absorbs fast and keep my eyes refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m young skin type so those expensive de-aging or firming or whatever do not work for me. Plus those Kinds of gel normally consists of high concentration of essence and causes milia... My convern is chiefly tired eyes so this one is perfect. For those who just want hydrattion and refreshness, this would be a good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who claim it forms a film, I can understand because I encountered the same case when I use the h2o face oasis gel. That probably becoz you use too much or your skin cannot fully absorb gel. You could use it as a night eye mask then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some alternatives for young eyes: The Body Shop Elder flower Eye Gel; Fresh Lotus Eye Gel.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good, it definitely is soothing and tightens.  Makes eyes appear brighter, more awake.  It also takes away redness.  Only problem is that it peels away in \\&quot;boogers\\&quot; on the skin throughout the day.  I use it more at night or for awhile in the morning than wash it off.</li>
    <li> This product appears to be ok , However I haven&#x27;t seen any drastic changes in my under eye area, Honestly I haven&#x27;t seen any so no I would not recommend this product. Thank You</li>
    <li> This is the only under eye treatment that has ever worked for the bags under my eyes. I use this Gel consistently for one week and bam! my bags are gone.</li>
    <li> Great product however I am allergic to broccoli and broccoli extract was in the ingredient list. I tried it anyway. Not smart. My eyes swelled almost shut. It also did flake off the face after use. The texture was great and the over all idea of it was great. If you are not allergic to any of the ingredients, try it for soothing tired eyes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews. I have sensitive skin and this stuff mousturizes and I don&#x27;t find it gummy, sticky or goopy at all. It absorbs into my skin and leaves no residue. I don&#x27;t know why it does for some people, maybe they&#x27;re using too much.</li>
    <li> It irritates eye area even for non-sensitive skin. It was applied after face wash in the morning, and stings the skin around eyes and skin turned red. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> Horrible!! I got a rash under my eyes from using this stuff. It hurt so bad and took forever to heal!!! Never buying anything from Say Yes again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. It keeps my eyes from looking puffy and the eyelid from looking so droopy. My left Eyelid droops much more than my right. I honestly thought I had a mild stroke or something the way it kinda sagged over my eye. I looked like I was frowning all the time. But this stuff perked my eyelids right back up.  NO lie.  I am always searching for a great Eye cream. I am 45 and take pretty good care of myself, don&#x27;t party, smoke or drink.  This stuff does the trick for me.</li>
    <li> This product changed my life!  Well, actually, developing a dust mite allergy at the age of 31 changed my life and I was in desperate need of a product to soothe the rash around my eyes.  Up until I found this product, I was using a bit of hydrocortisone twice daily (ahh! steriods on the face, twice daily! But it was the only thing that worked. Even my beloved Queen Bee Eye Cream only made the rash worse).  But when I saw this product with a clearance sticker on it at Target, I said, &amp;#34;What the hell, I&#x27;ll give it a try. The rash couldn&#x27;t possibly get worse.&amp;#34;  And you know what?  The eye gel felt so soothing after months of just getting by, I practically cried tears of joy.  I&#x27;ll be honest, it took a few weeks for the redness to completely go away, but the gel made me feel so much better, I kept at it, and lo and behold, I am completely normal looking again and steroid free!  Now I just keep an eye on this product on Amazon and at Target and buy whichever one is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews and honestly, I never notice it being sticky or peeling off.  Also, I don&#x27;t wear tons of makeup so I am not the biggest authority, but I wear mineral powder over it without any problems whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely horrible! it is not organic or safe for sensitive skin, i developed eczema under my eyes, using the cucumber under eye crap , i asked my dermatologist, she said that many people have had very bad reactions from this product. #itscrap</li>
    <li> it is sticky and leaves residue on my face. I threw it out.</li>
    <li> Observations:&lt;br /&gt;Only worth using at night, since it&#x27;s a little sticky (as most gel formulations esp. with aloe). My skin is extra sensitive, and I find this (along with a few other Yes To products) to sting for a few minutes after application, especially if applied right after cleansing skin, not sure which ingredient is the culprit yet. It&#x27;s moisturizing, as any product with aloe can be expected to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*However* I did not feel like bothering with returning it (plus I picked it up on clearance at RiteAid), and now use it liberally as a soothing skin gel on face and body:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets itchy, red and splotchy so easily from coming in contact with certain things (especially on my decollete area), and this really does the trick at calming the skin down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a night moisture gel for the rest of my face, and it has greatly diminished flaking due to the harsh acne topical medications I use underneath the gel (without affected the medication working).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also doubles as a great burn gel for those pesky burns in the kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, but better for skin than other around eyes if you&#x27;re sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work better than pure aloe vera gel (at a fraction of the price)?&lt;br /&gt;Hard to say, probably not. It is lot less sticky than pure aloe gel, and the added ingredients are a bonus though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend it?&lt;br /&gt;Not as your main eye moisture treatment, no. But it is pleasant and package is convenient (portable), so if you happen to see it on sale or feel like trying it out, you&#x27;ll find ways to put it to good use.</li>
    <li> This product seems to moisturize the eye area, but it&#x27;s very sticky and can peel off. Don&#x27;t wear makeup with this product.</li>
    <li> I just could not use it these days, it&#x27;s way too drying for me these days, with the dry air from the heaters. I will try it in the summer, hopefully it will work better when humidity is up, because it is not very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This eye gel didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. It just left a weird residue after it dried, and didn&#x27;t really take care of any undereye issues. I don&#x27;t see how anyone could wear it in the morning because it gets weirdly cakey when dried. If you wear it overnight that&#x27;s fine, but again, it didn&#x27;t really seem to have much benefit, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;A much better option is the Yes To Carrots eye cream - that one works wonders! I wish I had repurchased that one instead of trying this yes to cucumbers eye gel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really useful, it look like I actually slept 8 hours!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never considered my skin sensitive at all, and I expected that something formulated for sensitive skin would be extra gentle. I got a red splotchy rash around my eyes minutes after applying it. Pretty much the opposite if what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I bought this eye gel because I was experiencing an allergic reaction to something that was causing the skin around my eyes to be inflamed and very painful. This is an excellent product, just the right consistency to apply gently, very soothing, and provides a nice level of moisture. I am very pleased with my purchase. This has been a good solution for my normally dry and sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this eye gel, but there is nothing &#x27;soothing&#x27; about it.  I went on vacation and was a bit sunburned around my eyes, so I bought some of this in hopes that it would at least reduce some puffiness.  Nope - it stung the heck outta the skin around my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had this happen, so I was surprised.  I tried again a few days later and same thing - stung.  Also, like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s not very hydrating at all.  I gave it two stars (instead of one) is b/c if you put it in the fridge, it cools the eyes a bit...before the stinging kicks in.</li>
    <li> If you look at the labels on all the different boxes, cucumbers, grapefuit, etc, ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS ARE THE SAME!  Marketing strategies by the folks at yes.</li>
    <li> I like this eye gel; it is very soothing to apply in the morning when my eyes are a little puffy and it smells great. It has a light cucumber scent. It works quickly to soothe the eye area and diminish puffiness. The only drawback is that you can&#x27;t wear makeup over it because it will peel off. So reserve this gel for days when you don&#x27;t plan to wear makeup or for nighttime. I personally don&#x27;t wear face makeup very often, so it&#x27;s not a huge drawback for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this.  It felt good and was soothing, but I didn&#x27;t really see any results.  Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> i should have trusted the reviews .. this got so gummy under my eyes. i&#x27;d have little ball-like things on my face. no thanks.</li>
    <li> I like it, the price also cheap. Really worth buying this eye gel. Starting to use it, but don&#x27;t know the effect yet.</li>
