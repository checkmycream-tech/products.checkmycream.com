      <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I wish it was more immediate,  Would buy again.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>works as advertised only don&#x27;t rub it in and make sure you wrap the area best if you leave it on for about 2  hrs</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t even sure if he was tattooing me</li>
      <li>Cost to much and does not work!!!!</li>
      <li>This product works really good, couldn&#x27;t feel a thing during first hour.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t be completely painless because let&#x27;s face it waxing is a superficial pain, but it does diminish the pain greatly</li>
      <li>This is a good buy that really works.</li>
      <li>My wax lady was so impressed with me that she is going to recommend this product to her other customers.</li>
      <li>And like I said the first hour was amazing.</li>
      <li>but, it works just fine without the plastic wrap.</li>
      <li>Delivered quick too!</li>
      <li>I was getting a huge cover up.</li>
      <li>this is a fabulous product.</li>
      <li>Works great, especially when you use plastic wrap.</li>
      <li>It was amazing, did a rib tattoo &amp; didn&#x27;t feel nothing at all for 4 straight hours.</li>
      <li>But overall , a great product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was not pain free.</li>
      <li>100% pain free.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>will probably use it, but I am not 100% comfortable using something that is unlabeled.  </li>
      <li>I am buying 2 more right now.</li>
      <li>hour without pain guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend and buying more for sure.</li>
      <li>I made my boyfriend put the whole tube because it was a pretty good sized tattoo.</li>
      <li>So worth it!</li>
      <li>I am sure it work well since it seems to have a very high percentage of lidocaine.</li>
      <li>with this one I can tell that waxing is not painful anymore.</li>
      <li>wrap all over my face and chest for the numbing cream to be in full effect.</li>
      <li>Seriously works great!  </li>
      <li>Received quickly.  </li>
      <li>I am not one of those lucky people.</li>
      <li>It even allowed my waxer to get in some finishing touches with the tweezers without me dying on the table.&lt;br /&gt;i received it quickly.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to pierce again my right ear, because the one I originally have is way off.</li>
      <li>Honestly this cream helped so much and I highly reccomend it.</li>
      <li>it was pretty good, the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is it has a peculiar smell and takes 45 minutes to an hour to kick in.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>I bought 6 more tubes for a large tat area worked real well on my neck area</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
      <li>So worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless of how effective this product is, I feel the need to express my concern about using numbing creams regularly on my face - keep in mind that I dermaroll once a week -, depending on my experience and my research.</li>
      <li>applied one tube to a freshly washed arm and wrapped with plastic wrap and taped.</li>
      <li>I have tried several different types of numbing cream and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Good tool,fast shipping,recommend to use it only for professional purposes!</li>
      <li>Right over the first.</li>
      <li>Need to use a large amount in order to receive results, it works!</li>
      <li>but it certainly helps!</li>
      <li>Felt absolutely NOTHING for the first full hour.</li>
      <li>Nubs very fast.</li>
      <li>Worked fast!</li>
      <li>just make sure you buy enough for what you want to do.</li>
      <li>I got my first tattoo on my rib cage yesterday</li>
      <li>I was skeptic at first like everyone else</li>
      <li>why go through pain if you really don&#x27;t have to?!</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
      <li>I bought this cream for her, and it did help her with the pain, it numbed that area for her, she did think it was for inside the mouth the first day</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome. And works! Let it sit for at Least 90 min. Then let the games begin.</li>
    <li> Good tool,fast shipping,recommend to use it only for professional purposes!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work maybe it works on different people</li>
    <li> This stuff does all that it promises. My husband accidentally touched his face with the hand he uses to apply this cream and after about 10-15 minutes he said that it felt just like going to the dentist and receiving novocain.</li>
    <li> I tried many numbing creams before and I was not too happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;But with this one I can tell that waxing is not painful anymore. Wears off quite fast though - 30 min. I would reccomend to do not wipe the entire area. Wipe as your progress goes on.</li>
    <li> Worked very well I applied it to my stomach wrapped in plastic wrap for 2hours my artist whipped off w the plastic b4 he began and I didn&#x27;t feel a thing but it started to wear off 45-50 mins in</li>
    <li> Did not work in the slightest though that may just be me.</li>
    <li> 1st time I ordered &amp; used it it worked great. I ordered a 2nd time and it didn&#x27;t work at all... followed directions the same way both times.... disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have an extremely heavy handed tattoo artist. I normally start giving up after 40 minutes and one hour feels like an eternity. I bought this because it had the best reviews. I was getting a huge cover up. I decided to use the whole tube and followed the directions to the t. The tube is small and I was covering a large part of my arm.. Anyway. The first hour I literally felt NOTHING. The outline and the shading were done and it was a breeze! The reason why I am giving this four stars and not five is the because the cream only lasts about an hour. My tattoo was a three hour long process. Honestly this cream helped so much and I highly reccomend it. I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to push through without it... And like I said the first hour was amazing. I only heard the sound of the tattoo machine. Definitely purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> Should have got this stuff a long time ago ~ Deadise From Crazytown</li>
    <li> Used it to tattoo my eyebrows. It numbed great!</li>
    <li> I wanted to pierce again my right ear, because the one I originally have is way off. My sister did it when we were teenagers and I think she was nervous or something. Anyways, I put the stuff on thick on both sides of my ear, waited for about half as hour and bingo!, it felt numb. The numbness lasted for about an hour longer. Highly recommend it to people that are scared of pain. It worked pretty. good.</li>
    <li> I just received the cream, so I didn&#x27;t use it yet and therefore cannot comment on its effectiveness.  However, what makes me concerned that there is no list of ingredients, there is no active component listed, no manufacturer information.  There is a web site printed on the tube, but it is not working (parked domain).  This makes me concerned about legitimacy of manufacturer/seller and safety of this product.  The box and the tube claim that it is &amp;#34;#1 Doctors&#x27; recommended brand&amp;#34;, but no licensed doctor will ever recommend a medication that is not properly labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use it, but I am not 100% comfortable using something that is unlabeled.  This is to warn other potential buyers.  It may meet the purpose, but use at your own risk, since there is no one to sue if anything goes wrong.</li>
    <li> Works if you follow the directions to the letter &amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply generously to skin area, do not rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;2. Allow to remain for 90 minutes before proceeding to next step.&lt;br /&gt;3. Using a clean dry cloth, gently remove any excess from the working area.&lt;br /&gt;4. Do not wipe the cream away, blot area leaving a nonvisible thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;5. Test area by performing a shallow pin prick with a standard sewing needle.&lt;br /&gt;6. If pin prick was uncomfortable, repeat steps one through five.&lt;br /&gt;7. Once numb, complete any procedures within 120 min.&lt;br /&gt;8. Do not apply to the same working area more than twice in 24 hours.</li>
    <li> works great, repeat user, not affiliated with the company.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different types of numbing cream and this is by far the best. I put this on and it lasted for no s$&amp;t 3 hours. For the price and lasting power this stuff is what you need. 100% better than Dr Numb.</li>
    <li> This actually worked. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect from this but I got good results.</li>
    <li> Bought this cream for my aunt who is suffering from cancer and her jaw has been hurting, she was using kanka for mouth relief inside her mouth but over skin she was still feeling discomfort to touch her jaw or move it. I bought this cream for her, and it did help her with the pain, it numbed that area for her, she did think it was for inside the mouth the first day and she ate some, she said it tasted awful. Don&#x27;t Eat This. Once we figured it out it was pretty good, the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is it has a peculiar smell and takes 45 minutes to an hour to kick in. I wish it was more immediate,  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. I would like a complete refund. Me and my tattoo artist followed directions and nothing happened. Now i have wait to get my tattoo and who knows when i can get it. I would never recommend this to any of my friends or strangers. I am strongly disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! ! Got a tattoo onside of my leg tonight and didn&#x27;t feel a thing. Will be ordering more. This is no bs. I was skeptic at first like everyone else but very glad I tried it ....amazing</li>
    <li> Really good , numbed my entire arm for sleeve , but gave me a rash on a few spots. Check out ingredients , had allergies to a few ingredients. But overall , a great product. Didnt feel a thing while being tatted.</li>
    <li> I used in order to remove a lipoma from my ribcage below the pectoral.  The size of the lipoma was maybe 1-1/2&amp;#34; x 1-1/2&amp;#34;.  The cream was placed  on the lipoma and a small area around it.  I did an initial application and then 15 minutes later did a second application and placed Seran wrap in order to protect it from my shirt.  In about an hour the area became noticeably numb. Using a surgeon knife a 1&amp;#34; cut was made.  I felt nothing on the surface cuts until the last little layer before the fat is exposed.  That was not so pleasant.  Very pleased with the numbness that the cream provided made the surgery doable.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but I followed the instructions and I had a 2 hr session 3 days ago and I was a breeze! I couldnt feel a thing. Great product.</li>
    <li> It was amazing, did a rib tattoo &amp; didn&#x27;t feel nothing at all for 4 straight hours. Only bad thing is when it wears off the pain is more intense, but I&#x27;m gonna use this again!!!!</li>
    <li> This product worked wonders . I used it for my brazilian wax appointment. Im usually a cry baby and need breaks but with this product i hardly felt anything. My wax lady was so impressed with me that she is going to recommend this product to her other customers. It lasted about 4 hours after the second application...and some places were more numb than others. I did have some inflammation/irritation in the labia minora skin fold area to be completely honest so id say be very careful in making sure you only apply to the external skin areas where the skin is less sensitive.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have time to let it set for two hours but it really did seem to numb the more sensitive areas before epilating.  Worked great. Be warned though, it is a TEENY tube of stuff. I knew it was going to be much but one review said a little goes a long way...and it does!...to be the size of my pinky finger. Lol. Product works great just make sure you buy enough for what you want to do. I plan to purchase again when I get an actual tattoo and epilate again.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews on products, so the fact that I am leaving one for this means it really works. I am scared of needles, especially getting my blood drawn. The thought of metal sticking inside and outside of me, gives me the creeps. So when I found out I was pregnant and would be getting lots of blood work in the near future, I bought this product. I put some on the inside of my elbow, wrapped it with saran wrap, and tape it off with a couple of band aids. I leave it on for an 1 hour to an 1 hour and 15 minutes. The first time I did it, I removed the wrap about 30 minutes before the blood was drawn and was worried that I would feel the needle because it had been off for so long, but I didn&#x27;t feel it and I was amazed! I use to have to watch them put the needle in so that I would be prepared for the pain, then I would close my eyes.. Now I just close my eyes and not watch and the next thing I know is they say I am done.. I have no idea if they actually took my blood or not!! Getting my blood work done is a breeze and I don&#x27;t have to spend days dreading it before it happens. I don&#x27;t care if it looks stupid wearing saran wrap around my elbow in the hospital.. It&#x27;s worth it to me. I plan to use it for my IV and epidural as well. I keep it in my purse so that I am never without it.</li>
    <li> Just got back from the tattoo session. This product works really good, couldn&#x27;t feel a thing during first hour. Applied 1 hour before the session, plastic wrap applied.&lt;br /&gt;1 hour without pain guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend and buying more for sure.</li>
    <li> Works great for tattoos</li>
    <li> Find it just about  as good as Dr Numb !!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but this is a must! I am getting my tattoo finished while writing this and I haven&#x27;t felt one thing! After being in ridiculous amount of pain for the first session I had to get something. But one tip is to not follow the box instructions. There is different ones on the internet. Apply the cream. Wrap it in plastic wrap and leave on for at least an hour and a half. So worth it!</li>
    <li> I have to say after reading the review&#x27;s and then ordering this item. I went in for my full back peice holy cow was I numb and did not feel any pain I used two tubes used surranwrap waited one hour then started no pain for almost two hours then started feeling it places more on them waited 30 min finished a total of 5 hours no pain. Thank you for this. I will order more and finish my piece.</li>
    <li> It is a excellent numbing cream for derma pen, I live it for 30 minutes with Saran wrap and vuala completely numb.</li>
    <li> I would def use this anytime I get a tattoo!!! I got my first tattoo on my rib cage yesterday 4/24/15 and I am a sissy when it comes to pain. I put the cream on about 1hr prior and wrapped the area with plastic wrap. when I got to the shop I removed the plastic wrap and wiped the cream off. I was %100 numb!  I didn&#x27;t feel ANYTHING for atleast an hour! you will def know when it wears off because you begin to feel the needle.  I would never get a tattoo without this cream!! EVER!! why go through pain if you really don&#x27;t have to?! if I didn&#x27;t have this cream I probably wouldn&#x27;t have completed this tattoo.</li>
    <li> Used this for my foot/ankle to be tattooed and it worked great. There were a few times it hurt a little and I did have to reapply about 1/2 way through but overall I LOVE this and will use it again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Also one small tube was sufficient for two applications on my foot/ankle and I still have some left.</li>
    <li> I applied it 1 hour before with seran wrap over it washed it off before I left for my appointment. I was numb for about 2.5-3 hours!! The last hour I felt it sucked, but it was the best tattoo experience being numb for a few hours hahah</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work on me at all</li>
    <li> The stuff really works for Brazilian bikini waxes. Virtually no pain. I can feel the hair being pulled out but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. This might be better than Dr. Numb. It&#x27;s more expensive and it&#x27;s smaller, though.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the product!!!!  Cost to much and does not work!!!! Would love my money back!!!</li>
    <li> Really work....only wished it was a bigger tube</li>
    <li> Received quickly.  I have not yet tried it as I am still working on the courage needed to derma roll my face. I am sure it work well since it seems to have a very high percentage of lidocaine.</li>
    <li> Great stuff takes a lil bit to be delivered but we&#x27;ll worth it</li>
    <li> I bought it because I was nervous to get my rook pierced and I just got it done and did not feel a thing! I asked my piercer when they were going to push it through and they were already putting the jewelry in. If you follow the directions you will have no problems. I am definitely going to by this again for my industrial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;~ Apply generously to skin area, dab don’t rub.&lt;br /&gt;~ Allow to remain for 90 minutes before proceeding to next step.&lt;br /&gt;~ Using a clean dry cloth, gently remove any excess from the working area.&lt;br /&gt;~ Don’t wipe the cream away, blot area leaving a non visible thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;~ You are now ready to complete what you need.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly. Then proceeded to get my thigh tattooed. Honestly there were probably only 2 dime size spots that got numb...and only barely numb at that. This product did not work for me at all. Id love my money back. Also it&#x27;s a super tiny tube with no ingredient list or anything at all. That made me cautious but I still tried it. Sadly I just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I was having a piece done on my back which is very sensitive for me.  This product worked excellent!!!! You should put it on 1 hour prior to tattoo work and it last around 2 hours depending on how much they wipe and spray.</li>
    <li> Absolutely does what it says. I used a very high quality dermaroller on my face with 192 very sharp surgical steel needles and I would never have gotten through it without this stuff. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Had a 6 inch round tattoo done which took 1 1/2 hrs to do with no breaks. Felt absolutely NOTHING for the first full hour. Even my tattoo artist was amazed that I had found a cream with 8% Lidocaine !</li>
    <li> I use it for bug bites. I am very allergic to certain bugs and ants, and I have used many OTC and prescription lotions, and &amp;#34;speed numb&amp;#34; is the only thing that worked. Really does make the area numb. (and thus, not itchy!!) Thank you!</li>
    <li> Works great! Left mine on for about an hour then wrapped in plastic wrap . Did not feel a thing</li>
    <li> Bbboooooo....didnt do a damn thing....it only numbed the surface and nothing below</li>
    <li> This stuff worked so well! I got a sternum tattoo and I literally didn&#x27;t feel a thing. I wasn&#x27;t even sure if he was tattooing me bc I was so numb. I left it on for a few hours only because I had to wait for my bf to get a tattoo first but I was numb within an hour of applying the cream.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t be completely painless because let&#x27;s face it waxing is a superficial pain, but it does diminish the pain greatly</li>
    <li> Worked really good... Love this stuff</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great customer service</li>
    <li> Well my chest was numb but it doesnt last too long i started to feel it after an hour its not a miracle worker but it certainly helps!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t numb the site that I applied it on and I followed instructions to the tee.</li>
    <li> works as advertised only don&#x27;t rub it in and make sure you wrap the area best if you leave it on for about 2  hrs I bought 6 more tubes for a large tat area worked real well on my neck area</li>
    <li> This works very well! I do cover it with plastic (old grocery bags) during the 45 minutes it takes to achieve full effect. Other people say they leave it on for an hour and a half but i find for me it begins to wear off by then. Besides the package says leave on for 45 minutes. I use this for epilation. Its not greasy so it doesnt clog my epilation device. I feel no pain. Nothing at all when using this. I find i cant epilate without this- too much pain! This is a good buy that really works. The tube is very small but a little covers a large area so dont despise it because of its size.</li>
    <li> Need to use a large amount in order to receive results, it works!</li>
    <li> Some people have endorphins that flood the body and take over to handle tattoo pain after a few minutes. I am not one of those lucky people. I tend to vocalize my pain with colorful words and euphemisms not generally acceptable in a public place...even a tattoo studio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied one tube to a freshly washed arm and wrapped with plastic wrap and taped. Waited 1 &amp; 1/2 hours. Removed plastic wrap and applied a second tube Right over the first. Wrapped in plastic again and taped. An hour later my fully numb arm....weird tingling and all...was cut out, wiped and a 3 hour session of outlining ensued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not pain free. Make no mistake. But.....this was a 5 star experience hands down! Really tolerable tattooing right up to the middle of the 2nd hour. Even once it started to wear off, it still took the edge off the needle for another half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms, ribs, wrists, elbows: wash it, slap it on thick, tape it up with plastic wrap and wait wait wait.  So worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My artist appreciated me using this product as it makes his job easier when the canvas doesnt flinch or swear. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, lidocaine and similar substances can cause a drop in blood pressure and a rise in heart rate in some folks. If you have a heart or bp condition, always ask your dr before using a numbing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+++&lt;br /&gt;Have already reordered for the next session.</li>
    <li> awesome will buy from seller again</li>
    <li> Thank you,  I just received the item.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all !!!</li>
    <li> WOW! Amazing! I do dermaroller on my face and my chest. This product numbed both to the point of scary. It was my first time using a numbing cream, and not being able to feel my face and any touch on my face felt pretty weird. While dermarolling always hurts a lot, as you can imagine, I did not feel a thing, this time. It even got me thinking that maybe I should get a 2 mm-needle dermaroller instead of the one I currently use - 1mm -, since I have this magical product now. All the same for my chest - it worked equally well. Another thing I have to mention is that before I got a numbing cream (and I decided on this one after a long long research), I tried to figure out if I really HAD to put saran wrap all over my face and chest for the numbing cream to be in full effect. That question kept bothering while I was searching for a good numbing cream, because it is a HASSLE to cover my face and my chest with saran wrap every time. Anyway, I could not find the answer online and just decided to give it a try. So I purchased Speed Numb and applied it before my dermaroller procedure, and waited for about 1.5 hours - no saran wrap; just a not-too-thick-nor-too-thin layer of cream. And boom! Magic, as I described above. But, this is very important - at the end of 1 hour, my face did feel numb, except my forehead was still sensitive to the needles and my chest was not numb at all. At the end of 1.5 hours, however, I could not feel a thing on both areas. So I would like to put an emphasis on how long you&#x27;re supposed to wait for it to kick in. One other thing you need to keep in mind is that it comes in a teeny-weeny tube. It&#x27;s not like I already run out after only the first use (I suppose I have enough for 4-5 more sessions [face and chest]), but plan ahead if you&#x27;re going to use it on larger areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of how effective this product is, I feel the need to express my concern about using numbing creams regularly on my face - keep in mind that I dermaroll once a week -, depending on my experience and my research. The way the numbing cream works is that it numbs the nerve endings. Very simple. But, as far as your face is concerned, those nerve endings help the blood flow in your skin, therefore give your face its natural glow and healthy look. That is exactly why your face instantly turns red when you&#x27;re dermarolling without a numbing cream and it either does not, or does only partially, when you use a numbing cream - and then it turns red once the cream loses its effect. So there&#x27;s a delayed response, because you had numbed your nerves. Anyway, it is said that numbing creams, when used regularly, might damage those nerve endings, which is not something I would want - both because of health reasons and aesthetic concerns (because I don&#x27;t know how it might affect the look of my skin when the nerves are damaged). Also, it doesn&#x27;t feel right to lose touch with my face and a part of my body, on such a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a conclusion, even though I personally made a choice of not using a numbing cream regularly, Speed Numb is definitely highly recommended!eek -, depending on my experience and my research.

    <li> Works well, slept through the first hour and a half of a calf tattoo. Gave 4 stars because I would prefer a larger tube.</li>
    <li> This cream really worked for me.  I was very anxious about the pain from a tattoo and after reading good reviews, I decided to&lt;br /&gt;give it a try.  I used almost all of it on my forearm, where a 2.5 inch by 1 inch tat was going.  Wrapped it in clear wrap 2 hours before my appointment.  At first, it didn&#x27;t feel like it was numbing, but by an hour and a half passing, it finally kicked in.  It was a small tattoo that took about 45 minutes and the last 5 or 10 I was starting to feel the sting a little.  Would it work for a large or&lt;br /&gt;involved tat?  Only if it was done in installments.  I recommend this cream highly.</li>
    <li> Work really good! I like it thanks</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I was skeptic, but I&#x27;m getting a large tattoo on my side right now and cannot feel a single thing, no joke!!! I put it on, covered it with cling wrap for about an hour and I&#x27;m completely numb! Will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> only lasted about 20 minutes</li>
    <li> I applied the cream and there was bo releif during my tattoo process. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Works really well, used it for waxing, and it was my first time doing it on myself... A lot of blood, but no pain.  There should have been. Works very well. Wish the tube was bigger, but a little seems to go a long way.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I put it on maybe 20 minutes before the tattoo and the spot never got numb within the 2 hours it took to get the tattoo. I made my boyfriend put the whole tube because it was a pretty good sized tattoo. It never effected me. I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> You want numb? With this, you get numb. Went in for a pre-employment physical today and having a fear of needles, I decided to give this a shot for the needle used for blood work. Let me just say, this stuff works like a charm! Followed the directions to the letter before going in and I was thoroughly numbed when blood draw time came. The nurse inserted the needle, drew the blood and finished up the process before I even knew she had started. 100% pain free. This is my new numbing creme, hands down.</li>
    <li> Numbing cream works. My only concern is that the numbness didnt last long maybe 2 hours. I kept it on for 45 min and whipped the cream off with plastic. By the time I got to my appointment for laser treatment it had already wore off. Little tube</li>
    <li> Nubs very fast. I used for electrolysis on my legs.  Apply a layer on my skin and wrap with plastic wrap for at least an hour before procedure. I felt is starting working already 30 min after application. Like this product a lot</li>
    <li> I got because I was getting waxed and am such a sucker for pain. I followed the directions exactly  and it worked. There was still some pain but not as severe. It even allowed my waxer to get in some finishing touches with the tweezers without me dying on the table.&lt;br /&gt;i received it quickly.  The tube is small so get a few if a large area.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well when u cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit in for about a half hour . Leaves that area numb for over an hour !</li>
    <li> this did not work for nothing</li>
    <li> Love love love!!!! Worked fast! Never getting another tattoo done without it!</li>
    <li> Hi, this is my review for the numbing cream. It works  but, it works just fine without the plastic wrap. I just got my ears pierced yesterday. And I just rubb end it into my earlobes. No wrap. I didn&#x27;t feel anything. Really.</li>
    <li> If you want something numb this will do it.</li>
    <li> I got my septum done with this didn&#x27;t feel the pain as bad as before , from 1-10 I would give the pain a 1 , it a little pinch , you get just as numb as when you leave a dentist , follow the instructions and you will not go bad results</li>
    <li> My husband would rather do anything than have a shot.  I pressured him to a flu shot this year, and bought Tattoo Numb for him.  He couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked!!  He didn&#x27;t feel the needle at all, and he&#x27;s already promised to get next year&#x27;s flu shot!</li>
    <li> When I first received the box I started laughing. It is so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limited directions - &amp;#34;Exactly&amp;#34; as printed on the box&lt;br /&gt;1.Speed Numb NumbCream must be applied 45 mins before the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;2.Apply very thick on the area and do not letIt dry.&lt;br /&gt;3.Wipe the cream off with plastic before the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the product questions someone asked,&lt;br /&gt;What are the ingredients? eBay lists it as 8% lidocaine  but there is no ingredients list on box or tube. no directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone answered by saying they have the cream in front of them and it says 8% lidocaine.&lt;br /&gt; I received the exact cream you see here and there is no product information. No ingredients, nothing. After a mental debate of wanting to be numb for a DermaRoll versus why the hell would I put this on my skin not knowing what&#x27;s in it and against my better judgement, I tried it anyway and it has the exact same numbing feel as 5%. Thankfully my face didn&#x27;t melt off.&lt;br /&gt;Having many Medspa procedures I will say, every numb cream I have used or the Medspa &amp;#34;barely&amp;#34; takes the edge off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading endless reviews on numbing creams/gels/sprays/ointments, I believe they react differently depending on the person.</li>
    <li> Numbs great.  I use it for neck pain as well.  Seriously works great!  Delivered quick too!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  My 10 y/o son is diabetic and changing his pump site is usually very painful for him. Since using this product he says he doesn&#x27;t feel any pain at all!  That&#x27;s huge!</li>
    <li> I used this tattoo for the first time when I got a large tattoo on the back of my calf. My tattoo artist recommended it and it worked amazingly. It stayed active for me for around 4 or 5 hours and it was a 16 hour tattoo. Even the most sensitive area (back of the knee) I didn&#x27;t feel a thing at all. I now buy this and do not want a tattoo without it. I love this product</li>
    <li> Says non oily on the box but this cream is extremely greasy after being applied to face.  The cream is like any white sort of cream, except when applied to face, it starts to sort of melt shortly after.  I applied this like I would apply any mud mask, staying a good distance away from my eyes and mouth.  After about 10 minutes, it started melting and running into my eyes and mouth.  Once it starts melting it&#x27;s very greasy.  I tried the entire tube which wasn&#x27;t much but each time it always melted in my mouth, which made my lips numb and tasted extremely bitter.  I left it on for 1 hour 15 mins with saran wrap, after washing it off the numbed sensation went away after 20 minutes.  Not worth all the fuss, discomfort and extremely short term results.  It&#x27;s too greasy to leave on.</li>
    <li> This thing did NOT work, we did a thick layer and waited about 45 min to an hr for it to take affect and it didn&#x27;t work at all. It didn&#x27;t numb at all felt the whole thing.</li>
    <li> Works great, especially when you use plastic wrap. I was numb for so long, I was beginning to be concerned.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit suspicious. There is no manufacturer&#x27;s address on the box and the re-order website on the box is non-existent. If it includes a drug (like lidocain) it may not comply with FDA labeling requirements. A degree of caution might be warranted in using it.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for DERMA ROLLING</li>
    <li> this is a fabulous product. It performed beyond expectations. Even outperformed priscription product.</li>
    <li> this numbing cream really works. let me tell you, when the tattoo guy was doing the outline, I felt nothing, I was like are you tattooing me? cause I cant feel s***. but it was a large tattoo, so it did wear off, and I starting to feel it, ouch, ouch. But for the most, I will buy again, as a matter of fact I am buying 2 more right now.</li>
    <li> Good timing on shipping, and good product. No, there&#x27;s no ingredients. And the instructions are simple. After 45 minutes, i piercing my septum and I didn&#x27;t feel a thing! The tube is small, but it worked good for a piercing. I recommend, no doubt!</li>
