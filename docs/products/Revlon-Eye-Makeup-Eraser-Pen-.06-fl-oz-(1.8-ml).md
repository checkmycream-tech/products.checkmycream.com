    <li> This is the best product of its type I&#x27;ve tried. Removes makeup mistakes quickly &amp; easily. I used this in the past &amp; loved it but then it was discontinued. I wish Revlon would bring it back because it was about 1/3 the price when available at retail.</li>
    <li> Cleans up mishaps in eye makeup application. I have used this product for years. Unfortunately Revlon discontinued this product  it so I was fortunate to find it on Amaxon. Quick delivery. No issues. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for this product, and I was forced to pay more than I wanted to, but since it&#x27;s discontinued I caved in. This little pen makes it so easy to fix makeup mistakes. To take a q-tip is just a hassle to keep fibers out of your eye. This is portable and does a much better job. Wish Revlon would take note.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! It&#x27;s the size of a pen and It has become one of my essentials.  It&#x27;s glides on easily and your able to remove smudges or eyeshadow when it lands on your cheek anywhere.  I looove it and it&#x27;s so cheap!  Love!!!!</li>
    <li> This makeup eraser pen is great, it helps you to create a flawless look in a hurry.  I keep one at work and one at home, a definite must have for anyone who does not have alot of time to create their makeup look.</li>
    <li> This pen makes it so easy to remove any eyeliner or mascara mistakes. It is so much easier than getting out the makeup remover &amp; q-tips. i love it!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed that Revlon might not have this item again.  This is the one item that should be in everyone&#x27;s makeup kit.  Please please carry it again!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 3 years and love it.............All of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore until I found it on this site............ordered 2 one came dry so this retail site was going to send me another.  They e-mailed me to tell me that they had no more so they gave me a credit.  I&#x27;m disappointed with this....I have a feeling the Revlon company has stopped making this product. I will order from this store again since they have given me great customer service.</li>
    <li> I think these are a must have for anyone wearing any type of eye makeup.  They work perfectly to correct any smudging of mascara even the water based kind I wear. I use these pens all the time and wonder why they are so difficult to find.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup product that I&#x27;ve ever found! Have you ever made a mistake while applying your makeup? Well, I sure do. Whether you&#x27;re applying mascara and blink. Or, applying lipstick and slip. This pen works just like a regular eraser. When you make a mistake while writing with a pencil, you use an eraser to get rid of it. It&#x27;s just as easy with this item. You&#x27;ve got to try it!!  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  [[ASIN:B0038BMAII Revlon Makeup Eraser Pen #505 (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> I have a 14 yr old and 12 1/2 year old.  They are learning to make up the eyes,  and this was a wonderful edition to their make up bags  so they are ready if they have a slip!!  They both love it!!!Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This eraser is the BEST invention ever! I cannot get ready and get my makeup on without it! I ordered two because I can&#x27;t find them in the stores in my area. I highly recommend the eye makeup eraser!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this makeup remover pen; it&#x27;s a must-have in my purse. The pen makes it super easy to remove any mascara smudges or makeup imperfections. Plus, it&#x27;s small, so it&#x27;s super portable. However, about two weeks after receiving this product, the tip broke off as I was using it. The product is great, but I won&#x27;t be reordering it because it&#x27;s quite pricey. All in all, this is a great makeup remover pen, but for the price, it&#x27;s pretty fragile, so be careful with it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely one of the best tools in my makeup kit.  Unless you NEVER get mascara anywhere except your eye lashes, you will wonder what you ever did without this handy wand. It lasts a long time and works as promised.</li>
    <li> Really like this item.  It removes any eye make up that is not where it belongs without removing the rest of your make up.  Couldn&#x27;t do without it.  The seller was a bit slow, but I won&#x27;t count that against the product.</li>
    <li> This eraser pen is great.  I&#x27;ll be bummed when I can&#x27;t find them anymore.  I use it to fix my eyeliner in the morning.  After using it, you should blot the tip of the pen on a tissue, which will help remove the makeup from the tip.  To &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; the residue left on your skin, just fold a piece of tissue over your finger tip and use your fingernail to wipe across the area of your skin where you used the pen.  It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used product before and it works great.</li>
    <li> Wish this were not so hard to find now. It is great for when yoo make a mistake putting on mascara and eyeliner. It goes right off with a little press of the wand without running the rest of your makeup. If more people wanted them they might strat carrying them in the stores again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing tool for erasing eye makeup smudges.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It works very well....</li>
    <li> I lsot my pen and had to buy a different one all the revlon pens I see online are to expensive. We&#x27;ll see what happens</li>
    <li> This product really works and is very easy to use. It&#x27; is a shame they don&#x27;t make them any more.</li>
    <li> I love this product however it needs to be sold in stores. Also the price almost doubled since the last time I ordered this product.</li>
    <li> Been using my first and only Revlon makeup pen for about a year now. I have no idea how much longer it will last but when it finally runs out I will get a new one! It has a firm, smooth tip that allows for precision \\&quot;makeup mistake removal.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried to find the exact ingredients and could not but it does seem to feel and act like a very light oil. It leaves behind no residue and it is non-irritating. If the tip gets dirty (like when I pick up mascara specks) I just gently wipe the tip on tissue. I recommend this product for anyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this product - worth every penny and a true must-have in your purse!  It works likes a charm, easy to use, no clean-up, no fuss, smudge-free, and removes all that it touches.  It doesn&#x27;t leak, typically lasts about 3-5 months for me depending on frequency of use, leaves no residue, and is perfectly lightweight to carry with you.  I rarely rave about a product, am 40-years old, and have been wearing makeup since I was 14 - this is one of the few products that lives up to all of my expectations.  Buy it...you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this product at any drug store in my area....Happy that I was able to get it online.......Product always does its job.....</li>
    <li> Best product. Wish it sold in stores.</li>
    <li> It wipes it right off. I rarely wear makeup but then I do I want to be able to get it all off at the end of the day and this makes it so easy. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product.it removes any makeup mistakes you might make without taking off all your other makeup. One of the BEST tools Revlon made. When it came time to purchase a new one, I was told Revlon has discontinued it...I don&#x27;t know why but, OH NO.. After searching the mall and being told that no other manufacture made anything like it, I searched the internet and found it..I bought 2 of them that should last a long time. The shipper was very prompt in getting it to me and it was exactly what I was looking for THANK GOODNESS..</li>
    <li> I have to go over mistakes a few times before it is completely erased. I don&#x27;t really care for it. While I will finish it. I will I purchase again.</li>
    <li> i have had this product in the past and it works very well.  Its very hard to find so when I came across it on amazon, I knew I had to replace my old one.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this product. It immediately erases any mascara or eyeliner mistakes and is very easy to use. I wish it was easier to find.</li>
    <li> I HAD LOOKED IN EVERYSTORE IN TOWN FOR THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT FINDING IT. SO AS USUAL, I TURNED TO THE INTERNET WHERE I FOUND WHAT I WAS LOOKING TO BUY. I LOVE THIS FOR HELPING TO TAKE MASCARA OFF PLACES I DON&#x27;T WANT IT TO BE.</li>
    <li> Love how this erases mistakes without dammaging makeup.  Cannot find it at any of the stores I shop at.  This way is easy.</li>
    <li> very convenient when you make wrong stroke in eyeliners or when eye makeup smears after a while. Easy to carry.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, Luv It.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for your makeup bag.  It&#x27;s a great quick fix when you make a mistake and it lasts a long time.  I had my last one for more than 5 years and only had to replace it because I lost it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in the stores any longer and I had used the last one for 2 years. Smudge waterproof mascara under eyes.... this takes it right off, with no problems.  I bought two of these pens this time.  It&#x27;s a staple in my makeup bag. Love it!</li>
    <li> It is the one which, I have been looking for, I am completely satisfied. I will buy this item in future too.</li>
    <li> Love this pen as it will remove even smudges of waterproof mascara from my under eye wrinkles!  Can&#x27;t beat that with any other product.</li>
    <li> Received the product very quickly!  It was packaged well, and I am thrilled with the way it works!  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes eye makeup!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this. I had bought a couple of these in a store a few years ago and loved it, it works great. I use waterproof gel eyeliner and if I make a mistake this will correct it easily with no mess. It releases just the right amount of &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; to get it off without messing up my makeup. I have used other options since because this is hard to find now and expensive online compared to the few dollars I paid for it in the store, but the other options are not nearly as good. I am afraid that Revlon has discontinued it, which is a shame, I am betting that people just don&#x27;t know about it and how great it works.</li>
    <li> Whisk away a blop of mascara in 1 or 2  quick, pinpoint strokes ... Like magic - Gone.  And you&#x27;re back to perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from the makeup aisle at a grocery store, but these days I can never find this product anywhere. I always search the makeup aisles for this one, but with no luck. I looked online at Sephora for a similar product, but could not find anything. I&#x27;ve tried the L&#x27;Oreal Clean Artiste makeup corrector pen, but this product doesn&#x27;t compare with the Revlon pen. Luckily I found this product sold online and bought a whole bunch to keep in stock in case they discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon pen is great for correcting eyeliner mistakes and panda eyes when your makeup starts smudging under your eyes. I usually use the pen and then a tissue to wipe the smudges. It works great and so much better than using your fingers or a wet tissue to wipe away those smudges. It lasts a super long time. I&#x27;ve had mine for months - just make sure to wipe the tip so that it remains clean.</li>
    <li> I had this several years ago and I ran out of it and could not get it until I saw it on here.  I really love how it works.  I cannot find it in stores I even asked if it could be ordered, I was so glad to see it on here.  I recommend it highly, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
