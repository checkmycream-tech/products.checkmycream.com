    <li> Now everyone is different (chemicals in our bodies. PH levels, etc..) but I am pretty sure one of the ingredients has concerns for allergies on EWG&#x27;s database and I had little bumps all over my scalp and hair line. It went away after I rinsed my hair with ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) so I wasn&#x27;t too worried but I will never use again unless they change their formula.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great!  I have double processed hair that is wavy and becomes dry very easily.  I felt like I grew a new head of hair after one use of this.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this because it was recommend on Paula&#x27;s Choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to get out tangles in my daughter&#x27;s hair. This is by far the best one that I have tried. The tangles come right out and the hair is nicely conditioned!</li>
    <li> Smooths the hair and helps split ends!</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well on my dry hair.  Left it on for several minutes in the shower and I noticed moderate improvement.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it is a great moisturize, I use while trying to get rid of protein overload. did help</li>
    <li> I bought this Neutrogena Hair Mask and the Daily Deep Conditioner--the hair mask did absolutely nothing to my hair. I might be exaggerating a little, but if felt like I put it in and after keeping it in for a couple of hours it just came right out. When I used the Daily Deep Conditioner, I put it in and then washed it out after the remainder of my shower, which was like 10 min. HUGE Difference. This gave me the moisture and softness I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It was OK. I expected more.</li>
    <li> Great product and was immediate shipping</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do a thing for my relaxed hair. I deep condition with it under my hooded dryer, and it felt like I didn&#x27;t use anything. My hair was tangled and hard</li>
    <li> I like to use this product daily as it makes my long hair super easy to brush without any tangles and makes my hair shine.</li>
    <li> I really like the Neutrogena hair products.  I use this with the Clean shampoo.  High quality at reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;I am male, and keep my hair normal short, so a little goes a long way.  My hair is clean, soft, with no residue.  Don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> I feel that my hair is better , but its not that moisturizing</li>
    <li> I was amazed how my hair felt soft and smooth again and to think that It was only the first try. This product is a must! My hair is lovin&#x27; it</li>
    <li> I used this with the Neutrogena once a week cleanse shampoo - I have hard water and hair that falls just below my chin that I started to think of course and unmanageable. This conditioner made it silky, and a lot easier to dry!</li>
    <li> great as a shampoo and wonderful scent</li>
    <li> Glad I discovered this, love using it on my hair.</li>
    <li> I really liked this conditioner! My hair became very dry but I can see that they look much much better after I use this conditioner. Really good moisturizer, will use again.</li>
