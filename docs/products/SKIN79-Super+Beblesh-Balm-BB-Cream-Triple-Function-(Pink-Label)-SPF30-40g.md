      <li>This product is great for light skin and hiding blemishes!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Great product for so cheap</li>
      <li>Also, coverage is light feeling but a good concealer.  </li>
      <li>This BB Cream was one of the most popular ones that I&#x27;ve heard about, so I decided I would give this one a try.  </li>
      <li>I think this is a light to medium coverage that looks like skin once it oxidizes and is actually good for your skin.</li>

      <li>My favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a year or more and and tried others, but none have the pink/beige pigment that this does.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I truly love the finish these BB creams give.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This product provides a nice light covering without looking like you are wearing makeup.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try a BB cream called cover girl cg smoothers, and it is pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Although its kinda pinkish ,it suits me just fine, its blendable, doesnt cake up and feels very light.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to have such a great experience in shopping for one.  </li>
      <li>Much recommended, but make sure you do your reading to make sure you get a genuine product since there&#x27;s a lot of fakes floating around!!</li>
      <li>when you have the bb cream on, it blend in to fit your skin tone and it makes it look even better.</li>
      <li>The coverage of my black spots and acne are great!</li>
      <li>This stuff really makes my face look and feel amazing, without feeling weighty or caked on.  </li>
      <li>It goes on light but blends in rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>Use a full pump if you want thicker coverage.</li>
      <li>My teenage daughter, who is much more fair-skinned, tried this and fell in love with it as well.  </li>
      <li>the first time i used it, it looked gray on me, but dont worry, the bb cream corrects itself to fit better to your tone and you will get use to the gray tone because it actually makes your face look more radiant.</li>
      <li>The product arrived exactly as advertised, and ahead of schedule too!  </li>
      <li>Hours later, I only had to blot my nose and chin once, while my forehead was perfect (first time ever).  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember when I last liked my face with makeup on.  </li>
      <li>I was once told by a makeup artist at the MAC counter that I was covering up my good skin with foundation that actually aged me.</li>
      <li>Because it is a BB cream it smooths out all the red splotches and gives a nice glow.</li>
      <li>and i always buy your great products but for the second time im trying to buy the bb cream triple action and</li>
      <li>I like having sunscreen built right in and having to use a separate product.</li>
      <li>This is the first BB Cream I have tried out----I originally used Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation, and, though it covered up my acne perfectly, it was extremely heavy on my skin.  </li>
      <li>woow thank you very much love it fast and new</li>
      <li>I do like the amount of product I was given, but I will probably opt for the Missha BB Cream (which has a more sheer coverage) by the time I run out of this because of the higher SPF Missha provides.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For first time users: on first application it looks gray.</li>
      <li>but also the bottle looks like having some cracks and the tiny part of the bottle on the top was not neatly positioned, hence causing some cream leakage when it was shipped to my place.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only okay.</li>
      <li>I also use a concealer in addition to this, just apply the concealer to the areas you see after you have applied this product first.</li>
      <li>This is a cross between an American BB cream and a full coverage foundation in terms of coverage, but SO much better!  </li>
      <li>this BB cream give me a clear and smooth finish, of course if you are looking for a full coverage bb cream this is not for you, this one just give you a natural look</li>
      <li>Good coverage with small amount used.</li>
      <li>Less gray, warmer, nice smell, dewy glow.</li>
      <li>I sometimes layer on a bit of bronzer if I look a little too pale (since it does have whitening effects) or dab on a layer of powder that is closer to my skin tone, but it has a pretty flawless finish and does the job well.</li>
      <li>The BB cream feels like and is less oily than other brands and it&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>thanks, Eliete</li>
      <li>Recommend it to people who dont have as much imperfections.</li>
      <li>nope I received the real thing.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m a light to medium with yellow undertones).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so much more than what i expected.</li>
      <li>It does not oxidize like a foundation does and has buildable coverage, which I really like.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Having never used real BB Cream before (not the tinted moisturizer that passes for BB Cream)</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive/acne prone skin, anything with a silky texture (silicones etc)</li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s for, but ya it came.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin, and even though this product claims to help with sebum, I do not see evidence.  </li>
      <li>I have tried the gold formula and liked it but found it to be a little on the light grey side.</li>
      <li>I bought this from a new seller called AustinCosmetics, and I definitely received a genuine product and a free sample of a facial mask.</li>
      <li>And it will not completely cover up your areas, but it will smooth it out like primer.</li>
      <li>My skin gets slightly dry after a half day, but the application is very smooth and light.</li>
      <li>I absolutely cannot live without it.</li>
      <li>The older one has 25 spf.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this BB cream</li>
      <li>I am totally satisfied with this little fat bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only very recently gotten interested in a BB cream, rather than a full coverage foundation.  </li>
      <li>the consistency is pretty thick, that&#x27;s because it has a better coverage</li>
      <li>i use it during winter time or when my skin is lighter because i get dark easily.</li>
      <li>this is product is for medium coverage, but it has a better coverage than other American drug store bb cream products.</li>
      <li>When I first apply it, makes me ghostly white</li>
      <li>This is the first Asian BB cream that I´ve tried.</li>
      <li>I had some left of the real authentic Skin79 hot pink from a previous buy and the contents of that bottle and the contents of this are completely different.</li>
      <li>I also have very oily skin so after a few hours, this makes me super shiny.</li>
      <li>I would really recommend this to Asian people..</li>
      <li>Leaves a soft natural finish.</li>
      <li>I really love this product,but after several weeks they told me it was not available.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 42 and white with acne prone skin, a very oily t-zone, visible veins under one eye, dark spots from sun damage on the tops of both cheekbones, fine lines around the eyes, and large pores, so basically my skin is not pretty</li>
      <li>It has a good amount of coverage, enough that I only needed to use some Larenim mineral foundation under my eyes afterward, and not on the sun spots and the broken capillaries on the nose.  </li>
      <li>Sorry I had to give such a poor review,it is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>It takes a few minutes to absorb but it is worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>The color did not change at all, and when I looked in the mirror, I just saw my skin as I wished it looked, and did not see a mask of makeup or too dark makeup or my large pores.  </li>
      <li>I think I have finally realized that although my skin is bad, maybe less makeup will actually look better than more.  </li>
      <li>I only use half to pump to cover my whole face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s so much more than what i expected. It has done wonders for my face.</li>
    <li> It controls my oils all day. When I first apply it, makes me ghostly white but after a while it becomes closer to my skin color. I am NC 37, indian skin, yellow undertone. It sort of feels like cement on my skin after a while. My skin feels very rough. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t use this BB cream anymore.</li>
    <li> woow thank you very much love it fast and new</li>
    <li> This seller&#x27;s skin79 BB cream has been the worst I have ever used. Not only did this cream made my skin looks so dry and but also the bottle looks like having some cracks and the tiny part of the bottle on the top was not neatly positioned, hence causing some cream leakage when it was shipped to my place. The seller claimed that s/he can&#x27;t return the product for me because it is used. But wait a minute how can I know the effect on my face without opening and using it?? They just assumed I did not see the picture or reviews. However I did it all before any purchase was made. And that is what I always do!!  VERY BAD EXPERIENCE!</li>
    <li> This is the first Asian BB cream that I´ve tried. It covers my face well enough, and gives me a a glowy look. Although its kinda pinkish ,it suits me just fine, its blendable, doesnt cake up and feels very light. Recommend it to people who dont have as much imperfections.</li>
    <li> This product provides a nice light covering without looking like you are wearing makeup.  It goes on light but blends in rather quickly.  It does not easily wear off and seems to provide day long evening out of the look of your skin as well as a little shine.  I tried matte products but did not like the look compared to this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried the gold formula and liked it but found it to be a little on the light grey side. The pink formula is closer to my skin tone and I truly love the finish these BB creams give. I was once told by a makeup artist at the MAC counter that I was covering up my good skin with foundation that actually aged me. I think this is a light to medium coverage that looks like skin once it oxidizes and is actually good for your skin.</li>
    <li> My go-to BB cream for the past 4 years! You do need to be careful who you purchase from as there are quite a few counterfeits out there, but hopefully the new packaging helps deter those in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product! My favorite foundation.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Good coverage with small amount used.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a dupe or fake but nope I received the real thing. I took my chances and got what i wanted . Thank youu</li>
    <li> hello! im from brazil and i always buy your great products but for the second time im trying to buy the bb cream triple action and the sun protect beblesh pact but its saying that you dont ship to Brazil. please help! thanks, Eliete</li>
    <li> Beware! This product is fake.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for four years and counting! I absolutely cannot live without it. It has improved my skin dramatically and I always recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For first time users: on first application it looks gray. But it will match your skin tone as it oxidizes. And it will not completely cover up your areas, but it will smooth it out like primer. I also use a concealer in addition to this, just apply the concealer to the areas you see after you have applied this product first.</li>
    <li> I heard it from my friend and order it. I am totally satisfied with this little fat bottle. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only very recently gotten interested in a BB cream, rather than a full coverage foundation.  I think I have finally realized that although my skin is bad, maybe less makeup will actually look better than more.  I&#x27;m 42 and white with acne prone skin, a very oily t-zone, visible veins under one eye, dark spots from sun damage on the tops of both cheekbones, fine lines around the eyes, and large pores, so basically my skin is not pretty and I&#x27;ve always wanted a lot of coverage.  I&#x27;ve gotten tired of going through all the steps to prep my skin for makeup (oil control moisturizer, mattifiers, pore reducers, spray primer, etc), only to have my makeup look horrible an hour after putting it on regardless of whether I used powdered mineral foundation or liquid foundation.  It would oxidize on my skin and turn tan, especially on my nose area.  When I&#x27;d try to blot, everything would sink into pores, leaving me with visible little dots all over.  I decided to try a BB cream called cover girl cg smoothers, and it is pretty good.  Very little oxidization, no sinking into lines, but very little coverage.  I ran across this Skin79 formula while looking for a BB cream with some oil controlling properties.  This is a cross between an American BB cream and a full coverage foundation in terms of coverage, but SO much better!  I prepped my skin as usual for makeup and then applied this with my fingers.  I did not pat as the instructions said to, but spread it around just like foundation.  It has a good amount of coverage, enough that I only needed to use some Larenim mineral foundation under my eyes afterward, and not on the sun spots and the broken capillaries on the nose.  I followed with Larenim pressed mineral silk powder as a finishing step, and BOOM, I looked good.  The color comes out of the bottle gray-taupe, but matches your skin perfectly (I&#x27;m a light to medium with yellow undertones).  Hours later, I only had to blot my nose and chin once, while my forehead was perfect (first time ever).  The color did not change at all, and when I looked in the mirror, I just saw my skin as I wished it looked, and did not see a mask of makeup or too dark makeup or my large pores.  This did not settle into my lines, so I looked younger as well.  I can&#x27;t remember when I last liked my face with makeup on.  I highly recommend this BB cream-there&#x27;s no comparison to the Americanized versions.  My teenage daughter, who is much more fair-skinned, tried this and fell in love with it as well.  It matches her skin perfectly as well.  I guess I need to stock up now!  I bought this from a new seller called AustinCosmetics, and I definitely received a genuine product and a free sample of a facial mask.</li>
    <li> This was a knock-off and I returned it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only okay. It&#x27;s lighter than my actual skin tone so it makes my face whiter than my body. I also have very oily skin so after a few hours, this makes me super shiny.</li>
    <li> I really love this product,but after several weeks they told me it was not available. Guess I need to try to find it from another vendor. Sorry I had to give such a poor review,it is pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> Recieved a fake product. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This is the first BB Cream I have tried out----I originally used Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation, and, though it covered up my acne perfectly, it was extremely heavy on my skin.  This BB Cream was one of the most popular ones that I&#x27;ve heard about, so I decided I would give this one a try.  I have very oily skin, and even though this product claims to help with sebum, I do not see evidence.  Therefore, I still have to use a powder over this product throughout the day on my t-zone, the tops of my cheeks, and my chin.  It does not oxidize like a foundation does and has buildable coverage, which I really like.  I would really recommend this to Asian people..I know there have been complaints that the BB Cream looks gray on European skin (that is because the gray color of the BB Cream neutralizes the yellow undertones of Asian skin, so it does not show up as a gray color on our skin).  I do like the amount of product I was given, but I will probably opt for the Missha BB Cream (which has a more sheer coverage) by the time I run out of this because of the higher SPF Missha provides.</li>
    <li> American BB creams are always too pink or too orange for me. I was recommended this brand by someone that was experienced with Korean BB creams. This is my HG face product. I have very sensitive/acne prone skin, anything with a silky texture (silicones etc) will usually cause acne on my face. Not this product, I actually think it has improved the condition of my skin over time. This is my 3rd time to order and I definitely will purchase it as long as it is produced. Seller was excellent, arrived at my doorstep weeks in advance of the estimate. 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nervous to try it as the English on the back is incorrect. Also, not the packaging as in the picture. Frustrated.</li>
    <li> I love this BB cream. It goes on grayish bit after a while, it bends in with your skin and becomes flawless. A little pump goes a long way too. I only use half to pump to cover my whole face. Use a full pump if you want thicker coverage. The BB cream feels like and is less oily than other brands and it&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years now and it is very beneficial to my dry, thin skin.  Also, coverage is light feeling but a good concealer.  It takes a few minutes to absorb but it is worth the wait.  Just plan ahead.</li>
    <li> This product is great for light skin and hiding blemishes! It works really wonderful! Best foundation bb cream to be on my face(: love it!!</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this . I like to mix it with my missha # 23 bob cream. I&#x27;m 50 and a tennis player so spend lots of outdoor time. I always get complements on my glow to my skin.... I do wear a moisturizer under cause I have dry skin .</li>
    <li> This product works great as a primer for my makeup. I even like to wear it as my foundation. Because it is a BB cream it smooths out all the red splotches and gives a nice glow. Plus it not only covers acne but helps to cure it. Great product for so cheap</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. But product was not full size like it shows in the picture.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using this for a year or more and and tried others, but none have the pink/beige pigment that this does. This is the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one with 30 spf. The older one has 25 spf. I like having sunscreen built right in and having to use a separate product.</li>
    <li> The product arrived exactly as advertised, and ahead of schedule too!  Having never used real BB Cream before (not the tinted moisturizer that passes for BB Cream) I was thrilled to have such a great experience in shopping for one.  This stuff really makes my face look and feel amazing, without feeling weighty or caked on.  Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend. So don&#x27;t really know what it&#x27;s for, but ya it came.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bb cream exclusively for the past 3 years, and it&#x27;s never failed me. Moisturizes and covers blemishes without looking cakey, and really easy to blend! I sometimes layer on a bit of bronzer if I look a little too pale (since it does have whitening effects) or dab on a layer of powder that is closer to my skin tone, but it has a pretty flawless finish and does the job well. Much recommended, but make sure you do your reading to make sure you get a genuine product since there&#x27;s a lot of fakes floating around!! I bought mine from Beauty Works -- not sure about other sellers.</li>
    <li> Love it! this BB cream give me a clear and smooth finish, of course if you are looking for a full coverage bb cream this is not for you, this one just give you a natural look, actually looks like am not wearing any make up at all, and just help me to cover the lil blemish i got on my cheeks sometimes</li>
    <li> definitely fake. Initially the pump didnt work. When I opened it manually it was watery and blotchy. I had some left of the real authentic Skin79 hot pink from a previous buy and the contents of that bottle and the contents of this are completely different.</li>
    <li> Leaves a soft natural finish. Does not cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> My skin gets slightly dry after a half day, but the application is very smooth and light. Love the soapy smell. The coverage of my black spots and acne are great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Skin 79 Gold for years. I like the Pink label as well: Less gray, warmer, nice smell, dewy glow.</li>
    <li> this is product is for medium coverage, but it has a better coverage than other American drug store bb cream products. I am going to use this product for a long time and i have recommend it for my friends too. its for lighter skin. i use it during winter time or when my skin is lighter because i get dark easily. the consistency is pretty thick, that&#x27;s because it has a better coverage, i usually use it with my facial moisturizer so that it spread out easier. the first time i used it, it looked gray on me, but dont worry, the bb cream corrects itself to fit better to your tone and you will get use to the gray tone because it actually makes your face look more radiant. i&#x27;ve had a lot of complements on my skin and everyone does not believe me when i say i have make up on. when you have the bb cream on, it blend in to fit your skin tone and it makes it look even better. I get a lot of compliment saying that i look younger than i actually am a lot when i use the bb cream.</li>
    <li> This is the only base I use on my face, and I love it. Goes on a little grey, adjusts after a few minutes. I have combination skin and it makes it more even and lovely. Big fan!</li>
