      <li>The color that arrived did not match the picture, but I love the carrier.</li>
      <li>As for the other reviews about the quality of the bag, I have 2 and mine are great, Amazon has a great return policy so if someone has received one that wasn&#x27;t sewn well then they should request an exchange or refund.  </li>
      <li>The 5ml bottles won&#x27;t fit under straps and not 14 bottles for sure..</li>
      <li>Love the color but doesn&#x27;t fit the roller bottles like the description claimed.</li>
      <li>If you are a user of those mini bottles, this seems fine for the price.</li>
      <li>I prefer cotton, but it is fine.</li>
      <li>The reason your 5ml bottles don&#x27;t fit, is because this case is made for 5/8th dram bottles..</li>
      <li>This item was fantastic in making a mini- oil kit to take away on vacation.</li>
      <li>none of my oils fit.  </li>
      <li>The stitching looked cheap, too.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of 10ml and none of those fit either,  </li>
      <li>Perfect for my new essential oils.</li>
      <li>Lucky to fit 7</li>
      <li>Super cheap and not at all equip to hold the quantity it says.</li>
      <li>Bought this- was a good bag but not what I was personally looking for</li>
      <li>Does not hold the dram bottles in,  I thought I might be one of the lucky ones to get a case where the elastic was sewn in correctly...</li>
      <li>This case is exactly what it says in the title and detailed description.  </li>
      <li>you for a useful product.&lt;br /&gt;Leslie</li>
      <li>and I can carry it with me on trips easily or have it around home and easy to keep essential oils in.  </li>
      <li>Just the right size.  </li>
      <li>I keep them in my purse so that I don&#x27;t have the added weight of the original bottles, because I refuse to leave home without a decent selection of oils.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for...</li>
      <li>pretty.</li>
      <li>I also think it was kind of cheapy, not much padding.</li>
      <li>The whole thing feels unbelievably cheap and gross.  </li>
      <li>Only fit 1 5ml bottle and nothing else because of the stitching.</li>
      <li>Very well padded, kept bottles cushioned during travel and being packed in checked baggage.</li>
      <li>It will go straight in the trash.</li>
      <li>They are very practical.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it three stars because seller was fast-</li>
      <li>Very convenient way to store and carry your oils</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll need the smaller vials in order to not break the threads holding the elastic a/bottles secure.</li>
      <li>but i wish they had made it more clear that this holds super mini shortie bottles, not standard size essential oil bottles like Do-terra, etc.</li>
      <li>Great for carrying small amounts of essential oils and a carrier oil with me.</li>
      <li>The quality seems ok, there is very little stretch in the elastic so its hard to imagine filling this to capacity and being able to easily remove bottles.</li>
      <li>I have tiny bottles of my most used essential oils in it.  </li>
      <li>It is meant to carry your sample bottles with you, not full bottles. :)</li>
      <li>After receiving the product, I think the price is a touch high for what you get.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to anyone who would like to have oils on hand at all times.</li>
      <li>I guess I expected something that would fit my 5ml-15ml bottles</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a felt then a fluffy fabric.</li>
      <li>Has decent padding and the construction seems to be pretty solid...</li>
      <li>This only fits the tiny bottles, no 5,10 or 15 ml bottle would ever fit.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed fits in my purse for my essential oils.</li>
      <li>It clearly says in the description that it will for 14 5/8 dram bottles, not 5mLs.</li>
      <li>I was being really generous with the three stars, only because I never actually used the product, and it&#x27;s possible it would have been useful and long-lasting.  </li>
      <li>I have attached a picture that shows the different size bottles and which ones this particular bag will accommodate.</li>
      <li>the elastic is too small to fit anything</li>
      <li>I guess I expected something a little more substantial.  </li>
      <li>I use daily with new oil collection.</li>
      <li>Is a tight though if you are trying to use it for essential oil bottle you get from the company ; the are to big but will fit you just lose use of the neighboring slot .</li>
      <li>I could barely get my pinkie through the elastic loops.</li>
      <li>i guess it&#x27;s for super small oil bottles.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have it full and it has room enough for my small swiss army knife.</li>

<li> It hardly seems right or fair for someone to give it a bad review because they couldn&#x27;t fit the larger, 5 ml or 15 ml bottles inside this case simply because they failed to read the description.  </li>
<li> Sometime when you open the bag the bottles are loose inside.</li>
<li> The material is a little too soft and flimsy.</li>
<li> It was smaller than I expected and won&#x27;t hold my oils</li>
<li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> The elastic is sewn in to tightly and even if it wasn&#x27;t it is just not big enough for 14 bottles.  </li>
<li> It sort of catches on dry skin.  </li>
<li> it holds the little tiny bottles I make up for oil</li>
<li> Bottles do not fit, supposed to hold 14 bottles can only get four in case.  </li>
<li> Was not what I expected.  </li>
<li> Not what I expected.  </li>
<li> If it weren&#x27;t for the trouble, I would send it back.</li>
<li> When I&#x27;m trying to look at or get an oil from one side, the other side bottles sometimes falls out.</li>
<li> This is for the small bottles, not the regular sized ones.</li>
<li> Not worth what they are selling this for...</li>
<li> I had to go down to the description at the bottom of the page to see this.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d also rather have the bottle standing up rather than lying down side by side.</li>
<li> Purchased 5/8 dram bottles and was disappointed that they didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
<li> Bottles do not fit, had to return it</li>
<li> They do not fit using the bands, the rows are too close together,so they all clink together.</li>
<li> Just wanted to say, for all the people who are trying to put 5mL bottles in here and complaining that they do not fit.</li>
<li> waste of money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect size to put in my purse and take with me.</li>
    <li> Just the right size.  Elastic bands keep bottles in place.  Very well padded, kept bottles cushioned during travel and being packed in checked baggage.</li>
    <li> I traveled with 2 of these cases in Europe and the middle east.  They are very practical.  I was glad to have oils with me.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a useful product.&lt;br /&gt;Leslie</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected. Elastic is very tight, making putting the bottles in difficult.</li>
    <li> Great for carrying my oils when travelling, etc.!</li>
    <li> I ordered this size by mistake [I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size of the case].  MY BAD!  It holds smaller bottles than what I have.  I do use it, but none of my bottles are secured.  Good quality stitching &amp; zipper, tho.</li>
    <li> It came in a timely manner, I&#x27;m not happy with the quality of the bag. The bottles don&#x27;t stay in the elastic. Sometime when you open the bag the bottles are loose inside. Bad design</li>
    <li> wish i didnt buy it, elastics too smalll to hold bottles</li>
    <li> This item was fantastic in making a mini- oil kit to take away on vacation. I highly recommend to anyone who would like to have oils on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I expected and won&#x27;t hold my oils</li>
    <li> There is no way I could get one, not alone 14 bottles in this bag.  The elastic is sewn in to tightly and even if it wasn&#x27;t it is just not big enough for 14 bottles.  Also the quality is better in the picture than what I received.</li>
    <li> Bought this- was a good bag but not what I was personally looking for</li>
    <li> Not as described.. The 5ml bottles won&#x27;t fit under straps and not 14 bottles for sure.. Lucky to fit 7</li>
    <li> This case is exactly what it says in the title and detailed description.  It holds 14 of the 5/8 dram size bottles.  It hardly seems right or fair for someone to give it a bad review because they couldn&#x27;t fit the larger, 5 ml or 15 ml bottles inside this case simply because they failed to read the description.  As for the other reviews about the quality of the bag, I have 2 and mine are great, Amazon has a great return policy so if someone has received one that wasn&#x27;t sewn well then they should request an exchange or refund.  I keep them in my purse so that I don&#x27;t have the added weight of the original bottles, because I refuse to leave home without a decent selection of oils.  I have attached a picture that shows the different size bottles and which ones this particular bag will accommodate.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Much smaller.  I paid $12 for a $3 item.</li>
    <li> The color that arrived did not match the picture, but I love the carrier.</li>
    <li> This is nice it holds the little tiny bottles I make up for oil and I can carry it with me on trips easily or have it around home and easy to keep essential oils in.  It is nice.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say, for all the people who are trying to put 5mL bottles in here and complaining that they do not fit. It clearly says in the description that it will for 14 5/8 dram bottles, not 5mLs. It is meant to carry your sample bottles with you, not full bottles. :)</li>
    <li> This is ugly.  And the fabric is...yuck.  It just feels awful in your hands.  It looks like terry cloth in the pic, but it&#x27;s not. The whole thing feels unbelievably cheap and gross.  I don&#x27;t know if it is or not, because I gave it away.  The stitching looked cheap, too.  I was being really generous with the three stars, only because I never actually used the product, and it&#x27;s possible it would have been useful and long-lasting.  Honestly, I&#x27;ve never hated something because of the fabric before, but this fabric was the worst.  I couldn&#x27;t stand touching it.</li>
    <li> The description of this case says it holds 14 BOTTLES. What it should say is that it holds 14 VIALS. There is no way you could put bottles in this case. Luckily for me, I own a sewing machine and seam ripper and could adjust the spaces and make the 14 slots into 4!!!! Does anyone even own vials of oils??? Save your money, don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
    <li> This does not hold 14 bottles. I have to squeeze to get five bottles in side. I still love it because it fits in my purse and I can carry oils with me. But the amount it holds is definitely misrepresented.</li>
    <li> The material is a little too soft and flimsy. When I&#x27;m trying to look at or get an oil from one side, the other side bottles sometimes falls out. I&#x27;d also rather have the bottle standing up rather than lying down side by side.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for...It fits 14 5/8 dram bottles perfectly. Has decent padding and the construction seems to be pretty solid...Perfect for purse travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it three stars because seller was fast- BUT it isn&#x27;t what I wanted. This only fits the tiny bottles, no 5,10 or 15 ml bottle would ever fit. I also think it was kind of cheapy, not much padding. I was very disappointed. If it weren&#x27;t for the trouble, I would send it back.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description I guess.  Got it in the mail.  none of my oils fit.  I have a lot of 10ml and none of those fit either,  i guess it&#x27;s for super small oil bottles.  Can not use.  I guess I&#x27;ll use it for my lip still or something when I travel......Make sure read descriptions before purchasing :-)  I loved the color purple tho.  pretty.</li>
    <li> The quality seems ok, there is very little stretch in the elastic so its hard to imagine filling this to capacity and being able to easily remove bottles. It is not the sellers fault since it gave a bottle size but i wish they had made it more clear that this holds super mini shortie bottles, not standard size essential oil bottles like Do-terra, etc. I could barely get my pinkie through the elastic loops. If you are a user of those mini bottles, this seems fine for the price.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that 5/8 dram referred to the bottle size.  I thought it described the material.  Consequently, the carrying case was too small for my needs.</li>
    <li> The workmanship is a little shoddy. I guess I expected something a little more substantial.  I guess it&#x27;s ok and serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Not worth what they are selling this for...</li>
    <li> This is horrible, not worth the money.  Bottles do not fit, supposed to hold 14 bottles can only get four in case.  Does not stay under straps and very cheaply made.  Looks dirty and not usable</li>
    <li> Love the color but doesn&#x27;t fit the roller bottles like the description claimed. The &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; bottles fit great. I would have given 4 stars but I bought this specifically for the roller bottles so I ranked 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is for the small bottles, not the regular sized ones.</li>
    <li> Very good quality and beautiful colours; good to use!</li>
    <li> 14 bottles?  No, it holds 6-8 bottles.  Chincy fabric, basically worthless, I threw it away.  Horrible product.  If you want to store 6 bottles of oil in a worthless sack, don&#x27;t even bother to wast you money on this one.  Buy a doo-rag</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed fits in my purse for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel with essential oils.</li>
    <li> The reason your 5ml bottles don&#x27;t fit, is because this case is made for 5/8th dram bottles..</li>
    <li> I thought it would be much larger.  While it said it would hold 14 bottles, what I missed was that it was 14 2 mL bottles, not 10 or 15 mL bottles.  I had to go down to the description at the bottom of the page to see this.  After receiving the product, I think the price is a touch high for what you get.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Nicely fabricated. I use daily with new oil collection. Holds my roller bottles perfecly. Is a tight though if you are trying to use it for essential oil bottle you get from the company ; the are to big but will fit you just lose use of the neighboring slot . Very convenient way to store and carry your oils you have mixed!!</li>
    <li> wont fit any oil jars i own! waste of money. the elastic is too small to fit anything</li>
    <li> Works well w/the very small bottles.</li>
    <li> My daughter got me this for my birthday.  I love it!  I have tiny bottles of my most used essential oils in it.  I keep it in my purse and actually use it often for myself or others.  I don&#x27;t have it full and it has room enough for my small swiss army knife. The material is polyester; feels like kid&#x27;s fire retardant sleepware. It sort of catches on dry skin.  I prefer cotton, but it is fine.</li>
    <li> Purchased 5/8 dram bottles and was disappointed that they didn&#x27;t fit.  You&#x27;ll need the smaller vials in order to not break the threads holding the elastic a/bottles secure.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected.  Construction is good. I just needed to order a bag for roller bottles</li>
    <li> This holds about 6 5ml bottles. Total disappointment!!</li>
    <li> Does not hold the bottles, to small</li>
    <li> Does not hold the dram bottles in,  I thought I might be one of the lucky ones to get a case where the elastic was sewn in correctly...NOPE!!!!!  They do not fit using the bands, the rows are too close together,so they all clink together. It;s so cute, so sad... Guess I just have to hope none get broken.  Do not buy if you expect the elastic straps to work.</li>
    <li> I guess I expected something that would fit my 5ml-15ml bottles and this definitely does not. Not anyone&#x27;s fault. Just don&#x27;t expect to use it for bigger than the sample size bottles.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my new essential oils.</li>
    <li> Works perfect for my purse.</li>
    <li> Super cheap and not at all equip to hold the quantity it says. DO NOT purchase this!</li>
    <li> Stitching is all jacked up. Only fit 1 5ml bottle and nothing else because of the stitching. Material is not as discribes. It&#x27;s more like a felt then a fluffy fabric.</li>
    <li> Great for carrying small amounts of essential oils and a carrier oil with me.</li>
    <li> Bottles do not fit, had to return it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so bummed, this case is terrible. It is so tiny like the size of a sunglasses case and it&#x27;s so hard to squeeze 5ml bottle in, one slingshot at my face while trying. It hardly fits a few bottles. Very poorly made. It will go straight in the trash.</li>
    <li> I use this for traveling with my essential oils.  I use this for short trips and use one where the bottles stand upright for longer trips.</li>
