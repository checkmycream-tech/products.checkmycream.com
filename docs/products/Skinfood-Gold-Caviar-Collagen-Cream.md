      <li>Nice cream, but</li>
      <li>Everything I bought from Honest Skin did not come with a envoice of what the box contained.  </li>

      <li>For me, it even works much better than many name brand skin care which costs more than this product.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel nice and smooth..</li>
      <li>and i see how many extractions i need,but it gives a lot of hydration which i like and need as i am 58.</li>
      <li>ALL OK</li>
      <li>SURELY, I WILL CONTACT YOU AGAIN.</li>
      <li>Love the jar.</li>
      <li>I noticed results the first day!The Skinfood cream has the gold, caviar and collagen that really feel wonderful on the face!</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s worth using!!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!!</li>
      <li>love it, it makes the fine lines in my forehead almost dissapear in just one month of use.</li>
      <li>This feels like it kind of sits on my skin for a while before it eventually gets absorbed.</li>
      <li>, the thing is that my skin is so sensitive to many creams, so if your skin is ok then I think this cream would be the best, but if you have the type of my skin which get allergic to many other creams brands</li>

      <li>I have been using two other SkinFood products that I&#x27;m wildly happy with and have reviewed elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>great for dark spots, and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Not too rich or thick, the cream felt very light and yet gave good coverage.</li>
      <li>I have dry skin and this one does a good job of long-hour moisturizing.</li>
      <li>A bit on the thick side, I would have liked it better if the fragrance wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>

      <li>It was my first time using the product</li>

      <li>I had a very skin allergic reaction from the first time I applied it to my skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some fortunate enough to see results the first night,</li>
      <li>There are gold shimmers in the cream and seems pretty decent.</li>
      <li>The only box I had said second box written on top</li>
      <li>My new Skinfood arrived just before dinner</li>

    <li> This cream is amazing! I noticed results the first day!The Skinfood cream has the gold, caviar and collagen that really feel wonderful on the face! Love this product great results!</li>
    <li> Nice cream, but it feels a bit heavy to me.  Lightly scented and goes on smoothly.  Love the jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really sorry to put one star but the reason why is I had a very skin allergic reaction from the first time I applied it to my skin and it took me a week to get rid of it, the thing is that my skin is so sensitive to many creams, so if your skin is ok then I think this cream would be the best, but if you have the type of my skin which get allergic to many other creams brands then I don&#x27;t recommend buying it</li>
    <li> My skin is moist using this cream but I don&#x27;t see any difference it makes</li>
    <li> great product for firming the skin and under-eye section against the aging effects...one of the best and natural caviar products i have ever tried...</li>
    <li> i might give this closer to 5 stars after i have used it a while and have had a facial and i see how many extractions i need,but it gives a lot of hydration which i like and need as i am 58. i can get very small bumps on my lower cheeks and this seems to keep that to a minimum. so i am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Dries my face out so bad! Even after just one nightly use.</li>
    <li> This smells and feels so wonderful! A little bit goes a long way. Buying again. Definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this one does a good job of long-hour moisturizing. For me, it even works much better than many name brand skin care which costs more than this product. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> ???nit for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> By far the best collagen cream..It makes my skin feel nice and smooth..I only used twice so far so I can&#x27;t say I see a difference but I definitely feel the difference and that&#x27;s worth using!! Will keep ordering</li>
    <li> This is another great Skin Food product I ordered with the other Skin Food treats. It was my first time using the product and I was happy with the quality. It has a mild fragrance that comes in most all of the Skin Food products making the beauty regimen a very pleasant experience. Not too rich or thick, the cream felt very light and yet gave good coverage. I would order this collagen cream again.</li>

    <li> There are gold shimmers in the cream and seems pretty decent. A bit on the thick side, I would have liked it better if the fragrance wasn&#x27;t so strong. This feels like it kind of sits on my skin for a while before it eventually gets absorbed.</li>
    <li> it is suitable my face</li>
    <li> This is going to be a progressive review.  My new Skinfood arrived just before dinner so this is my first night.  I used my Vit. C serum first and then my Gold Caviar Collagen Cream.  I&#x27;ve noticed some fortunate enough to see results the first night, wouldn&#x27;t that be a treat!!  I have been using two other SkinFood products that I&#x27;m wildly happy with and have reviewed elsewhere.  So, in a week I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. it feels really good on my skin. I Will buy this again. This product shipped from Korea so it took about a month to receive.</li>
    <li> great for dark spots, and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Good as a moisturizer.  Ingredients were written in korean, so I do not know if is chemical-free and what does it contain in addition to what was mentioned ( caviar, gold, and collagen).  Nice container.</li>
    <li> Waaaw , it arrived very fast. I love it ,it is so gentle on my skin and smooth. I have a very sensitive skin and dry, most creams I put on my face cause me allergic , but this one is perfect. I will order more in the future.</li>
