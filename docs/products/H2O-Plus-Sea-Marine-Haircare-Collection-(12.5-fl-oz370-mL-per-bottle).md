<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled. Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I used this on a Disney Cruise and was impressed how soft my hair felt and my daughters hair was after hitting the pool. Everyday after the pool we washed and voila, soft again. It removes all the residue and smells great, like a spa. Love it!!!! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Left hair dry and flat. Horrible chemical smell. Not to mention it&#x27;s overpriced. Do NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of this, it will clean you hair but I can&#x27;t stand how it smells afterward I should&#x27;ve just returned it. It smells very very musky, nothing like the one that is teal in color, which we got at the Disney resort.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this body care line at Disney Grand Californian. The smell always takes me back and leaves me feeling refreshed. I feel the price is worth it!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and fancy myself the Queen of Lotions, Notions, and Potions.  This has to be one of my favorites for years.  Moisturing without weighing down my hair.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> We discovered this product while staying at the Iron Horse Hotel in Miwaukee, WI.  They had the shampoo, conditioner and body wash for their toiletries in the bathroom.  We loved the smell so much, we couldn&#x27;t wait to find the full size bottle for our personal use at home.  Definitely give you that spa-like sensation.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, very satisfing</li>
    <li> We encounterd this brand on a Disney Cruise. Got the wife some for Christams, she loved it! If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> We used this product on the Disney Cruise and loved it!  My daughter, her husband and the triplets all use H2O products now.</li>
    <li> This is the Cadillac of shampoos. It&#x27;s pricey but worth it. I experienced a lot of hair loss with department store shampoo but lose only a few strands with H2O. I not only experience thicker, fuller hair but hair that is shiny and soft. I can go several days longer without having to wash my hair as it stays clean longer! Price is not an issue when I get these kinds of results. I will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> My wife and I started using H2O products in India and we really love it. No doubt, they are a little on the higher end, but isn&#x27;t your hair worth it?   Was so happy that this is available through Amazon.com; the product arrives on time and by UPS even though you select the normal shipping option; the package it arrives in the really good. I ordered it the second time.</li>
    <li> Pricey but I guess you get what you pay for. I ordered some after a buddy of mine posted the products on his Facebook.</li>
    <li> My husband especially loves this shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; scent to it.  It is very clean and fresh, and leaves the hair soft.  Sad that it seems to be out of stock everywhere.  We love it!</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for years so gave as birthday gift to niece.</li>
    <li> the shampoo &amp; conditioner are great makes my hair smell nice and it always looks great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best shampoo &amp; conditioner ever!! Love the smell and color and the feel on my hair. And good price when combined too. :)</li>
    <li> Originally used this product on a Disney Cruise.  Liked it so well searched it on Amazon and have purchased it several times.</li>
    <li> I used this at Disney&#x27;s Grand Floridian and was hooked immediately. I love the fresh, minty scent! I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily and find that it doesn&#x27;t get oily in between washes. My hair is also pretty long and I find I don&#x27;t need a detangler after using this conditioner. Wonderful product, just wish it was less expensive, since the bottles don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I first used this product on a Disney Cruise, and really loved it.  I have very fine, straight hair that tends to want to have &amp;#34;fly-aways&amp;#34;.  This shampoo/conditioner combination makes my hair feel clean and smooth and I have not had the need to use any gels or sprays to keep my hair in place.  I also really like the scent, which is pleasant but not overpowering.  I have used this product exclusively now for over a year, and intend to continue doing so.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  First used it on a Disney Cruise last month and fell in love with it !</li>
    <li> The very best non fragrance shampoo and conditioner there is.</li>
    <li> yes I have use it for the last five yrs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the H2O Plus Sea Marine shampoo and conditioner on the Disney Cruise ship in the past, but during our last cruise I noticed that my hair did not go as flat in the summertime humidity. This has always been a big problem for me, since I live in an area that&#x27;s very humid in the summer. I think it&#x27;s the collagen in the conditioner that gives my hair more volume. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with these products.</li>
    <li> These products are fantastic and the fragrance is amazing. I&#x27;d like to try more of their face cosmetics. They even have eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have two daughters with LONG hair and they both love this shampoo and conditioner to get the most luscious locks.  It smells great without being overpowering and leaves hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this shampoo does an excellent job of cleaning it without weighing it down.  It lathers extremely well, so even with my shoulder length hair I only use a nickel/quarter size drop.  The conditioner detangles without weighing down the hair as well, although you need to use a bit more of it than the shampoo.  This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that kept my hair looking clean for more than one day.  It smells nice, too.  UPDATE:  By the end of the first bottle of shampoo it started to weigh my hair down quite a bit, even when I omitted conditioner.  I switched to another shampoo for a few weeks then tried switching back and it still weighed my hair down.  I&#x27;m only docking one star because I&#x27;m not sure if the issue is slow build up or something with my hair itself.</li>
    <li> My husband I used this on a recent Disney cruise (aboard the Dream!) and this is the best hair care product we have found in years.  We are both in our fifties . . .and it did wonders for both us and it very definitely worth the price.  We both have very fine hair and it seemed to give our hair more body and shine . . .. which is desirable at ANY age.  Will continue to keep us supplied via Amazon!</li>
    <li> I  absolutely love the fragrance of this shampoo and conditioner, very unique....I only wish that I could get larger bottles.</li>
    <li> Great product. I heard great things and I love the plankton line.  This could def. smell better, and you could get more for your money - but it&#x27;s a great shampoo if you love H20 products.</li>
    <li> These are exactly the same products as used in Disneyland resorts. Good hair products, a little on the pricey side however.</li>
    <li> H2O shampoo leaves hair clean and soft.  The conditioner leaves hair smooth &amp; manageable, but not limp. Both products smell divine.</li>
    <li> I was expecting products I&#x27;d love. My mother says the smell is like Hibiclens medicinal/ surgical soap the hospitals use. My little sister says it smells like &amp;#34;hotel.&amp;#34;  I was sort of disappointed.  I bought this because a luxury chain of hotels (home to a famous mouse) partnered up with h20+ and supplies this shampoo and conditioner at their resorts. Maybe I should try the body butter or another scent?  Well, it does Ok as a regular shampoo and conditioner would perform. It&#x27;s just nothing extra special.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time at a hotel, where it was provided, along with other samples of this brand.  I absolutely LOVED it.  It made my hair feel thick and look shiny.  My father had died recently, and the stress made my hair fall out.  I had lost quite a bit, and was self conscious about it.  This product really gave what was left of my hair bounce and shine, and it gave the appearance that I had more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 15 years.  My hair has long since grown back/returned to its normal state.  I saw that Amazon carried this product, and so I excitedly bought some.  It is very good, and I would recommend it, but it isn&#x27;t quite the wonder product I remember it being (but it does look, smell, feel exactly the same, so I don&#x27;t think it has changed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does clean my hair gently, if I don&#x27;t use too much of it, and it does leave it shiny and soft.  The conditioner de-tangles well, and both have a nice scent.  For reference, I have curly/wavy hair, some hairs are fine, and some are coarse.  My hair is &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; in damp weather, and flatter in dry.  It is very temperamental, and I can only wash it every other day, sometimes if I don&#x27;t go for a run, I do three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tired of buying shampoo and conditioner and throwing them away because they make my hair look and feel terrible.  It seems like it is better to spend a little more on things that work, rather than buying cheap products that just go in the trash anyway.  This is a good product that is a bit overpriced, but I will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> Got this as samples at Disney Grand Floridian!  I was so happy I was able to order a bigger supply!</li>
    <li> We became familar with H2O products when we visited Disney World and it was in our hotel room.  We became quick fans.  Our hair was clean and moisturized.  The smell was amazing and lasted.  My husband with thick dry hair, my daughter with fine hair and me with straight hair that can frizz during the day.  All our hair responded well to the shampoo and conditioner.  My hair didn&#x27;t frizz and had body.  We like to use the product but the cost doesn&#x27;t allow us to use it much.  It would be nice if they made a large size with a pump like Aveda does.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Smells great (a little minty and clean).  Makes my hair feel great too.  Great price when you buy both the shampoo and conditioner in this set.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and was shipped quickley</li>
    <li> I first tried the samples while on a recent Disney cruise. I was amazed at how it eliminated the frizz!!! My hair was smooth and smelled great. It also gives the scalp a tingling sensation. Better than the expensive brand Purology sold at salons. Better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. They give my hair body and sheen. I first used both products on a Disney cruise and really liked them. I will order again.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!! Can&#x27;t say enough, my hair is supper shnny and soft.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best collections for hair products. Used these products at a Disneyland resort hotel in March of this year … and had to order it, once I got home.</li>
    <li> Love this product and love the samples you sent me!</li>
    <li> We used it on Disney Cruise and love it! Smells great and my hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy when I dry it.</li>
    <li> This is just a great product.  Smells awesome, cleans and conditions, high end stuff.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner and gives my hair lots of body.  Totally love it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> I switch to it every summer.  And it is an excellent deal on Amazon, with a great price and free shipping when I bought it.  Much less expensive than going to the local Ulta for it.  Works great to control my fine, frizzy summer hair.</li>
    <li> my mom loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have fine, long hair with a small bit of layering and a heavy bang.  I have so much trouble trying to find a good shampoo and conditioner that leave it feeling nice.  My husband went to NYC and brought the hotel shampoo and conditioner back to me.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with what I was currently using (I am always changing, never buying the same thing twice, spending anywhere from $2 - $20 per bottle). Anyway, wasn&#x27;t happy with whatever was currently in my shower so I started using these hotel products and was so pleased with the texture of my hair!! It also somehow seems to make my hair dry so much faster.  I hate blow-drying, so it&#x27;s a big plus for me.  I also have gotten compliments on my hair lately, which does not often happen.  My hair is shiny enough, but not too weighed down or greasy with this product.  So glad it&#x27;s on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Just got back from a Disney Cruise - this is the brand of shampoo and conditioner they use on their ships.  Love the fact that every morning I get a little whiff of the aroma of the sea - a subtle reminder of vacation.  This collection is cheaper than the products sold on the cruise ship as well ($24 for each individual bottle).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner! I first tried it at the disneyland resort and it has done wonders for my hair.I saw a difference with my hair after 2 days of using it.</li>
    <li> this should be the same product that we used at disneyland - it has the same name and is the same brand... and it smells the same... but i loved what i brought home in sample size 1000xmore than this. if it was the same would be worth the $$ but otherwise waaaaay too expensive for what it is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at the hotel for a while now with great results. Could not find it here in town so bought the 2 pack on AZ. Very concentrated, nice smell. H2O adds softness and shine. Awesome purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have EVER used………I get my hair done at the salon every week and bought this to leave there for my stylist to use when I go there…….You must try it if you have not as yet !!  Fabulous !!</li>
    <li> First time I used it was on a WD cruise. My hair and that of my girls was specially shinning and soft, the only thing that could have made a difference was the new shampoo and conditioner that the cruise line provided, from then on I have been using this product and love what it does to our hair.</li>
    <li> Stayed at Hotel Mela in New York and fell in love with this product.  Had to have it for home.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of these! The smell lingers in my bathroom so it literally smells like a spa. My friend came over and took a quick shower with my shampoo and couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it. It&#x27;s a tad pricey but a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s totally worth it! Great product!</li>
    <li> I first used this product at The Grand Californian. It not only works well with color treated hair but the smell reminds me of the Sonoma Coast where the forest meets the sea.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to these products on a Disney Cruise and loved them. I couldn&#x27;t find the product anywhere in the area…thank you Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Makes my hair shiny and soft to feel. No itchy scalp anymore. Everyone loves the smell..</li>
    <li> Got this when I was on a Disney Cruise and so glad I can get this online through Amazon. Love the smell - my hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Have used it before and it is wonderful. I will continue to use it as long as I can.</li>
    <li> LOve it Love It Love it  what else can I say.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed these on my cruise, they remind me of a lovely and much needed three days but I really can&#x27;t justify the price. I can get the same results from OTC shampoos &amp; conditioners. So for me it is a novelty if I want to take a nice quick trip down memory lane but certainly not an everyday product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the others. This is nothing like Disneyworld spas. My hair didn&#x27;t feel better for using it and the scent is not the same either. Disappointing purchase.</li>
    <li> First used this product on a Disney cruise and now I am hooked.  I love this shampoo.  I color my hair with henna and this is the only shampoo I have found that does not strip out the color!</li>
    <li> Discovered the products on a recent Disney cruise.  Just absolutely LOVE them!  Using them takes me back to the vacation.  Smells great and really makes hair shiny!</li>
    <li> I recently stayed at a hotel, which offered these products in their bathrooms, and I enjoyed using them so much, that I decided to try to find them when I got home. The amazing way my hair felt and looked, while I was on vacation, has continued now that I&#x27;m home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found several places to purchase the items, but found the Amazon prices to be the best, so I purchased thru them.  The products were just as described, and they came very quickly. I made a good choice to purchase thru Amazon!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! The smell is clean and fresh and leaves my hair feeling exactly the same way! My sister brought me a sample of both the shampoo and conditioner from a Disney cruise she went on and it quickly became my favorite!!</li>
    <li> I first discovered SPA at Disney World and loved it.  It leaves my hair (which is shoulder length) soft and silky yet still having volume.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> great smell, great for a guest bathroom</li>
    <li> I almost never review products, but this warrants the highest praise a hair care product can covet. I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s with the same healthy hair of a 22 yr old. and I spent time in my youth as a male model, I was signed by the most exclusive agencies from Paris, Milan, Miami, LA, Phoenix and NYC until I blew out my ankle playing hoops just prior to the Spring collection in Paris (sniff, can&#x27;t walk a runway in a cast). Back on point, they paid for the best of everything, including our hair and skin products which is where I developed a fondness for only quality shampoo and conditioner. On a vacation at a posh resort in Maui I tried their &amp;#34;house-brand&amp;#34; on a whim, the same one they used in their very chic Spa, H2) Plus Sea Marine. It has the most appealing scent of any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s not overly floral or &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; making it androgenous, good for both women and men, but it doesn&#x27;t over-power your perfume/cologne of choice. It washes clean, so clean in fact that I often forget to use the conditioner as my hair feels conditioned after just the wash. Use both and your hair will feel like silk, not easy to do with my ultra-dry hair type. The cost is very reasonable and comparable to the better known popular brands aka Paul Mitchell, KMS and such, but these aren&#x27;t in the same league as H20 in terms of quality. Try it once and you&#x27;ll never use another shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Always a hit at our house.  These are great spa products for the home with a nice &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; smell.  No lingering baby&amp;#34;ish&amp;#34;, sickening sweet smell that stays on your body.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product. It&#x27;s very addicting though so be careful! Once you try it you&#x27;ll never want to go back.</li>
    <li> I used H2O Plus Sea Marine shampoo and conditioner while on a Disney cruise.  Disney doesn&#x27;t do cheap!  I trusted my hair to their hair care products and all turned out well.  The shampoo was not particularly flowery nor fruity.  It was more strongly scented than the conditioner, which I didn&#x27;t notice at all, but still quite mild.  I&#x27;d say the scent was in line with the Sea Marine label and it didn&#x27;t feel watered down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner got enough tangles out of my long hair so that I could brush my hair right out of the shower without first combing it.  That&#x27;s the number one reason I condition my hair.  If it could do that, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I first tried this hair product at a B&amp;B in Monterrey CA and fell in love.  I&#x27;ve never seen it sold in a store and am so glad Amazon has it!  I love the product and the way it smells.  I see that most of the negative comments are related to the smell, if you like flowery smells this is a much more &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell and might not be your cup of tea.  Our whole family uses it and the boys especially don&#x27;t like to smell like a flower or fruit so they especially like the way this product smells.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo ever(for me)</li>
