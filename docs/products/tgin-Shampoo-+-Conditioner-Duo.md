<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> wife loves this so I guess it works her hair is very dry</li>
    <li> I love how the product smell and make my hair feel-soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Cleans and nourishes my hair I love these products.</li>
    <li> Prior to visiting amazon I heard great reviews from other naturals and was happy to see the many other positive reviews on amazon. I was however, not impressed by the product. My hair by no means was soft, the shampoo and conditioner did not work any wonders. My hair felt no different from the other shampoos and conditioners that I have used before. I had to use a lot of the conditioner to get slip so that I can easily finger detangle my hair and trust me I don&#x27;t have much- I have fine, thin collar bone length hair. After three (3) washes I was half way through the bottle. Definitely not impressed. The product gets some stars for arriving on time, smelling good and the conditioner being somewhat moisturizing.</li>
    <li> These products worked well with my collarbone length, fine, type 4 hair. The shampoo had a little slip and really cleaned my scalp but it was a bit stripping and had a hardening effect on my hair (which was really weird), but once I applied the conditioner, I fell in love. The conditioner has A LOT of slip and restores any moisture that I may have lost from using the shampoo and then some. Overall, these products work very well together. Also, after I used them, the bottles still looked completely full, so it didn&#x27;t take much product at all to get the job done and I suspect these products will last me a few months.</li>
    <li> I love the TGIN shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried other sulfate free shampoo and conditioners and my hailr was left somewhat dry and brittle. When I tried the TGIN I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and manageable it left my hair. My hair is thick and course. This product leaves my hair soft and full of moisture.</li>
    <li> I love these products!! The shampoo leaves my hair feelings soft, but with no dirt or grease! Ive got an oily scalp and dry ends but when i use this my head feels more in balance. The shampoo doesnt lather at all for me and if youve never had shampoo like that it feels like you havent cleaned your head at all, but trust me you have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im giving this four stars instead of five is because my hair tangles like mad once it gets dirty! The opposite usually happens for me but for some reason this one is different! This is also the case directly after getting out the shower. Once you completely rinse this conditioner from you hair it all sticks together and it WILL NOT want to brush!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure why this happens, but this also happened with my last conditioner(from LUSH). Both make my hair look amazing when dry.</li>
    <li> Best quality shampoo- highly recommended!</li>
    <li> gives me dandruff if i use it for one week straight</li>
    <li> Wonderful products. Makes my daughters hair clean and soft.  The fragrance is so refreshing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is EVERYTHING!! Point blank period</li>
    <li> This product feels amazing in my hair. As soon as I applied it to my dry wet hair, my tresses immediately felt softer and smoother. After my wash and condition, I could not believe how different my hair felt and looked. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this. I am a naturalist and I use this every week even on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I will be purchasing more. Thanks Amazon you rock.</li>
    <li> Very good need to be a little less in price$</li>
    <li> These products seem to do the impossible...suds and detangle, soften and smell delectable. Washing and conditioning was a breeze for my shoulder length, natural kinks. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and will likely buy again.</li>
    <li> I am transitioning into my big chop. I have 3c/4a/and some 4b hair (different textures in different areas of my head). Worked well on all three. Love the way this shampoo made my hair feel. It was soft and supple without losing any of my curl and elasticity. The conditioner was good too. However, I had to use a shower cap to &amp;#34;greenhouse&amp;#34; it in order for the conditioner to soak in properly. LOVE the smell. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this shampoo and the conditioner makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Really makes your hair shine &amp; manageable</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorite Shampoo and Conditioners. I use the conditioner mainly as a co-wash, it works well to get rid of product build up and soften my 4B/4C mid-length hair. The shampoo is moisturizing without stripping the hair. I&#x27;ve since added these two products to my wash routine in the last month, so far so good.</li>
