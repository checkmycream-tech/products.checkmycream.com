<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this deodorant</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s solid (TSA proof) But not chalky or gross to apply, does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was super cheap.  The main reason I want it is because I live in Las Vegas, but also travel to humid Mexico and you need a good antiperspirant in hot temperatures.  This one is the best! I don&#x27;t stink when I sweat and it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> Boy did I get a deal on this! Thank you Amazon! I can&#x27;t remember if it was on sale or it was a clip &amp; save coupon but I got this at a really good price. This is an awesome product! I love it. For some reason I feel like I sweat a lot and using Clinical Strength keeps me dry so I&#x27;m not always worried that my pit stink! I love that it&#x27;s a clear gel because it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t show up on my clothes, since my favorite color to wear is black! It&#x27;s definitely all day strong, because I think it&#x27;s prescription strength. I like the scent too, powder protection. I can wear this all day &amp; feel confident that I&#x27;m dry and odorless! Love it!</li>
    <li> Secret Clinical Strength is fantastic, it works just as it is described. The value on Amazon is awesome, I can often buy it with a clippable coupon for a fraction of what local retail stores charge for it.</li>
    <li> It took me weeks to figure out what this smell was. Cherry Jolly Ranchers. Is that bad? No! They smell great. So do you! It&#x27;s effective, reliable, and invisible. My only quibble is that it&#x27;s pricey compared to regular antiperspirant. But if you need some extra help (as I have post-baby), I&#x27;d try it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave lots of white residue and mostly prevents perspiration on hot humid days.</li>
    <li> Excellent deodorant.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this formula. The gel doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the others although it smells good going on it doesn&#x27;t last as long. It also take a bit for it to actually feel dry after application. I am fancy on the new dry sprays that are out.</li>
    <li> works great.  No mess.  Love the clear gel.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, awesome price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great scent and keeps you dry even during heavy exercise. It  doesn&#x27;t leave you wet after applying, either.</li>
    <li> Love the gel! Goes on clear, smells terrific and provides protection all day long. Pretty impressive considering I work in NYC!</li>
    <li> goes on great. And it came on time.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Especially like that it&#x27;s gel.  Works great.  One day I forgot to use and didn&#x27;t even notice until late in the day when I thought about it.  Never needed it the second day.  Going back to using solid because it&#x27;s a really good deal at Costco but would definitely use this again if I could get a really good deal on the price.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the gel. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the other ones.</li>
    <li> Hi! Love this deodorant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the clinical strength for awhile now. Fabulous!!  If I could give it 10 stars then I would.  I struggle with bad BO and have all my 43 years. This leaves no white stuff or wetness AND as an added bonus it smells so good. Awwsome product and aqesome price.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product really works and being able to schedule it means I won&#x27;t have to worry about running out of it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to wait for this product to go on sale somewhere anymore...</li>
    <li> Good price with coupon!</li>
    <li> Finally a gel form. My wife has to use this clinical strength deodorant. We use almost exclusively organic personal care products and food, but this is one of the few areas she can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> No as good as the solid..</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! No more stains on my daughter&#x27;s shirts</li>
    <li> As a man, I used this because it seemed to work better than most.  When I found the Gillette product, it worked a lot better.  Go with the Gillette.</li>
    <li> Got a great price. Not any better than other deodorants. And it is a gel. Used up very quickly.</li>
    <li> I rated this item as 5 stars because, it&#x27;s what my wife was looking for Great Price too..</li>
    <li> This is my first gel deodorant, and so far I really like it! Seems to last all day.</li>
    <li> Arrived in time. Item as described except it seems half empty by the time it&#x27;s cranked up enough for first use</li>
    <li> The only thing that works for me.</li>
