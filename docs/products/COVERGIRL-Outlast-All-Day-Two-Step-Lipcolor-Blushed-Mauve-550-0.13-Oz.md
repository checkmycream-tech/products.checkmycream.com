    <li> dissatisfied and would not buy again</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS SHADE! COVERGIRL OUTLAST STAYS ON ALL DAY LONG!  LUV IT !!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the color, it arrived quickly, and (wearability) it lasts for Hours!!</li>
    <li> The color is great, but the texture is really what throws this produce off for me. Once it dries on your lips and the top coat is put on, it feels great. Then, after a short amount of time, the top coat dries off and the base coat (the color coat) gets very sticky and gummy. It balls up on my lips, and just looks really bad. Probably won&#x27;t be a product I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to apply this again and again during the day.</li>
    <li> Of any product like it that I have tried, this is by far my favorite.  Color is beautiful and stays on.  It dries on so it will not smear or get on cups when you drink.  The clear gloss might, but it&#x27;s clear.</li>
    <li> I love it. I only have to put it on once. I also love the gloss. It really shines.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lipstick since it came out. It is the best, especially for the price. Easy to apply, dries quick. I was not a daily lipstick person until I found this. Apply it once, you&#x27;re good for all day. Just reapply the gloss. Two things: it can feel too dry if you are dehydrated and on the verge of chapped lips. Otherwise i think it feels fine. Plenty of colors, but you will have to try them out. I&#x27;ve found that the way it looks in the tube is slightly different on my lips.</li>
    <li> I really love it! It stays all day and its amazing! Great price and great product! I want more colors! Good luck! Better than lipstick because it doesnt get on teeth and doesnt come off when eating!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is not quite but nearly my HG color. As always, Outlast does just that: it lasts. Doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out, either.</li>
    <li> Best lip stain ever purchased,  fast shipped.</li>
    <li> It looked more purple than it is. Its pretty bland, almost a rust color.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Good price and easier than trying to locate this color in a store</li>
