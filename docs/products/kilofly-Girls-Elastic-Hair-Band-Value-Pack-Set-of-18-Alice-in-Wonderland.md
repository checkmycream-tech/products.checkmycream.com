    <li> Lovee it!!!!! GO get it for your little princess. Sturdy, well made and simply beautiful.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Some of them came already damaged. I know it is cheap, but was expecting something better...</li>
    <li> There are a couple of problems with these bands.  First of all, they are advertised for children - but they are very, very (did I say very?) long.  They are longer than adult bands.  You have to hold your child (in my case, toddler) for a long time while you wrap this band around and around and around their fine hair.  Those of you with little kids will know that that&#x27;s a major problem.  Secondly, they are of really bad quality.  After trying to wear one of the bands for a day or two, the flower part had already broken off from the band because the glue did not hold.  Just don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> VERY cute! But two pieces arrived unglued and Needed fixing in order to use.</li>
    <li> They are cute from afar. Most of the attachments are way too big for a little girl&#x27;s head.  My 4yo looks silly with most of these on as they are that big.  Other plastics pieces look cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the, again</li>
    <li> Very cute but one of them fell apart today. I hope they don&#x27;t all fall apart after a single wear.</li>
    <li> It soo beautiful!  I hope my daughter it gonna be love it!</li>
    <li> These are REALLY cute, but don&#x27;t stay in very well for fine hair.</li>
    <li> The quality of the hair band is very good .&lt;br /&gt;Its a good value pack to buy  and will fit from toddlers to girls .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great to gift as well</li>
    <li> Cute but for thicker hair. Can not use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews, however these were just awful.  The elastics were too long, they don&#x27;t look as nice in person and are cheaply made.  I would not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Pretty set!  It has all duplicate pairs for matching ponytails.  Hard to find that type of product.  I always have to buy two sets of everything.  These are nicely made and nice quality.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These hair accesories looks great in my babies hair</li>
    <li> Really cute and soft. Great for little girls with fine hair. Good assortment.</li>
    <li> poorly made. some of the bands was already damaged when i open the package. not worth the money</li>
    <li> Dis:&lt;br /&gt;1-The colors are very different than the pictuer.&lt;br /&gt;2- Some of the flowers fall out before even using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advan:&lt;br /&gt;1- Cute&lt;br /&gt;2- Variety of colors</li>
    <li> Although these are very cute they do not and will not last. After using them once the flower falls off. Every single one is in garbage land because they all fell apart.</li>
    <li> Beautiful designs! Very unique product, I will surely order again when you come out with new designs👌</li>
    <li> Cute but I didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t get all of them.</li>
