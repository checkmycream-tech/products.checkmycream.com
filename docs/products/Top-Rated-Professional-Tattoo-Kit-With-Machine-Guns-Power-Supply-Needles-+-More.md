      <li>Kit works great to practice do not use the ink on skin only to PRACTICE on  fake skin etc.</li>
      <li>Peddle is cheap and you have to mess with it to work properly.</li>
      <li>1 pack of the inks had a blue and a green and a gray ink that exploded in the pack but that is fine because it was just starter ink</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this Professional tattoo kit.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t recommend using them for long periods of time since they heat up, also I suggest getting plastic tubes since these ones are super heavy.</li>

    <li> I just got my Tattoo kit today and when i opened it the power supply was broken but other than that, it is a nice kit</li>
    <li> Already have almost a whole sleeve done.I&#x27;ve never done a tattoo before this but it looks and works great.I got way more than I was expecting and will definetly order through them again!you could easily make your money back and then some with this.</li>
    <li> Great product, don&#x27;t use the ink on real skin tho, horrid ink, the machines are nice but I don&#x27;t recommend using them for long periods of time since they heat up, also I suggest getting plastic tubes since these ones are super heavy.</li>
    <li> Shader machine don&#x27;t work everything else is ok not bad at all u see , tattoos everything good .. H</li>
    <li> Not using Amazon before I was skeptical on if I was going to be throwing away money but this was exactly what was expected, everything was nicely package and arrived undamaged. I&#x27;ll be definitely be recommending.</li>
    <li> consider yes, but case is plastic not sturdy and ink in side was leaking out of containers. need more gloves only came with two pairs.</li>
    <li> The kit is good the only thing was when it got here three of the inks had busted and got all over the other inks it was white olive and light green</li>
    <li> the machines and case are okay but the ink is horrible!! you have to push so deep to make the ink stay that it actually bleeds out under your skin! if you like the kit purchase a different brand of ink.</li>
    <li> Everything was in excellent condition. The tattoo machines work great. !! I love it.</li>
    <li> Definitely a pro-package including an exclusive instructional video by one of the tattoo masters. I am impressed and very happy with my purchase Ty.</li>
    <li> DVD didn&#x27;t work but I looked on youtube, I do wish it came with more gloves and stencil paper, but it&#x27;s still good. I&#x27;ve done two tattoos on myself and they came out great, I was a total newbie and taught myself on the practice skins.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Great company to buy from!</li>
    <li> The green ink was busted open, it leaked everywhere. :/</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping came as described I love it and it works great. Would buy it all over again if I had to.</li>
    <li> Everything was as described by seller. Everything works very well and easy to use. 1 pack of the inks had a blue and a green and a gray ink that exploded in the pack but that is fine because it was just starter ink and it may have happened during shipping.The ink was contained in the bag in which it was wrapped so it didn&#x27;t get on everything. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> DVD in Chinese and not really informing. ...unless you speak Chinese</li>
    <li> Its was vary good the only bad thing was maybe some more stencles. I like the practise pads vaery much</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> I bought this for one of my sons. All three of them loved it, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be purchasing another!</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as described! The only problem was the video which has music on the background instead the person explaining plus the subtitles are not in English, not a big deal though, you can find anywhere on you tube the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; from attaching the machine to tattooing .I got the kit this morning which was estimated to be here only next week! I was so excited, I already got 2 tats done. I really love it!</li>
    <li> Garbage...Please do not waste money on this and spend more for decent machine and more for quality.</li>
    <li> This set came with everything needed. Everything was packaged properly, and the materials were all good. Everything worked as supposed to, no problems with anything. Good set for the price  definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> nice kit for the money.</li>
    <li> Great kit a  must have, if you are a beginner or a pro at tattooing this is a must have.</li>
    <li> It works very good my husband loves it he&#x27;s a beginner but he did very well for his first time tattoo we will be ordering more things frm here</li>
    <li> perfect in every way no problems</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Son and he loves it! I would definitely recommend this Professional tattoo kit. Comes with a DVD.</li>
    <li> For the cheap price it works to practice. Peddle is cheap and you have to mess with it to work properly. Kit works great to practice do not use the ink on skin only to PRACTICE on  fake skin etc. Buy good ink to use on real skin.</li>
    <li> Excellet, i&#x27;m happy with the product!</li>
    <li> DVD is no good...ink is no good... Transfer paper no good...  One of the guns didn&#x27;t work... Not the best ....</li>
    <li> My inks had three broken and one of my guns won&#x27;t run. I don&#x27;t want to return it Because.I&#x27;ve used my other gun and thrown out the inks I would like a replAcement gun and inks</li>
