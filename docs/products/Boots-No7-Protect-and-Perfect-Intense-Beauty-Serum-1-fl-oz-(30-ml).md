<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have heard about this particular serum on a number of TV shows discussing beauty options and skin care.  I decided to try it since I had just coincidentally bought the mature skin day and night creams at Target.  I love it.  It has definitely made my skin appear softer and the fine lines softer.  I am 60 years old, fair skin with only fine lines - no deep wrinkles - this is a wonderful addition to my daily skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> The issue I have with this product is that it only come in a 1 fl ounce size which is not enough-I prefer to buy a larger size that will last a month and not a week without the hassle of re-ordering so often-I won&#x27;t purchase No7 in the future unless they can come up with a larger amount.  (especially if your covering your whole face and neck) 1 ounce just won&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Decided to try this given it&#x27;s the current &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34;, but very disappointed.  For the price and moisturizing quality, it&#x27;s definitely not as good as Olay&#x27;s Regenerist Serum - still haven&#x27;t found anything better than OoO!</li>
    <li> Really like this and ha definitely noticed a difference. On my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> non irritating and moisturizing.. seems to work well.. nothing spectacular</li>
    <li> Really nice serum and believe I DO see a difference. Have to purchase more now.</li>
    <li> The product had a subtle scent to it.  I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all without putting my nose super close to it. It did have a very chemically smell though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum felt very nice and creamy.  I smoothed into my face nicely.  It didn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing though which is my number one thing to look for in facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I didn&#x27;t care too much for was, without thinking, I stuck my hand under the faucet.  The product that was still on my hand was super hard to get off with just water.  It had the same effect as an oil, most similar to coconut oil.  I totally did not expect that and it kind of turned me off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I didn&#x27;t care too much for this product.  But, in it&#x27;s defense, I have no use for a product of this nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully!!  So silky!  My skin is definitely better than ever!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, evenly and make up is so easy to apply on top. No irritation at all.</li>
    <li> I do love this!  Seems to be more effective than Olay Serum and about the same price.</li>
    <li> I  really  like it  but it is  too  costly  for me  to  continue  using it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it EVERY day &amp; night</li>
    <li> I had seen this with one of my friends and she recommended it. So far, I am very happy with it.  It makes my face and neck feel tighter.</li>
    <li> I gave it a four because I gave a little to my mom to try and within a week of using it mine does not have any left in the bottle, the bottle is white so you cannot tell how much is in it and it should have lasted longer than a week, when I said I gave my mom a little I mean a little, other than that I love the way it makes my face fell and I don&#x27;t have to put on any other kind moisturizer.  I will try it one more time and let you know if this was a fluk</li>
    <li> Feels good but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with my skin</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel like silk. Really like this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I heard this was a great product, and I like it. No heavy chemical smell and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I am a beauty advisor at Walgreens and we sell allot of this product. Make sure when you are purchasing these products that you come in and speak to someone so that we can tell you if it&#x27;s the right product for you. Buying it at Target you have no one that is trained in these products to recommend the right one. It is hypoallergenic but it also has fragrance so if you have sensitive skin it may cause you to break out. I have rosacea so I cannot use No. 7, but Boots has an organic line and a line for sensitive skin ( Botanics &amp; Expert) that will also work for you. So shop at Walgreens for your Boots product, we have trained experts to help you!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product works very well, my skin is so much better when used regularly.</li>
    <li> i did try this product....infact i use it everydayor everytime i wear makeup , which is a few times a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dont know what to look for ! i do not happen to notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I have highly reactive sensitive skin but really like this product.  I need to use it more sparingly as I went through the entire bottle in about two months but I do think it was helping with skin tone and texture.  I did not realize that I was out of it either until it was gone as the bottle does not show the contents from the outside.</li>
    <li> Super product &amp; fabulous way to get it rather than battle Target which usually runs out before I get there!!</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t get the hype here.  I&#x27;m almost finished with the bottle.  I&#x27;ve used it day and night and nothing!  Back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the entire Boots product line. I like to use the beauty serum in combination with moisturizer after washing my face in the morning. One bottle lasts a long time (around three months for me with daily use). There is no scent and it goes on smooth without feeling greasy. I don&#x27;t know that it really improves the youthfulness of my skin but it feels great to apply and wear, plus I think it helps my makeup to last a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> So far I like it on my skin. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good product, time will tell.</li>
    <li> It is a great product.I have sensative skin and so far its working for me. My skin is becoming very smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! So nice when something works like it says it will!!</li>
    <li> The best on the market for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable.  I&#x27;ve never used a product that makes my skin so smooth!</li>
    <li> I am try my third bottle seems to be working well so far</li>
    <li> This product is better than it even claims to be.  Within just a few days I saw a noticeable improvement in the tone and texture of my skin, and I plan to reorder and keep using it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this product and Amazon&#x27;s fantastic price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product</li>
    <li> It was just OK not brilliant and it seemed to run out very quickly almost as if it was not full to begin with.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I have used..I have purchased many..even lancome. ..saw a great improvement  in texture of my skin...</li>
    <li> very smooth, foundation makeup applies well over it</li>
    <li> I really like it but I consider a serum to be different than a moisturizer. This is the consistency of a moisturizer not a serum but it works really well for me. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Silky, not greasy moisturizer - velvety feel - excellent!</li>
    <li> I love this but my pump broke when the bottle had only been used twice. Couldn&#x27;t figure how to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; so I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderfully</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this line.....LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Smooth and silky going on.</li>
    <li> Nice cream...too soon to really tell if effects are worth the price...but so far so good</li>
    <li> It was for the wife so im not sure about this item.</li>
    <li> Great product! You notice a difference in your skin in two weeks time. It&#x27;s light and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Have noticed a difference in my forehead I will defiantly buy this product again when it runs out?</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I have found so far and I have tryed many diffrent ones that were a lot more expensive then this one. After a very short period I&#x27;m already noticing a diffrence in fine lines &amp; wrinkles. I&#x27;m hooked!!!</li>
    <li> Wear under sun protection to keep facial skin supple and wash it off at night.  Works well.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Dd not see any great improvement in skin or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> boots says see results in 4 weeks,week 3 wrinkles seem softer,my skin feels great!im 53 and should have kept up but did not,this product is helping,downside must use 5 or6 pumps so go through it quick,all in all love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product &amp; Works Well. Spreads well... The best I have used to date.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase and I WOULD not , but for GRL Discoveries to say it does not contain parabens, maybe doesn&#x27;t know what that is because it contains  FIVE (5) types of PARABEN.</li>
    <li> The bottle came with the sprayer broken</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. Got a chemical burn on my eyelids. Red and puffy. It was the only thing I did differently in my skin care routine. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a year love it, can really tell the difference when you stop. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great product, already reordered.</li>
    <li> Its really too early to see the results but it feels good</li>
    <li> You can spend a ton of money on expensive products and not get the results of any boot 7 product. This product works. Trust me I&#x27;ve bought it all.</li>

    <li> Generally Boots #7 seem to get great reviews so I decided to give this one a try.  This serum may work well on most people however not me. Within a day of trying this my skin broke out.  I quit using the serum and my skin recovered.</li>
    <li> Works as well as most</li>
    <li> Boots No.7 work fairly well. No smell so that&#x27;s nice. I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few weeks. I&#x27;m more of s naturalist so it was a big deal for me to use a product I didn&#x27;t put together. Overall I like it and will give it a full use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum a few weeks now and it is wonderful! It is very luxurious and silky and leaves my skin perfectly moisturized! I have been using the same brand for 24-years and this was a good change for me! I will try other items in the line!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 57 and I had a noticeable difference in my skins appearance and texture after just 2 weeks! I will continue to use it and plan to purchase the complete line.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, BUT....it comes in a bottle that you can not see through. It was a good size bottle so imagine my shock when all of a sudden it was gone...in a very short period of time. I use very little at a time and this bottle and it should have lasted much longer!</li>
    <li> I apply this product twice a day as directed.  I am 60 years old and that is sufficient for me:)</li>
    <li> Really like the non greasy feel to it makes my skin fell wonderful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a good moisturizers and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot . I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I use this product at the outer corners of my eyes, across my forehead, and along the laugh lines of my cheeks. I apply it morning and night before my regular facial moisturizer. It seems to penetrate into these deep wrinkles better than my usual moisturizers, and I intend to reorder!</li>
    <li> It feels silky smooth and absolutely glides on!  I have been very happy with the results as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It goes on smooth and the price is very affordable! It is hard to find in stores so I bought it on Amazon!</li>
