      <li>Very manly scent, seductive, price was great.  </li>

      <li>and I love the fragrance on him.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a soap.</li>
      <li>Never had so many compliments on a cologne as I do with this.</li>
      <li>love the smell, and i get compliments about it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That is a pretty darn good example of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly one of the most unique scents I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
      <li>Anyway, the price is great and you could try and see personal results.</li>
      <li>Originally, I was going to order something else, but now, no.</li>
      <li>Like others, i was a bit suspicious if this was the original fragrance...</li>
      <li>This perfume doesn&#x27;t smell like original one.</li>
      <li>I really cant think of a better way to describe the aroma it gives off.</li>
      <li>i will surely buy more ferragamo fragances in the future.</li>
      <li>I love fresh clean scents such as Burberry Brit, D&amp;G LB, Versace, KC Reaction, etc., and this is a VERY fresh scent, but doesn&#x27;t have that clean smell.</li>
      <li>it worth the risk of spending 25$,</li>

      <li>I love this fragance, but its longevity is not as much as I expected.</li>
      <li>Thanks for getting the spray to me fast.</li>
      <li>has a very sophisticated scent and a long lasting action.</li>
      <li>An old girlfriend bought me this and paid 50.00 at Macy&#x27;s for this!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I am commenting on a purchase from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT purchase this cologne, it is a waste of money, even it was</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that is good or bad, FYI.  </li>

<li> I was little bit suspicious but when this perfume is long time out of regular stores.</li>
<li> and I recommend it widely</li>
<li> They won&#x27;t be closed tight together.</li>
<li> Instead, as another reviewer stated, it like getting off of a small plane on a small island in the ocean.</li>
<li> Sadly it is really hard to get one as Ferragamo discontinued it.&lt;br</li>
<li> i saw it on amazon i though it was a fake, but realized that for this piece of art</li>
<li> well i wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all!</li>
<li> I was very very disappointed</li>

    <li> I love this fragance, but its longevity is not as much as I expected. Same problem I saw in Essenza by Zegna. Anyway, the price is great and you could try and see personal results.</li>
    <li> Warm scent ! Good for daytime</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance for it has a very sophisticated scent and a long lasting action. I like to use it on a daily basis to work and play alike. Very good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!! Thanks for getting the spray to me fast. The smell of this stuff is just awesome!  Will order it again!</li>
    <li> This is what I ordered. I was little bit suspicious but when this perfume is long time out of regular stores. But when I received it I was so happy.</li>
    <li> My favorite Cologne!&lt;br /&gt;This is a superb fragrance, my all time favorite. Sadly it is really hard to get one as Ferragamo discontinued it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has stock an unbeatable price on this so I went and order two.</li>
    <li> Like others, i was a bit suspicious if this was the original fragrance... I had it 3 years ago as a Christmas gift from a cousin, some months later the bottle broke and well, that&#x27;s my story with these perfect heaven-smelling fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i saw it on amazon i though it was a fake, but realized that for this piece of art it worth the risk of spending 25$, well i wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all! It is the original and it continue smelling nice, so if you are in the doubt zone get out of there and just buy it!</li>
    <li> excellent product and I recommend it widely Original Premium hopefully make future purchase of a similar item or better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks greetings</li>
    <li> love the smell, and i get compliments about it. i will surely buy more ferragamo fragances in the future.</li>
    <li> Awesome, cheap price, good stuff, smells great</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the quality of this product, since the cap and the bottle was separated. They won&#x27;t be closed tight together. Originally, I was going to order something else, but now, no.</li>
    <li> I love the essence on this perfume, the smell of cedar is sensational and it is one of my favorite. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Never had so many compliments on a cologne as I do with this. An old girlfriend bought me this and paid 50.00 at Macy&#x27;s for this!</li>
    <li> smell cheap,&lt;br /&gt;not recommended</li>
    <li> This is the first time I am commenting on a purchase from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT purchase this cologne, it is a waste of money, even it was&lt;br /&gt;$2.00 stay away. The cologne arrived in a sealed package, I opened the&lt;br /&gt;box and sprayed the cologne on my hands and wrist the fragrance lasted fot&lt;br /&gt;20 seconds and than there was no smell....I was very very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell bought two</li>
    <li> Very manly scent, seductive, price was great.  Would recommend for the gentlemen as well as the ladies to get for their man to be smelling great/</li>
    <li> This perfume doesn&#x27;t smell like original one. It&#x27;s more like a soap. Anyway for this price you won&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and I love the fragrance on him. It came with original packaging, looked like straight from the store.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer said:  \\&quot;It reminds me the smell of the mediterranean lands and shores, the palms and tangerines, as well the cedar and the aromatic herbs you find only in that region. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is a pretty darn good example of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly one of the most unique scents I&#x27;ve ever worn. I wouldn&#x27;t say that is good or bad, FYI.  I love fresh clean scents such as Burberry Brit, D&amp;G LB, Versace, KC Reaction, etc., and this is a VERY fresh scent, but doesn&#x27;t have that clean smell. Instead, as another reviewer stated, it like getting off of a small plane on a small island in the ocean. It has a minty top note with mild leather / woodsy mid and deep notes. I really cant think of a better way to describe the aroma it gives off. If you want something like nothing else anyone wears, this is the scent to buy!</li>
