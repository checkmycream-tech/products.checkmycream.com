      <li>If you are familiar with stamping and/or possess proficient nail art skills then this product may be great for you, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for beginners</li>
      <li>Sinful Colors Polish is the best out of the ones that I own so far.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like because its cheap, and product does not work good, the price is good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>and it seems ok for the price.  </li>
      <li>I love these.</li>

      <li>Easy storage-</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really easy to scrape with.  </li>
      <li>but they seem fine to me.</li>
      <li>and I think once I practice the technique I will be able to make some fun designs.</li>
      <li>so I was browsing Amazon to see what was available and came across these stamping plates.</li>
      <li>cute stencils and fun to use</li>
      <li>but once you get the hang of it they really are nice.</li>
      <li>Overall it was a great buy</li>
      <li>As others suggested, we purchased a cheap pocket photo album to keep the disks in.</li>
      <li>Love them they are so much fun</li>
      <li>The designs are very cute,and most of them stamp on pretty nicely.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> another gift and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try  this. I have become obsessed with anything nail related. I played with  this for about 2 hours before settling on a design. And I love the different plates there are so many options .</li>
    <li> This set is really cool. I saw a lot of nail art videos that used this device but I can&#x27;t help but wonder if they used different nail polish because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working very well for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Some of the stamps do not transfer</li>
    <li> These actually work very well. Took another persons advice and put each plate in it&#x27;s own ziplock baggie for protection from scratches.</li>
    <li> So far the stamper is okay. Remember to clean the nail plate every time you use the stamper to pick up the design. I do not use the scarper, instead I use a plastic card.</li>
    <li> I just received it in the mail today and it was a lot smaller than I thought, I had watched some youtube nail tutorials on the konad stamp sets and those plates looked a lot bigger...I though these were going to be similar in size but maybe it&#x27;s just the camera angle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the width and the length of the product is slightly smaller than the width of an adult palm with the length from the bottom of your palm to about where the knuckle line is on your fingers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, before I go on to the pros and cons, just wanted to mention that this is my first stamp kit so basically a first impression and I&#x27;m not comparing the quality in my head to any other kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;nice plates- the set comes with 10 with a variety from flowers to stars to french tips (NOTE: most of the design are relatively small with a few large one spread out the plates)&lt;br /&gt;stamp- the stamp picks up the image well when you clean it after a few uses&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean-there&#x27;s really no mess or hassle consider how much you&#x27;re doing, nail polish remover easily removes everything and leaves no traces of residue on the plates&lt;br /&gt;stamped nail art dries super quickly, if you wanted you could probably put on a topcoat just 30 seconds after you applied the stamp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;Plates- I wish that I got a plate that had a full nail design&lt;br /&gt;stamp- difficult to roll on the edge of the sides of your nails due to the size of the stamper, it&#x27;s a little stiff so hard to aim perfectly if you want all of your nails identical&lt;br /&gt;scraper: DO NOT USE THIS SCRAPER- this is probably what docked this product the stars...it&#x27;s just slides the nailpolish around and makes a mess...suggestion: use a giftcard from target or walmart that&#x27;s sturdy and you have a perfect scraper...don&#x27;t use a credit card b/c it tends to be more flimsy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Easy storage- I used ten cheap sandwich bags with no zipper and put each plate into a separate one to prevent them from scratching each other, then I stuff all 10 into a ziploc bag with a zipper and also the stamp and my giftcard scraper, then I just put it in my bin along with all my other nail polish products, next time you want to use it, everything&#x27;s already there and you don&#x27;t have to search for anything</li>
    <li> So happy can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> This is the first stamping kit I&#x27;ve ever ordered and or used so I&#x27;m happy for the small price of the kit.  What I&#x27;m not happy about is that in the small amount of plates I got (10), I managed to get a duplicate.  Its a little ridiculous how they couldn&#x27;t mix up 10 plates.  I&#x27;m glad I only spent the money on the ten plate kit and not the 30 plate kit.  I&#x27;ve used it once and it seems ok for the price.  The designs aren&#x27;t exactly wonderful, but for a beginner they are a good practice.  Basically, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Somehow I recived two of the same flower plate in the package.. But it&#x27;s a nice plate so it&#x27;s ok... Instead of using the included scrapper I used an old credit card because the scrapper they provided was damaging the plate... Overall it was a great buy.... I did have to practice several times to get the right consistancy of the stamp.</li>
    <li> Works as awesome as the pricey ones I bought n took 4 days yuuup fast delivery :-).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to buy the special stomp nail polished as well if you don&#x27;t have any you don&#x27;t waste your time  waiting for it 2 .&lt;br /&gt;N buy a liquid glue :-D</li>
    <li> I am terribly disappointed in this product. I read reviews before and after I purchased it, and for the most part everyone&#x27;s complaint was the stamper itself. For me, it&#x27;s both. The plates arrived all scratched up. The indentions are not deep enough, so once you scrape off the polish- you literally take every bit of it off. The stamper is no good either :( I order a lot from Amazon, and this is the second time I&#x27;ve received merchandise of bad quality. Unfortunately, I have discarded the packaging, so I am unable to even attempt to return this (which I don&#x27;t enjoy doing) and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a &amp;#34;Contact Seller&amp;#34; button next to the item, so I had no choice but to leave this comment out in the open to where everyone can read it :( I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one, or this product is just of bad quality in general, but I am less than thrilled! Although very inexpensive- complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works good. My three year old loves it when I do her nails. My only complaint is that the metal scrapper is tricky to use. Other than that, it gets the job done!!</li>
    <li> I just got this set today and am very pleased with it. I&#x27;ve been wanting a stamper, but didn&#x27;t want to spend much money to find out if I like it or not so I ordered the 10 plate set. The package was open upon arrival. The side seam split open and the stamper was floating around the package. Nothing was damaged and I am pretty sure nothing was used since the blue film was still on all of the plates. I immediately had to try it. I love it! I took the suggestion of others and used an old gift card and it works great that way. the stamper could be a little softer, but it does just fine. I did 3 test stamps on paper before trying my nail. The desings came out nice and clear so I went to work on my hand to practice a little. The designs were clear there, too. I just need a little practice on lining up the designs to get them straight. That&#x27;s a user issue, not a product issue. No duplicate plates, either,. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy. Took off a star simply because the package was open and the stamper wasn&#x27;t as soft as I was expecting. This is my first experience with a stamper so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> Item came quickly. Can&#x27;t wait to use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product and now I am a little disappointed. It is really hard to get a good result from this product, I tried to use some times and in all times I used it toke me 4 to 5 attempts to get a regular result with some failures in the design.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using and see if with more practice it gets better.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it less stars. The designs are too small and they are not cut deep enough which leads to abe awfull transfer</li>
    <li> The item was great and arriving time was excellent.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, and was as advertised. I bought this item as my daughter is interested in nail art. We tried it once, as soon as it arrived and it was not as easy as the you tube videos show. She needs practice to become good at this. The product is perfectly fine though, although the etchings could have been indented a little more deeper.</li>
    <li> Plates engravings are much too shallow, not to mention the fact that the edges are extremely sharp! I sliced my finger wide open just handling the plates! Needless to say I&#x27;m not a fan of these and I just got them yesterday!... Ugh! :(</li>
    <li> The stamps are nice the stamper a bit on the small side</li>
    <li> I tried everything other reviewers suggested, sanding the top of the stamper lightly, cleaning thoroughly, changing nail polishes, everything...it wont work right, my daughter is very disappointed. I purchased the nail dotting tools and they are fabulous, should have just stayed with them in the first place.</li>
    <li> Just ok! I purchased the 10 plate kit, the designs are nice, they are very small though, NOT for the whole nail....price is good, works ok but I would not recommend it because the designs are not carved deep enough, so you can&#x27;t really appreciate the art.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why there are such high ratings for this item. It is such a piece of crap and waste of money. The grooves in the plates for the designs are not deep enough. When you go to use the scraper all of the nail polish including the polish in the grooves gets removed. I&#x27;ve tried different types of nail polish and I&#x27;ve tried even using an old credit card as a scraper. They don&#x27;t work; don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I received the nail art stamping kit today. It is nice</li>
    <li> great kit I am very happy with the plates.  I did not get any duplicate plates and I love all the designs  great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Plates are not carved deep enough. The designs are tiny and do not transfer.. and they do transfer, you can barely see it on the nail. Buy something better.</li>
    <li> Well I used it and it did not work I tried it once and it did work but only once I&#x27;m not sure if it works I think it does only with the right nail polish</li>
    <li> nice, although it arrived late, because of snow, I love it</li>
    <li> Very good high quality</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the templates but needed the stamp. The scraper did not work well for me at all. I definitely recommend using an old plastic gift card to scrape because it works very well. The stamp works great though.</li>
    <li> The rubber stamp does not work, therefore it renders the product unusable.</li>
    <li> Great beginners kit. Variety of designs included is nice. Having the right type of polish is crucial</li>
    <li> It came to us used and all messed up. It&#x27;s sharp so be careful holding it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently decided to try  stamping so I was browsing Amazon to see what was available and came across these stamping plates. So I decided to purchase the 100 plate set and try them out. I figured for the price it was worth trying. I&#x27;ve seen other plates from other companies and they are kinda pricey so I thought I would try these first. They came in the mail pretty fast my boyfriend is a prime member though so if ordering through regular free shipping might take longer. The only little gripe I have is the bag the plates were in had broke so they were all over the box but they come with protective plastic on them and they probably came out during shipping so won&#x27;t affect my review. The plates are great so many designs to choose from and so far are stamping great! Now I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to yet but they seem fine to me. I think maybe they were konad plates that weren&#x27;t etched deep enough or because they are so sharp on the edges they were rejected because on one of the plates there is the word konad that you can stamp on your nails. Not sure but why would that be on there if they were not intended to be sold by konad, like I said the edges are very sharp so be careful when handling them. The stamper is not the best but it does work on some of the designs usually the smaller ones I also like others ordered the konad double sided stamper and like others did not bother with the included scraper but use old gift cards. All in all I totally love these plates hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> Stamper is too hard and firm images doesn&#x27;t pick up</li>
    <li> Plates got scratched on first day.All plates having floral designs only.No variety in designs.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick. Posted a pic of the plates for the 10 pack. It was straightforward to use, however there seems to be a bit of a learning curve as to how much to scrape off and how much pressure you need to transfer the design on the stamp without messing up the design. Also, the designs on the plates seem a little shallow to me... It was tricky to get just enough polish to transfer to the pad. The bigger the design, the easier to transfer.  I will probably purchase plates from another brand to compare, but overall a it is a reasonably cheap intro to stamping.</li>
    <li> UGh..What can I say. I guess I expected more from this kit. The designs are very cute,and most of them stamp on pretty nicely. But others don&#x27;t for some reason. I&#x27;ve seen ppl use a similar kit and they stamp the design very,VERY nicely but mine aren&#x27;t working like expected . I honestly don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the kit or if it&#x27;s just me doing something wrong.  :/&lt;br /&gt;Now, that&#x27;s the least of my problems. Im going to tell you the BIGGEST PROBLEM for me :&lt;br /&gt;The edges on these things are VERY sharp! After doing my 7 year Old&#x27;s nails (2 days ago), I told her to help me clean the discs . Gave her a cotton ball with acetone and all of the sudden she shrieks! One of the discs cut her finger and began bleeding! THAT is a huge problem for me! And should be for you too if you have young girly - girls who want cute nails . Although,  I should have known this could happen.  As soon as I took the plastic off the discs I noticed they were very sharp! I won&#x27;t return because the kit was very cheap and I don&#x27;t want to pay shipping to return these things.  But, I won&#x27;t buy anything from this brand or seller again. It really ticks me off that someone would look past a potential safety hazard and still sell their product. I  guess I&#x27;ll go for the $30 Kit @the mall.</li>
    <li> It works great, i enjoy doing my nails and so do my daughter! I like the pink end better then the white one&#x27;s it grabs better and the white one grabs a bit and dosnt even stamp on! Great stamper I really recommend it and the price is awesome 10 plates and the stamper and the swiping thingy lol for about $6-$7 cant complain!</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this product..but it didn&#x27;t quite work as well as I&#x27;d like. But i feel like it&#x27;s because of the bad quality nail polish that I&#x27;m using. so I&#x27;m excited to try it with different kind of nail polish.</li>
    <li> Terrible. No matter what polish I use, the designs seem to come out very faded. Not sure if it&#x27;s cheapy rubber stamp or user error. Don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> i was soooo hoping for this in the mail but got little disappointed when the art is not sticking in my nails. i tried different polish but the design doesn&#x27;t stay in the stamp, i read somewhere the polish has to be thick, hope i can find one that fits the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;In the other hand, love the design it has, many options to choose :D</li>
    <li> Huge pain to use and many of the discs were scratched. The edges of the disks are sharp enough to cut yourself</li>
    <li> The pictures are not raised. They are just discs with stencils painted on. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> The scraper that came with the kit doesn&#x27;t work great. A friend recommended using an old gift card, which works much better. Several of the designs are really similar, but not exactly the same.</li>
    <li> The stamper picks up the images and the plates work.</li>
    <li> this is definetly an easy way how to make a simple desing.  just paint your nail with a color base, any color , choose white or any other that you prefer and print it.&lt;br /&gt;Keep a cotton with polish remover and a dry towel so you can clean the plate and the stamper after every nail application.  Clean it and dry it so you can get the paint stick to the aplicator again.&lt;br /&gt;First time I couldn&#x27;t do it but then I learn, so be patient... you can also find internet videos that teach you how.</li>
    <li> Small. Everything is small. You have to be quick, because the polish dries fast.</li>
    <li> This is my first time with a plate stamping set. I like it it a lot. I have used 5 designs already. There&#x27;s 3 plates with french tip designs that I doubt I&#x27;ll use but just two of them. One was like tiger stripes and it wasn&#x27;t deep enough to take on the polish, even when I used 2 different types. The flowers all work well. Still have to practice more on how to position them on my nail. I would recommend these for a beginner.</li>
    <li> I use OPI nail polish to do. The plate hold the poslish but not much but this is the first try.&lt;br /&gt;Ok with the price</li>
    <li> Love them they are so much fun</li>
    <li> i got a new stamper because this one is much to hard but the plates are good i suggest the pueen squishy stamper its kind of small but works wonders u just have to get the pressure</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hit or miss. Polish dries too quickly and doesn&#x27;t transfer to the stamper. I wasted so much nail polish just to try the designs. I should have gotten the other brand.</li>
    <li> great and easy to use!!!</li>
    <li> Good product, and delivery time.</li>
    <li> I love it, there&#x27;s a lot of figures that you can be creative with, the stamp is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works great and it&#x27;s simple</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected some of the designs don&#x27;t even work, the stamp refuses to print the art</li>
    <li> I got this today and have tried this give times already and can get the hang of it!! I&#x27;m thinking I never will. I watched videos on how to do this stamped at but it&#x27;s just not working for me. Anyone have any tips out there let me know. I will keep trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery. Kit is exactly as described and probably works great, I just can&#x27;t do it yet.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great starter pack for trying nail stamping. i was able to get the swing of it after only a few tries. The stamper is small, but works just fine.</li>
    <li> I had seen this on many Instagram posts so I decided to try it out. As others have mentioned, the stamp is not the best although it is manageable. I have made multiple designs using the included stamper just make sure to work fast! Also not all nail polishes work with this product. The thicker the better! The scraper is horrible. No need to spend extra money on one of those though, I suggest using an old credit or gift card. That will work just fine!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get the design to transfer successfuly</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and great for a beginner. I use an old gift card as a scraper since I read the metal scraper scratches the plates. I also filed the stamper and cleaned it with acetone before using. DO NOT USE ACETONE ON THE PLATES, it makes them streaky!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like because its cheap, and product does not work good, the price is good.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend for me not work.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a 11 yr old as a Christmas present.  They arrived in a timely manner.  The young lady had a blast the first week changing designs.  As others suggested, we purchased a cheap pocket photo album to keep the disks in. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Doesnt even work like it says its supposed to. Wasted my money on nothing.</li>
    <li> ordered many sets, my friends love them, they make great gifts</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to troll, but This product was not useful for my mother. Maybe because she did not have a good nails paint like Konad. She had to use a ceramic paint than use in foamy.</li>
    <li> It was a great buy. Really happy with my purchase. You just have to take the blue flim off and start stamping you polish away. Usually one of the stamp plates cost about 5bucks. This deal was totally worth the price. Highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s into nail designs.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because my 11 year old REALLY wanted it.  It&#x27;s nice enough quality but it doesn&#x27;t actually work.  It was a totally waste of money as she can&#x27;t use it.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s even a way we could get it to work.  We tried several different types of polishes and worked as quickly as possible but no dice.  She was so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT IT THEN BOUGHT NAIL POLISH FOR IT CUZ THE NAIL POLISH I GOT DIDNT WORK AND IT STILL WIPED OFF ALL THE NAIL POLISH THINKING IT WOULD WORK BUT IT DOSENT.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I got 2 sets for my two girls.  The first was the 10 plate and the other was the 30 plate set.  I split them up so they both had 20.  There were only about 8 duplicates throughout the entire 40, which worked out fine since I was splitting between two girls.  I agree with other users that the scraper that comes with the kit is pretty useless.  I pulled out two old credit cards from about 8 years ago (I have no idea why I still had these!) and use those instead.  They&#x27;re really easy to scrape with.  I also put each plate in the holders that I purchased separately,recommended by another user (PUEEN Nail Stamp Plate Case Holder), and put them in their Christmas stockings.  I tried them out with the girls Christmas day and we had a ball.  The girls are 9 and 11 so their fingers and nails are a bit small for these size stamps.  There are a few that will fit on their tiny fingernails, but mostly their for fully grown hands.  I can use everyone of the stamps on my fingernails.  It helps that I actually have long nails too.  They don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll get more use out of them as they reach their teen years and quit biting their nails!  Shipping was fast, quality is really good for the price.  Watch the you tube videos to get a good technique down.  I don&#x27;t ever paint my fingernails and if I can do it, anyone can.  You just have to watch how it&#x27;s done before you decide it doesn&#x27;t work.  You tube is a great source for that.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any duplicates, plus they were a good price. However, ALL of them had scratches on them..some were deep scratches.</li>
    <li> This is very cool.  My 11 year old loves it.</li>
    <li> cute stencils and fun to use but it is best if you use the Konad nail polish which does not smear.</li>
    <li> Item was in good condition, tried it the next day and it came outt good. When i get the time i&#x27;ll do better on my nails, was just a test try. If u like doing your nails I recommend.</li>
    <li> I need more practice, but this is the cutest!!!</li>
    <li> Got what u paid.... Plates not deep enough to cone out design properly</li>
    <li> packaged well and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> The stamping plates were TERRIBLE. The plates were really scratched up and the scraper badly damaged them. They were WAY TO SHALLOW so when you scraped them NOTHING would stay in the plates. The stamping plated are a TERRIBLE RIP-OFF and I highly advise you NOT TO BUY THEM.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;d be better if this product came with some sort of instructional guide or even just with basic instructions on the packaging. I&#x27;ve looked through YouTube tutorials and blog posts trying to figure out an effective way to use this product and my efforts have failed thus far. If you are familiar with stamping and/or possess proficient nail art skills then this product may be great for you, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for beginners</li>
    <li> This stamping kit was as described. There is a wide variety of designs in this set and I would describe the plates and stamper as being good quality. I&#x27;m not crazy about the scraper, because it is hard to clean but an old credit card works just fine. I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun trying this stamping kit out and I think once I practice the technique I will be able to make some fun designs. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. :)</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my friend. She said it was a little difficult to use at first but once you get the hang of it they really are nice.</li>
    <li> It is kind of difficult to use it, because you need a thick nail polish. But at the end you end up using it correctly.</li>
    <li> This stamper set is completely worthless. The grooves aren&#x27;t deep enough. The scraper is useless. I guess I&#x27;ll try buying a more expensive set. You get what you pay for, as they say. This didn&#x27;t work for me at all and I tried several times, with several different polishes and a credit card. I wish I could get my $ back. :(</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff and easy to use more options for art skill. Recommend to teenagers for exploration of skills and imagination</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and it doesn&#x27;t really work.  We tried using the stamp many different times, and tried applying the polish and design to the stamp different ways, and it just doesn&#x27;t work.  Each time we stamped our nails we ended up with a messy smudge.</li>
    <li> The scraper and stamper work perfectly every time. The stamps come with beautiful designs that I use very often, but I would have to say that they were a little smaller than I expected, but I still use them just as much.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old ordered this and the stamping actually worked!  She loves it.  HOWEVER, She CUT her thumb pretty badly while taking the blue plastic off of the disc.  The edges of the discs are sharp but I would never have guessed it could slice the way it did.  Please carefully take the plastic off the discs, preferably while leaving the disc flat on the table and NOT while holding it between thumb and fingers.</li>
    <li> The stamp is so stiff it won&#x27;t stamp the polish onto the nail. The plates are not carved deep enough to hold any polish.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good - I got the 10 plate set because I had never used a stamper before and I just wanted to try it out. As some other reviewers have mentioned some of the images are not etched deeply enough, because they are impossible to stamp.  I didn&#x27;t receive any duplicate plates - probably because I only had the 10 piece. I will not use several of them though, which kind of stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my nails pretty frequently, and I&#x27;ve had these for about 2 months and I haven&#x27;t really gotten addicted to them or anything. The scraper does stink though, but the stamper works well. I looked around online for suggestions of nail polish brands to use - NYC colors work pretty well because they&#x27;re thick, same with the cheap Sally Hansen polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few tries before you get how to use these, after that it&#x27;s super easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend if you&#x27;re looking to try stamping without dropping a bunch of money.</li>
    <li> It is hard to use and no directions came with this product!</li>
    <li> (Written by my wife) The designs on the plates are too shallow for nail polish to settle in them, so the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick anything up. The scraper does not wipe away polish as it should. But the stamper itself it really nice. The rubber on it is nice and springy.</li>
    <li> Terrible, did not even work. Threw it in garbage wasn&#x27;t worth my time or gas to mail it back. Maybe mine was a bad one, that would be my hope. Sorry.</li>
    <li> At first i was upset because i couldnt get it to work then i realized that the blue sheet was a cover then i worked as expected and a love it</li>
    <li> First time and every time after designs have come out detailed and perfect. Sinful Colors Polish is the best out of the ones that I own so far. I love these. I wish I would have opted for the larger pack.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an excellent value. These are all single designs, along with some french manicures. The plates all appear to be engraved well, and I anticipate no problems in using them. The stamper and scraper are typical, although instead of using the included scraper, I am using an old gift card. Doesn&#x27;t scratch the plates, and is easier to use.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. The worst but I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    <li> this set is ok, but not the plates are poor</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product , the scraper leave a lot of mess on a plate and  pictures on a plate is not enaphe deep, so during the transferring you get not all parts of the picture.</li>
    <li> It sucked didnt work at all</li>
    <li> I purchased the 10 plate kit and tried several designs and different polishes... None of them worked. The designs are not carved deep enough. I would not recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> Stamps don&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
    <li> it really cool but a little hard to tell where you are putting the design and you have to push really hard to get the imprint.</li>
    <li> Nice designs I like this product&lt;br /&gt;If you are not getting the desing out of the plate is because you don&#x27;t have the right nail polish ... To know if you have the right nail polish test it in your nail, put a coat and if you can still see your nail throw the nail polish it&#x27;s not the right one.. it has to have a thick consistency</li>
    <li> The rubber stamper works great.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND SELECTION!</li>
    <li> its ok good for beginners</li>
</ol>
