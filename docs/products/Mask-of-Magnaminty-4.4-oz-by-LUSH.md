      <li>I plan on using this mask on special occasions</li>
      <li>and I was super excited to get this in the mail.</li>
      <li>Smells delicious and really gets down into your pores to leave your skin feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>Purchasing at the lush website will be much cheaper, but the overall  quality of the product is superb!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fresh and minty and I can feel it tingling as it&#x27;s drying.  </li>
      <li>The face feels revitalized and smooth, highly recommend it</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell.</li>
      <li>which is exactly what my oily skin needs.</li>
      <li>Overall I am pleased.</li>
      <li>Results immediately from the first time use.  </li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t at first, what a rip off.</li>
      <li>And leaves your skin extremely soft, smooth, and moisterized.</li>
      <li>While I love all Lush products, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not actually being sold by Lush.  </li>
      <li>I had this mask a few years ago and when I couldn&#x27;t find it on the LUSH site, I was happy to find it here.  </li>
      <li>This mask its make my facefelel so soft and clean..</li>
      <li>Be aware that it is very minty though, if you don&#x27;t like this, you will not like this mask.</li>
      <li>The chances of this being spoiled by the time it arrives to you are very high.  </li>
      <li>Smells minty and has smashed up adzuki beans to gently exfoliate.</li>
      <li>.. works really well..</li>
      <li>but I had to come on Amazon and do a review because I know how much I depend on reviews when buying anything.&lt;br</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t see too much of a diff with my combination skin.</li>
      <li>i really recommend it</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re guaranteed to get the real product.</li>
      <li>Also, if you&#x27;ve ever been to a Lush store you will notice that their face masks are on ice to keep them fresh and they suggest you store them in your refrigerator.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time buying any Lush product</li>
      <li>I will definitely try more Lush products in the future though.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin as well</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell it worked just as well and doesn&#x27;t have to be refrigerated.</li>
      <li>Makes skin buttery soft.</li>
      <li>and this did not break me out (none of the lush products do)</li>
      <li>size on the Lush website.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and smooth and firm.</li>
      <li>It does take awhile to dry, but it&#x27;s a real pleasure to scrub off.  </li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s more expensive than just buying it straight from the source.</li>
      <li>Put aside all the weird things about this mask, it actually does a good job as a face mask.</li>
      <li>However, i thought it was going to be a bigger size; my fault for not reading clearly.</li>
      <li>I got for $23.29 when I could have gotten it way cheaper on the Lush website for $12.95 for the same size, and yes I see it in the discription now</li>
      <li>I think this is a nice splurge if you are having troubled skin but definitely buy it on the Lush website or in an actual Lush store because it is cheaper there.</li>
      <li>Liked it, but been obsessed with a diff clay mask...</li>
      <li>This is an incredibly thick mask, and there&#x27;s lots of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in there- the consistency is by no means smooth.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really crazy actually, and better than any medical treatment I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s really crazy actually, and better than any medical treatment I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
<li> and you can tell when it&#x27;s totally dry because the mask changes from a dark to a light green.</li>
<li> Item seems a little less fresh than I had hoped.</li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only worn it everyday for only 2 days, and I&#x27;m starting to see results in the clearness of my skin.</li>
<li> I&amp;#34;m a huge fan of LUSH and have never been disappointed with their products.  </li>
<li> only downside is that it is a little pricey for the amount you&#x27;re getting.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an interesting texture on the face and the beans make the mask apply thick in some spots and thin in others which makes the drying uneven.</li>
<li> me you will not regret buying this mask it puts all other mint masks to shame!</li>
<li> Less messy that way.</li>
<li> Expensive for not lasting long.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a green mask</li>
<li> If I feel a blemish coming on and apply this mask it usually knocks it out.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s from Lush, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
<li> and I was recommended  this one in the mean time.</li>
<li> It is expensive for a very very small container</li>
<li> Who knows if this is an upcharged fake???</li>
<li> Needless to say I was shocked at the size jar (4.4oz.)</li>
<li> This mask is cold when applied and it is chunky because of the aduki beans.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wish I had read the reviews on here before I bought it on Amazon. I originally seen a lot of good reviews on this on Youtube, so I just came on here and bought it without looking at the reviews on here. Needless to say I was shocked at the size jar (4.4oz.) I got for $23.29 when I could have gotten it way cheaper on the Lush website for $12.95 for the same size, and yes I see it in the discription now but I didn&#x27;t at first, what a rip off. Thats the only reason for the 3 stars cause I love the product, I just wont get it on amazon any more. I can get the 11 oz. size for the same price I got for the 4.4 oz. size on the Lush website.</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;m a huge fan of LUSH and have never been disappointed with their products.  I had this mask a few years ago and when I couldn&#x27;t find it on the LUSH site, I was happy to find it here.  It&#x27;s fresh and minty and I can feel it tingling as it&#x27;s drying.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Like thus mask. It is expensive for a very very small container so I have been using it sparingly. I try to use it once a week. The only downfall is the expiration date was about 1 month away so it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Expensive for not lasting long. Hope I don&#x27;t need to throw any out.</li>
    <li> Item seems a little less fresh than I had hoped. Overall I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this in stores but I had to come on Amazon and do a review because I know how much I depend on reviews when buying anything.&lt;br /&gt;First let me say this...any mint mask that you may have at home get rid of it and GET THIS ASAP! This mask is amazing, not only does it smell like mint chocolate chip ice cream, but it is the most refreshing &amp; pampering mask I have ever felt in my life. It feels so strong and cooling and just amazing which is exactly what my oily skin needs. I have very sensitive skin as well and this did not break me out (none of the lush products do) and I also appreciate that it is also a light exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me you will not regret buying this mask it puts all other mint masks to shame!</li>
    <li> Really draws out all your impurities and smells AMAZING. Love the exfoliating aspect when you&#x27;re washing it off as well. Definitely repurchasing!</li>
    <li> This mask its make my facefelel so soft and clean.. i really recommend it.. works really well.. thanks♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥</li>
    <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I have not have had experience with this seller, but I am dying to write a review about this mask! Purchasing at the lush website will be much cheaper, but the overall  quality of the product is superb! Leave mask on for no more than 7 minutes for best results. I&#x27;ve only worn it everyday for only 2 days, and I&#x27;m starting to see results in the clearness of my skin. This mask rids your skin of unwanted oils and pimples..... And leaves your skin extremely soft, smooth, and moisterized. It&#x27;s really crazy actually, and better than any medical treatment I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> This is such a treat on your face!  Results immediately from the first time use.  Smells delicious and really gets down into your pores to leave your skin feeling fresh and clean.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> this product is so great. i&#x27;m almost done with it. only downside is that it is a little pricey for the amount you&#x27;re getting. i&#x27;m trying not to use it a lot so it will last longer. best mask i&#x27;ve ever bought so far.</li>
    <li> This feels really nice on my skin.  I wish it felt like it was pulling out more impurities, but I do enjoy it.  It&#x27;s easier for me to put it on before a shower and to rinse it off in the shower.  Less messy that way.</li>
    <li> Love this minty mask! Leaves your skin feeling refreshed and cleansed. Definitely recommend this product. Be aware that it is very minty though, if you don&#x27;t like this, you will not like this mask.</li>
    <li> This is an incredibly thick mask, and there&#x27;s lots of &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; in there- the consistency is by no means smooth.  It&#x27;s a green mask that&#x27;s tingly and minty on the skin.  It does take awhile to dry, but it&#x27;s a real pleasure to scrub off.  I find the best place to take it off is in the shower, because it can make a bit of a mess coming off.  A nice treat for the summer.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying any Lush product and I was super excited to get this in the mail.The first thing I noticed was the smell. It smells like a minty punch in the face. I personally like the smell of mint but some people will definitely have a problem with it.This mask is cold when applied and it is chunky because of the aduki beans. It&#x27;s an interesting texture on the face and the beans make the mask apply thick in some spots and thin in others which makes the drying uneven. It feels tingley when it&#x27;s drying and you can tell when it&#x27;s totally dry because the mask changes from a dark to a light green. Put aside all the weird things about this mask, it actually does a good job as a face mask. I noticed that it minimized my pores and it got rid of most of my blackheads. My skin feels soft and smooth and firm. I think this is a nice splurge if you are having troubled skin but definitely buy it on the Lush website or in an actual Lush store because it is cheaper there. I plan on using this mask on special occasions but I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase this specific mask. I will definitely try more Lush products in the future though.</li>
    <li> A lil more expensive than just going through the actual store, but my duaghter loves the product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s from Lush, can&#x27;t go wrong! Makes skin buttery soft. Use only once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> Liked it, but been obsessed with a diff clay mask...didn&#x27;t see too much of a diff with my combination skin.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing - you can feel it working.  If I feel a blemish coming on and apply this mask it usually knocks it out.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I loved the mask, leaving the skin soft, one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried. The face feels revitalized and smooth, highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, but if you buy it here, you&#x27;re wasting your money.&lt;br /&gt;On lushusa.com, it&#x27;s way cheaper and you&#x27;re guaranteed to get the real product. Who knows if this is an upcharged fake???</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! Best face mask!!! Although I have discovered I can get the&lt;br /&gt;11oz for 25 bucks on LUSH.COM instead of 53.99 on amazon. Kind of a rip off!! I will not he purchasing&lt;br /&gt;this product again from amazon</li>
    <li> love this mask, great for acne and large pores. However, i thought it was going to be a bigger size; my fault for not reading clearly.</li>
    <li> Went  in for the chocolate cup cake mask but they were out and I was recommended  this one in the mean time. As far as I can tell it worked just as well and doesn&#x27;t have to be refrigerated. Smells minty and has smashed up adzuki beans to gently exfoliate. Only downside is it doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate.</li>
    <li> While I love all Lush products, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not actually being sold by Lush.  Also, if you&#x27;ve ever been to a Lush store you will notice that their face masks are on ice to keep them fresh and they suggest you store them in your refrigerator.  The chances of this being spoiled by the time it arrives to you are very high.  Plus it&#x27;s more expensive than just buying it straight from the source.</li>
