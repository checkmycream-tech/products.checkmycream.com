<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> By far, these are the greatest wax things ever. Not messy, gets all the hair out, the little included cleansing cloth removes all the excess wax. So much less irritating than shaving.</li>
    <li> poor quality. do not recommend.</li>
    <li> It was a sticky mess and didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> These work very good, although I found a tip from a youtube video, dust the area to be waxed with some baby powder, it works. Maybe everyone already knows that but me, but it sure helped.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even remove hair, even when I followed the instructions to a t, and just caused a hugely sticky mess that took forever to remove.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I am a complete beginner when it comes to waxing. I had never waxed myself before today! These strips worked perfectly for me. They were easy to use and mostly mess-free. I used them to wax my bikini line, and I really love the results!</li>
    <li> As per my wife&#x27;s updates, she found it quite hard to use the strips at the first attempt. She had to read the how to use guide to get it a bit better.</li>
    <li> They are good but sometimes they leave some hair. Beauty really hurts! Well they smell good and they should come longer!</li>
    <li> This was my first time with these strip, and even waxing in general.&lt;br /&gt;I think its great how these wax strips are &#x27; ready-to-use &#x27; and no heating is basically required. EVEN THOUGH these strips are a lot easier to apply you need to take notice on some of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For skin that have never waxed before or more sensitive areas that have not been exposed to the sun or shaved, it may hurt more or less depending on the person. It can leave a reddish color on your skin. The redness goes away in about 8-10 minutes when I applied cold water to soothe the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;redness&#x27; however DOES NOT MEAN it is ineffective. You NEED to read the leaflet that they put in there. It comes with tips on how to use the product etc. On the leaflet, I found the most important tips are under &#x27; Top Tips When Waxing &#x27; on the right edge of the leaflet. It includes:&lt;br /&gt;-Testing for allergic reactions to formula components&lt;br /&gt;-Pulling the strip FASTER.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x60;t pull outwards&lt;br /&gt;-Wax the day before a special occasion to prevent any redness ON the day of the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pack only comes with 6 Mineral oil wipes, I think that was pretty lame BUT I found out that baby oil or makeup remover also works in getting rid of the wax. After removing the wax i like to pat the oil away with a kleenex tissue. This also helps me make sure there is absolutely no sticky wax left, since if there were it would stick to the kleenex. DON&#x60;T USE WATER TO RUB OFF THE WAX. It makes the wax look white and feel like you just poured super glue on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you cut the strips down to a smaller size, this task is not messy at all. Just be careful, have a trashcan ready and read the tips on the leaflet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I made mistakes on my first try such as using the strip&#x60;s cover to try and wax (stupid) and pulling outward and the hot water but after two strips i got the hang of it. It unfortunately did not get all of the hair, but I believe it is justmy inexperience. I&#x60;m going to try once more AFTER a couple hours of waiting. Waxing right after a session will only waste your time, your mineral oil wipes, your patience with this product and the money you put into it. Patience is virtue. (;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of Luck ,&lt;br /&gt;Vivi</li>
    <li> Even following the directions and being an experienced waxer with hot wax, I got these thinking they would be nice for travel.  It takes off some hair, but leaves a lot.</li>
    <li> I use for my back.  They work great for large relatively flat surfaces (back, chest, legs). Not so great for areas with grooves or valleys. butt...</li>
    <li> best wax strips I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> Every time I try a new wax on the market I claim it is the best and will use nothing else...until the next new wax comes on the market then I claim that one is the best...and so it goes.  The same applies to these.      I had been using regular (hot wax) on my legs (Sally Hansen).  I am not really a fan of the goopy-ness that it is so I was ecstatic when these Veet strips came out.  And they work really well!  I usually use the Veet face strips to tidy my bikini line, but when I&#x27;ve been neglecting that area awhile, the small strips seem to take forever to get a patch off (because they&#x27;re so small; duh, for your face).  So I tried the Veet legs and body strips.  Got 98% of the hair off in one rip (regardless of which direction I pulled) and I used the face strips to tidy up what little was left.  They are great on the legs too.  I just warm the strips in my hand, place them on my legs and rip them off.  No goopy mess like Sally Hansen was.  I would just shave otherwise but since I&#x27;m going on vacation I would like my legs to be a lot less hairy and don&#x27;t want to waste time in the shower shaving them again and again...    Thanks Veet and can&#x27;t wait to see who comes out with what next!</li>
    <li> I picked these up in Walmart and was excited to use them but blech. What a waste. I exfoliated my skin and waited until it was completely dry, following the instructions to a t. I might as well shaved, it would have been better results. I used them on my legs and underarm. On my legs they picked up a few hairs but mostly just cut them in half, even though they were about 3mm long. Not only that but they left a really bad sticky residue on my legs and especially my underarm. My underarms they didn&#x27;t pick up anything so a waste in general. Their after wipes are just pure oil, and did well on soothing the skin, but didn&#x27;t do much to pick up the wax residue. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! It&#x27;s very convenient to use the ready-wax strips since I&#x27;m short on time most of the time. Thank you for fast delivery and great price &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Veet salon line was the only wax strip that I had ever been happy with. I decided to use this new formula and it is a worthless sticky mess. It does not grab any hair and leaves the skin all sticky. I am amazed how this gets any good reviews.</li>
    <li> It is better than waxing for me. No mess</li>
    <li> I have dark hair and kept booking my leg waxings at the spa too closer together.  Then they&#x27;d say my growth wasn&#x27;t long enough but they&#x27;d try, and I&#x27;d end up dropping $40 and a week later had sparse regrowth.  So I gave these a whirl originally to save money, but the best thing is, for about $11/box (which lasts me about 6 weeks), I can wax any time I feel I need it, and even if it&#x27;s just partial areas on my leg (my front calves grow hair back faster, so they need touch-ups more often).  I haven&#x27;t been back to the spa in over a year.  I actually warm these up with a low-setting blow dryer and then you have to keep the strips on maybe 20 seconds longer than you&#x27;d think so the wax can harden slightly.  They are fantastic!</li>
    <li> These strips did not pull out many hairs. They did pull out a few, but mostly, it just hurt when I pulled them off. They also left a sticky mess behind. The wax remover wipes did work well, but they were very oily and gross to touch, and they did not last very long. I had to use about half of them for just half of one leg. I would not by this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other wax strips before and liked results so I bought these to try and was very unimpressed. They worked... But only took out MAYBE half of the hair in the area (leg and bikini)  I&#x27;m going to have to go back through and rewax because it&#x27;s way to much left over to even tweeze. They were also a lot more harsh on my skin and left a lot more wax behind than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love these. You need to grow your hair out for about two weeks, but if you use them regularly your hair will grow in very soft and slower. There are always too many packs of wipes since you only need one or two for your legs or armpits. I don&#x27;t use a razor anymore.</li>
    <li> Great concept but didn&#x27;t work as planned. Tried these for the first time tonight and will never purchase again. They are messy to use. Wax was all over me and very hard to get off. Secondly they probably only removed about 80% of the hair on my legs. Wasn&#x27;t worth the pain!</li>
    <li> This is a first impression review. I just used this about 10 minutes ago, so my opinion could be updated in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved for many years now. I got sick of doing it, so I stopped. My hairs have grown extremely thick and coarse. They&#x27;re borderline manly. I wear pantyhose whenever my legs are shown. But summer&#x27;s coming soon and I&#x27;d like to wear shorts. Since shaving was out of the question, I decided to try these on a whim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a newbie when it comes to waxing. So I tried them today and I am VERY impressed! Of course, they don&#x27;t get every single hair, but how amazing would that be? Anyway, so it says to make sure your hair is between 1 and 5 mm or something like that. I eyeballed it and thought, yeah my hairs are long enough. I decided to measure AFTER waxing my left leg. My leg hairs are about 1 cm long! That&#x27;s probably why it hurts a little more, but the pain is tolerable and short living. When you&#x27;re ready to pull it off, you just have to not think about it. About once or twice I would think about it for too long. I&#x27;m a newbie, what can you do. I&#x27;ve used 3 strips so far, and my left leg still isn&#x27;t done yet, but I have thick calves, so it&#x27;s understandable. I was able to use a strip about twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I inspected the use strip, I could see the hair roots, which excited me (yeah I&#x27;m a dork.) Hopefully the hair will grow back thinner now. The box says to test the wax on your skin first, which I didn&#x27;t notice until AFTER I waxed. So far nothing bad has happened yet. But keep that in mind if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m impressed. Will update eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So the above I submitted in mid-February and it is now June 6, 2015, about four months later. I have to say that I will never return to shaving. I love how waxing leaves my skin and how my hairs grow back finer. I decided to be bold and use this on my upper lip and it works just as well. I&#x27;ve also used it on my knuckles and underarms. I have not been disappointed. If you&#x27;re thinking about stopping the razor, this is a good place to start.ping the razor, this is a good place to start.</li>
    <li> this product is the worst product i have EVER BOUGHT!!!!  it removes little to no hair....the wipes do not even help get any wax off or do anything really.....and all i am left with is hairy sticky legs....and i have tried and tried again to get this wax off my legs to no avail!!!!!  if you like hairy sticky legs then this is the product for you....if not....your better off just shaving.....2 HOURS later and im STILL trying to get the wax off of my legs..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually too lazy to write a review, but this time I feel obligated to do it, for the well being of the general public.    First, this product has poor performance on hair removal, leaving 10% of hair behind.    Secondly, either the wax or the finishing wipe made my skin red then brown for a few days and then peel for a week.     Last, residual wax is very hard to clean. Yes, finishing wipes come with the package, BUT the oily wipe is totally gross, and don&#x27;t resolve the residual wax well, you will have to almost scratch until your skin hurts to get rid of 90% of the residual. The rest 10% would still come bugging you when you take a shower to get rid the the gross oil left from the wipe, after you spend 30 mins battling the wax residual.    Conclusion: I will never touch this product again. I suggest you stay away from it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different brands of wax strips and found this to be the worse by far. The wax is very thick and sticky but not in the hair removing way, more sticky like melted gummy candy on your skin. It barely takes any hair out per strip so you may find yourself using the entire box for half a leg. Even the wax removing wipes didn&#x27;t work! I used 2 of the wipes to try and get the wax off and follwed with a hot shower and tried scrubbing it off. Even after all that I still had sticky patches on my skin. What a dissappointment. The clear plastic strips used by other brands are a lot easier to use and less mess.</li>
    <li> This product is ineffective and I felt as if my skin was pulled off.  Left my leg with a huge bruise!!  Wax was next to impossible to remove.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m going to be honest here.....I HATE shaving my legs with a passion! To me it is too time-consuming and aggravating. I mean all that work for one day of smoothness if that! So what&#x27;s a busy momma to do? Let herself get hairy! Nope...check these puppies out and give it a go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off I have light, fine leg hair and I did not have any problem getting these to work. I did have some hair to grab on to and that is essential in getting these to work. You can&#x27;t shave your legs Monday night and try these out on Tuesday expecting them to work. If you have never waxed before, please READ the directions!! Also, you may want to enlist someone to help you out your first time you use them. It takes some courage to rip your own hair off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to waxing is making sure you apply it in the right direction. Then hold your skin tightly and then rip it off quickly, like a Band-Aid. After apply pressure to the area - it really helps! After you&#x27;re completely done with waxing use the oily wipes to get any excess was off. I also take a shower after and then apply Aveeno baby lotion. I enjoyed over 2 weeks of smooth skin and the $8 I spent was well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think all the negative reviewers are improperly using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also believe the average person could wax their legs twice with the amount of product given. I am a larger girl and used over half of the wipes for one use on my legs. Go ahead and give it a try! What have you got to lose, except all that unwanted  hair and aggravation of shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Less messy than hot wax. Quick and efficient.</li>
    <li> I usually wax my boyfriend&#x27;s shoulders with regular warm wax. It made a mess and wasn&#x27;t really working; he has very thick, stubborn hairs. I thought I would try to use the Ready Wax strip, since it wouldn&#x27;t be such a big a mess. We read the directions, which were pretty simple; I applied the strip, rubbed it in a little bit and pulled. The strip took off every hair on his shoulder! We were both surprised to see it actually worked. It did leave a little bit of wax stuck on his skin, but the wipes help with that. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product to use. I&#x27;m hooked to it now. No more messy warm wax.</li>
    <li> I was fed up with shaving and the things that come along with it like after a few days you start to itch as the hair grows back, shaving bumps and razor burns. I decided to try Veet Cold Wax Strips because I didn&#x27;t feel like warming anything up in the microwave or applying the wax myself using traditional wax methods... That whole process just seemed extremely messy... So, I was relieved when I came across Veet&#x27;s ready to use wax strips. I will admit that my first attempt trying wax and failed miserably. I warmed it in my hand and followed the instructions but when it came to pulling it off myself I wasn&#x27;t doing it fast enough, so nothing came off...  After 3 failed attempts I asked my husband to help I told him to go in the opposite direction that my hair is growing and when he did it, it was perfect. So I recommend asking someone else like hubby or boyfriend... Just make sure you inform or make them read the instructions. At first we did my stomach... I must admit we did have a few stubborn hairs that just would not go away... We just kept going until it MOST of it was gone and the rest I just plucked... Next up was my bikini line.... I was going for a brazilian wax sort of thing.. I wanted to be bare... But unfortunately it was much too painful. The hair is more coarse and hurts more down there so I gave up... So I look like a mess!!! I have Patches of bald spots right now lol...  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, It works well... You just have to know what you&#x27;re doing and be able to endure pain. If I ever attempt the bikini area again I will definitely get no scream cream (something I saw on youtube (you&#x27;re supposed to apply it a little bit before you get waxed and it is supposed to take the pain away, lol go figure- but willing to try nething to get rid of the pain that goes along with waxing) and take some pain pills.... FYI: I&#x27;ve ever heard of some people using Orajel on the bikini line before they get waxed... which is weird to me... Idk.. So anyway, this stuff works well on fine hair like stomach area wasn&#x27;t very painful for me at all but not so much with pubic hair because it&#x27;s so coarse and skin is so sensitive... unless you can deal with the pain of going over the bikini area with the wax about 15/20 times.. wouldn&#x27;t recommend this..  I am considering plucking my pubic hair one by one... Idk what to do.. If you have any advice please comment.. I am too shy to go to a professional plus I heard it&#x27;s extremely expensive..l on fine hair like stomach area wasn&#x27;t very painful for me at all but not so much with pubic hair because it&#x27;s so coarse and skin is so sensitive... unless you can deal with the pain of going over the bikini area with the wax about 15/20 times.. wouldn&#x27;t recommend this..

    <li> I have to say it&#x27;s great for the leg, however even when I hold it taught it skips spots and leaves me patchy and hairy. Not exactly what you want after someone pulls hair off your leg. Not for use anywhere else.</li>
    <li> These wax strips are terrible they don&#x27;t remove any hair.  All the leave behind is a sticky mess that is a pain to get rid of.  I also found out that veet tests their products on animals which is also a negative thing for me.  Over all this product doesn&#x27;t work and you need way more finishing wipes to get the dang sticky crap off your body.</li>
    <li> I bought the veet wax strips for my daughter who has been wanting to shave her legs for the first time. We decided that waxing was a better option than shaving for her. She has pretty dark, thick leg hair that has never been removed before. I wasn&#x27;t expecting great results, but was very pleasantly surprised after pulling the first strip! The wax stuck to her hair but not her skin. There was virtually no hair left behind. We were even able to use the same strip twice in a few spots. We only did the knees down, but her legs were instantly smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. The redness was gone in about an hour. I am so impressed, I think I may have to throw my razor away and start using these strips myself!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong or maybe I&#x27;m just not hairy enough, but I find this a useless product. My home made sugar wax works better.</li>
    <li> I am not inexperienced when it comes to waxing. I prefer hard wax, but decided to try this product off the shelf. I followed the directions exactly. It didn&#x27;t remove ANY hair from my underarms and bikini line, but did manage to remove some skin along the edges of the strip. I do not understand how this product is receiving postive reviews.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my friends. Seems they like it. But to be on fair side I am not the right to rate it.</li>
    <li> Its really helpful for hair removal. It makes skin smooth and it is easy to use if u do it with proper way.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like pain, don&#x27;t get this product, I have rated this 4 stars because I was in total disbelief that it would even work in the first place but it proved me wrong. it box says to warm with rubbing it with your hands but i used a hairdryer and it seemed to work much better.  This product lost a star because it did leave one bruise at the tip top of my thigh, don&#x27;t know how it happened but it was instant! I have only tested it for a week and I&#x27;m still hair free and hopefully it will at least work one more:)</li>
    <li> I tried using these strips after heating them in the microwave for about a minute. It works beautifully, every single hair came off with little effort. Just rubbing it between my palms didn&#x27;t help at all though and I ended up wasting many strips. The wax needs to be very warm to the touch before peeling the strips apart and applying it. Also, rubbing a little oil on to residual wax removes it very easily.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the pain of waxing, then these wax strips are great! They actually hurt less than the sugar wax that my family previously used, plus there is no worrying about keeping the wax the right temperature, putting on too much or too little, and all the mess that normally accompanies waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, more importantly, these are much more effective! We had much better luck getting out all the hair, with much less breakage. I think these are the perfect at home waxing solution. They left our skin sooo smooth! Be sure not to use the towelettes until you are all done waxing because they are very oily and you don&#x27;t want that on your skin while still trying to wax.</li>
    <li> Like someone else said, I don&#x27;t understand how this is getting such positive reviews. I&#x27;m fair haired and I waited until my leg hair was long enough that the wax would be able to grab it. Some strips did manage to yank out some hair, but others did not. It left me with weird patches that I ended up having to shave off anyway. Within a couple days, even the hair that the strips did manage to remove was back. These were so painful and left me with horrible redness and bumps that lasted even after the hair grew back. Absolutely worst $8 that I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waxed before with homemade stuff which means dealing with warming wax, cutting cotton strips, and making sure you don&#x27;t burn yourself. this is the first time I actually used store bought wax and I like it so much BETTER. No mess and no mistakes. I absolutely love it and it cost very little compared to spending $60 for a salonwax.</li>
    <li> Veet wax strips are the best way to get rid of unwanted hair on legs, arms, bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Create no mess&lt;br /&gt;2) very easy to use, nothing else required.&lt;br /&gt;3) Excellent results, lasting up to 4 weeks for me.&lt;br /&gt;4) Can do it anytime at home.&lt;br /&gt;5) The after wax wipes are excellent to remove wax left on body.&lt;br /&gt;6) 40- Count box will do legs &amp; arms and still 4 left. So it is cheapest by far from any other solution.&lt;br /&gt;7) the best of all - it is HYGIENIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and delivery has always been great and on time.&lt;br /&gt;Just use it the right way and you will be happy.</li>
    <li> Very nice....It works great. .I m surprised. .it is very effective. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sally Hansen wax strips for more than a year, and even though they worked, now that I&#x27;ve used Veet&#x27;s strips, I&#x27;m never going back again. Veet&#x27;s strip cloths are better quality and the tabs help lessen the mess, which is pretty much inevitable with wax. And the wipes that are provided to use after waxing are so much better than the liquid that comes with Sally Hansen. They even smell...good. I know!</li>
    <li> I used the veet strips today for the first time. I was cautious to follow directions. For the sake of getting it right the first time I even put the new strip in (turned off)oven as the temp is lukewarm in it. The result is good for 1 time use of 1 strip. Repeat use will not get out a lot. I used 14 strips on both legs but there is a lot left to be removed, however I got tired :D. So I might run epillator on the rest or wax later. Its a good way to remove dead skin and its less messy.   While the wax is great I think that sometimes it sticks to skin and doesnt come off easy, perhaps with repeated use of wipes it might but the thing is that you shouldn&#x27;t wipe while in the middle of waxing because the oil mitigates the effect of wax if you happen to touch the strip with it or use oily strip on area to be waxed.  I wonder what will the chemical affect of an astringent be if wiped on to skin with a cotton cause that way skin wont be sticky/oily and the same area can be cleaned and waxed again. Perhaps veet folks can tell that better.</li>
    <li> They work but you have to let your hair grow a bit first. does little to nothing on stubby hair (I&#x27;ve tried)</li>
    <li> I bought these  wax strips because i hated the fact that shaving only got rid of the hair on the surface  so i bought these because they get rid of the hair from the root not the surface which was a BIG plus to me  I really had no problem with these one reccmond is to apply baby power or gold bon so you can have a smother wax ]  really reccmond these</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a blonde with super fine hair; after a month of no shaving, my thighs are virtually hair free and my shins had thin, about half an inch long hairs sparingly on them. However, I have tons of thin, short little prickly ones. So, my hair condition is better than that of anyone I know, but I really cannot stand not having smooth skin. So, I used these on my legs. It got the half inch hairs but nothing about 2-3mm long. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was painful at all. First rip every time you wax hurts because it&#x27;s shocking but every rip after that doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much. I did repeat use of the strips because I bought them at CVS for more than ten bucks and I&#x27;d rather shave every other day than spend ten dollars a month using all the strips to wax. I don&#x27;t know why my skin isn&#x27;t smooth at all after waxing, but it&#x27;s really frustrating and actually emotionally upsetting because there&#x27;s so much pressure on girls to have perfectly smooth, moisturized, glowing skin. (I won&#x27;t use creams because they irritate me but I&#x27;m not allergic/do not have sensitive skin).  However, I found a use for this that works! The bikini zone/Brazillian area (if you get what I mean) is the use I&#x27;ll have for these strips. It took every hair off. So, I think if you have coarse leg hair, these strips will be your best friend. If you have thin hair, pass on it.</li>
    <li> This product does NOT replace waxing (with the actual wax and strips).&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as an attempt to not have to wax in my tiny college dorm room with real wax, but have realized that this product is not an equal replacement.&lt;br /&gt;It misses far too many hairs to be entirely efficient, and I use this product for &amp;#34;touch-ups&amp;#34; when I don&#x27;t feel like breaking out the wax warmer. In that way, this product is very convenient. (Like for those random warm days where you want to wear a tank but haven&#x27;t waxed the underarms in a while.)&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to do entire legs, not only is this product inefficient, it will also take forever. I have fairly long legs for my 5&#x27;6&amp;#34;/5&#x27;7&amp;#34; height, and I once attempted to do both legs----that was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;About the &amp;#34;sensitivity&amp;#34; factor… I can&#x27;t really say much because I normally wax with regular honey wax, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Make sure to follow the directions and rip off the strip quickly (this is a mistake that rookies sometimes make)---if not, you will leave wax all over you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the veet cold wax strips in the sensitive skin formula (green box with aloe [...]) and it&#x27;s a LOT better. This one was sticky and didn&#x27;t grab any skin. It makes a huge mess, and your hands, scissors, and body all get sticky even if you&#x27;re careful. It also doesn&#x27;t pick up any hair. Get the other kind. You get half as many, but it actually works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Veet wax strips before, and had no problem with irritation or wax left behind on my skin. This particular formula is a different story.&lt;br /&gt;As another user posted, the strips are very thin and fold over on themselves when separated; the backing is more like cellophane or thin plastic than a cloth or paper strip.&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself stuck to everything BUT the hair, and I had to clean my fingers with one of the after-use pads before I could go on. When I pulled the strip off, I think it took a layer of skin with it, but it didn&#x27;t take much hair. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the almond oil in the wax, or the fact that it&#x27;s a sensitive skin formula, but I am unimpressed, and out $9 to boot.&lt;br /&gt;This Veet comes with no numbing pre-wipes, and the post-wipes are a joke. You have to scrub pretty hard to get the residue off (of your skin, and your countertop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using wax strips on my armpits for years, and I know my way around them. I also know a craptastic product when I use one, and I certainly won&#x27;t be using this particular Veet again. It&#x27;s not worth the mess, time, trouble, or red, sore armpits.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have luck with these. I didn&#x27;t grow my hair quite as long as I should have, but it hurt more than it took anything off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure if you grew your hair for a few weeks and really had someone help you it may be effective, but I am still skeptical. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Worst hair remover in the world! I followed the directions and it didn&#x27;t work. It hurt and left my skin sticky which was very hard to remove. The pain was not worth it because it only removed three hairs. My advice do not buy it unless you really hate yourself and want to stay hairy... Oh and lets not forget sticky.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I&#x27;m a guy. First time waxing. And I have REALLY hairy legs I wanted to wax my legs (particularly upper thigh) and that whole area down there because I&#x27;m hairy and it&#x27;s just gross. I can never seem to shave close enough and waxing overtime discourages hair regrowth, unlike shaving which makes hair more coarse and visible. I didn&#x27;t really want to do hot waxing, it just seemed like too much work, so I bought these. I tried two of the strips (they&#x27;re paired and glued together, so if you look there&#x27;s only 20 in the box)and it worked great, didn&#x27;t really hurt and it removed nearly all the hair. I decided to take a shower and do some more. Oh man, what a mistake. If you use these when wet, the wax appears to be more prone to sticking to skin and removes significantly less hair. It also hurts A LOT more. So heed my advice:&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T USE THESE AFTER SHOWERING&lt;br /&gt;If you have long hair like i had for the first time (1-3 inches) I would recommend just taking a pair of scissors and trimming down a little bit because that&#x27;ll make it hurt a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;But these work great and I love my legs all nice and smooth (and that area down there ;d). It&#x27;s so comfortable. Will definitely buy again. Make sure to read the instructions thoroughly to get maximum results.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Used for legs..and it worked perfectly. it was quick and easy</li>
    <li> just how it is suppose to be. I think some people might find it difficult when doing on themselves. you need to get hang of it. Plus you hair have to be little long for the waxing to happen</li>
    <li> Sticky &amp;#34;wax?&#x27;. The inly thing these strips remove was dead skin cells. novelettes included to remove excess &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; was useless! This is the second day, and I&#x27;m still taking some of thee &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; off. DO NOT USE!! NOT RECOMMENDED!!! Throwing the remainder of this in the trash&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I bought them 3 hours ago and tried them out, well lets just say that my skin felt like it was being ripped apart. Aside from the fact that now my leg (shin area) has red dots on it aka a rash. I may try them again, but right now, I am just trying to deal with it. I do not reccomend anyone to buy unless you want to have red skin and have the feeling of your skin being ripped off! And I think I should&#x27;ve listen to the other reviews. Also, I had longer hair so it should&#x27;ve worked (2mm-5mm long hair!) haha! RIP OFF DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for years and during my travels have tested many products. I usually prefer the hot wax home kits and have steered away from wax strips in the past, because the ones from years ago were really painful and too cold to use. Recently, I was traveling and had no choice but to buy these Veet strips. I was really pleasantly surprised at how well these worked! Since then, I have tried some other brands, but have decided to purchase the Veet ones from Amazon because I like them the best. Here is what I like about them:  - There are enough strips in one box for both legs and arms. The wax consistency is done so well that you can reuse one strip several times.   - It&#x27;s gentle enough to use around the bikini line.   - The wax grips your hair well and does not pull. Some other wax strip brands can cause bruises - I had a very bad experience with Nads for example. Also, the Nads strips ran out faster.   - There is a paper bit around the wax bits, so that you can hold the strip without getting wax on your fingers i.e. the whole thing is very practical and not messy. Most brands have this, but I like the fact that the Veet has a slightly curved bit to one end, so that you really don&#x27;t get wax on your fingers. Some of the other brands you still do.   To summarize, this is my new favorite strip wax product! It&#x27;s great for when you&#x27;re traveling or on the go, and don&#x27;t have time or the means to melt wax in a microwave or a pot. Also it&#x27;s less messy. The facial strips from Veet work equally well.</li>
    <li> Not only do these strips work but they do a fantastic job! It&#x27;s very cost-effective and really saves a lot of time compared to going to the salon and paying 10 times more.</li>
    <li> i see a lot of people complaining and asking if its ok for the genital area but if you guys would just READ the DESCRIPTION you would know. ive also had the same problem with a rash, dont get hot water on the area for a day or 2 after waxing, dont scrub, use a lotion like soap with no exfoliants and put vitamin e oil on afterwards. the rash should(did for me) go away.</li>
    <li> This strips are such a hassle. You need to apply the strips multiple times on the same area in order to see a result and even so my legs were still not smooth. It is a very messy and long process. I don&#x27;t see how this beats shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use.  Wax heats up quick&lt;br /&gt;-removes all hair&lt;br /&gt;-40 wax pads is great value for the money&lt;br /&gt;-after wax towelettes work great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;-sometimes when removing the protective back the wax strips fold on each other and its impossible to tear apart.  I&#x27;ve wasted a few because of this.&lt;br /&gt;-They do not supply you with enough after wax towelettes.  They give you 40  wax strips, but they don&#x27;t even give you 10 after wax towelettes.  If you don&#x27;t have one of the towelettes you&#x27;re in trouble.</li>
    <li> These things didnt work.  I have thin sparse hair, so even though a lot of reviews said it didnt work, I thought maybe since there is not a lot of hair to remove, it may do something.  Wrong... these things suck.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this product in markets in our neighboorhoos, but I couldn&#x27;t find it.  It is easy to use and it is better than other brands.</li>
    <li> I previously wrote a negative review saying that the Veet wax strips left behind a sticky mess. After reading so many positive reviews, I figured I must be doing something wrong. And I was. What I was forgetting to do, which is very important in all types of waxing, is to hold the skin very taught while you are pulling the strip. I was holding the skin taught, but nowhere near as taught as I should have. It made all the difference. It grabbed almost every single hair, and was nearly painless. The tabs on the paper help alot when you have to pull off the strip. It&#x27;s also very comfortable, the strips are made of paper but are woven to feel like cloth. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other cold wax strips before, by Sally Hansen and Parissa, and these worked the best. The wax is thicker and stickier than on the other strips I&#x27;ve used and the strips themselves are fabric-like rather than plastic, so they more easily fit around your more interesting contours. I found these strips to be larger than I needed, and they worked just as well after I cut them in half. Usually, when I&#x27;ve waxed before with the aforementioned strips, they would leave the coarser bikini-line hairs behind but these strips got every last one! The oily wipes this set comes with took the extra wax off with relatively little effort.</li>
    <li> This wax trips are very sticky, pull out all the hairs clean. It is very convenient as you do not need to hit anything, control temperature and thickness of a wax layer you apply. 5 starts from me.</li>
    <li> This is a good product with cheap price.Everything is good about this product from user friendly and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My parents made really hairy kids with really stubborn body hair. I have a 24 hour window of smoothness after I shave my legs, and since my hair is dark and thick, stubble is very noticeable. I&#x27;ve tried other wax strips that just were unable to pull out my super strength hair, but this worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoothness lasted about 18 days, not the 28 advertised, but for me, 18 days was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Also, to help heat it up, I warmed the wax on the plastic part of my flat iron.</li>
    <li> Better than SH and Parissa - The wax seems to grip (and melt) better and the strips are more re-usable, up to 4 times for me. For those that say it hurts....well, it doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than it would getting it professionally done. The more hair you have and the thicker it is &#x3D; more pain. I don&#x27;t flinch when doing my legs but my underarms leave me in tears.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and it worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, light hair. Even when it grows about an inch, you cannot see that it is there unless you deliberately look for it. I only used it on my legs and it got most of the hair off. I&#x27;ve been to many salons/spas over the years and this product performs just as well for me as any \\&quot;professional\\&quot; wax job I&#x27;ve had in the past.I didn&#x27;t even need to use all 40 sheets. It did leave my legs itchy but I will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Worked WAY better than strips that you have to wax yourself. Extremely easy and fast. It hurt a LOT less than it did at the salon and worked almost just as well. Be prepared that you might have to shower afterwards though, especially the first time - at some points I didn&#x27;t pull hard enough and it left small (perhaps three 1x1 inch) spots of wax on my skin and I had to rub with some facial soap (as you&#x27;re not supposed to use items with fragrance on it for 24 hours, which all my shower gels are) to get the wax off. The finishing wipes doesn&#x27;t really get the remaining wax off, but at least it has this oily substance in it that soothes the pain and moisturizes the skin. overall I was very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these once in the past and was amazed about how smooth my legs were and how long it lasted. Could have used a couple more strips to get entire thigh and leg done, but only had enough strips for half of the thigh area which wasn&#x27;t too bad of an issue. Only sucky part is having to grow your leg hair out enough.</li>
    <li> Yikes these are terrible!  First off, they don&#x27;t work.  They did not take one hair off my body.  2nd, they are a mess.  I ended up having wax in my body hair that did not wash out.  The hair clumped together and the \\&quot;smooth finish\\&quot; strips did not get any of the wax off.  I ended up having to wash my body in baby oil a few times to get the wax out.  Messy and useless.</li>
    <li> This was my first time waxing so I followed the directions exactly, but I found the strips only removed a little bit of hair and left a gluey mess on my skin, which the wipes did not get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I didn&#x27;t shave all winter the hairs were all pretty long, so that isn&#x27;t the problem. It&#x27;s also black and quite coarse. Waxing should have worded fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse, the next morning the patches where it DID seem to have removed the hair were stubbly, so it must have just broken them off. Now my legs are both hairy and stubbly, and sticky to boot. AND I&#x27;m afraid to shave because of the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And worst of all: I dropped on on my hardwood floor and I can&#x27;t get it cleaned up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time, just to see what would happen, I tried to take off my leg hair with duct tape. That worked better than this stuff did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side... I guess it doesn&#x27;t as much as everyone says. Hurts more than shaving, though, as well as taking longer and being less effective.</li>
    <li> Ummm, the first one I used, I had problems with--it was too warm in our house &amp; had melted it--sticky mess.  I keep them in the fridge now.  Just warm it up between your hands &amp; you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
    <li> From a guy&#x27;s perspective this product worked pretty well.  I tried the wax on my arms and the hairs just came out.  The box mentions that it&#x27;ll work with hairs even as short as 2mm but this short length was difficult to remove.  I had to reapply it a few times for hairs of this length.  One complaint that I have is that there&#x27;s 40 strips of wax and only 6 wipes.  The wipes are useful for removing the excess wax left over.</li>
    <li> Got it in Walmart. Tried once on my legs and I swear I will never ever touch it again. Hair removal was not perfect. My legs are still itchy. Large areas of rash on them. The finishing wipe did not clean up the wax well.</li>
    <li> I am definitely buying this product again. The strips are less messy, easy to pull off with the paper tabs and cleans off easily. Its been a month since I last waxed and there&#x27;s hardly been any hair growth. And at this price,it surely is value for your money. I am very happy I brought this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different types of waxes: cold wax strips, hot wax, salon waxing. This is by far the easiest and most convenient. There&#x27;s no mess of spreading the wax and dripping it all over the place. You don&#x27;t have to worry about spreading it too thin or too thick or it being too hot or too cold. These wax strips do all of the work for you! I was able to use one strip for my entire lower leg. It&#x27;s sticky enough that you can use it over and over (within reason.) It&#x27;s way cheaper than going to a salon and way cleaner and easier than heating it and spreading it yourself. I HIGHLY recommend these strips!</li>
    <li> It is so easy and inexpensive to use these wax strips.  It just takes a few minutes and there is no mess to deal with.  You can reuse the strip a couple of times. A pack of 40 wax strips lasts a long time.  After using this product once I am hooked on it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product:( you will hurt yourself , leaves mess, red skin, and hair is still there :(   watch out for this product :(</li>
    <li> I know that Veet was trying to be helpful by putting that tab to hold the strip on at the top.. but now I can only use the strip in one direction. If I put it on the wrong way, trying to grip the non-tab side is difficult.   A lot of women cut the strips up for use on smaller areas - but this is harder with new shape. Stick to rectangles.</li>
    <li> So easy to use, love the wipes that come with it to remove excess wax. Only thing i didn&#x27;t like is that it didn&#x27;t last as long with out growing back like it says. Maybe after repeated uses it will. Still highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I thought that these strips would be amazing - but they did NOT work! I did everything that they said to do on the directions, and yet all I got was broken blood vessels on my skin and a sticky film on my legs - but the HAIR remained. This was a complete waste of time and money and I do NOT recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Must have for every woman :) Totally satisfied with this product!! Great buy for a great price, also available in stores.</li>
    <li> “I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member.” I have tried this product and I have to say that it works great for small jobs. If your concern is a stray hair here or there, then this is the product for you. It wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought to use these strips. I like that this package can be discreet and can easily fit into the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Good remover of the hair on the body, it is good quality and quantity, cheaper than local store. Recommend this one</li>
    <li> Actually it&#x27;s not good, I don&#x27;t think people need to spend money for it.</li>
    <li> Worst product I have ever tried.  I did a lot of research on this product  I fallowed the instructs to the T, and I still came out of it very disappointed.  The strips left a lot of waxy residue and took off more skin than hair.  I couldn&#x27;t see a difference compared to before I waxed. I thought that I may have reused a strip too much, which was only two times, and tried a new one, and that left more hair than the first.  I was really hoping to find a way much better than shaving on a daily basis, but the search continues.  This product may work for others and they are satisfied, I am just not one of them.</li>
    <li> Works very well and gets the job done</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of waxing strips and I think parissa are my favorite though they are much more expensive. These ones have too much wax (although I cut them into smaller pieces and use them on my bikini line so maybe they would be better on the legs) so they are really hard to rip off.</li>
    <li> I have been using cold wax strips for years, including those made by Veet.  Unfortunately this product does not measure up to the previous strips sold by Veet, and is poor compared with other brands.  The wax is in a very thin layer, making it hard to properly adhere to your hair.  Also, the shape of the strip means that when you pull the two sides apart, one side curls and folds in on itself - I ended up with a large patch of wax on my tile floor that took a while to clean up.  I&#x27;d stick with another brand over choosing the new Veet strips.</li>
    <li> The quality is good and it works however the package that I was recived were missing one double strips, I had 38 not 40!?</li>
    <li> These are effective and easy to use wax strips which I have been using on my legs.  MUCH cheaper than going to the salon!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this left me with little red bumps. Instead of removing my leg hair, it just broke it off, leaving me with stubble. It&#x27;s also very time consuming. I think I&#x27;ll stick with shaving.</li>
    <li> Nothing miraculous.  You have to use friction to warm up the wax sufficiently.  I still find this type of product too expensive for what it is!</li>
    <li> I know this is primarily a feminine product, but I&#x27;m sure that some men like myself will use it too. This was my first experience with waxing and I highly recommend it over shaving (I&#x27;m surprised that women choose shaving over this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works perfectly, getting every single hair in one pull. I found that the faster you pull it off, the less wax residue will be left behind. Also, you must pull straight back. If you pull up, it will hurt just as bad, but won&#x27;t remove any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as pain, its easily 10/10, but the pain only lasts a second or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box includes some wipes for cleanup, but I found that baby oil worked better for removing the remaining wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about 6&#x27;1 and used 2 boxes to do both of my legs.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as easy to use as it appears and it doesn&#x27;t do that great a job. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a satisfaction guarantee. I bought this for my daughter and she didn&#x27;t have success.</li>
    <li> These strips are so cheap and easy to use. Simply peel the strip apart, rub it down onto the skin and rip off. They work on coarse hair under the arms and around the bikini area. DO NOT try to use these on a Brazilian wax because it will just cause excessive pain and miss a lot of hairs. Use hard wax for a Brazilian wax. Other than that, these strips are great for the rest of the body (underarms, legs, stomach, back, arms, bikini area: sides only). After one pull, you can keep using the same strip and hair will still come off effectively. You definitely get your moneys worth. To remove stick residue after just use the tissue they give you (warning: they may be a little too oily) or use lotion.</li>
    <li> It does the job well, but there are not enough cleaning wipes in the package.</li>
    <li> Saw many people use these online, I thought I would give them a try.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!  Used just as the directions said, and a few different ways.  No luck at all.  The strips removed just a few strands of hair each, and hurt VERY BADLY.  Caused a very bad rash as well.  Don&#x27;t buy.  I do have semi-thick hair, but not that bad.  I will stick to shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve self waxed, and while I&#x27;ve never enjoyed the process, at least it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time it didn&#x27;t work at all. The strips are huge, so you have to do a very large area at once, which is not a good thing when doing your bikini area. Sure I&#x27;d love to get it all over with quickly, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to keep that entire area taut enough for one strip. The strip took out one hair. One. And left the rest of the hairs, covered in wax. The wipes that are supposed to clean up afterwards, don&#x27;t work either. I had to use the oil that came with a different waxing product to get the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs were of the correct length, I followed all of the instructions, and it simply didn&#x27;t work. You can&#x27;t re-wax an area you&#x27;ve already waxed, so I didn&#x27;t bother trying any additional areas.</li>
    <li> It works effectively if you follow the directions, but those directions leave room for common human errors.  So you could get lucky and manage to pull of all the hairs in one stroke, though this depends on you pulling/applying/warming up the strips perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The thin oil-drenched cloths that come with the box are crap. I use oil of a different brand to get rid of the leftover wax.&lt;br /&gt;Should you buy it? If you can find an effective, reliable way method to use the strips, then yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Taniya</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stick to skin at all.  I had to shave my legs anyway, only after I got the sticky stuff off my skin.  Waste of my time.  I tried it 2 different times and then threw them out.</li>
    <li> Too harsh on the skin. Leaves blood spots when used on thick hair and takes too much effort to pull small hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of waxes, both cold strips and hot wax, and these are my favorite by far.  They worked really well on everything I tried them on.  And, as an added bonus, when I cut them to get more precise lines, the strips were just as effective.  There is some sticky residue, but the enclosed wipes get rid of that pretty quickly.      The only downside for me is that when the box says 40 strips, it means 20 double sided strips, which I did not anticipate.  Other then that, a good, cheap effective product.</li>
    <li> other wax strips&#x27; brands dont work on me, only Veet does. love how it works on me and very easy to use</li>
    <li> Although use of this product is a little sloppy, the hair removed with it took a longer time to grow back than the shaved areas.    If you can successfully use this product without getting the wax all over you, then I strongly recommend its use.</li>
    <li> Veet changed the formula for their strips from great to terrible. The new formula is very sticky and it leaves behind a major mess on your skin. Now I have to find a new brand. blah.</li>
    <li> this stuff is no joke , this was my first time waxing ever so all of your first timers be prepared.  It was very painful but that expected when your having your hair ripped out. Worked pretty well of the parts that I pulled fast enough. If you dont pull the strip off fast enough your going to have a big amount of wax left on your body so don&#x27;t fear the pain and pull and fast as you can. The wipes that come with the strips work pretty well , i had a big amount of wax left on my body and it got it right off , but baby oil will do just fine when you run out of wipes since there are only 5 for 40 strips.</li>
    <li> In my opinion the people who aren&#x27;t happy with this product simply don&#x27;t know how to wax.It does pull out all the hair. I bought mine at walgreens. The only issue that I have had with this is that the first couple of time it made my legs itchy. But now I thoroughly clean my legs with the wipes provided and put an aloe vera toner which soothes my skin.</li>
    <li> This is indeed a great product and I recommend this product to everyone. It&#x27;s really easy remove hair using this product and I love this product.</li>
    <li> Barely removes anything...and I&#x27;m not the hairy type</li>
    <li> This product is great and deserves 5 stars, not 3.5, at least for bikini lines (have not tried on legs). Every time I use it on my bikini line the results are better and better and the process becomes easier and less painful (not like its unbearable to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a terrible bikini line and a not so terrible body, but always felt self conscious in a bikini/underwear, even when  cleanly shaven because we all know that doesn&#x27;t look super clean. But these wax strips have done wonders and it appears totally seamless down there. The first couple times might not be that way but don&#x27;t give up because they have ultimately solved all my bikini line problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut the strips down to fifths or so. To remove excess wax when I run out of the towelettes I rub coconut oil on the offending areas which I believe may also reduce redness/irritation/ingrown hairs. Hope this helps someone with the same issue as me.</li>
    <li> They work great! I&#x27;ve been using them for 3 years! Saves me money and time from going to spas. No appointment necessary. I use them on my legs and armpits.</li>
    <li> You get lots of strips, the sugaring solution seems strong, easy to remove with the included oily pads or with olive oil.  Will purchase again.</li>

    <li> i am extremely pleased with my purchase, it is better than expected. Fast shipping, product in perfect condition, very good quality. would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a blogger recommendation who raved about them (as well as Veet&#x27;s liquid hair removers).  I have tried Veets liquid products in the past without success, so I decided to try this.  The first time I tried the strips, it was ok; it didn&#x27;t take off all the hair (on my lower legs). I thoroughly read lots of the reviews on here, so I did the whole holding the skin taut, etc.  However, I figured I&#x27;d have better luck on my second time around.  It&#x27;s been a month - two months, and I&#x27;ve used them 3 or 4 times now (still on my lower legs) and am not having any better results.  Not only does it not take all the hair out, I feel like it pulls new hairs out just enough to make my legs prickly. My legs feel less smooth after than before.  Not only that, but it takes about an hour to wax both legs!  Although shaving is a pain, at least after I spend the time to do it, I get instant smoothness.  This totally isn&#x27;t worth the time, trouble or money.  Looks like I&#x27;m back to shaving...</li>
    <li> I bought this product, intending to use it with the face strips to perform a bikini wax. Yes, I know it says it&#x27;s not supposed to be used for that purpose, but the product never got farther south than the front. I could handle the pain level, to a point. These strips remove more of the hair than the smaller face ones, which you&#x27;d think would be what you&#x27;d want to use in this case since they are, in fact, smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, what I ended up doing was cutting these strips into pieces and using them the normal way. They worked fairly well and I only had minor irritation for the rest of the day and overnight. It hurt, but it was manageable. I wish VEET would make a BIKINI/Brazilian product line of these strips that was specially designed for that purpose. I really don&#x27;t want to have to deal with all of the mess that comes with melting wax and applying it and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips DO work, you just have to work a bit for the result. I had to stop because it started to hurt so much, but there was a considerable amount of hair removed. I did notice that the wipes are basically baby oil-coated pieces of cloth. They&#x27;re oily and feel the same. If you run out of them, just use some baby oil. Its cheaper than buying many packs just for the wipes. Plus, after you shower, you can use the baby oil on your skin and it will lock in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, no matter what you do, do NOT put any sort of aloe or cooling gel on any part of your body that you used this product on for waxing. It stung like h*ll. I probably made a few mistakes in the waxing process, since I&#x27;ve never waxed before. But, despite the pain and irritation, I&#x27;m going to try again. Even if I can only get the front part free of hair, it&#x27;s less I have to shave later. I&#x27;m sure, with practice, I&#x27;ll be waxing like a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to any first-time waxers who want to see if waxing is for them. It&#x27;s a great product for waxing anything. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this product again. Mostly because you get more strips for less money AND you can cut them up into different sizes if you find that this length isn&#x27;t working.ips for less money AND you can cut them up into different sizes if you find that this length isn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> I tried using this on my legs and underarms, it didn&#x27;t work well. It just didn&#x27;t grab hold of my hairs. But it sure is good to use after plucking your eyebrows and cleaning up. Just cut them into strips and it would be good to use for your face.</li>
    <li> The best wax of its kind. Way better than Sally Hansen. Works great on legs and underarms.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Although it tends to stick to hands sometimes.</li>
    <li> I use these regularly on my legs &amp; they work well &amp; are much cleaner than \\&quot;real waxing\\&quot; at home. They are awesome for a quick hair removal last minute. I saw some other reviews on amazon with low ratings and they were mostly from people using them on sensitive areas of their bodies &amp; the packaging states where they should be used. Use these on your legs, nowhere else! Buy gentle face &amp; bikini waxes for those areas. The only downside is a little residue left behind at times, but the oil after wax wipes usually take off most of the little goo spots.</li>
    <li> If you want a form of torture this is the product for you. Talk about painful and oh yeah..they don&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> While it does get the job done, it can take repeated tries to do an adequate job.</li>
    <li> This item is easy to use and good if you have courser hair, it really grabs at those, but doesnt work so well for thinner hairs. When i tried using it on the thinner hairs it only grabbed at the surface and ripped off, it didnt pull out the entire hair. And also, it doesnt warm up well when you rub it with your hands, i turned my straightener on and warmed it by the heat it gave off, then it works fine. Ripping the opposite direction of hair growth also works WAY better than ripping the same direction as the package says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good product if you use it right, its not messy and the wax is easily washable compared to other salon waxes that stick FOREVER. Very convenient product.</li>
    <li> These wax strips are supposed to be for sensitive skin, which is what made me buy them in the first place, but these are just horrible. First off, I&#x27;m pretty these wax strips take off a layer of skin, not hair because my skin was bright red, stingy and irritated for a good while after, but most of my hair still remained.&lt;br /&gt;Second, they ARE messy, the wipes are useless, after I cleaned, or thought I cleaned, the wax off my leg with the wipe, my leg was still sticky and I practically had to wash another layer of skin off just to get all the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;So sorry I wasted my money. I&#x27;ll stick to shaving.</li>
    <li> I am usually a person who writes reviews but when I read few of the bad reviews about this wax strip I couldn&#x27;t stop my self .&lt;br /&gt;These THE BEST strips I have been using veet strips for long time couple of times I couldn&#x27;t find it so I went with Nair and Sally Hansen and I will never recommend these two .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these strips.</li>
    <li> Love these, they work so much better than other methods and I have diligently used all kinds. I&#x27;ll skip the backstory - just try these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sincere advice is to look up youTube tutorials (not reviews; actual instructionals from satisfied customers) about these specific Veet wax strips and follow the advice.  Somehow these strips are way less painful to me and more efficient than electric epilators, professioanl hard hot wax, supposed laser removal devices (and I won&#x27;t even mention chemical depilatory creams).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not affiliated with Veet or paid by them, I really want to keep my favorite products in business and production!</li>
    <li> It did not remove single hair (well it did remove one ;) ).&lt;br /&gt;plus it left wax all over my skin on my first try.&lt;br /&gt;it took around an hour to get that wax off my skin.....would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not very useful unfortunately, very harsh on skin</li>
    <li> This very hair remover is a great product to be used at home. I used it for both hand and leg waxing as well as under arms. The wipes helps clean the skin post waxing  and leaved you with such clean and smooth skin. A perfect solution to save those extra bucks from waxing in a salon. And yes, it&#x27;s very simple to use without any mess. I have used to twice and still have lots of left. All at such a low price. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I have been using veet for a long time and tried the wax when it first came out and decided to go back to using it.. my legs were fine then i did my arms and under arms.. under my arm it left bumps and on my arm it left me burned..  i know how to use it so i know i did it right. But it hurt so bad till i have been coating the burns in cocoa butter for a week now.. the scabs are falling off but now i have discoloration where it was burned.. :(</li>
    <li> These are legit. I bought this to wax my back. I was able to do it with just 4 strips, it&#x27;s now smooth and hairless. You can also use each strip a couple of times before it looses it stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Tip: Use a hair dryer to heat up the wax, it makes it nice at hot.</li>
    <li> Please ignore all good reviews !!!!!!! I followed the directions to a t and .... Not a single piece of hair came off. Not a single one. All it did was leave the unwanted hair sticky with glue that you can not get off. Not even with those supposed magic wipes they give you which are are dry as he&#x27;ll.&lt;br /&gt;I care about you. Please don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I used to go get waxing service on a regular basis (bi-monthly). I tried Veet and now I save 90% doing this myself. A must have. Read the directions if you are waxing for the first time. Pulling tight is a must.</li>
    <li> I got tired of shaving day after day (I have thick coarse hair that you can still see even after shaving smooth, which doesn&#x27;t last long and will be prickly again within hours of getting out of the shower) so I decided I&#x27;d try hair removal. I used an epilator at first, and while it worked fine, it took a couple hours to remove everything from my legs and half the hairs were snapped instead of pulled. Wanting something a tad bit quicker, I turned to wax strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used Veet Wax Strips, I was hesitant. I applied the strip, and (what I thought was) quickly removed it. It left a mess behind, only grabbed a couple of hairs, and I had to remove a layer of skin just to get all the wax off, because the oily pads they give you don&#x27;t do anything to that much wax.  I figured they were a waste and banished them to the bathroom cupboard until I started questioning my pulling technique and looked around online until I found a video demonstration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out I was definitely pulling too slow, and at the wrong angle as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I applied one again, ripped it off as fast and low as humanly possible, and low and behold, they worked perfectly. Everything they touched came off, and no wax was left behind on my legs. The very little that did end up on my skin was easily wiped away with the oily pads, and my legs were smoother than they&#x27;ve ever been in my entire life. I ended up only being able to do the bottom halves of my legs with the entire box though (I&#x27;m sure that will change when I learn to be more efficient with the wipes) but I will be ordering this product in the future for all my waxing needs.</li>
    <li> Does not remove hair at all, hasn&#x27;t removed one yet</li>
    <li> These are pretty good wax strips. If you&#x27;re doing it correctly (putting them on, smoothing them in the direction of your hair growth, then ripping it out FAST in the opposite direction of your hair growth) they&#x27;re pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They won&#x27;t catch every single hair though. These are great for the price, but don&#x27;t expect to be 100% hairless at the end.</li>
    <li> OK, my bad, I was thinking any strip can pull those tiny hairs away, but instead it works the best with 1 inch or so hairs.</li>
    <li> So I just finished waxing 3/4 of my lower leg before I gave up on them. I have pretty thick course leg hair and it didn&#x27;t really take much of them off.  But on the inside and towards the back of my calf where the hair is softer and fewer it worked pretty good. It got a lot of the roots but it also broke many really short.  Surprisingly it didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I thought it would.  I have only had my eye brows waxed before and that doesn&#x27;t feel to good so I was kinda worried.  I will probably just go to a salon and have them done professionally so I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the hair I missed.  But  the wipes took the excess wax right off for me. I missed and few spots and just rubbed the oil that was still on my leg over the area and it took it right off.</li>
    <li> As per Veet marketing, I should have grown a penis by the time my hair grew back. I am horribly disappointed as I expected to become a man so I could make my own choices and not apologize for natural body functions at every turn in my day to day life.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, Veet has not delivered. I am still being forced to wax every 1.5, 2 weeks if I don&#x27;t want to be publicly shamed and scorned by my sexual partners.</li>
    <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. I gave veet leg and body hair remover cold wax strips a 5 because I just love them. They are well as they say cold to use but they have a great scent and did not burn me at all. I was left with soft, clean fresh smelling legs.</li>
    <li> I have used wax strips before, so I didn&#x27;t think it would be painless, but this was horrific! The wax is so gummy that it won&#x27;t pull off quickly and cleanly. It tugs and sticks. Also, the included wipes are useless. They are like wax paper with oil on them. I tried to use one, and it was even more of a mess than the wax was. I will go back to using the Sally Hansen brand.</li>
    <li> What a fabulous product I have found in your home waxing kit! I was actually lasered many moons ago and have no need for your product, but I have met a lovely man who was the perfect candidate for some at-home hair removal. He&#x27;s a charming lad with no hair atop his head, so imagine my surprise when I discovered his chest was just bedazzled with a wiry mess of tendrils. Now I find him overwhelmingly attractive either way, but he expressed a desire to remove the hair as he currently spends a great deal of time grooming and it gets in the way of other important tasks, such as drinking beer and watching basketball. I knew my mission. I was to find a product that was both effective and virtually pain-free. Not totally pain-free, however. I knew it would be fun to be just a little sadistic. It&#x27;s early in our relationship, and I&#x27;m sure one day, I will enjoy inflicting pain a bit more. Anyway, we went together to make the purchase. We decided it best if he imbibed a bit of alcohol before waxing commenced. Five beers and three shots of cinnamon whiskey seemed to be the perfect amount! We did a test strip, which he thought was particularly rough. It didn&#x27;t hurt me a bit though. I had the idea to cover him in all the strips, then rip them all off in close succession. I knew if I got them all on him, there would be no turning back! I covered my man friend in these handy little strips. I wasn&#x27;t even that careful. It wasn&#x27;t MY body, so who cares? I began to rip them off, one by one. He cried out in pain, but it was so much fun, I did not care. No sissy boys for me! Imagine my awe and delight when I pulled the final strip off and he was free of his man-fur! And there was barely any blood at all! There was some minor scarring and some of his skin peeled off, but all in all, it went very well. I can&#x27;t wait &#x27;til next week. Me and my VEET strips are plannin&#x27; a trip South, if ya know what I mean :-)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It gets all over somehow and will not be removed easily even with the &amp;#34;perfect finish&amp;#34; pads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t remove hair well, is VERY prone to making patchiness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-painful without the effectiveness of real wax</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I bought so I could prank my friends. They now have random bald spots on their legs.</li>
    <li> The wax strips are really effective. It works smoothly and almost painlessly on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;Its very easy to use and comes with moisturizing strips after waxing. I bought this twice</li>
    <li> Horrible pain! Literally left red strips on my legs along with hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where to start.. I&#x27;ve been using these Veet ready to use strips for the past 6 months and I must say, that&#x27;s all I use now! It&#x27;s VERY convenient, and great for the price too. It&#x27;s easy to use and the results are awesome - leaving me smooth and soft for at least 3 weeks, and when the hair finally comes out, it comes out thinner and not everywhere like it normally would with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;To save time, I usually apply 4-6 strips at a time all over and then start pulling them off one after the other. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and I&#x27;ve even recommended it to a couple of my friends who loved it as well! Waxing beats shaving any day of the week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a monthly subscription that gets delegated on time and it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because I figured it would save me time and money by doing my waxing at home. However when I got the item which was delivered in a timely manner, I tried to use it, I did as instructed and it did not work, it was really really messy and the wax and oil stuck to my skin and I had such a difficult time getting it off, it removed NO hairs and I was really really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Worked great on my legs knees down, but thighs and bikini line not so much. :( Oh well was worth a shot</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and searched demonstrations on YouTube before I purchase this product. It works perfectly fine and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Do you hate yourself? Do you have a deep fear that the natural hair growth on your body brings your gender into question? Then this product is for you! Don&#x27;t take my word for it; just ask Veet&#x27;s ad campaign!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying this brand of wax strip- there&#x27;s no mess like there is with the pots of wax (UNLESS you pull the strip off too slowly, then it will leave some goop on your leg, but you can get it off with one of the baby oil wipes). Two strips are stuck together by the wax (you use BOTH) and you warm up the wax by rubbing the back of the strips quickly in your palms, then you pull them apart.  I usually stick one down and then the other and then rip them up in the same order I put them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To reuse a strip, I hold it sticky-side-up over a 3-wick candle for about 3 seconds and then smooth it down over another part of my leg.  I can usually do this 3 or 4 times before the strip isn&#x27;t as usable and starts trying to leave behind residue (if you try this, don&#x27;t leave it over the candle too long to warm the wax, it&#x27;ll clump the wax).  Strips are not able to be stored once you have pulled them apart, as the wax will obviously lose its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand really does work on short hair-- a week and a half/ two weeks of growth can be pulled up easily.</li>
    <li> It does work and the strips are a good size.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, you need to wait anywhere from 2-3 weeks without shaving before your (leg, presumably) hair is long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, it didn&#x27;t really work on my ankles and I didn&#x27;t bother on my thighs since that hair grows much slower. It comes with a few wipes that really do take away the leftover wax on the skin but there are only 6 wipes. My advice is to wait a few weeks, wax everything at once and then use a wipe or two to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good first time wax.</li>
    <li> I read these reviews and almost didn&#x27;t buy it. But I decided to try it out because I needed something over the counter that did a good job since I was going to an impropmptu pool party and didnt have time to make a waxing appt. I was very skeptical but the product works great. The key to make this a 5-star product is to APPLY TALC POWDER BEFORE USING. You can also use pain ol&#x27; generic foot powder as well.I applied this about 8 times through out waxing my bikini line. Don&#x27;t be afraid to do more. Make sure your skin is completely free of oil, water, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the talc powder was the difference because I used a strip on a large section without it ( I thought I applied  too much powder so I didn&#x27;t think I needed it.) Boy was I wrong! It was a hot/humid day and my skin was pretty moist the wax ended up getting gooey and stuck on my skin. The strip also didn&#x27;t take off any hair. (*another tip --use Olive oil to take gooey wax off your skin :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So once I used plenty of powder and got most of the hair off, I plucked the last remaining bit and I was good to go! By the way having to pluck at the end does not mean the product is bad. I pay $75 for my Brazilian waxes and even then my cosmetologist ends up plucking at the end as well to get perfectly smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you go! A 5-start product as long as you use it correctly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those women who was blessed with the darkest, coarsest leg hair, which begins to stubble literally as soon as I finish shaving. The second I step out of the hot shower, I get goosebumps and might as well have not bothered shaving at all. So, I have been looking around at other hair removal methods for summertime, but have been intimidated by wax strips of other brands. My sister (who has sparse, blonde leg hair) uses the Sally Hansen strips, and not only does the later redness look painful (it usually lasts a full day), but she has to go back over her legs several times to get even half the hair off. I vowed to never even attempt those!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I did some intense research before deciding on a product, and these Veet strips seemed to have great overall reviews. Despite my first impression of wax strips, I picked up a box of these yesterday to try. After a bit of stalling, I warmed up the first strip and got ready to wax! It didn&#x27;t necessarily feel pleasant, but I would call it more of an annoying sting than pain. Keep in mind, this was my first time waxing my legs, so I was probably more sensitive than those who have waxed before. There was virtually no wax left on my legs (just a little where the bottom edge of the strip was placed), and the slight redness lasted less than an hour. I only had to use one clean-up pad per leg, and even that was mostly to see how well they worked (if they got the minimal leftover wax, if they burned at all, if they left my legs shiny like the ad boasted). The pads did leave my legs super smooth and shiny, but my only complaint is that the floral/clean fragrance of them wasn&#x27;t amazing. It wasn&#x27;t bad, it just reminded me of my grandmother&#x27;s perfume. The good thing is that the smell is easily covered with scented lotion. Anyway, this wax kit definitely exceeded my expectations and was easy for a first-timer. I will try to update in the future about the long-term use of these.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! So first of all, I got these to use on my legs, and haven&#x27;t tried them elsewhere yet. I had 5 laser treatments on my legs, but still had a lot of hair growing back (thick, dark hair), and shaving just leaves me miserably itchy, so that wasn&#x27;t an option. I knew I wanted to try wax strips, but I was terrified!!! I finally got the guts to try these though, and I am SO glad I did! The hair was really long (2 months of growth), so maybe that helped me, but when I pulled that first strip off, eyes closed and ready to scream, I was just confused! I mean, I barely felt anything! So, I looked down, expecting to see no hair removed, and the strip took all but one straggler from the area I had placed it! Holy cow!!!! Excitedly I did the rest of my lower legs, with almost no pain except around the knees and ankles, and even that wasn&#x27;t bad. I never even flinched! Plus, I could use each strip several times. The first leg I used a new strip each time, but the second I used 4 strips total for the whole lower leg. The strips left very little wax behind, and what they did leave wiped off easily with the included wipes, although I&#x27;m sure baby oil would work just as well. Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with these strips, and I&#x27;ll absolutely be stocking up more! Loved them :)</li>
    <li> Terrible!! Left all my hair but left a sticky mess behind that I can&#x27;t remove. I tried their wipes that are supposed to remove it but it&#x27;s not working. I tried nail polish remover. I just can&#x27;t get it off!! I&#x27;m now a bright red, sticky, hairy mess. Garbage product. No way those 5 star reviews are all real.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent. I actually use this for my face (even though the box says you&#x27;re not supposed to) It works! but definitely take a little bit of practice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never waxed or had anything waxed ever before (I&#x27;m 45) but shaving my legs is getting old (too).  I&#x27;m also pretty cheap, so I did my research and ordered these.  First: ouch.  I think my legs are quite sensitive.  I will never be able to get a tattoo.  Second: it takes a little practice, but he second leg had many fewer left-behind strays.  Third: I think these were pretty easy to use, eventually, and did a decent job.  They are a little messy if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I used almond oil afterwards to get rid of the little stickies.  My legs were covered with red dots for about 12 hours, but now they&#x27;re fine, and fairly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips would be to use a little talcum powder in a cool room (moisture does NOT help things), and take your time.  After pulling the strips apart, I was able to get two uses out of the printed strip (the one I think you&#x27;re supposed to use) and one use out of the other strip, so this is a pretty good deal.  I&#x27;ve got a lot of strips left.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t make much of a mess, and does a pretty good job of hair removal.</li>
    <li> I love these wax strips. I have been using them for years and years and they have never failed me and I have tried others along the way and nothing lives up to these!</li>
    <li> I cannot shave my bikini line without getting terrible bumps and ingrown hairs, so I have been getting professional waxes for years.  I&#x27;ve tried both the plastic variety of strips and the cold wax that you slather on (i.e. nads) but I just didn&#x27;t like either.  The liquid was messy and didn&#x27;t come off completely and the strips didn&#x27;t conform to the body so patches of hair were left behind.  For my upcoming vacation, I decided to try these Veet strips and I have to say I was impressed.  I think with practice I will get neater and quicker with it, but for a first time, I thought it was great.  I will definitely be using these from now on and saving myself a lot money on professional waxes.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome and so easy. You just rub them between your hands to heat them up, and that&#x27;s all it needs. If you smooth it down right, and in the right direction, it will get everything.</li>
    <li> The wax is extremely sticky. It did not wash off my skin even after a shower, stay away from this product if you have sensitive skin. But my main complaint is the fact that this product does not work and the wax  has an unpleasant odor, similar to old play dough.</li>
    <li> Just okay. I prefer the cream hair remover to this.</li>
    <li> My gf waxed my back with it and it worked lol.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and it is effective. I could do hands and legs in few minutes. Will use it next time also.</li>
    <li> Two thumbs up. It was the brand I used to use during college days in Denmark. I am so glad to find it again online. I used today first time after my last usage in Europe almost 20 years ago. Much better quality and design than the American equivalents, so are many household items. European light industrial products have much higher qualities than their American, Chinese, or Taiwanese counterparts.</li>
    <li> This is product is very good for for cleaning legs and hands both and i can use it for underarms also.</li>
    <li> My experience with these was so terrible I had to come and review them.  I chose these over the other brands available in the store because it was the best price per strip.  I used the entire 40 count box on my lower legs and had to go back for another box, at which time I bought a box of Nads cold wax strips to finish the rest of my legs and bikini area.  The Veet strips left a LOT of hair behind and were very sticky to use.  I had to use the post-wax wipes while waxing because my hands got so sticky.  I had to wait until the next day to wax again and still not all of the hair came off.  I spent a lot of time plucking.  Furthermore, the strips are not really reusable.  After the first pull they lost all their stick and just yanked on the hair and skin instead of getting it off.  The Nads, while not formulated for sensitive skin, have a thicker layer of wax.  They do the job and they retained a bit more stick.  I&#x27;m glad I saved the Nads for the bikini area.  I wish I had bought more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for actually taking some hair off and for not giving me any allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> This product does not work on underarms at all, it just becomes a sticky mess which is very hard to get off without the wipes included. The wipes themselves work like magic, removing the wax residue completely, but feel very oily. The strips do work well on legs, and can be re-used many times, although they do get very messy/sticky/gross. On your legs does not hurt as much as expected, good for sensitive skin like mines.</li>
    <li> Never going back to hot wax again! These strips work great on my legs! As an Indian-American girl, my leg hair can be on the thicker side. I&#x27;ve been using hot wax at home (avoiding the salon costs) but it has always been such a hassle - reheating wax, never having the right ratio of wax to strips, and the dip-stick MESS of it all. THEN I found these strips.&lt;br /&gt;Do they work as well as hot wax? No. But they work well enough that I don&#x27;t need to mess with the hot wax again and it&#x27;s totally worth not necessarily getting every single hair perfectly removed to not have to deal with the hassles of hot wax. Plus if you don&#x27;t wait til the leg hair grows thick enough to look like you&#x27;re wearing a pair of leggings, these strips should suffice!&lt;br /&gt;You can do quick touch-ups whenever you need by either conveniently grabbing a cold wax strip OR using an epilator/razor (as opposed to needing to reheat a whole tub of wax and hoping you have more strips and dip sticks to pull out too).&lt;br /&gt;I find the price of these strips to be a bonus too since it&#x27;s more affordable than hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to reuse each strip twice per use and my legs come out fine.&lt;br /&gt;MY SPECIAL TIP: Instead of using my hands to rub heat into the wax strips as directed, I just use my blow dryer to give the strip a quick blast of heat. Hope that helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I haven&#x27;t tried these strips out on my armpits or bikini area so this review is only about leg waxing.)</li>
    <li> I used these Veet wax strips for months and had nothing but praise for them - they were so easy and convenient and removed the hair very well. Recently, however, I have not been pleased. The last three boxes I&#x27;ve purchased have not been worth it. Peeling the strips apart was nearly impossible as the wax would just stick to one side no matter what I did or how much I warmed them between my hands, and then I could barely get each strip to get one good pull (in the past I was able to use each strip 2-3 times) and often the wax would stick to my leg instead of coming off with the paper. I don&#x27;t know if they have recently changed something or if I have just gotten three awful boxes in a row, but I will not be purchasing these anymore.</li>
    <li> Having very thick, dark hair is great for your head, but not so great for other parts of the body.  I have to shave my legs constantly and this irritates my skin, especially in the winter.  The slightest stubble makes me itch so much.  I had hoped that waxing would break the itchy irritation cycle.  I patiently waited several days, enduring the stubble itch, before attempting to use these.  It hurt a lot coming off, but I was sad to see it did not remove a SINGLE hair.  I suppose the hair has to be longer for it work?  But there is no way I can wait weeks for it to grow out to remove.  Sure, it would be nice to smooth for a while, but not so nice to then endure weeks of hairiness.  That defeats the purpose to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on arms... my arm hair is not as thick as on the shins, and it was longer.  I was initially pleased, it seemed to work very well.  But only two days later I noticed stubble.  It APPEARS to work on my arms, the skin looks very smooth at first, but it is not actually removing the hair from the root.  Instead, it seems to be tearing it off at or near the surface of the skin.  It also leaves A LOT of sticky gunk that I have to really work to get off.  I may as well use an electric razor... less pain and less mess for the same result.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but it did not do its job. You basically have to use a whole box to just get your legs done and even then, theres patches of hair that remains. It does remove some hair but it does not get nearly enough off. I would save your time and money by suggesting letting a professional do it in 10 minutes which will also save you the pain and frustration of having to shave after using this product.</li>
    <li> I just have allegy when using this</li>
    <li> Best hair removal product I&#x27;ve ever used. Clean and fast. I finished my entire legs plus underarm in less than an hour. I used three boxes for all that.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t get warm enough with just hands. You can use a hair dryer or a heater to warm it up to the point where it works nicely.</li>
    <li> great this is useful for me. because i need this thing long time, and it is great. really good thing</li>
    <li> My bf bought these for me to try out and see how I liked them. Well we tested them out him first ;) He has a hairy upper back that he usually shaves or uses a creme to remove the hair. Long story short he let me use these on him and OMG they&#x27;re awesome! The hair came right out with no difficulty and it took a lot with it. I&#x27;m so pleased with the way they worked on him I can&#x27;t wait to use them myself!</li>
    <li> This product works well on my legs. I recommend this product. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, but it does work well for the most part.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I got it, I did what the directions told me to do and when I pulled it off only a tiny bit of hair came off!! I had patches of hair all over my legs!!!. I In did up useing about 30 on one of my legs and still had patches of hair. And your left with a sticky yucky mess!&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy it again!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely remove the hairs. Also the remaining wax on your body will stick to your skin and hardly removed.</li>
    <li> Not bad, price was great and you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Its an amazing product. The only thing im not a fan of is cleaning off the excess that occurs sometimes. That is my problem though.. not Veet&#x27;s haha. I am still new to waxing but wish I found these things earlier!</li>
    <li> Good product in theory. Overall worked good. But only comes with about 5 wipes to get wax off. If it gets on Anything else good look getting it off. Does leave rash some, but could be due to sensitive skin. I like them for my legs.</li>
    <li> I know this is my first wax strip, but when i followed the instructions and few tips from the reviews it didn&#x27;t do much. It left me messy wax on my legs that took a while to get it clean and no hair was removed....</li>
    <li> Tried to use this product on my underarms and wasn&#x27;t successful it didn&#x27;t remove any of the hair. Haven&#x27;t tried to use them anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve get professionally waxed with sensitive skin wax on a regular basis but has never waxed myself. Decided to try this product and I liked it! It didn&#x27;t hurt much and was VERY easy to use.</li>
    <li> after first using this product i thought i was doing it wrong NO it just doesnt work that well and it hurts and its not sensitive it hurts</li>
    <li> easy to use and nice product!</li>
    <li> I tried cheaper brand and it didn&#x27;t work at all! So I wasn&#x27;t sure about this item,but it worked great! I have a lot and thick hair.</li>
    <li> Oh...my god. Painful! Pulled 1 hair, left sticky residue on my body. The wipe didn&#x27;t work to remove it. I ended up shaving and the residue was still on me after I showered. Had to use baby oil to remove it. Don&#x27;t buy!!!!!</li>
    <li> I dislike shaving my legs, so I finally decided to try an alternate defoliation technique and ordered these strips. They&#x27;re nicely affordable and pretty easy to use -- on my legs, anyway. You can reuse each strip two or three times. But LORDY are they ever sticky, and the stickiness doesn&#x27;t come off with plain soap and water! You will need more wipes than come with this package, before you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another word of warning -- for these to work best, you need to pull your skin fairly taut before yanking them off. This is no problem with self-applying on your legs. But under your arms, you&#x27;re working one-handed, and it&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother issue! Either you&#x27;ll want to find someone you know intimately enough to handle your side-boob, or you&#x27;ll end up like me, having to try multiple times and ending up with your arms glued down to your side until you can get the wipes. STILL I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Left waaaaay too much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was about 50/50 removal versus hair left standing. It also leave a LOT so sticky residue.  The inclusive wipes help but I still had a waxy film on my legs the rest of the day. Very disappointed in the hair removal outcome. Gave up after 3 strips were used. I still had to shave and each pore was bright red and angry the remainder if the day.</li>
    <li> Says 40 strips...only got 20.  Yay overspending!</li>
    <li> I love Veet wax strips. I&#x27;ve used so many different types of wax strips, nair, shaving, etc. I have to say these are by far the easiest to use and my personal favorite. (Well, shaving is easier, but the results don&#x27;t last long and I have thick dark hair, so it needs to last! And if you miss a spot with nair, you either pluck or shave anyways, and if you aren&#x27;t careful you get chemical burns that irritate the skin for weeks! Plus nair smells!)&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I would highly recommend these to women that have no problem with self-waxing. Yes, you will feel pain, but compared to other wax strips, it&#x27;s nothing.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;m using wax strips. Decided to try this product because it got postive reviews and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with heating wax. It does gets some hair but not enough for me. Also it leaves behind such a sticky mess. Guess I&#x27;m going to have to try a different product I&#x27;m more satifsy with.</li>
    <li> This product really did not work for me. I have medium thick hair and I know how to properly wax my legs. I tried this product because I get a little nervous that I&#x27;ll overheat normal wax and end up with blisters. These strips didn&#x27;t do anything except leave a whole bunch of wax behind. The cleaning sheets didn&#x27;t work at all either. I tried using nail polish remover which got most of it but there was still too much left behind. It was about 2 or 3 days before it all finally came off. Definitely not purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I used the strips on both my bikini line and my legs and found them to be more effective on the coarser bikini line hairs than on my legs. I am pregnant so needed my husband&#x27;s help with the bikini line and he had no trouble cutting the strips, warming them and using them. He even commented on how easy it was. Multiple applications were not necessary on the bikini line.     I found that doing my legs was more trouble than it was worth. It honestly takes less time to just shave them. I also have to agree with others that it did not grab all of the leg hair and multiple applications were necessary for my legs.    Pros:  Fabric and flexible  Works like a dream on coarse bikini hair  Warms very easily when rubbed between your hands  Cuts to size easily  The oil after care wipes really do take the wax off,  just be patient    Cons:  Not good on finer leg hair    Overall: I would buy them again to do my bikini line but I would suggest looking for another option if you have fine to normal leg hair.</li>
    <li> There is a learning curve you have to go through. I didn&#x27;t do very well the first time and it hurt like hell for a day. I tried it again after my hair grew back and had very good result. This gets the root of the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave black dots like shaving. Last longer and cost less than buying razors all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Trim the hair. Take a pair of scissor and trim the hair to about half a centimeter.&lt;br /&gt;2. Shower so you can get rid of sweat and product you use on the skin. Have warm water running on the spot so the hair loosen.&lt;br /&gt;3. Dry the spot and use baby powder if need.&lt;br /&gt;4. Find something warm to put the wax on after rubbing are you will get waxes everywhere. I used my computer charger to keep it warm in between. Cut the piece if need. I cut them in to 4 so I end up having 8 for each strip. Smaller piece hurt less.&lt;br /&gt;5. Rub the direction the hair grows and pull the opposite way.&lt;br /&gt;6. Use the wipes provide or for me I used baby oil with a cotton ball. This works good as well if you run out of wipes.&lt;br /&gt;7. Don&#x27;t put anything on the skin except oils.&lt;br /&gt;8. Don&#x27;t think you can get every hair so use tweezers for some that are left over</li>
    <li> I used to spend hundreds of dollars at salon every month just to get rid of unwanted hair on my body.&lt;br /&gt;Now no more salon visit for waxing. Thanks to \\&quot;Veet Leg and Body Hair Remover Cold Wax Strips\\&quot;. Its so easy to use it. Moreover once waxed, the hair grow back no sooner than a month. Also i m no more dependent on salon working hours. I can use these strips anytime and anywhere. And after waxing, the skin feels so smooth. This product comes with 6 wipes. These wipes removes the leftover wax so effectively and leaves the skin feather soft. One more important thing about these wax strips is that they can be reused, so with one strip u can wax half of a leg.&lt;br /&gt;Just one thing to be taken care of is that these strips are cold waxed. So these need constant rubbing with hands while waxing to help the wax remain warm.&lt;br /&gt;I simply love this product. It helps me flaunt my sexy legs and body. I am always ready with my mini dresses and shorts :P&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to every girl out there coz u have got nothing to lose but your unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> This piece of crap ONLY came with 18ct. ready to use wax strips....NOT 40!! AND the box was all torn open! I would of gave it 0 out of 5 stars, but i couldn&#x27;t! These \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; didn&#x27;t help me for s***!</li>
    <li> so these are $11.49 at my local cvs, which isn&#x27;t terrible. I&#x27;m a guy and I use these on my thighs and butt and omfg so smooth and perfect. they do hurt, but it&#x27;s not like screaming pain. very easy to use and they come with these wipes that take off any leftover wax and clean your skin. halelujah amen.</li>
    <li> This worked great for me. I would recommend this product to all the ladies out there. this is more cost effective then the salon.</li>
    <li> LOVE these! They are inexpensive but work so well, a lot easier than traditionally heating up wax and making a mess transferring it onto your body. Clean, easy, and accurate with amazing results!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair well at all.</li>
    <li> These strips are okay. They take off most of your hairs. I was not expecting it to take off that many, but it did. You can also save strips by cutting them in half and reusing them 2-3 times before using another one. It takes around 3-4 strips for my legs and works well in removing most of the hairs.</li>
    <li> These work for me.  I just follow the instructions and it is very effective.</li>
    <li> It worked surprisingly well!! Just make sure to use it on your legs only...</li>
    <li> Compared to the Sally&#x27;s version, this has a slight synthetic fragrance, and personally I would prefer no smell unless it&#x27;s a natural smell. I feel like the wax is softer and less effective at sticking to hairs, but this is significantly cheaper because of how many strips they provide.</li>
    <li> I use these wax strips because I find it to be less of a mess. I stick them in the microwave for 20-30 seconds before peeling them apart and I use them fast. Being the penny pincher that I am, I try to use it a couple more times. They work pretty well for the first pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They definitely work a lot better for me sticking them in the microwave vs rubbing the wax strips between my hands. They get most of the hairs off.</li>
    <li> it obviously works but i think it should come with more strips. unless you have done it b4 i suggest you DO NOT DO YOUR UNDERARMS!!! IT HURTS LIKE H*LL! but aside from that i liked them.</li>
    <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like this product: for one it hurt a bit, and two she didn&#x27;t like the feel of her legs afterwards.</li>
    <li> A total waste of money.  It doesn&#x27;t really remove the hair.  I had to repeat the process several times just to get the hair removed from one small area on my leg.</li>
    <li> not sure where these come from, but they are different from the ones I used to get from the store, they work the same though, packaging is different</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought they would but they&#x27;re&lt;br /&gt;okay.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  You have to be VERY careful when using it because the wax/glue/stuff will NOT come off if you get it on fabric/towels - but when used correctly, does a great job of removing hair.  These was strips are a little too &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; to use on your face, but they are great for legs/underarms.  A bit of advice.... as soon as you wax, slather on a bunch of organic coconut oil - it&#x27;ll help get rid of any was residue, soothe the irritated skin and moisturize with minimal bumps/redness.</li>
    <li> These wax strips are great but do not come with enough post was removal pads.  They are very very sticky and regular soap does not remove the remaining wax.  It is a very good deal as you get quite a few strips per package.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews. Not only did these wax strips not work but they still hurt even when not removing hair and they leave your legs so very sticky. The after wipes don&#x27;t work. They are very, very oily and didn&#x27;t remove the wax at all. My skin was red and a little sore to the touch but not a single hair was removed. I ended up having to shave anyway. I bought these at my local Walmart for about 8 bucks. That 8 bucks was completely wasted. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this instead of the Sally Hansen strips, the texture of the Veet wax strip is great, but the wax sticks to the skin a lot if you are not efficient/decisive in pulling it (hence the \\&quot;good\\&quot; if someone else helps you) --plus I didn&#x27;t like that they include only 6 wipes to remove leftover wax since there are (40 wax strips). These wipes are very similar to those wet hand wipes.     Summary: You get 40 wax strips, the texture of the strip is great (not plastic smooth), con: the wax sticks to the skin/pulls and is thus more painful---Unless you pull w/out hesitation (or someone helps you).</li>
    <li> my friends still laugh at me because of this.. these work OK for the legs. not painful, sometimes a little sticky. after doing my legs i thought i would try to make my lady bits smooth. if i would have read the box it says DO NOT USE ON THE BIKINI AREA!.. i didnt read the box. instead i propped up my leg on the toilet seat and slapped that strip on my overgrown jungle of love. deep breath 3...2...1..PULL! the strip didnt budge at all. i pulled again. the wax strip slowly and painfully pulled away from my skin. tears filled my eyes. all the wax from the strip was still in my pubic hairs. ALL OF IT. i ran naked threw the house looking for my phone. i called my friend for advice. the act of running smooshed everything together, effectively gluing it into a painful mash of hair and shame. my friend was no help at all. i got in the tub and tried in vain to wash it off but i just ended up smearing sticky wax onto my legs and then onto the tub. at this point i could even get out of the tub because the warm water made the wax stickier. thats right- my lady bits got all glued together, glued shut, and glued to the tub floor. i tried to use a razor and that was useless. eventually my boyfriend came home and found me. after laughing at me for 20 mins he suggested i use the oily single use anti-wax wipes that came with the wax strips. since i didnt read the box, i didnt even know i had these handy. i used them all. it worked ok and smelled like horrible dollar store perfume. my bits were left red, angry, swollen, and smelling like flowers. on the bright side, my friends got a good laugh out of it.</li>
    <li> I think the people giving this product 1 star are the competition trying to poopoo this product, there is no way this doesn&#x27;t work!  I&#x27;ve used everything over the course of 3 decades, (including the Emjoi, my surefire hair remover except it&#x27;s too slow).  This stuff is amazing!  You peel, put in on and pull it off, in seconds, just that fast you&#x27;re hair free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hispanic with thick hair and waxing is my only real option, but using wet waxes at salons is too expensive. This is cleaner and faster than any wet wax, other strips, or the Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can warm it in your hands like it says, but even if you don&#x27;t, it still works.  I tested it. It&#x27;s as sticky at wet wax with hair, but not the skin, so you won&#x27;t get bruised.  No burns, either, since you never heat it.  I wish I had this stuff when I was a teenager, you can imagine the trauma I would have avoided!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use another product again for established hair. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: you can&#x27;t use it for short hair though, wax needs to hold onto something.  If you&#x27;re hair is barely visible (stubble), use the Emjoi, it grabs even invisible hairs.  Otherwise, this product is the bomb!</li>
    <li> Wax did not grip any hair. I ended up throwing 3/4 of the box away.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm every time.</li>
    <li> I started using wax strips because I had some skin troubles after using razors on my sensitive skin. I like that these are ready to use so there&#x27;s no mess and the results last longer than shaving. Only downside is that waxing can be pretty painful. The price of beauty!</li>
    <li> - Works perfectly on legs&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work on underarms&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts about 1 - 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;- Nice rose velvet smell&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves leg red, soft and silky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read a more detailed version here: http://ireviewuread.com/post/86694064153/veet-suprem-essence-ready-to-use-wax-strips-review</li>
    <li> Works great on my legs as long as you follow instructions.  I still prefer going to a professional to get waxed or just shave my legs..  It was very time consuming.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grip hair very well. Product only removed small portion of leg hair.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet. But I get a friend recommend it to me strongly.I think the price is acceptable. I&#x27;ll try and see if it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> My wife is very disappointed it leaves your skin very sticky that even a water cant washed off and didnt even take off the hair...she followed the instruction and it didnt removed all hair but a sticky one on all areas she applied. We&#x27;ll definetely not to buy this one again. Just thought that this is the best hair remover wax. My wife just used the nair its more way better than veet.</li>
    <li> cheaper than getting it done!</li>
    <li> These strips don&#x27;t work good at all I wouldnt recommend these to anyone</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use these on my legs, when I try to it usually doesn&#x27;t work so I don&#x27;t know about that. But I cut them into small pieces and use them to wax my eyebrows at home, it&#x27;s very easy and VERY cheap! That salon was getting outrageous, and one sheet lasts forever. I&#x27;ve had this package since last summer and I still have a ton of sheets left. It rips out my thick black eyebrow hair and keeps it away for a while. This is just a tip for you all, if you have any left over wax on you just use baby oil to get it off! I was 10 minutes away from having a meeting to go to and couldn&#x27;t get the wax off and I would&#x27;ve liked to know this before I started 😂</li>
    <li> IF the right conditions are met, this products works pretty well. Dry legs? Don&#x27;t even try it...all you&#x27;ll get is dead cells on the wax strip. Short hairs? Don&#x27;t try it then either. The wax strip won&#x27;t get hold of the hairs. Wax left behind? The package includes wax removal towelettes but there are only a few in the box. I would like to purchase just the towelettes to carry me through using the entire box of wax strips.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions word-for-word and even watched a demo video. These strips were completely worthless. They pulled a few hairs and left the majority. After using a handful of strips and seeing that it wasn&#x27;t working, I gave up. My legs are currently full of red bumps (which I expected and have no problem with) and PATCHES of hair that was not pulled. I had such high hopes for this product, but was completely disappointed. PLEASE save your time and money and DO NOT buy this product!</li>
    <li> I have 6+ years of regular waxing experience that I used to do at home with real wax. I&#x27;ve tried wax strips before and decided to try these out. I highly recommend using them on wider surface areas like your legs, back, chest only. I say this because your underarms are really sensitive and the strips are too big to place just half of it onto your armpit and rip off. It can leave red marks and eventual dark discoloration because its easy to remove it wrong. On your legs, it&#x27;s no problem because the strip spans all of the skin. A nice way to heat up the strip also is to use a blow dryer. It gets the wax more fluid in my opinion and less will remain stuck to your skin afterwards. It&#x27;s kind of a waste to use this strips for minimal hair removal and better for when you want to remove a lot that&#x27;s growing at once. Remember to apply friction by rubbing the strip after it&#x27;s placed on your skin. Hold/tug the skin above the strip (up) towards your body and pull the strip as fast as you can towards the same direction (up). Never leave strips on your body for a long time. You should stick, rub, peel and not pause in between. Overall, I think these strips will come in handy on trips and on days where I can&#x27;t afford to spend time epilating or waxing. It&#x27;s great on the go and fairly inexpensive.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews i decided to purchase this wax strips....it worked no better than any of those i used previously. I ended up throwing it away. save time and money and purchase a hair removal cream instead, works much better.</li>
    <li> Helps in easy hair removal, I would recommend they included more easy wipes to get rid of extra wax soon. The wax does not come off with water or soap or anything else.</li>
    <li> Sticks to everything but the hair! Works okay on legs with a few passes but anywhere else just makes the area sticky and a huge mess to clean. The wipes that come with help a bit after using the stripes but don&#x27;t get everything.</li>
    <li> when I first was using this product it was working well but as I kept going the wax started getting sticky and wouldn&#x27;t remove hair anymore accept in patches and when I finally just gave up I was left with this huge mess of wax all over me. Not a good buy</li>
    <li> They are easy to use but very little hair comes off when you pull off the strip.</li>
    <li> It may get a few long hairs but basically does not work!  Also the other Veet product does not work. I should have sent both back but&lt;br /&gt;did not.  Another purchase sitting in the closet!</li>
    <li> So far so good! If you&#x27;re looking for a quick and easy way to get rid of unwanted hair, I highly recommend this (Veet Leg and Body Hair Remover Cold Wax Strips):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy instructions right on the box, no microwave necessary, no mess, warm strips between hands, can each strip multiple times until stickiness is gone (I used the same one strip for full arms about 4-5 pulls).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The after-wipes are okay, don&#x27;t seem to take off everything and they are one-time use so you only have the handful that are in the box. Nair&#x27;s face wax strips come w/ little bottles of oil which can be used many times with a cotton ball or cue tip and get everything off.</li>
    <li> Okay, I bought these awhile back (6-7 yrs ago) and worked perfectly fine on my underarms. I&#x27;ve been applying hot wax instead, but it darken my underarms; so I decided to look for these to buy again. I was surprised of how many bad reviews there were for these Veet Cold Wax Strips. Anyways, I ignored the bad reviews and purchased this item. When I first applied it to my underarms, it didn&#x27;t pull out any hair and it left a mess (a big gooey mess)!!!!!!!!!  I was disappointed! It seems like the company changed their formula or something. I didn&#x27;t want to give up on these wax strips, so I rested it in the freezer for 5 mins. I took it out and let it thaw for 60 seconds, then tried it one more time. Again, it didn&#x27;t work!!! The wax strip had only two strands of hair and this time it had a burning sensation (because it was cold?!??). Frustrated, I threw it in my drawer and came upon it a month later. This time I rested one of the Veet Wax Strip in the freezer overnight. I took it out the next night, let it thaw for 5mins, I cut it in thirds, applied it to my underarms and to my surprised it worked!! Yes, I didn&#x27;t waste my money after all! Btw, the finishing wipes smells good and works perfectly to get rid of wax residue.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Veet Cold Wax Strips Leg and Body 40- Count! And when I finally received them I had only 19 in the box I wondered why the box was all smooched didn&#x27;t think nothing of it until I decided to count it, I was sooooooo DISAPPOINTED! :(</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the Rachael Ray show and decided to buy it for myself and my daughters to try.  Since I have the fastest growing and thickest hair (and also because I&#x27;m a Mom and we&#x27;ll sacrifice ourselves for our kids!), I volunteered to be the guinea pig.  We warmed the strips, applied as directed, rubbed and then I held my skin down while my daughter ripped them off.  OUCH!  It hurt, but the pain subsided and it certainly was not unbearable.  It didn&#x27;t remove all of my hair, but my hair is INCREDIBLY thick, so I wasn&#x27;t really surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, what I was NOT prepared for is all of the INSTANT SPIDER VEINS that appeared!  I have NO varicose veins, which is the only thing the package warns about.  Of course, we stopped after using the first two strips and noticing the negative effect.  Then I googled the subject and found out that causing spider veins is a possible outcome of any waxing procedure.  I sure do wish I would have known this before I ruined my legs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product would probably work just fine for removing hair if all of the directions are followed, but please be aware of the possible side effect of spider veins!</li>
    <li> Ha the wax is very sticky and not so easy to clean. The effect is OK but not good as some hair remover cream I used before.</li>
    <li> Wow. I&#x27;ve used the Parissa strips, which are pretty good, and the Sally Hansen, which suck, but the Veet strips are great for underarms and legs. It&#x27;s very sticky and gets a greater percentage of hair than even the Parissa. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be doing any intimate waxing with this one, though. For just bikini line, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s okay, but it warns to avoid the more sensitive areas of one&#x27;s nethers.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t take off any hair. Harsh on skin.</li>
    <li> Immediately I was disappointed to see that these weren&#x27;t what I&#x27;d hoped they&#x27;d be--that is, something larger that you just wrap on to apply, wait a minute for it to burn/dissolve/kill follicles, and then \\&quot;ouchlessly\\&quot; remove. (Not that the regular Veet cream was ever really effective, anyway, but somehow this seemed like a more promising method. Clearly I was engaging in some wishful thinking.) Nope, they&#x27;re just bloody wax. Well, okay, not just any bloody wax...these strips have some serious uber-wax, so you can scarcely handle or lay them down on any non-disposable surface. It starts getting everyplace. You&#x27;ve got to be super-careful. Okay. So, I&#x27;d cut and tried two small pieces as tests. Those seemed to work acceptably well, so a few days later I tried the rest of one. WOW. Forget about being able to peel it back \\&quot;in one swift motion.\\&quot; Is this something I&#x27;d ever want to experience again? Nope. Would I wish it on my worst enemies? Only because I&#x27;m sadistic. ;P Might I feel slightly differently if at least SOMETHING had been removed? Perhaps, but that&#x27;s a moot point, because this time there was NO change. You have to use the razor anyway, after scrubbing and rubbing for several minutes with lotions and soap and water and the little wipes they give you (but you don&#x27;t get nearly enough of them if you were actually going to use the entire box, because once you open a packet it doesn&#x27;t reseal, and the wipes need to be brand-new to remove a significant amount of icky wax.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they&#x27;d be a bit more effective if you cut a strip into smaller 1-to-2-inch pieces and used them individually, but I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s preferable to shaving. The only reason I could imagine for bothering with this stuff would be for those with very thick, dark hair in a place where they don&#x27;t want it. For my compadres with fine, thin, light, often barely-noticeable \\&quot;nonhead\\&quot; hair that you nonetheless would prefer not to be there, they were just a huge disappointment. Not worthwhile at all. I was, naturally, not about to try the other, probably equally worthless half of the strip. Guess it was worth a shot, but it is a waste.t all. I was, naturally, not about to try the other, probably equally worthless half of the strip. Guess it was worth a shot, but it is a waste.</li>
    <li> I used these strips on my legs 8 days ago and they worked pretty well. It pulled out most of the hair (although I sometimes had to go over an area twice), then proceeded to use the provided wipes to get the remaining wax off and everything was going well. About a day or so later, my legs began to develop a rash and itch (I&#x27;ve gotten my legs professionally waxed before and this has never happened) and they didn&#x27;t stop for about the next four days. I had some sort of allergic reaction to what was in the wipes, combined with sensitive skin from waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself worked very well, but if you are worried about having an allergic reaction, do a test strip on a small part of your skin and use the wipes as well, but wait longer than the recommended 24 hours.</li>
    <li> dear veet,&lt;br /&gt;i think we need to talk.i read many reviews about u and decided to give a try.OMG,sooo sticky,the wax was all over my finger tips,palms and wont go away.and on the top of it the pain was unbearable.I found something else,and its name is NADS.It was so concerned about me when i peeled it off,it was like a \\&quot;happy waxing time\\&quot;,the three words which i never experienced when i was with u!!&lt;br /&gt;finally,its not u,its me!!Welllll,i think its pretty much u!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so bie,bie.&lt;br /&gt;FOREVERRRRRR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S---hope u dnt find some1 like me to hurt them too!!!</li>
    <li> I believe I&#x27;m very close to being a monkey. I&#x27;ve tried different ways to remove my leg hair with no satisfying results. It normally lasted like 3 days before I would see the hair again. It is the first time I try this method and I love it! It is not painful like I expected it to be and it lasts longer than ever. I doubt it would last 28 days as promoted but 14 days for me would be a glory. The fact that I&#x27;ve had nice legs for over 3 days make this product excellent. Please read the instructions before use. That helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my face, and it literally burned my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have giant burn scars on my face and I don&#x27;t know if they will ever heal.&lt;br /&gt;I am freaking out right now.&lt;br /&gt;Make yourself a favor. Stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;It will literally destroy your face!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! This was my first time waxing my legs and it worked wonderful. Much better than shaving. I will buy more of these strips</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Veet wax strips for over a year, and they work very well (Unlike Sally Hansen - which are painful and rip the hair). They&#x27;re not messy like loose wax, and therefore much easier to use. There have been times I&#x27;ve used it in the locker room quickly before entering the pool lol. I normally get them from Rite Aid for $12, but now I feel ripped off seeing the price here. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering from Amazon from now on!</li>
    <li> It works for removing hair... but left me itchy for weeks after.  They use some chemical in it that creates an allergic reaction on my skin.  if you have sensitive skin and maybe have a grass or alfalfa allergy, avoid this!</li>
    <li> I just Love it! instead of spending a lot of money on going to beauty salons and doing body waxing, it&#x27;s much better to use this product. It only takes about one hour to remove the hair of both legs including bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;It is great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Had a hard time with this product.</li>
    <li> Works just fine. All the hair comes off but I have to say it does pain quiet a bit. I could say it&#x27;s little messey too if we need to cut the strip in need of a smaller one, the wax oozes out a bit.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find this works for me at all.</li>
    <li> work great and a good price too thanks</li>
    <li> My daughter has started using wax strips and she likes this brand.  I hate it because there is now wax stuck all over the bathroom!  Pricing seems good, a bit lower than the local mega-marts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to purchasing a similar product at CVS for around $12, which only contains 6-8 big strips.  I&#x27;m a guy and need to get rid of that unattractive shoulder hair, so the big pads are perfect for this.  I imagine they&#x27;d be great for legs, chest, and any large parts of the body as well.  I was shocked to see 40, yes, 40, extra large strips in the package.  These will last me a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality and performance was equal to store brands. Highly recommended, 5 stars.</li>
    <li> These are the best wax strips.&lt;br /&gt;They are pleasant to work with (paper bands feel like fabric) and they get short hair better than other brands that are easier to find here in the US.</li>
    <li> this things very amazing to help me lose weight, i like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this amazing things, hope everyone to used it.</li>
    <li> I use these on my legs and it is the best brand, I have tried different and this is the most gentle on your skin and the best to remove undesired hair.</li>
    <li> The last time I went to purchase the Sally Hansen strips I had always used they were out and I was very hesitant to buy the Veet brand.  I am so glad I did. They work so much better for me and they are much more cost effective since there are so many more in each box.  The only reason I did not give this product a 5 star review is because it comes with perfect finish wipes vs the bottle that comes with Sally Hansen.  I prefer the bottle because you can use as much or as little as you want.  The Veet brand only comes with 6 wipes and there are 40 full size strips in the box.  This box last me much more than 6 uses.</li>
    <li> Excellent results with these. And I love the cooling/after care wipes, they smell nice and work well to remove any residual stickiness from the wax.&lt;br /&gt;One tip I have for using these (or any) wax strips..because before I had no success with the &#x27;pre waxed&#x27; strip method. I just fill up a drinking glass..just a regular tall glass with boiling hot water and take it into wherever you will be doing your waxing. Then instead of rubbing the strips between your hands as per the instructions (which is ridiculous IMO) I just gently place the strip (before separating it of course) around the glass, as if I&#x27;m using it as a pot-holder and just hold it there until the heat from the cup warms the strip enough, then you will see much better warming results, you just pull apart the strips so easily and get those babies on you and that hair will come right out! lol.</li>
    <li> Works great! People who say they don&#x27;t work are using it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Apply in the direction the hair grows and rip away going the opposite direction. You can repeat two or three times before needing a new strip</li>
    <li> I use to buy a different product from Fred-Meyer before I ordered this one from Amazon. I got it for a low price (per unit) and I saved on shipping too by opting for &#x27;Subscribe and Save&#x27; option :)&lt;br /&gt;Tried it on my hands last week and the wax strips worked great. Even though the wax is a little sticky, the wipes takes care of it. Infact, I loved the wipes too. Make sure you warm the strips before using them by pressing between your hands for about 10 second and hold the skin tight while peeling off. I also put lots of cold water on the waxed part after wiping it to avoid getting rashes. NOTE THAT THESE STRIPS DON&#x27;T WORK ON CHIN AND UPPER LIPS HAIR. I had to purchase another strips for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product at good price !</li>
    <li> I get professionally waxed for my privates, but was looking for an at home wax to easily wax my own legs. First, I love this product since I do not have to let my leg hairs grow out super long. It is easy to do. I tried using Sally Hansen strips and they do not pull out as many hairs and I do not like the way the product is. The veet wax strips are easy to apply, rub on and rip off. This product does not hurt if you pull your skin taught and rip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for at home wax strips, look no further!! I will also use this on my bikini in between waxes. Also, I like the smell of them. Once I am done waxing, I use the little towel (even though there are only a few in the box, I use about 4 wax strips per leg each time, so I do not run out) I hop in the shower after I wax and use baby oil in the shower. Love this product! Also, it is cheaper on amazon then in target. ($11.99) And it shipped in a few days! 100% happy!</li>
    <li> I love this and use it all the time when I get lazy to heat my wax warmer. This works miracles. Fast and easy to use</li>
    <li> Gillette Venus commercials made me cringe. Honestly, I&#x27;ve always thought that smooth legs were absolutely unattainable past a 24-hour period. Thick hair is a painful trade for countless hours spent shaving, epilating, waxing, Nair-ing, and sanding. Yes, folks, I&#x27;ve experimented with just about every concoction of hair-removal devices. Currently, the Veet waxing strips are at the top of my list. Even with sensitive skin, Veet waxing strips have been good to me! An entire box lasts me approximately 3-6 months (I&#x27;m not a big girl, strips can be reused immediately, and if you&#x27;re not too liberal with the strips, these will go a long way). It also helps to use an epilator (I use the Emjoi) to do touch-ups to avoid wasting strips. Great value for your money - I&#x27;ve finally found the product of my dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[RECOMMENDATIONS]&lt;br /&gt;-If you cannot stand any amount of pain, take a Tylenol&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure that your skin is smooth and dry&lt;br /&gt;-Rub the strips between your hands (or a hair-straightener) to warm the wax prior to separating&lt;br /&gt;-Adhere in the direction of the hair, then pull the skin taught, and tear in the opposite direction&lt;br /&gt;-Use baby oil or lotion to remove wax residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negative reviewers are improperly using the product. Seriously, it&#x27;s not rocket science, but it does require a certain level of experience. If it&#x27;s your first time, I highly recommend watching online tutorials or getting some advice from someone who&#x27;s done it before. Better yet, get one of the ladies at the salon to teach you! Do not take on this endeavor if you&#x27;re afraid of making a mess. Just remember that baby oil is the ultimate antidote to wax!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my opinion on Veet wax strip and Brazilian wax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Easy to easy; just warm it up by rubbing it, peel back &amp; apply&lt;br /&gt;2) Less messy than Brazilian wax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Don&#x27;t expect complete removal, it can at most remove about 70 to 80% of the hair, compared to nearly 100% using Brazilian wax&lt;br /&gt;2) Only works on moderate to long hair while Brazilian wax grip even short hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Should have included more wax removing wipes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Cut the strip in half while using on armpit because pit hair tend to grow in 2 directions, peel each half at opposite direction for better removal</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t use this product it left my skin red and the didn&#x27;t work on my body hair : (</li>
    <li> If you have not a lot of hair this strips is what you need.They grab the hair at the first try,leaving the skin nice and clean,finish up with the wipes and tweezers and you&#x27;ll be ready to go...</li>
    <li> This product Works great. It removes hair and isn&#x27;t too painful. However my only negative thing to say is it leaves traces of wax behind and it is extremely hard to get off. I showered right after I waxed and it didn&#x27;t come off with the special wipes provided and it didn&#x27;t come off till the 2nd time I showered. You really have to scrub your skin. Other than that this product is great. Its been almost 2 weeks since I started using and still no hair in site. Slick and smooth as if I had just shaved 5 minutes ago. I would recommend!!</li>
    <li> This product works just as described. It is very easy and mess free. I have used several different products and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for like years and it is so convenient to use them.&lt;br /&gt;Better than any messy wax kits.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and silky..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sophia</li>
    <li> I really liked this product for how many strips came in the package. Enough to finish an entire leg and some. They oil removing cloths are okay - didn&#x27;t get all of the wax off.</li>
    <li> I did not understand the directions, or I was not doing it right, but it did not take any hair off of my legs!</li>
    <li> Shaving irritates my skin a ton, so waxing is the direction I&#x27;ve been slowly moving toward. I have my own traditional wax heater and muslin strips, but it gets frustrating and messy, and can leave burns if I&#x27;m not careful. It&#x27;s hard to keep traditional wax at a good temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work just as well. Have your leg hair an appropriate length. Longer is better, for sure. Also, I don&#x27;t rub these between my hands like the directions say. I actually turn on my blow dryer on high heat (low speed) and heat up each side for maybe 5 seconds. It works way better. For the second strip (if I&#x27;m slow, I will carefully reheat it with the blow dryer).</li>
    <li> bought these thinking they would work, nope... not sticky, followed instructions and nothing came off the skin or even anything on the strip. bad product</li>
    <li> love love love. i will be sad when they stop making this. i order one everytime i run out. this is the best brand ive used in the cold wax strips. Nair brand sucks!! dont buy it. always buy veet! good price, and they work!</li>
    <li> very good smell. however very easy melting, does feel kind sticky after use, which can be removed with the napkin in the small individual package. fair price, but doesn&#x27;t work so well with short hair.</li>
    <li> They work pretty well seeing as I have very course and thick hair and they took the hair right off my legs! However, they did leave a little bit of prickle on my calves if you feel in the direction of the hair which is to be expected I suppose. The wipes and wax smell great and the wipes don&#x27;t irritate the area at all while removing all the wax.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s convenient and fast, but I&#x27;ve never experienced so many ingrown hairs on my legs! It was painful and took months to get my legs back to normal.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money, was very messy and the wax is not easy to remove. The excess wax will stay on your skin and wont come with warm water or soap for about one week,  the worst product you can buy!  Not worth a penny!</li>
    <li> I have fast growing body hair and was really happy when I saw these on the shelf. After trying them all I have to say is no, no, no, NO! It was nothing but a sticky, oily mess. I followed the directions and applied pressure to the strip after I stuck it to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using a whole package of 40 and still had to shave the hair it left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this product negative stars if I could.</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly!!  I used them on my boyfriends back.  He said it hurt and he had a temporary rash that went away in a day or so.....but his back was baby smooth. I WILL be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and easy to use .. Used it in legs and hands. Worked well.</li>
    <li> Been using it for so long. Nice but not for super short hair.</li>
    <li> I got a reaction to it. I threw it out</li>
    <li> These work out amazingly well.  I haven&#x27;t waxed before, but these strips made it easy and explained it so well.  There are 40 strips, but they&#x27;re packed as two together per strip.  The sticky side is together, so once you use one, you  have to use the other.  It doesn&#x27;t matter to me since you need about 4 to get through one leg.  You can use one strip more than once, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for more than twice unless you just have one tiny spot that&#x27;s being stubborn.  Be sure to use the wipes after to remove any wax spots and use a good lotion after.  My hair hasn&#x27;t fully come back in about 4 weeks.  It&#x27;s a lot less coarse and parts haven&#x27;t even regrown at all! Waxing seems to be great for my needs.</li>
    <li> I followed all the directions and the wax barely took any hair. It mostly left the wax on my skin. I guess I just have tougher hair. Might work on other people but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This did nothing. It pulled out five hairs, maybe.</li>
    <li> It works really well and gets most if not all of the hairs out. More so than a Sally Hansen version that I tried before trying this one. I also like that you can use the strips more than once and still get the vast majority out. (On one wax strip, the Third and Fourth strips are not as good as the First and Second though. And you really need to rub the wax in after the first try if you want to get most if not all the hairs out). No comment on the sensitive part as I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is sticky but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of waxing. The coarser the hair the worse this stuff works. You have to \\&quot;heat\\&quot; the product up a bit to get it to work but even with a quick dryer pointed at them they just don&#x27;t grab like wax does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean up pads that come in the box doesn&#x27;t remove the sticky gel. They just cover them with oil and that makes it appear gone. Than you take a shower and the oil washes off and you have the sticky stuff back.</li>
    <li> These wax strips work great and don&#x27;t leave much residue when used. I recommend \\&quot;heating\\&quot; them up using a blow dryer instead of rubbing between your hands, since this works much quickly and is less tiresome. When heating them up with a blow dryer, you can use the same strip multiple times. I love that you get 40 in a box, which is way more than comparable wax strips. I would definitely recommend! They work really well! For reference, I have dark coarse hair and use it on my legs and bikini area.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really complain about the horrible allergic reaction I have all over my crotch two days before my beach vacation because I didn&#x27;t do the allergy test. Learn from my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I thought the product did fairly well in the bikini area. The bikini line itself came pretty clean but more delicate areas didn&#x27;t wax well. Perhaps it was user error or inexperience, but I&#x27;d stay away from anything other than the traditional bikini line. The strips were easy to use and the wipes did a good job of removing excess. I might give these another go if I didn&#x27;t have a flaming crotch to tell me there&#x27;s an allergy.</li>
    <li> On my first try i used it On day old legs and it barely worked. The second time i waxed it was after I washed my leg and put a layer of baby powder on. The wash and powder improved the wax&#x27;s ability to pull hairs greatly and I reused a strip about three or four times per side. Afterwards I used a wipe and they do leaves my legs shiny but greasy feeling after removing the wax. They feel greasy right now after being done for two hours. I am curious about the claim they make for lasting 28 days. The countdown starts now.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this at all. It&#x27;s not for me. Messy, Painful, didn&#x27;t remove hair,</li>
    <li> This product works if you grow out the hairs for about two weeks. I think it comes with six or so towelettes to remove excess wax, but if that is not enough, baby oil works fine too. My main issue with this product is that about a week after waxing, my entire legs have become extremely itchy and I am having  delayed allergic reaction to the product. Too bad, since my legs stay hairless for a while after use.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have very fine leg hair so this works well without being too harsh on my skin. It says 40 strips, but you&#x27;re actually looking at 20 strips where each strip counts as two when you tear them apart. A little tip is to warm up your sheet before using it. (I sit on it while I use my phone or do my make-up). Recommended over the Sally Hanser strips!</li>
    <li> Tried this product after it got a big thumbs up in my favorite magazine. I had been wanting to try wax for a while and it was advertised as very easy to do. Despite following all instructions to a T (holding skin very taut, pulling very quickly, having adequately long hair) I could NOT get these strips to pick up more than a couple hairs and left a WHOLE BUNCH of wax behind. I have thin, dark leg hair and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. Based on other reviews, I&#x27;m guessing there must be SOME user-error involved but I don&#x27;t know what I could do to make these work better. :(</li>
    <li> I got this item today and tried it out. i first cleaned my legs with alcohol, to get rid of any dirt. Then i added some baby powder to my legs. I used the strips and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much plus got every single hair in the section placed. It did not leave ANY mess at all. I love this product and the cleaning wipes got rid off any glue left on my skin wasn&#x27;t to much. It all depends, if you use it correctly. I guess i did and know I have smooth beautiful skin. No more shaving for me Thanks to Veet!!</li>
    <li> It just broke off the hairs so my legs were prickly instead of smooth. I tried it on my husband who has much thicker, courser hairs (although he occasionally shaves so our hair length were about the same) and he had a perfectly smooth patch were the waxing strip was. I was very disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for my legs since these strips are so easy as compared to applying the wax yourself.</li>
    <li> the strips do fast and good job</li>
    <li> I am a member of the Veet Vixens on Crowdtap &amp; may receive perks &amp; rewards as a member. It&#x27;s easy to use and super gentle to my sensitive skin. Shaving was yesterday..!!</li>
    <li> Not really though. There is more hair on my legs than on the strips when I finish. I would rather just use real wax.</li>
    <li> This product was in great condition when I received it. The instructions inside of the box are fairly clear. I have never waxed before but this product seems unusually painful. I used it on my legs first but the strips left a lot of hair behind. Then I did under my arms and I started to bleed. Not really bad but it kind of freaked me out because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it. I had red marks under my arms for about a week, but the pain subsided within seconds of pulling the strips off. I would not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. However a good alternative is (veet spray on cream hair remover) the (legs and body - sensitive skin formula). I only used it once under my arms but I worked really well.</li>
    <li> Ive been trying different brands to see what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Mostly thus far i have only been trying wax products for the face. Sally Hansen products are a hands down!!!! However, i ventured out to try for body (legs) and bikini. I have been told that you should never wax your bikini yourself, get a pro to do it. I figured going with a product that has bigger strips would be best for my legs and bikini area. I read the reviews on this and thought this would be a go. WRONG. i followed the instructions, i even used a blow dryer to warm the wax more. The only effect i got was minimal hair removal and more SKIN removal! Needless to say, OUCH! This stuff did not work, it stuck to everything EXCEPT the hair. Usually strips i dont find messy but these certainly were. So i have decided to leave the bikini up to the pro&#x27;s, but i think ill stick w/ Sally Hansen products for my other waxing needs</li>
    <li> Scientists say that your hair does not grow back thicker and darker after shaving but, the way I see it, it does. I used a wax strip on my arm where there&#x27;s thin hair and it worked for that but, It doesn&#x27;t pull one small dark hair off of my legs. I only bought this for my legs but, considering it won&#x27;t work, I pretty much have no use for it now. Wasted ten dollars.</li>
    <li> This product skimps on the wax. It does not have any real stick to it and really doesn&#x27;t remove hair well. It can not really be used more than once as advertized.</li>
    <li> strips are much too big. leaves a lot of residue and doesn&#x27;t get all the hair</li>
    <li> Ehh.  Doesn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t remove all the hair and have to use more than I&#x27;d like to get it all.</li>
    <li> Really love these for my arms and face. Not great for legs or bikini. Heat them with a hair dryer and they work awesome. Be sure you have oil to remove excess wax.</li>
    <li> Parlor quality waxing! Saves my time and money. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Love these. They it may take a longer but it&#x27;s as good as going to a salon to get my legs waxed and at a fraction of the price! One tip is to exfoliate your legs before using this. Works so much better! I also light a candle and hold the strips over the candle to warm it up instead of my hands. Don&#x27;t hold it too close but just close enough for it to be warmed.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot to say.  I have been waxing my whole life, so don&#x27;t write off my bad comment as me just being naive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cold wax strips do not work.  I followed directions (and other advice from people), but the strips rip off without removing hair and they leave an annoying sticky reside that is hard to remove, even with the accompanying wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea, but it&#x27;s a huge waste of money, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> This kit removes hair pretty well, both on legs and underarms. You can use the same strip a few times in a row, it remains rather sticky, though after the 3rd time it doesn&#x27;t make sense, qualitywise. You have to stretch the skin well and tear the strip off with a very quick movement, close to the skin. The hair should be long enough, to come out.&lt;br /&gt;There is one draw back. The stuff is very sticky, which is OK, considering the task. But they provide very few finishing wipes which help clean the skin of this sticky stuff. I tried soap, to be sure, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well, the skin remains sticky. So now I have plenty of strips yet, and I am running of the finishing wipes. Whoever know where to get just the finishing wipes or how they can be substituted, I&#x27;ll gladly take your advice.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m the only one, but I followed the directions and these just wouldn&#x27;t work! Didn&#x27;t take one single hair off my leg.</li>
    <li> I probably wont but these again. I only get a few strands of hair every time I wax using the strips. I was hoping that it would gather more.</li>
    <li> If this stuff isn&#x27;t banned under the Geneva Convention as a method of torture, it ought to be.  It hurt like h3ll a good lot of the time.  It ripped off skin in several places and it made blood vessels downright angry in others.  It did mostly rip the hair out like its supposed to...so overall I guess it works as intended.  I bought this product to try because I was having problems with ingrown hairs from shaving.  I have dark hair.  It wasn&#x27;t overly thick but still no one wants an ingrown hair if they can help it.  I don&#x27;t think it helped with those.  I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in the ingrown hairs...mercifully enough I haven&#x27;t seen an increase in them either.  I cannot say that for hair growth in general...for I feel like I&#x27;ve got at least 4x more hair on my legs than I had before I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I gave it a fair test.  I tried 1.5 boxes of it and I used it on my legs and my pits.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do with the half box I have left, unless I use it to trap ants or peel paint off the baseboards.  It&#x27;s not going to be going on my skin that&#x27;s for sure.  If I finished off this box (or used any more) I think I might turn into a Sasquatch.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s your first time waxing your legs, it might take a couple tries before you get the hang of it but the wax strips definitely work. They hurt quite a bit so I would recommend doing your legs at night. For armpits, I got pretty bad results but I think it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t pull the skin taut enough. All in all, I do think that this is a good product for the price and will be repurchasing it.</li>
    <li> I find this product easy to apply, zips off easily, no mess! I don&#x27;t see why I wouldn&#x27;t continue to use.</li>
    <li> I used this on my legs, which have not very thick, but very dark, hair, and it did very little. The hair grew back (to a little bit of stubble) in about two weeks, which sounds awesome, but honestly isn&#x27;t that great because my leg hair grows very slow. I had to shave once a week just to keep my legs really smooth, but honestly, if I didn&#x27;t mind a little bit of prickliness, I could go 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. So yeah, these didn&#x27;t do much but break the hairs off.</li>
    <li> Hmmm... lets be honest, I was quite disappointed on these wax strips. I purchased this produce mainly for my underarm and it DOESN&#x27;T work. I was so confuse because I have read a lot of positive comment about this produce before I purchase this. I am an asian girl and with super fine hair, I couldnt thought of any reason that why it doesnt work.  It left a huge sticky mess on my underarm and I used out all the wipes to clean off the wax at the first time. I put them aside for couple months and go back to the salon.  Yesterday I was cleaning my home and I found this little poor thing at the corner on the shelf and I decided to give it one more chance. This time I am really careful, I watched couple viedo on youtube and make sure I do it in the right way (cause there is no more wipes left I have no idea what should I do if the sticky mess is come back to me again without the wipes)  I cut it in half, use a hair dryer to warm up the wax strips, place it on my leg and rub it, and BOOM !  It works!!!  It picks up hair without any wax leftover on my leg.  I was so happy and guilty at the same time cause I blame on this produce before. Then I try it on my underarm and SHIT happened.  It was exactly the same result as last time:  sticky mess without picking up any single hair.  I was so shock and I try again on my leg with the same strip.  It works.  WTH !?  The only reason I could thought of is my leg&#x27;s hair is finer than my armpit&#x27;s. I used my oil-base makeup remover to clean it up and still feels a little sticky on my underarm. I dont know what to do with this produce, my leg&#x27;s hair is super fine and invisible that I dont even need to wax it. I really hope that this produce would work.  So if anyone have any suggestions on the waxing step please tell me,  so I could come back and change the rating.</li>
    <li> Okay, a week ago i was trying to find some sort of hair removal and resorted to this one because i didnt want to be chemically burned. So of course i read through most of the reviews and was kind of torn because some said that it was awesome while others wrote that it was a waste. it definitely is NOT a waste! In fact it works quite well indeed! Im not an experienced waxer and it did a mighty fine job. The people that say it does not work must be doing something wrong. All you do it : 1. Open the box 2. whip out a strip 3. warm it up in your hands by rubbing them back and forth swiftly 4. Place in desired area 5. rub it in the direction of hair growth 5. Rip it off in opposite direction of hair growth. It will work, if not something is wrong with you, no offense... or you have steel instead of hair in your skin. And no I am not a promoter like some of these people write, just the truth.</li>
    <li> These did not do anything for me other than get wax stuck all over my leg that I could barely even get off in the shower.  My skin doesn&#x27;t usually hurt with waxing/tweezing, so they didn&#x27;t really hurt when I was taking the strips off, but my legs had a slight burning sensation a little afterwards.  They didn&#x27;t take any hair out.  Now, I have really stubborn Italian hair, but I read a review that it even took out a girl&#x27;s hair that had the same hair type as I did, but nope.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.  Guess I will just have to continue shaving daily. /:</li>
    <li> even following the directions still didn&#x27;t work for me so I&#x27;m not satisfied very is very good product just not this one</li>
    <li> Good.. working as expected ..</li>
    <li> Did not work.  Was very messy.  There are probably better products out there</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay. If you get the wax warmed up enough, and the hair is long enough, then they work decently. It&#x27;s not going to be as good as a professional wax, but for the price, it does what you&#x27;d expect</li>
    <li> Clean, less painful and really convenient.</li>
    <li> I am always cautious with waxing strips but over all they were very effective!</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> I think not! This stuff isn&#x27;t very good. My leg hair was pretty long when I used it and it barely worked. I had to use half the box on one leg and it STILL didn&#x27;t get it all. I finally gave up because my leg still felt as prickly as before and started turning red.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t notice these said leg and body, the directions say not to use them on your face but I just cut them into strips and they work good without irritation so 40 big strips for around $8 is amazing! I DO NOT USE THESE ANYWHERE BUT MY FACE, SO THIS REVIEW DOES NOT INCLUDE USING THEM ON LEGS OR BODY</li>
    <li> I had the WORST experience with this product. DO NOT buy it. Listen to the other bad reviews. Try different wax strips. For my arm, it removed little hair, and left stubble. It also peeled off some of my skin and i will probably have a scar on my arm for the rest of my life. It was covered in cuts and burns. Whenever someone saw my arm, they ask what happened to me. Most of the scars have gone away, just a couple remain, but are most likely permanent. For my legs, it removed NO HAIR WHATSOEVER. Plus, it is probably the most painful wax I&#x27;ve ever had. I can&#x27;t even get started on the sticky mess it made. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Save your money and buy a different wax treatment.</li>
    <li> Only pulled out around 50 percent or so of my leg hair. Easy to use, just not effective. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well these worked. They weren&#x27;t messy and did a good job at pulling out hair, However they hurt! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but it felt more painful than other waxing products I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ll use them for now, but I&#x27;ll also be looking for a less painful product that is just as effective.</li>
    <li> I have used wax strips from Veet, Sally Hansen, and Nad&#x27;s, and these Veet strips were my least favorite of the 3 (Nad&#x27;s were the best).  Almost all of the time, this product does NOT remove all of the hair from the waxed area.  Also, these strips frequently leave wax residue that is difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to buy wax strips, I would recommend trying out Nad&#x27;s or Sally Hansen instead.  I have found that both of those brands are more effective at hair removal than these Veet strips.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy after reading some negative reviews. They work. They work well and you dont have to mess around with wax mess. I went through 20 strips for both legs (half the box) wish they would stay sticky a bit longer, but all in all I was thrilled.</li>
    <li> My leg hair has always been stubborn and relentless, so I don&#x27;t expect much from these things.  I was happy to see how easily the hair comes off, once finding the proper way to pull it off.  My legs were actually smooth for a whole week, which is a big step up for me.  My legs do not stay smooth for more than a couple hours when shaving.  I won&#x27;t use them all of the time, because I wouldn&#x27;t want to do this once a week, but they&#x27;re perfect to use just before a week of vacation or going on a trip!</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE DOES NOT WORK MAYBE GETS ONE OR TWO HAIRS JUST BUY A WAXING KIT ITS NOT WORTH IT!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, painless and smooth legs last for weeks! the little towelettes are perfect to remove the excess wax and leave a nice finish.</li>
    <li> I have been using Veet on my pits for more than 4 years now. After moving to the US, I couldn&#x27;t find this brand in any personal care shops here. Once again, Amazon to my rescue. Since I&#x27;m not a regular salon going person, this product does the job for me. I do have coarse, thick hair on my legs, and most of the time Veet works smoothly on them.</li>
    <li> Works very well for hands and legs but not so well for under arms. Like it better than epilators because it removes dead skin as well. Convenient for travel. Not messy. Have used it for several years now.</li>
    <li> This was my first time waxing, and I chose these because they seemed simple and not terribly messy.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they were mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: simple, the pain was bearable, left some but not too much wax on skin that you could get off easily with another strip, got most of the hairs off&lt;br /&gt;CONS: didn&#x27;t get ALL the hairs off and my hair is coarse/obvious enough that I will still have to shave my legs, there were not nearly enough strips for my legs- only enough to do from the knees to the ankles once over, took 100x longer than shaving, pores on legs are red/irritated now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a bad first experience, but not really worth the money (I got them for $13 and still have to shave). The idea of waxing still appeals to me, but I will probably buy an actual warm wax kit next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I pulled my skin taught and exfoliated beforehand and used powder and all that jaz</li>
    <li> It worked for my legs, but had no effect on my bikini line and underarms. My leg hair is extremely thin and almost unnoticable and i usually don&#x27;t do much with it, but I wanted to test the strips somewhere that wouldn&#x27;t hurt too much, so I did my legs first. It worked well, but when I tried my underarms it didn&#x27;t work too well... I pulled the skin taunt and everything, but it picked up one or two pieces of hair and that was that. As for my bikini line.. I had to cut the wax strips into smaller pieces and it picked up most of the hair, but it hurt a lot and left the area all red and some pores were bleeding. I wish i hadn&#x27;t gotten the 40 count one because I have a whole bunch left and don&#x27;t really want to go through the ordeal again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the oil thing does work effectively to clean the wax off.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to share a tip with everyone so that you can use the product easier. I live in Florida, where it is very hot and humid. After a few bad pulls where the wax melted on my skin and never firmed up, making it almost impossible to pull off quickly, I found out that my skin was too hot! As blood rushes to the surface of your skin, it gets hotter and hotter. A good tip is to keep an ice cube in a cup next to you, ice your skin down before you put the wax on, then dry with a paper towel, THEN warm the strips and put them on your skin. That way, you have hot wax going on a cold surface and immediately firming up, grabbing the hairs, and pulling them out once you pull the strip!</li>
    <li> They are quick easy less messy work we&#x27;ll very handy and can be in your travel kit always must try</li>
    <li> Dry, and doesn&#x27;t work as well. Nair is usually better.</li>
    <li> I bought these so i wouldn&#x27;t have to spend as much time shaving anymore, if anything these are more time consuming and they only kept hair away for a week at most.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m, honestly, unable to explain the phenomena happening in the review section of wax strip products right now. I logged onto my computer this afternoon resolved to find a wax brand that was at least decent in the eyes of the consumer, but instead I find mediocre, \\&quot;middle of the road\\&quot; ratings with 1-star review numbers nearly equal to the 5-star ones. Even outside Amazon on websites such as Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, and etc. people seem to be divided 50/50 (or close) on whether they love or hate wax strip hair removal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being overcome with \\&quot;Oh God, are the 1-star&#x27;s right?!\\&quot; syndrome, I decided to take a look-see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;-Very, Very little pain. (Though I&#x27;m mentioning it, take this with a grain of salt. I have a high pain tolerance)&lt;br /&gt;-Little to no residue left behind. I didn&#x27;t even need to use the provided napkins. It wore away.&lt;br /&gt;-Light red pin-prick complexion that went away within the hour.&lt;br /&gt;-Ability to get two rips from one sheet. (Might leave behind a few strays with the second use)&lt;br /&gt;-Complete hair removal. I am the proud owner of thick, brown hair. Trust me, this is an accomplishment.&lt;br /&gt;-The sheets are cutable/resizable for touch-up rips or to use the product on the face (though the box says not to do this)&lt;br /&gt;-Detailed instructions provided that makes even the most novice waxer feel confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;-After a few practice attempts, I found I didn&#x27;t need to use the heating method (rubbing them) on the strips while they were off of my skin. I simply placed them on cold, then rubbed in the direction of the hair growth until I could feel friction heating the wax on my skin. I believe this contact heat and pressure are key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Have no fear! Don&#x27;t be timid with the ripping. Allow yourself one hesitation, then give it hell. Rip fast, and rip close to the skin. Being mousy and cowardly will only make it hurt worse..if it hurts at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you find it DOES hurtbadly, I have seen several online reviews that say rubbing an ice cube on the skin right before ripping dulls the sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one thing to remember is that human error is more likely than factory error, at least in this case with so many successful stories in the 5-star range. If it doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t flip a table and ragequit. Try a different approach, read some guides, and understand that everything has a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;40 sheets doesn&#x27;t go as far as you would think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Ripping!</li>
    <li> Good and satisfactory</li>
    <li> Good Product for easy home waxing. Subscribe and save feature gives you the product in cheaper rate + sends the item periodically. Great product to do waxing sitting the comfort of your home!!</li>
    <li> it doesnt grab onto the really short hairs like it says, but if you let your leg hair grow out a decent amount and then wax it grabs everything! ive always wanted to wax my legs, but never had the guts or money to do it in a salon - these are awesome!</li>
    <li> smells oddly nice. I don;t think i was using them right, but still worked pretty well</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, easy to use and many applications in one box. The only downside is the small amount of cleaning wipes, but baby oil works great.</li>
    <li> Works well on my legs and arms! I have Asian hair so it&#x27;s a bit thicker than average but this removed it no problem! Quick and easy! For people having issues with these strips, it really helps to follow the instructions on the box.</li>
    <li> This is actually Jeff&#x27;s wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this junk NO STARS!!! I followed the directions to a tee and not one single hair came off!!! It was the most painful event of my life right up there with childbirth!!! What did happen is that I now have a bruised bikini area. The wipes didn&#x27;t get the wax off, soap didn&#x27;t work, facial cleanser didn&#x27;t work! I had to totally destroy a brand new razor to get the wax off!!!! One can only pray they take this product off the market NOW!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of wax strips as getting wax done outside is very expensive. These strips are super easy to use and are very handy in the sense, wax gets soft quickly. But I didn&#x27;t like this as much as the Sally &amp; Hansen wax strips -- are much better than the Veet ones. Wont recommend buying them.</li>
    <li> It does not pull away all of my hair. But it does get most of it.</li>
    <li> Sucks, do not waste your money. The glue wax stuck to my skin.</li>
    <li> Used this was and it works perfectly.  Very easy to use just follow the instructions and you should have silky smooth legs.</li>
    <li> your hair has to be pretty long to use this -- who wants hair that long on their legs???</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t that much more expensive compared to the 20 count pack so I purchased the 40 count one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to warm up the wax strips enough. If you&#x27;re like me, then just rubbing it between my hands for 5 seconds isn&#x27;t enough... I leave it under my laptop (where the battery is located) for a little while and that warms it up enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, after I place the wax strip on my leg, I apply pressure to it and rub it for a few seconds before I rip it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripping should be done in a quick smooth motion for best results and remember to pull the skin taught with your other hand while ripping. Pull in the direction opposite of your hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When done correctly, there will be a minimum of wax left over and stuck on your legs (aka you won&#x27;t really need those finishing wipes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product when used correctly. :D Highly suggest this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Buy it!</li>
    <li> no matter if you have ever waxed before or not these are super easy to use &amp; work great. removes hair easily. the only thing is the wipes you get i think their should be more wipes. as you have to use them after you get done waxing or the leftover wax doesn&#x27;t come off. It makes you fill sticky until you use the wipe then it&#x27;s all smooth.</li>
    <li> Great price here and I like these wax strips the best of all that I&#x27;ve tried including hot wax.</li>
    <li> I use these to remove hair from my face. Although the strips don&#x27;t say they are for the face, this is what I use them for. Upper lip, chin, eyebrows and cheeks. They do a good job and don&#x27;t really hurt for the most part. They also remove the dry outer skin layer, leaving soft, smooth skin. The oil wipes are helpful to combat the sticky residue left afterward. Make sure you leave it on the area you waxed for at least 10 minutes. Coconut oil can also be used as aftercare. Breakouts can occur after waxing, so keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It wasn&#x27;t successful in removing ALL of the unwanted hair on the area of application. It should&#x27;ve been, considering the level of pain I felt upon removing each one of the strips. I&#x27;d rather try a different brand.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work AT all. I pulled/held my skin taut, grew my hair out as much as the instructions say, did everything it said. I even exfoliated. It didn&#x27;t pull any hairs out. It just hurt and left my skin super red for a few hours. Waste of my money. I wonder why the facial ones are great and these don&#x27;t work even a little bit. I&#x27;m so angry, I hate having to shave. I don&#x27;t care about pain as long as it has good results but it didn&#x27;t work AT ALL. I don&#x27;t recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair remover ever!!</li>
    <li> Very messy to use. It also didn&#x27;t pick up nearly as much hair as I expected, even though my hair was long enough. On the bright side, it did make the hair grow back much more slowly.</li>
    <li> I tried these on my bikini area. I followed the directions to a tee, but the wax just got super sticky. It caused a big matted mess of hair that was nearly impossible to clean up...so my underwear just stuck &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; for a few days. Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> I applied this only for the underarms. So for small areas like this it works perfectly and it saves me some money, considering no trips for waxing small areas.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all !!!! This was a completely waste of money and it&#x27;s so messy around.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it with Amazon but it was so awful that I had to write a review. It sucks, removes no hair and leaves a waxy film when removed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely hurt.  Followed directions and still had hair that would not come off.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite cold wax strips ever and I cannot find them in stores anymore. I am so glad I can still get them on Amazon and for a great price. I have tried many other brands of cold wax strips and they just don&#x27;t work as well or remove as much hair. To use them you simply rub the strip between your hand to warm the wax, then apply to the skin in the direction of the hair and remove. Lets be honest, waxing is a bit painful in certain areas and you don&#x27;t want to keep going over the same area trying to remove stubborn hair because it just irritates the skin and can leave burns and rubs. These strips remove the most hair per use so I only have to go over an area one or two times and done.  I like how they provide wipes for removing the wax that gets stuck to your skin but it can also be easily removed with a little baby oil. I cut the large strips into smaller strips for hard to reach areas and for better precision.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly! Despite all of the poor to mediocre reviews, this product did exactly as described and removed my corse, thick underarm hair without much hassle. I read the reviews on Amazon and did as suggested: properly cleaned and prepped the area, applied baby powder to remove moisture, used a blow dryer for about 7-10 seconds per side, and pulled class to the skin quickly while holding the skin very taut. After that I applied pressure and used baby oil to remove the excess wax. Worked like a dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my strip into pieces and even did a bikini wax on myself. Simple and EASY.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me 3 months to get used to using these, but now that I&#x27;ve figured out how to use them with minimal pain WITHOUT leaving residue (This is a huge part, since the residue that remains will ruin your skin, took my legs 2 months to heal back up after the first time) I can stay aerodynamic when I go bike riding without having to spend the time shaving that my competitors do.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t hurt and very helpful if you use it correctly. Remember to hold you skin tight with one hand when you pull the wax paper off with the other hand! so it doesn&#x27;t work that well on my arms. The finish wipes it comes with are really good to use too. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Product was highly recommended from my nail technician.  Cheaper than having it done in a salon.  Easy, effective and effortless...........will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I tried most of the tips other reviewers left about heating up the strips and cooling and drying my skin, but these strips just did not work for my legs.  I did use them to get the hair off my upper lip and that did work after lots and lots of pulls.</li>
    <li> My friend recommend me to buy it to remover body hair! I have to say, this one really works!&lt;br /&gt;Also the hair turn back less than three days better than other products i have used.</li>
    <li> I switched to these after waxing the traditional way, and this is so much easier and less messy. I can actually use each strip twice to remove hair, which is great because the box will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because the wax remover wipes don&#x27;t really do much for me, and also my box only had four instead of six.</li>
    <li> A good package of strips. Removes hair like intended, works fine, but likely won&#x27;t use in the future. I prefer the Veet Hair Removal Cream to the strips, but they definitely work well. I plan on keeping them on hand just in case the need for them should arise!</li>
    <li> The only nice thing that can be said for this product is that it is easy to use. However, I would probably be better off if it were nearly impossible to use, since that might have prevented the ensuing disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, this seems like a wonderful idea - there won&#x27;t be any mess, because the strips are ready to use and there is a little clean up towelette included! Except that the clean up wipe is largely ineffective at removing leftover wax. Two showers later, the sticky armpits problem was only mostly fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to being cursedly hard to clean off, this product was ineffective - following the directions religiously, it removed approximately 40% of the hair. Worse, it DID manage to remove patches of the top layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of smooth, beautiful legs, the end result was a blotchy (having stripped off chunks of tanned skin), hairy, sticky nightmare.  I threw away the rest of the box unused.</li>
    <li> Work well on longer hair as well as semi-short.  Did have an issue with the wax staying on some hairs and not removing them.</li>
    <li> Compared to other home wax strip kits, this is the best I have tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is much stickier, and really does rip out more hair than strips I have tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they store well - I use them only occasionally for touch ups between waxings, but they are still as good as they were the day I opened them, which was almost a year ago!  I store them in a bathroom drawer, so the moisture has had little to no effect either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The after-care wipes could be better - I prefer the little bottle of post wax solution, rather than towelettes, but the solution on them does work OK.</li>
    <li> The product arrived more fast than I expected. It is very easy to use and worked fantastic. I do recommend it to who want to wax in fast, easy and cheap way.</li>
    <li> so worth getting worked well. don&#x27;t gotta worrie about a razor now thanks i will buy more when theses run out.</li>
    <li> These work really well. I am happy that I finally found an at home hair removal product that wont make me broke, require constant re-upping, or make a huge mess. I am not a big fan of shaving, and waxing at a salon is just to expensive, at home, messy! - before I found these, that is. Follow instructions to a T, then mess around with them a bit. Tricks: you can use each side of the strip, pull apart and set the opposite side down sticky side up and save for later. You can use each strip more than once! I have found that I can wax both my lower legs entirely using just 4 strips (two full strips on each leg). I trim the strips down in size to use in pits and on bikini line - makes them more manageable! Happy waxing!</li>
    <li> These strips don&#x27;t work and leave such an obnoxious sticky mess behind that lasts for days, would never buy them again.</li>
    <li> I used this to wax my lower legs and there are enough strips in this package to do it twice.  It says it is able to pick up hairs 1/16&amp;#34; long but it didn&#x27;t work to well for me.  It did grab all of my 1/8&amp;#34; long hairs which was only like two more days of wearing pants and letting the hair grow out for me so I didn&#x27;t really care.  The cold wax really does work, you don&#x27;t have to worry about heating it up at all, skin temperature works fine.  You really do have to pull the skin taught and rip straight back in the other direction for it to grab all the hairs but when you do, it works very well and it&#x27;s a little bit less painful.  Each strip can also be reused 5-6 times which I thought was incredible but you really have to push it on and drag it over the skin a little bit to get it do grab hair the 5th and 6th times.  I tried waxing once with a kit of a pot of wax and paper strips but these worked so much better since it gives an even coating of wax and not too much wax and it is also incredibly less messy.  Overall, I was really impressed with how well these strips work and would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I am a mexican girl and i have super hairy arms, so i used this to wax there. It tooks most all of the hair off in one use and it wasnt unbearably painful. The reason I only gave 3 stars it because im not sure it its actually pulling the hair from the root. After i wax, i can see black dots on my arm and it looks like I shaved it. When it grows back it also looks as if i shaved it, but it doesnt grow back as fast as shaving. So basically, this will not make your hair grows back thinner or anything, but for me it made it appear thicker. Just like shaving, except it didnt feel stubbly. I can get by a month before waxing again. I think its a good price and it comes with a lot of strips. I dont think i&#x27;ll repurchase though. I am going to let my arm hair grow and then use Jolen Creme Bleach.</li>
    <li> These wax sheets work pretty well, and my legs stay smooth for about 2 weeks, which is much better than shaving every 2 days.</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money</li>
    <li> I felt that the wax is not strong/sticky enough to grab all the hairs, especially when reusing them for the second or third time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as a salon wax, but it&#x27;s so much cheaper. And it&#x27;s much less messy than normal wax - so it&#x27;s a win for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for underarm waxing and it&#x27;s not perfect, but with some tips I gleaned from others, it works pretty well. Here&#x27;s what I found out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Powder beforehand - some suggest baby powder, I use baking soda because I don&#x27;t have any baby powder&lt;br /&gt;2) Ice? Once the strip is on, sometimes I&#x27;ll actually ice the strip (not the wax side) to cool the wax so it &amp;#34;grips&amp;#34; better. I&#x27;m not sure if it makes much of a difference, but I&#x27;ll do it anyway&lt;br /&gt;3) Be vicious with the removal - I can&#x27;t actually remove it fast enough so I asked my husband to do it for me. He&#x27;s much more vicious about it than me.&lt;br /&gt;4) Oil on a paper towel - The soothing wipes they give are nice, but there aren&#x27;t very many. So I&#x27;ll put some cooking or olive oil on a paper towel and wipe with that instead. I&#x27;m sure there are better oils out there, but I don&#x27;t have any coconut or whatever oils at home.&lt;br /&gt;5) Tweeze the remainder - I&#x27;ll have a few stray strains which I need to tweeze at the end, but overall it&#x27;s much better than prior to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still contemplating laserhair removal so I don&#x27;t need to keep doing this, but it&#x27;s a good idea for now. :)</li>
    <li> I was terribly disappointed with this product. When you pull the strips apart, too much wax is on them, even moreso on one side. This results in a lot of pain, a lot of residual wax to remove, and barely any hair removal. Terrible.</li>
    <li> It works on your leg but when i tried to wax my underarms it hurt really bad and it doesnt work. But if you try on your legs it does, i dont know why it doesnt work for my underarms.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t always work properly, even if I use it the right way.</li>
    <li> The best wax strips I have used and I am pretty much addicted to waxing.  I cut them to size to wax just about everything and I&#x27;m able to reuse each strip about three times too.  But of course the true test is my husband telling me how smooth my legs were the other night!  Bottom line is buy them, and if you don&#x27;t like them you can ALWAYS get your money back.  Never settle for any product you don&#x27;t like, they will ALWAYS fix the problem for you one way or another.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Clean and dry your skin&lt;br /&gt;Hold your skin taunt and pull it straight back parallel to the surface!&lt;br /&gt;Have everything ready and open for clean up&lt;br /&gt;Use baby oil rather than the wipes to remove wax, I like to massage my legs for a while too after :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Does not hurt at all which is I think why I&#x27;ve become addicted&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean (compared to Nads facial strips which was similar to epoxy on my skin, in the shower no less)&lt;br /&gt;Surprising inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way if you&#x27;re smaller statured&lt;br /&gt;I get a massage out of the deal which is better than any shave :)</li>
    <li> Love these. Use them for my arms and so much faster and cheaper than going to salon. With one box I got 4 uses I believe.</li>
    <li> honestly, these things just left me sticky and disappointed. would not recommend for people with very very coarse body hair (i mean WIRY not &amp;#34;oh my peach fuzz is just a little thick&amp;#34;) even with holding the skin taut, i could only get a very small amount of hair to actually be removed. oh well, you lose some and you win some. may pass along to a friend with less stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> These work great. I have never tried anything like these. Why? They are so easy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but at the end of the work we feel sticky everywhere  specially on under arms. I have to washed many times n have to put some  telcome powder so the stillness goes.</li>
    <li> Leave a sticky feeling behind.</li>
    <li> To keep it short, I love these! They didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I expected and my legs have been smooth for three weeks now. HOWEVER, it was a disaster when I tried using them &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; but they only left wax. It could have been my own fault, because I was a lot more nervous. I would definitely recommend these for legs, though.</li>
    <li> regular user...good on skin and gets the job done</li>
    <li> Especially in the winter, I LOVE to wax my legs. It&#x27;s enjoyable for me and on top of that I don&#x27;t have to deal with shaving for weeks on end. Normally I purchase the Sally Hansen brand because it is super sticky and works really well. I took a chance on the Veet brand this time due to price and am really glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;This brand is more wax like than others, each strip can truly be used at least twice (I have dry skin so the &amp;#34;reuse each strip&amp;#34; tactic often does not work because the stickiness gets lost with the dryness) meaning I can wax my legs with literally 4 &#x27;front back&#x27; strips. This box is lasting me forever in comparison to the past brands I&#x27;ve tried! It&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a convert to this brand.</li>
    <li> The paket was open and the box was all torn up.</li>
    <li> I like it, and am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been &#x27;waxing&#x27; for about 20 years.  At this stage, I&#x27;m mostly in occasional touch up mode for bikini area and underarms.  I started way back with Sweet Simplicity (which is still my favorite, unfortunately no longer available).  I&#x27;ve tried so many products, as well as professional waxing, so all this to say, I have quite a bit of product experience to compare these to.  Currently I prefer the GiGi home products, though I&#x27;m still looking for something better to replace it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Veet strips in a pinch, no other products available at the drug store. (I ran out of cloth strips to use with the Gigi and the stores don&#x27;t seem to carry them stand-alone)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do they remove hair?  Yah... mostly.  sort of.  But not cleanly or completely, certainly not the most effective product I&#x27;ve tried, and the wax/sugar substance is a sticky mess to remove.  There aren&#x27;t enough of the wipes included to do the cleanup job.  Baby oil and baby powder are a definite must-use following use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried them on my legs...perhaps that&#x27;s the only area they&#x27;re designed to work well with.  For a pre-waxed strip, I prefer the Parissa products.  Unfortunately also difficult to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> Just like the title says, I have a really hairy stomach and these wax strips worked almost perfectly. My girlfriend stripped them off of me. Make sure to rub the strips until they&#x27;re really hot. Overall it does a great job and way cheaper than dropping $40.00 to get waxed professionally.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided to give this product a try because the price is lower than other brands of wax strips and the ratings were pretty good. But this product does not work for removing hair on my underarms. Instead of removing hair, the wax gets stuck on the skin and barely any hair was removed. It was also a pain to remove the sticky wax from the skin. I&#x27;ve had no luck with this product compared to some other users.</li>
    <li> I find it so funny how so many people give this a bad review because of their own clumsiness of getting wax in areas other than their legs. It&#x27;s wax people!! What do you expect!! What&#x27;s nice about these strips is the wax is sticky of course ( it is wax DUH) but it is not too hot to use or so gooey that I have to worry about it dripping everywhere. I waxed my legs sitting on the couch in my living room with no mess anywhere.  Also the perfect finish sheets that come in the box do a really great job of wiping the little bit of wax left on your legs. I also like how many strips you get inthe box too because it makes it last through quite a few waxes.  I also re-use each strip twice on my legs and it seems to work well enough for me. The only complaint I have is I wish the strips were cut into shorter pieces (which I&#x27;m sure I can cut on my own but am way too lazy).  It would be easier for me to face the pain with shorter strips because I find myself pulling the strips off in 3rds because it hurts so bad.  All in all, it works as its supposed to and does a great job especially for the price and ease!!</li>
    <li> With the advise of a friend, I tried this product. I bought one for face and other for body.  This is the first time I tried waxing at home and I was wowed by the result. So, easy to use and 90% less painful than salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried on my upper lip, wow hairs out without pain. I tried on my arms and really happy to see the hair coming out so nicely. Never knew waxing can be this easy. Not only that my skin is baby soft after the waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found a great waxing product.</li>
    <li> I have been getting my legs waxed for over a year and wanted to try these for the in between times.  I thought that since my hair is very thin after being waxed for so long that these would work-they didn&#x27;t. I had to use several on the same spot to get the hair off.  Wont but again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I didn&#x27;t use this as intended. I am a guy and I thought I&#x27;d try something cheap and easy to wax my chest with. I have no experience in the matter and figured this would be the best way to go. I warmed it up effortlessly in my hand and put it on my chest. Thinking to myself \\&quot;well this isn&#x27;t so bad\\&quot; I ripped it off fast and let out a big painful yell. I had finally seen MY chest being hairless and smooth and it looked so good showing out my muscles instead of being hidden away in that small forest. For this reason, I sucked it up and ripped of more and more. At this point I had used about 4-5 strips (2 strips are stuck together). The next one I put on I sat there with for about 2-3 minutes debating whether i&#x27;d rip it off since I was in agony. I decided I couldn&#x27;t take the pain and wanted to slowly take it off to avoid any more pain. It ripped off a few hairs and hurt a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My chest had turned red immediately after. I just loved the smoothness though. Since part of my chest was hairless while the rest wasn&#x27;t, I figured i&#x27;d do little by little every day to minimize the pain. That didn&#x27;t work out. The next day I was too scared to pull off any more. That was the last time I used this. Nothing against the product, I just think you need a high tolerance to pain for this. That, and it&#x27;s intended for legs and I&#x27;m sure it would be less painful there. Especially for a woman with just light hairs, as appose to a man with a hairy chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soo, good luck with waxing</li>
    <li> it is the great product!&lt;br /&gt;I know some people have said that they don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the key thing you cannot forget here is that you have to peel the wax strip off in the opposite direction of the flow of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Then, you should be able to get the result you want.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is good for winter, because you do not have to get wet in the bathtub to get rid of your hair!&lt;br /&gt;I greatly recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> Veet is one item I do not go without.  I love how it works and the oil smells good too. I only use once a month or so. Really worth the price.</li>
    <li> I applied the wax strips on my legs. After using it, my skin becomes itchy and red. The wax strips cannot effectively remove my hair and I had to do it several times which irritated me. Besides, it is very hard to remove the wax left on the legs... even I used makeup remover and soap.</li>
    <li> These made me bruise badly, although they were easy to use. Hair grew back within a week, however, despite being perfectly smooth after waxing.</li>
