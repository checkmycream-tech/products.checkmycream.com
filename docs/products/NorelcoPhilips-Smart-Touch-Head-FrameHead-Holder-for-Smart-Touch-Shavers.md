      <li>of course original part slowly stretches out and suspect htis</li>
      <li>I was afraid I was going to be able to find replacement part for my older model shaver.</li>

    <li> A no error supplier who uses photographs to insure you purchase what you want. The only site that correctly identified my needs, the complete frame/head holder for a Norelco/Philips Smart-Touch shaver. I tried but couldn&#x27;t obtain this information from other suppliers including the manufacturer, Philips.   I will be using this supplier in the future!</li>
    <li> My shaver literally started to fall apart - I would be in the middle of a shave and one of the heads would pop out of the frame - the plastic itself had become so worn with age.    I replaced the head frame and also the retaining plate and the shaver is now like new again!    Highly recomended.</li>
    <li> Head Frame works perfectly for my Norelco model. Saved me about $80 by not having to buy a whole new razor. I followed w/ new razor heads, and shave time is less than 1/2 it was before.</li>
    <li> finally found this part to my shaver, cheaper than replacing the whole thing.  part was brand new, shipped fiarly quickly...   price could have been a little better</li>
    <li> This is a perfect replacement part and works like new.  My shaver literally fell apart (same as the other reviews) and the heads would pop out in the middle of a shave, making it quite impossible to shave.  It took a while to find this part on amazon.com and when I did, I paid extra for 2-day shipping.  It arrived in 2 business days (excellent!); but what to do on the meantime?  Here is a TEMPORARY fix:  Allply a few drops of Super Glue to the joints of the floating heads of the frame.  OK, so it locks them in place (not sure why they needed to \\&quot;float\\&quot; in the first place), but they no longer fall out.  It worked so well, I began to wonder why I ordered a new one.  I&#x27;m saving the old one with the locked heads just in case this one also fails.  BTW, it lasted 4.5 years before it failed.</li>
    <li> Great product, fits perfect just like original.. You will not be let down... To bad the original didn&#x27;t last the life of the shaver..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s 9150 shaver. He seems to have to replace this part every 2-3 years. I&#x27;m fortunate to be able to find this replacement instead of purchasing a completely new shaver. The replacement part is a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> This product was a replacement part for my shaver.  It fits like the original one,which broke.  It is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Original wore out. This replacement was easily ordered, quickly delivered, and is a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> lucky to find this ... prevented having to buy a new razor</li>
    <li> Just like advertised. Fit perfectly and installed easily.</li>
    <li> Dropped my razor and broke the piece around the top. I love my current razor. It works perfectly fine and didn&#x27;t like the idea of buyin a new razor for nearly $100 and paying for more expensive razor heads. The only con I have is they didn&#x27;t offer free shipping. I am in Hawaii and paying shipping typically adds a lot to the cost of a product. Especially knowing this piece weighs almost nothing. The product is 5 star. Ding them for shipping costs.</li>
    <li> An exact replacement for the original B/M head which lasted six years...will keep the razor operating where it would have been discarded...</li>
    <li> We really like it instead of getting a new razon,we had the option to get the broke head holder for the Norelco/Phillips Smart, thank you</li>
    <li> works very well. reestablishes shaver as new. of course original part slowly stretches out and suspect htis wil do same. original shaver could be built more sturdy</li>
    <li> After several years use of my Smart Touch shaver, I noticed the the heads were becoming loose and were not giving me as smooth a shave as before.  New head frame/head holder worked great and my shaver is as good as new.</li>
    <li> This one replaced my Philips SmartTouch XL shaver original head holder with absolute precision and no hassle. The brand-new hinge and coil seems durable and is certainly strong. This head holds the new HQ9 heads snugly in place and embraces replacement parts in a coherent whole, giving a &amp;#34;brand-new&amp;#34; quality to the whole shaver&#x27;s top that translates into smooth shaving. I should have done this substitution years ago!</li>
    <li> it replaced the broken one just fine.  cheaper then buying a new razor.  maybe I can get another six years.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here;was exactly what my husband needed.</li>
    <li> Thanks to this frame, I have a shaver for many years. The fit and quality are OEM. I also purchased new blades.</li>

    <li> When this piece cracked on my shaver (9160XL), I thought I was going to have to buy a new unit. When this piece arrived, I removed the old one by lifting a small tab with a tiny screw driver, and popped the new one it. Took &amp;lt; 5 minutes and it was good as new.</li>
    <li> I was totally satisfied with this purchase. It was just as advertised and just what I expected. A total satisfying experience.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my old head frame. I was afraid I was going to be able to find replacement part for my older model shaver. Found it here and it works great</li>
