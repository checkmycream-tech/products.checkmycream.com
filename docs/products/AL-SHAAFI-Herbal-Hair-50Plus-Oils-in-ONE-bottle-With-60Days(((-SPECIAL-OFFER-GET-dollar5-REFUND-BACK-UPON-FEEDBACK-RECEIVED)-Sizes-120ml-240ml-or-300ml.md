      <li>This oil resembles the oil from my childhood very much, but I think is even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this oil brand especially the smell</li>
      <li>I have been graying since I was 14, and this oil appeared to lessen the gray strands and made my entire head of hair more</li>
      <li>For those of you with healthy hair already, it will only enhance your hair in my opinon, but I&#x27;m not an expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>OKAY MY HAIR DID NOT GROW  LONG</li>
      <li>It made my hair shiny,  more manageable,even thicker since my hair is already long and it was growing faster too.</li>
      <li>After a whole month of using this product my hair is thicker and stronger, slpit ends are close to gone</li>

      <li>I have a sensitive scalp and this product let me know that right away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, it something I can bare considering the results.  </li>
      <li>I also want to say that this oil is strong, a little too strong for me, so I sent it back for a refund.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is a little stronger than most oils but it will wear off as the day goes along, in my opinion it smells like a burnt kemi oil fragrance with a coco bean tar smell</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks to see if now that my hair has thicken, if it will show signs of growth and will edit my review, accordingly.</li>
      <li>s. Normal growth i was looking for some sprout like on the picture</li>
      <li>That is amazing as the new growth is usually only about a half of an inch in two weeks time.</li>
      <li>I have some new hair growth coming in</li>
      <li>I have almost an inch of new growth in just two weeks time.</li>
      <li>and I am amazed at the amount of new growth I have.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t make my grow more than usual; it usually grows about a quarter of an inch with out AL-SHAAFI; after applying AL-SHASFI every night; 5 times a week and living it over night it did not grow more than a quarter of an inch; witch is what it normally grows with out it.</li>
      <li>The smell is a little strong, but after 2 weeks of using the product my hair got thicker and my split ends started to decrease.</li>
      <li>I have started using the oil and so far I like the results.</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s all 100% natural products</li>
      <li>how long does it take  thanks</li>
      <li>Since my hair is fragile (african american 4/c), I tend to use it a little more.</li>
      <li>Great product but smells bad.</li>
      <li>I generally use it after each shampoo &amp; conditioning days, then 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s been 2 months and the product seems to work just like a regular oil.</li>
      <li>It came in a silver narrow aluminum container with a  black top (taped up) with bubble wrap.</li>

<li> Ugh I bought this and it worked good for the 2 times I used it considering that when I got the package that the lid wasn&#x27;t on right and everything including my eyeliners I had also ordered was covered in nasty smelly grease!!</li>
<li> Keeping in mind, my hair was severely dry and unmoisturized until I started really taking care of my hair a few months ago.</li>
<li> I had very long hair as a child, but when I grew up, I was keeping it relatively short, because it was breaking.</li>
<li> One should not expect to have thick dark hair, if one has thin fair hair.</li>
<li> ,i really freaked out,i think if you guys research well some herbals can not stay in any container ,just do something to the product,add a fragrance or anything,they can start having deeper smell than they already have,i had to make the review because the seller was not nice at all ,</li>
<li> I can also tell that the back of my hair has grown a little under 1/2 an inch</li>
<li> Money is well spent.</li>
<li> just add some water or other oil with it.</li>
<li> no alcohol, that dries your hair out over time, no parabens, no toxic ingredients that cause health problems that get into your blood stream like other hair products.</li>
<li> FOR A HALF OF YEAR  AND 4 OTHER PEOPLE USE IT WITH ME  </li>
<li> My hair strands are stronger, I can tell and less shedding for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I just wish it cost a bit less.</li>
<li> Bad oil , but does not have a no result , bad smell , and when he sent them to recover the money because he went 60 days without results replied no we can not return the money and started lying and deception , very resentful of this method is cheap</li>
<li> It is a waste of money. .didn&#x27;t</li>
<li> but it smells like dead rat</li>
<li> Over all I noticed it made my hair thicker and less frizzy!</li>
<li> I struggled for year to grow my hair, never getting it past my shoulders..</li>
<li> but I have grown at least two inches.</li>
<li> They also refunded me the shipping fee because they realized that the product was going to be late delivered to my address.</li>
<li> The only thing is that it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
<li> so it is a little difficult to judge length in hair growth.</li>
<li> These people are very serious about pleasing their customers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an excellent product! Keep making it. The only thing is that it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s been 2 months and the product seems to work just like a regular oil. I have some new hair growth coming in so I guess you can say it&#x27;s working..</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from E-bay and it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon. When I used this product I immediately noticed a difference in the texture of my hair. It made my hair shiny,  more manageable,even thicker since my hair is already long and it was growing faster too. Unfortunately, after I used up the bottle I didn&#x27;t order anymore for awhile since it was more expensive on E-bay. I will definitely order again! Plus it&#x27;s all 100% natural products no alcohol, that dries your hair out over time, no parabens, no toxic ingredients that cause health problems that get into your blood stream like other hair products. I&#x27;m glad to say this it all natural and very safe to use and healthy for your hair 100%!!!!</li>
    <li> It has been three weeks since I started using this product. The scent is very strong. I transfer some of the oil from its metal bottle to a plastic one so that I can squeeze the liquid onto my hair, as its original one doesn&#x27;t freely allow me to do so. As for the length, there hasn&#x27;t been a change; the only thing that I have noticed is that my hair strands are a bit thicker. I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks to see if now that my hair has thicken, if it will show signs of growth and will edit my review, accordingly.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to continue using. But just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product even though i mixt it with my Hair greece it still. Works.</li>
    <li> No way this is a lie am pissed mad and i wasted money am still looking moneyback really that would be a shock. I hope this would help that happen 2 month s. Normal growth i was looking for some sprout like on the picture and it smells. Like i dont know but it btoke me up with a boyfriend. Of 6 yrs he said it was a turn off lol am like. Omg to hair products</li>
    <li> The smell is a little strong, but after 2 weeks of using the product my hair got thicker and my split ends started to decrease. After a whole month of using this product my hair is thicker and stronger, slpit ends are close to gone and my hair has grown up to 3in on its own and when i brush my hair i see nothing on my comb. Money is well spent.</li>
    <li> I struggled for year to grow my hair, never getting it past my shoulders..also after my son was born I began to shed more hair than my dog in winter. . With last ditch hope I ordered this oil..I started using it on March 29 an today its June 1, my hair has grown 6 inches!  I am so happy an thankful for this product. .the shredding has stopped an my hair has never looked better.. the smell is strongly herb based , but if given the choice smelly beautiful an long strong hair or weak damaged good smelling scalp. . The choice is yours</li>
    <li> love what I was orther</li>
    <li> First day so not sure about how it works yet but it does smell like old bay seasoning lol. Very strong smell. Has a lot of oils in it tho so it makes sense. Hope it works. I&#x27;ll right another review in a month</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. I had a bald spot and 8 weeks of use 3-4 times a week and it&#x27;s almost gone.</li>
    <li> Great product but smells bad. I leave in overnight</li>
    <li> Did not grow my hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> I just start using it and I hope it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make my grow more than usual; it usually grows about a quarter of an inch with out AL-SHAAFI; after applying AL-SHASFI every night; 5 times a week and living it over night it did not grow more than a quarter of an inch; witch is what it normally grows with out it.</li>
    <li> OKAY MY HAIR DID NOT GROW  LONG LIKE THE PHOTOS THE COMPANY PUT UP ...I USED 6 BOTTLES AND MY HAIR GROW 3INCHS IN 6 MONTHS I BEEN USEIN THIS FOR A HALF OF YEAR  AND 4 OTHER PEOPLE USE IT WITH ME  AND THE SAME WITH THEM IT DONT WORK....IT DONT GROW HAIR REAL FAST ....911 DONT BUY ITS A RIPOFF SCAM 911</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love the oil, it stopped my hair fall. my hair use too fall so much, after using this oil it cools my head and helped my hair from falling so much, I see my hair getting lengthy it feels heavier. I ordered about 8 of these bottle already my whole family loves it</li>
    <li> poor,i will not buy this again,its herbal I understand but it smells like dead rat,i really freaked out,i think if you guys research well some herbals can not stay in any container ,just do something to the product,add a fragrance or anything,they can start having deeper smell than they already have,i had to make the review because the seller was not nice at all ,she/he was just all about making their money ,I don&#x27;t need a refund anymore,i just would not recommend this for anymore.</li>
    <li> Ugh I bought this and it worked good for the 2 times I used it considering that when I got the package that the lid wasn&#x27;t on right and everything including my eyeliners I had also ordered was covered in nasty smelly grease!! The smell didn&#x27;t bother me when I used it on my head. Over all I noticed it made my hair thicker and less frizzy! I emailed  the company and didn&#x27;t work out well. ;/ I will not be buying it again and I&#x27;ll rate 2 stars!!! Would be better if I could have used it more. I do believe it works!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I have been using for just one week and I already can see the difference. My hair looks healthier and easier to manage ( my hair is curly). The oil has an unusual smell, but it does not bother me at all. I am happy with the results and I intend to keep using it :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
    <li> This is a very good scalp oil.</li>
    <li> Bad oil , but does not have a no result , bad smell , and when he sent them to recover the money because he went 60 days without results replied no we can not return the money and started lying and deception , very resentful of this method is cheap, I will not repeat the experience again, and will not forgive you for taking the money without result oil ,,</li>
    <li> Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
    <li> I love this oil brand especially the smell it&#x27;s very light I&#x27;ll be ordering again</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for a 3-4 weeks now. I generally use it after each shampoo &amp; conditioning days, then 2 or 3 times a week. I have been graying since I was 14, and this oil appeared to lessen the gray strands and made my entire head of hair more glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little stronger than most oils but it will wear off as the day goes along, in my opinion it smells like a burnt kemi oil fragrance with a coco bean tar smell and I actually like the smell.. My hair strands are stronger, I can tell and less shedding for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this oil on my scalp (sparingly not much) each night and cover my hair with a satin scarp or soft night cap, when I wake up, my braided hair unravels with super ease. I think this oil will help anyone&#x27;s hair. Since my hair is fragile (african american 4/c), I tend to use it a little more. The packaging was well put together, no leaks. It came in a silver narrow aluminum container with a  black top (taped up) with bubble wrap. I rate this product a 5. I can also tell that the back of my hair has grown a little under 1/2 an inch &amp; it feels as if it has thickened up on the sides. Keeping in mind, my hair was severely dry and unmoisturized until I started really taking care of my hair a few months ago. For those of you with healthy hair already, it will only enhance your hair in my opinon, but I&#x27;m not an expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have started using the oil and so far I like the results. I smell like curry for a night but I have grown at least two inches. I will definitely buy it again and soon. I just wish it cost a bit less.</li>
    <li> Actually works great! but smells bad.</li>
    <li> This is not one of those pretty smelling oils, but it&#x27;s get so many good ingredients.......... it&#x27;s got to work</li>
    <li> I just received my bottle today and put on the oil. I sure hope that it works. I did receive it a day early which was great. I will keep you posted on the results.</li>
    <li> I was looking for such oil for ages and tried tons of different oils. Nothing stands even close to this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my story. I had very long hair as a child, but when I grew up, I was keeping it relatively short, because it was breaking. My grandma used oil on my hair, do not ask me the brand :)  But I do remember the feeling and the smell. This oil resembles the oil from my childhood very much, but I think is even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody&#x27;s hair is different. One should not expect to have thick dark hair, if one has thin fair hair. But one thing is certain, this oil will make your hair MUCH better. I got one bottle, will be getting three more</li>
    <li> so far so good, my hair is softer. I have mixed African American hair so it is a little difficult to judge length in hair growth. But if nothing else it helping with the overall health of my hair</li>
    <li> Just got  it no idea how long does it take  thanks</li>
    <li> I must say that I did had a bad experience because it broke me out a little. I also want to say that this oil is strong, a little too strong for me, so I sent it back for a refund. These people sent my refund as soon as they received the product back. They also refunded me the shipping fee because they realized that the product was going to be late delivered to my address. I was just amazed at their speedy ways of doing thing. They are very nice with everything. I felt like I owe them a nice review because they have been so nice about everything. These people are very serious about pleasing their customers. If you have any questions about the oil, just send them an email and they will respond fast. I hated that the oil was not for me, doesn&#x27;t mean it not for you. I have a sensitive scalp and this product let me know that right away. Their oil is good. but it just was not for me and I wanted to tell others that the oil is not bad. This oil is unique and will do as it say for anyone who is having issues with their hair growing. I say try it and see if it is for you. That&#x27;s what I did. If not then let them know. They will not disappoint you about refunding or giving more information about their product. I had a great experience with them throw everything-purchasing the product to refunding my money. I feel if you are having issue with the oil just add some water or other oil with it. I believe this oil is what they say it is and will do what they say it will do. Just email them and ask them questions. I wished I had did that before returning it so quickly.</li>
    <li> Phenomenal! This oil really works. I am African American and I have braids in my hair and I&#x27;ve had them for only two weeks as I just had a re-braid, and I began using the oil on my scalp the very next day and I am amazed at the amount of new growth I have. I have almost an inch of new growth in just two weeks time. That is amazing as the new growth is usually only about a half of an inch in two weeks time. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, it something I can bare considering the results.  I am a breast cancer survivor and can&#x27;t wait to have my hair back.</li>
    <li> It is a waste of money. .didn&#x27;t do anything. .I don&#x27;t even want to give it one star..</li>
    <li> this hair oil do not work at all</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much yet but the jury is still out</li>
