      <li>If you drop it, consider it gone for good</li>
      <li>Good for the lip hair,but suck for the rest of the face needs to be a bit stronger.</li>
      <li>This one is ALMOST as good</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t as good as I would want.</li>
      <li>All in all, I think it was a good purchase.</li>
      <li>Read the directions and you are off to a more beautiful face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased compared to bleaching.</li>
      <li>I love never having to shave anymore!  </li>
      <li>This is not the most pleasant appliance to use.  </li>
      <li>So nice to have the flexibility to do this at my own home.  </li>
      <li>It skips over the hairs you can literally see and can pluck on your own.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before and liked it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel it is effective at all.</li>
      <li>You must use some kind of shave cream</li>
      <li>it  rips the hair out often catching the skin.</li>
      <li>and  I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank yo for Your fast service .AAA+++</li>
      <li>It works on my wife&#x27;s face, but not on my own beard.  </li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t remove course hair very easily.</li>
      <li>I had an Episilk that was much more effective.  </li>
      <li>but that is not what I have found to be most effective.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my face where the skin is very fine.  </li>
      <li>I loving more and more as I use it.</li>
      <li>It literally is tweezing your hair out with the root, so pain is the thing most people forget is an unavoidable aspect.</li>
      <li>and I feel it creates a more youthful appearance.  </li>
      <li>No, but the ones it leave are usually more visible and easier to pull.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;to cut the hairs more than it pulls it out from the roots.  </li>
      <li>It would be much better if this was a rechargeable unit because as the batteries wear out the unit doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.    </li>
      <li>I was sure I would be returning this, as I had the non-battery version which did not work at all.  </li>
      <li>Not my top pick for epilators thats for sure.</li>
      <li>I am completely pleased with the Epilady Esthetic</li>
      <li>and I just love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but all that seemed ok.</li>
      <li>and it is awesome because now I have lesser and finer hair growth in my underarms.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t rate it because she hasn&#x27;t told me if she is pleased with the way it works.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re trying to remove hair against the grain, you&#x27;re going to feel it more than if you&#x27;re pulling it out in the direction</li>
      <li>The thicker the hair the more it hurts.  </li>
      <li>Used this a couple of times since it&#x27;s arrival and hope to see the same results as the Epilady Coil Epilator which is surely awesome as I have surely seen slower hair growth after using the coil Epilator on my arms and legs.</li>
      <li>Make sure you are holding it horizontal to your skin</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re trying to remove hair against the grain, you&#x27;re going to feel it more than if you&#x27;re pulling it out in the direction</li>
      <li>They missed too many hairs.  </li>
      <li>Be sure that you&#x27;re going in all directions.  </li>
      <li>I am really pleased with the way it works for the most part.  </li>
      <li>I am not as satisfied with this product as I would lke to be.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used every trick that I have been able to find in the instructions and on line, but I&#x27;m still not getting the results that I had hoped for.  </li>
      <li>Works better than a cheaper one from another company.</li>
      <li>I would like it to have more pull power.  </li>
      <li>The heat seems to help the hair \\&quot;stand up\\&quot; more, supposedly making it easier to tweeze.</li>
      <li>It might grab a couple of hairs but mostly it does nothing.</li>
      <li>And, if it proves to be as great as the original Epilady, I won&#x27;t have to use it forever.  </li>
      <li>And, if it proves to be as great as the original Epilady, I won&#x27;t have to use it forever.  </li>
      <li>I had an older versionn of the Epilady and it was far superior to this one, this seems to shave rather than pull out the hairs, not too impressed</li>
      <li>The older model of this was great, I would not recommend this one.  </li>
      <li>With all of these speed-tweeze type things, you get better at it over time as you recognize light pressure and growth direction.</li>
      <li>I have Epiladys original coil epilator that I have used for many years on my body.</li>
      <li>Therefore, you need to catch it in the way that it comes out easily.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been epilating my legs for well over 20 years, so thought this would work fine, no matter what others said.  </li>
      <li>My skin was fine though after a couple of hours</li>
      <li>It took off a lot of those hairs you can&#x27;t see in the mirror- fine hair on your neck, under chin, etc.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work on the fine hairs.</li>
      <li>this item is light in eight and easy to hold</li>
      <li>Still doesn&#x27;t get the fine hair or the thicker hair.</li>
      <li>It works best if you use it daily for the first week or two.  </li>
      <li>It may be too fine.</li>
      <li>I have had my Epilady for about a month, great product, it does sting a little, but it pulls the hair out, better than a No-No!</li>

      <li>Pulling skin tight works best.  </li>
      <li>I have PCOS and have been at this facial-hair thing since I was like 16, and I am very very very happy with this little gadget.</li>
      <li>I use (and love) the Epilady on my legs: this seemed worth a try.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.</li>
      <li>I will say that it is important to change the position, maintain contact with the skin, and have patience and persistence.</li>
      <li>I experienced no discomfort and no redness on my fair and delicate skin.</li>
      <li>I AM GOING TO TRY ONE MORE EPIL MACHINE AND SEE IF WORKS RIGHT.</li>
      <li>hair which is most of them, coil gets very hot &amp; batteries weaken quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife loves this. She wore one out, and asked for another. Makes Christmas shopping easy.  You have to be careful about cleaning it.  When you open it up, the springy thing can pop out, but you can replace it by being careful. this was a problem over the several years we owned the first one.  It works on my wife&#x27;s face, but not on my own beard.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> This item does work according to how it is advertised, but I am not sure I would purchase it again.  It is more uncomfortable to use than one might expect and it takes more time to use it properly.</li>
    <li> I had an older versionn of the Epilady and it was far superior to this one, this seems to shave rather than pull out the hairs, not too impressed</li>
    <li> bought this to remove facial hair and it did not remove all hair, ended up using tweezers to finish- not what i anticipated</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  It pulls the hairs on my face but doesn&#x27;t pull all of them out and I wind up using tweezers anyway.  It would be much better if this was a rechargeable unit because as the batteries wear out the unit doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.    I should have/could have sent it back but didn&#x27;t so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it but will not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great.</li>
    <li> This burned my skin really badly and did not remove a single hair. I would really give it zero stars!</li>
    <li> Not easy to use as I&#x27;d hoped. Either I don&#x27;t get HOW (followed instructions over and over) or my facial hair is too short? It&#x27;s relatively painless too which I was worried about. I&#x27;m still trying to figure it out after a few days of using it.</li>
    <li> FIRST OF ALL I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM ON AMAZON... I BOUGHT IT ON A WELL KNOWN AUCTION SITE, IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE NEW.?? BUT NOT SURE IT WAS.. IAM ONLY DEALING WITH ABOUT 3 FINE LONG HAIRS UNDER MY CHIN, THAT I CAN NOT SEE TO PLUCK. I MIGHT AS WELL OF SHAVED THEM... BECAUSE  THIS PRODUCT MADE THEM THICKER BY BREAKING THEM OFF.... I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.  I DID OWN THE ORIGINAL OLD EPILADY ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO,IT WAS PAINFUL AND NOT FOR FACE,.... BUT IT SHOULD HURT TO PULL HAIR BY THE ROOTS.... AND IT WORKED VERY WELL AT PULLING HAIR OUT....WELL THAT IS MY STORY.... I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON THESE 3 LITTLE PESTY WHISKERS UNDER MY CHIN... I AM GOING TO TRY ONE MORE EPIL MACHINE AND SEE IF WORKS RIGHT. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD EXCELENT LUCK WITH AMAZON ORDERS.... I WILL GET ONE WITH GOOD REVIEWS...</li>
    <li> It works exactly as expected.  The initial use is slightly painful, but after that, no pain at all.  Pulling skin tight works best.  I would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Not as advertised.Extremely painful, leaves bumps. Don&#x27;t buy it. Also hard to use, not balanced, but most of all, it&#x27;s not painless.</li>
    <li> Does not do as advertised.  Back to tweezing.  Will continue to look elsewhere for a more professional tool to do the job.</li>
    <li> Only pulled...made my skin bleed.</li>
    <li> Well, got tired of my 8 year old telling me, \\&quot;Shave your mustache Mom.\\&quot;  I use Retin-A, so I can&#x27;t wax or use hair removal cream.  Having very, very fine clear hairs on my face, plucking would be a joke.  This works okay.  Not perfect, but definitely reduces the hair.  It works better on longer hairs than short, but I believe if I use it more than 1 time a week, I&#x27;d be able to take care of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips -&lt;br /&gt;Always use witch hazel before and after using (no ingrown hairs at all!)&lt;br /&gt;Pull your skin taught or you won&#x27;t get the little hairs &amp; you may get hurt (my husband tried it on his ear hair and got his ear skin sucked in.....painful, but oh so funny!)&lt;br /&gt;Put vaseline or aquafor on your lips after using witch hazel, when completely done.&lt;br /&gt;If you possibly can, wait 30 minutes before moisurizing/putting on make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  It hurt as much as I thought.  But doing a little each day will get you used to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating my legs for well over 20 years, so thought this would work fine, no matter what others said.  I&#x27;ve come to some conclusions as to conditions that are assumed before using this.      This is what I THINK (NOT a scientific opinion)  This is for people who haven&#x27;t been using other methods of removing facial hair.  I have been plucking and waxing facial hair for years, thus facial hair regrowth has been coarse and thick.      This epilator didn&#x27;t work initially for me.  It does now! I used my leg epilator (which is NOT recommended for facial use) on its lowest setting, in very quick strokes.  I did this for several weeks, and now the hair regrowth is fine (not coarse) and is easy to remove with my epilator.</li>
    <li> Does not work, very weak, should be recalled.  Doesn&#x27;t even work on delicate hair.  I should have returned it when bought it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon (wish I had because I would have paid less for it) but I did read the Amazon reviews before buying so I wanted to add a comment. I have used this twice so far and found that it works very well and it is not difficult to use if you read instructions. Some reviewers said it was very painful but I found it less painful than tweezing and it is much more effective. All in all I am happy I bought this product.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> It skips over the hairs you can literally see and can pluck on your own. It&#x27;s a time waster. It&#x27;s not reliable and eventually it gets hot on your skin. I&#x27;m still looking for a replacement.</li>
    <li> This is not the most pleasant appliance to use.  But that is the nature of the beast.  It hurts when it is pulling hair from your face.  The thicker the hair the more it hurts.  The other side of the coin, your hair keeps getting finer and finer, so it is more difficult to epilate.  That being said, I just purchased my 2nd one.  It is fragile, but it does work.  It is very delicate and you cannot catch a lot of hair from your head in it, or else it will need replacing.  I have never tried waxing and have no desire to and I don&#x27;t really like shaving.  You must use some kind of shave cream and it just seems to me that would irritate facial skin.  So epi it is!</li>
    <li> After using this a few times I think I&#x27;ve discovered the trick to using this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. Go slow, just not so slow that it gets to hot on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. Turn the unit several different ways over an area of your skin. I work one direction and then go back over the area from a different angle/direction.&lt;br /&gt;3. There is only a small area towards the top of the unit that is actually effective in removing hair. Not the large area at the top of the wire spring but at the lower area of it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t expect it to get 100% of the hairs. However, it is much better than the methods I&#x27;ve used in the past. I am satisfied with the results I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the product. Oh sure, an expensive unit might do better but this fits my limited budget and gives results I am satisfied with.</li>
    <li> No matter how you  tighten your skin to use it, it catches your skin, especially around the mouth and chin.  Then it tears it.  I have scars from the tears.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to remove facial hair.  I have chin whiskers (very unbecoming on a woman of any age) and lots of the soft downy hair all over my face.  I originally purchased another product and returned it without even using it when I realized it was not suitable for removing facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is specifically designed to remove facial hair.  It appears to be modeled after the little spring with two handles that manually removes hair as you bend the spring and twist it in a spiraling motion to grab the hairs and pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this product doesn&#x27;t work that way at all.  As near as I can tell after trying the product and examining its functionality, it vibrates its curved spring.  Apparently, the vibration causes the spring wires to (occasionally) separate and come together enough to grab a hair shaft.  Theoretically, once the hair shaft is grabbed, it will be pulled out as you slide the implement over your face--against the way the hair grows.  The fact is that the vibration may cause the spring wires to open and grab a hair, but just as quickly, they will let it go without pulling the hair out.  So you get many little painful tugs of hair with very few hairs actually being removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a number of review about this and other products \\&quot;designed\\&quot; for this purpose, I have decided to continue finding fine-quality tweezers and using my 7X mirror in the light of a sunny window to remove the unwanted hair from my face.</li>
    <li> I would like it to have more pull power.  It only removes the peach fuzz and not the shorter hairs.</li>
    <li> does not even work with new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;no wrapping....just stuffed into an envelope&lt;br /&gt;most unimpressive&lt;br /&gt;for this price;  I don&#x27;t think so !</li>
    <li> After the first use, I stored this in a drawer. The next time I went to use it, the plastic cracked and the whole unit fell apart! At this price this is totally unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Does not do as expected.  It pulls, hurts and gets hot.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> So Far so good&lt;br /&gt;  Used this a couple of times since it&#x27;s arrival and hope to see the same results as the Epilady Coil Epilator which is surely awesome as I have surely seen slower hair growth after using the coil Epilator on my arms and legs. I actually also used for my Underarms and it is awesome because now I have lesser and finer hair growth in my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;  This I am using for my upper lip hair as I have to thread almost every other week but hoping that now after having started using this for my upper lip the hair growth will decrease.&lt;br /&gt;Will update in a few weeks if I am seeing notable difference in growth of hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and liked it.  My old one died so I got this one to replace it.  Thank you for the good price.</li>
    <li> Love this little shaver for troublesome facial hair.  I did learn to hold the skin tightly or it becomes a bit painful and bumpy. Just follow directions.</li>
    <li> It breaks the hairs off.  It does not pull the hairs out as advertised.  I use it on my face where the skin is very fine.  It may be too fine.</li>
    <li> it is absolutely useless. I have used it multiple times and it has failed every time. It might grab a couple of hairs but mostly it does nothing. I have tried it on my face, my arms and even my legs just to test it&#x27;s performance and this product will not remove any type of hair from coarse to baby fine. The one or two hairs it grabs causes the coil to jam against your skin and stop rotating without removing the hair forcing you to pull the hair manually. I had great hopes for this product but am only disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am a 41 year old woman. I have PCOS and have been at this facial-hair thing since I was like 16, and I am very very very happy with this little gadget. It took off a lot of those hairs you can&#x27;t see in the mirror- fine hair on your neck, under chin, etc. Does it hurt a little? Yep. Does it hurt any worse that tweezing or waxing? No. It didn&#x27;t get all of the hairs- especially the very pesky thick white hairs and a few of the dark ones, but those are also the ones you can feel and pluck with tweezer, too. This gets all the ones you can&#x27;t see. Awesome, awesome, awesome!</li>
    <li> I have owned two of the larger epilady products, but only needed this one this time to perfect the face and swim line for new pool aerobics.  Happy customer.</li>
    <li> I like it because it does remove fine hair with minimal pain.  However, it does not get the tiny blonde peach fuzz on the face.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gag gift for a friend who was laughing about the trouble women go through for their men, and how her &amp;#34;lady moustache&amp;#34; was in need of urgent care. We are both old enough to remember when Epilady products first hit the market, so I though she would get a few laughs from this. Turns out she actually likes it, despite the break in adjustment from manually tweezing, and uses it on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I just wasted my time and energy with this product.  It&#x27;s not grabbing or plucking my facial hair.</li>
    <li> finally something that works</li>
    <li> I would not have even given it one star if it could have been avoided. It broke hairs instead of removing them. It gets so hot so quickly that it burns your skin. I used it months ago and the marks are still not completely gone. Totally grateful I could return it.</li>
    <li> So far - it removes my fine facial hair.</li>
    <li> This little machine hurts like the dickens when you first use it but after a few times you get used to it.  It works very well and for me, it&#x27;s better than the waxing I was doing in the past.  It is light and easy to use. Read the directions and you are off to a more beautiful face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Epilady Esthetic Facial Epilator for several months and I have to say that I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  About the only facial hair that get removed is the peach fuzz.  The longer and/or more coarse hair just gets broken off rather than removed.  Within a couple of days the hair is back and the process must be repeated.  I&#x27;ve used every trick that I have been able to find in the instructions and on line, but I&#x27;m still not getting the results that I had hoped for.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the epilator, but it&#x27;s not what I had hoped.  Oh, well . . .</li>
    <li> This is a great tool and very compact.  Do you do get some minor pain such as tweezing but at the price it is a lot better than some other tools I have used and no chemicals.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quick, pretty comfortable, and regrows to be less-noticeable than before. I use (and love) the Epilady on my legs: this seemed worth a try. I&#x27;m very pleased compared to bleaching.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product it felt like tons of tweezers pulling out the hairs, which didn&#x27;t bother me because I previously tweezed a lot. It does a pretty good job of removing hair, especially the fine hair. But  coarse hairs are hard to remove and sometimes have to be removed by hand with your tweezers. Also, chin hairs and bottom jawline sometimes need several tries to remove the hair. However, I would still recommend it because it does save a lot of time. I just wish it had a rechargeable battery!</li>
    <li> I have had 2 other ones over a long period of time.  This is a&lt;br /&gt;great product and  I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank yo for Your fast service .AAA+++</li>
    <li> I have Epiladys original coil epilator that I have used for many years on my body. It is terrific.  I have gotten a few epilators that say they are good for the face but have not liked them.  They missed too many hairs.  I decide to get this one and am so happy I did.. I have fine fuzz on my face that I hate as it picks up and shows makeup. Using this as illitrated, it removed it all.  It also took care of some coarse hairs I have on my lip and chin area. Hold your skin so it is taut and go in circular motions Slowly. Make sure you are holding it horizontal to your skin and you will find it does work, does a great job and doesn&#x27;t pinch your skin like the non coil ones sometimes do. Also because of the way the coil works and  rests on your skin the coil gets all the hairs unlike the pinchers that are not right next to each other and therefore miss hairs.</li>
    <li> It does not work! What else is there to say. If your a smart shopper you won&#x27;t buy it, it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my sister for her birthday; it&#x27;s what she wanted.  I can&#x27;t rate it because she hasn&#x27;t told me if she is pleased with the way it works.</li>
    <li> The older model of this was great, I would not recommend this one.  It doesn&#x27;t work well at all, is painful&lt;br /&gt;as it  rips the hair out often catching the skin. There is nothing delicate about the operation of this product.</li>
    <li> It dos now do what it is intended to do... waisted $40...hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it....i want my $$ back</li>
    <li> Better than tweezing, better than shaving--it takes quite a while for the hair to grow back. It&#x27;s not nearly as painful as I thought either. It doesn&#x27;t get the teeny-tiny hairs that are just starting to pop out; but I can get those 2 or 3 with my tweezers. I use it at night before going to bed, even on my upper lip. I do my whole face and it works and I just love it.</li>
    <li> Best ever! Tried nono , I have tried waxing, depilatories, tweezing none compare to this. No ballots after ward, no rash, no irritation.  I have a condition called PCOS it makes hair grows in places you don&#x27;t want. This removed it all with far less pain then  waxing. I have the 3 coil from high school and still use it but this is gentle on the face and other places. Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it. Thank you epilady for a another trustworthy product.</li>
    <li> Good for the lip hair,but suck for the rest of the face needs to be a bit stronger.</li>
    <li> I was sure I would be returning this, as I had the non-battery version which did not work at all.  If you are reading this review, you area most likely familiar with the horrors of increasing facial hair as we ladies get older.  I have tried plucking (too many hairs, too little time), waxing (too expensive and inconvenient), and DIY strips (led to contact dermatitis).  Oh, let&#x27;s not forget the little shavers, which lead to thicker and darker hair, and must be done daily.  This pulls a little but is tolerable; just be sure to pull you skin taught and it will grab the hair vs. your skin.  It works especially well on the fine hairs on the sides of the face, but I must warn you, that is where it is the most uncomfortable.  Again, however, it is tolerable.  I think the directions said to use in circles but that is not what I have found to be most effective.  Pulling it against the hair growth seems to work the best for me.  Does it get all the little hairs?  No, but the ones it leave are usually more visible and easier to pull.  The longer I use it, the less extra hairs I have to pull, and growth appears slower.  With even the little hairs that are not really visible gone, my makeup goes on smoother and I feel it creates a more youthful appearance.  If I could improve it, I would give it a cord vs. batteries, although I have not had an issue with it pulling batteries down quickly.  Give it a chance and I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Forgot I had one already and it was not gentle.  I returned the package. Do not like product. It hurts</li>
    <li> Still doesn&#x27;t get the fine hair or the thicker hair. Only the medium hair and that&#x27;s not what I wanted it for. I use it, but I&#x27;m not thrilled.</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough to do much good.  Larger model is much better.</li>
    <li> It works great on fine hairs but not so well on the few thicker hairs.  Since hairs grows in different angles on my face it&#x27;s important to hold the Epilady at various angles to successfully remove some hairs.  I loving more and more as I use it. Wish I had purchased it sooner.</li>
    <li> The product work as described I do like it&lt;br /&gt;Better than similar products I had my for several days now, working good&lt;br /&gt;Product exceeds my expectations</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t get the hairs very well.  I would not buy it again but it does work, just not well.</li>
    <li> All of these type products require a feather-lite touch, practice &amp; patience. You almost have to focus just on grazing the surface - it may not get every single hair every time, but it does get most. Not even waxing or creams will always get each hair. With all of these speed-tweeze type things, you get better at it over time as you recognize light pressure and growth direction. The bonus is how long the hair stays gone and that over long term use, it becomes finer or nonexistent I spent a little over 20 dollars for an emjoi 140 tweeze and this 3 tweeze for the face at CVS. Both work well and fast. Yes, it does hurt the first few times, but use ice or an anti-inflammatory beforehand &amp; it wont bother you much. It literally is tweezing your hair out with the root, so pain is the thing most people forget is an unavoidable aspect. But not having stubble or ingrown hairs or long periods of time trying to tweeze the problem hairs that only increase with age? Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull hair but it does pull your skin into it.</li>
    <li> This was bought for someone that I know wanted to control unwanted facial hair.  They never use it because it heats up very fast and is not effective at actually removing hair - the times they use it then end up tweezing what the epilady can&#x27;t seem to get.</li>
    <li> Works better than a cheaper one from another company.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the fine facial hairs as well as my leg epilator does.</li>
    <li> I have used epilators for over 20 years and this one didn&#x27;t work.  Unfortunately, I really wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> This works great for me, I wish I had bought it years ago when I bought the one that is for legs.  I experienced no discomfort and no redness on my fair and delicate skin.</li>
    <li> This was an absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works OK, but it really hurts when using it, unless I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  I won&#x27;t be using it very often!</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I was using a manual spring and its a little tough on my wrists (the twisting action). This thing removes NOTHING! i boxed it up and labeled it to return it and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t when I thought I did - now i&#x27;m stuck with it. This is HORRIBLE and does not work. It&#x27;s a waste of money folks. I should&#x27;ve listened to the reviews on this one but i typically like to try things for myself. I especially wanted to try this since the manual spring works so well. I will most likely opt for a facial epilator with the tweezers in it.</li>
    <li> When the original Epilady for the legs came out, my Mom and I both used it.  Now, neither one of us has hair on our legs; the Epilady caused the hair to stop growing.  I love never having to shave anymore!  So when I saw that they now have one for the face, I decided to try it.  And it&#x27;s just as good as the other one.  Hopefully, this will, eventually, keep the hair from growing there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find that this product hurts.  I can feel the hair being removed, but it&#x27;s not a painful thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read through some of the other reviews, and I may have some helpful hints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Pull the skin tight in the area that you&#x27;re going over.  You need to get the hair into the coil as well as keep the skin away.  Doing this will prevent you from having the skin pulled up into it (which doesn&#x27;t hurt but does feel odd).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Slowly but continuously.  You need to keep the unit going over the area in a continuous motion.  However, don&#x27;t rush it.  You need to allow enough time for the hairs to get caught - it&#x27;s not doing that if you&#x27;re moving it too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It works best if you use it daily for the first week or two.  Doesn&#x27;t have to be a long time each session, but doing it every day will allow the shorter hairs to grow just enough to get caught - without allowing them to be so long that they&#x27;re unsightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) If you&#x27;re finding that it&#x27;s not removing the hair properly, you may not be allowing the coil to get to the hair.  Be sure that you&#x27;re holding it such that it&#x27;s flat against the skin (put your forefinger on it like you&#x27;re pointing at something and then rest the unit on your face such that your finger is parallel to your face).  If you&#x27;re not holding it so that the hair is allowed to get in there, it&#x27;s not going to work.  Remember that what it&#x27;s doing is providing an \\&quot;automatic tweezer\\&quot; type of removal - hair has to be in there to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Be sure that you&#x27;re going in all directions.  This is why going in a circular motion is helpful.  Hair grows at different angles on your face.  Therefore, you need to catch it in the way that it comes out easily.  This may be why some reviewers are finding that it&#x27;s not removing a particular type of hair.  If you&#x27;re not finding that it&#x27;s getting the hair in one area of your face, it could be that you&#x27;re trying to remove it in the wrong direction.  Try going in the other direction on the hair, and it&#x27;ll catch.  This tip also helps with any discomfort you may have with the product.  If you&#x27;re trying to remove hair against the grain, you&#x27;re going to feel it more than if you&#x27;re pulling it out in the direction that it grows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product.  If it&#x27;s used correctly, it does work.  And, if it proves to be as great as the original Epilady, I won&#x27;t have to use it forever.

    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. My friends urged me to purchase one on amazon to see what I thought. They purchased more expensive ones from sally&#x27;s and used it on their upper lip and side burns. This is just a cheap poorly made tool. I do not recommend this. I tried using in my sideburns and I would rather wax my face. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in August 2014. I used it about twice a week and initially it worked well. But in December, it just stopped working. I checked all the battery contacts etc. but all that seemed ok. So I don&#x27;t know the reason. For a product that cost $30+ I&#x27;d expect it to work a bit longer than 5 months. Looking at the product page on Amazon, it&#x27;s not obvious how to contact the manufacturer to ask for a replacement or refund. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst product invented.  Thought I would try it since it claims to be &amp;#34;delicate facial epilator&amp;#34;, it went back the same day.&lt;br /&gt;It was painful.  Waxing is far delicate!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped...</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with it. I don&#x27;t feel it is effective at all. sorry I made the purchase</li>
    <li> I had to give this one star in order to write the review. I would not have given it any stars. It is absolutely useless. I was hopeful, but it really does nothing. Total waste of money. You can tell the very first moment you use it that it is useless. I have been too busy to return it and now it is too late with short return policy. I will try to contact seller, as it is not his or her fault that the product is no good. They didn&#x27;t create it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product- save your money.</li>
    <li> Was very dissatisfied with this product. I&#x27;m not a big baby or anything and I can stand some pain however, this was very painful on facial hair. After just a few uses it quit on me. Too bad I already threw away the box and paperwork. That sucks!</li>
    <li> Works well on my stubborn course hairs.  A lot easier than plucking.</li>
    <li> I use this on/in my ears. I love it.</li>
    <li> did not work at all and made my face rash up</li>
    <li> this item is light in eight and easy to hold however it does not snag the hairs on the underside of your chin or upper lip area.&lt;br /&gt;It only works well on the hairs covering the cheek area of your face.</li>
    <li> Really worked on my blonde peach fuzz on my cheeks. Very pinch/plucking pain sensations with usage. Using twice a month....</li>
    <li> A good item for fine hair, but did not remove coarse hair.  I had to resort to twizzers.  I would not recommend it for the price charged.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2-3 years ago for the first time. It took a lotta time to get used to....i think because the picture on the product box is misleading. To get best results hold it upside down not the way it shows in the picture. Few months ago i purchased another one for my daughter and taught her how to use it. She loves it now!!</li>
    <li> Does not perform as promised</li>
    <li> Used the Epilady on my legs for years and now I have very little hair there.  I am completely pleased with the Epilady Esthetic Hopefully the same will happen on my face!</li>
    <li> You can only use it on the flat plane of your cheeks. If you try to use it on you chin or jawline it catches your skin; and I do not have sensitive skin! Also, it came from Israel so sending it back was expensive. They did not refund my my money because I did not have the box it came in. Not a good  experience.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product and thought it looked like a nice easy way to remove hair on my cheeks, chin and jawline. It didn&#x27;t remove any hair. Had to return it.</li>
    <li> I had an Epliady before for my legs and loved it also.  It twinges the first time you use it; but with continued use it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore.  You need to follow directions; it will not work properly if it&#x27;s not held at the correct angle and sometimes you need to adjust the angle.  It&#x27;s so much easier than creams, etc.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with this epilator.  I have used one on my legs for years.  This facial one tends&lt;br /&gt;to cut the hairs more than it pulls it out from the roots.  This is a problem, as I do not want more facial hairs,&lt;br /&gt;I want less.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mother who is 77 yrs old and has a lot of tremors. It is safer to use on her face than a regular razor, but if she doesn&#x27;t get her skin pulled taught enough it will pinch her. All in all, I think it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I felt this epilady did not do what it claimed for chin hair. It only removed very fine hairs, not the stuborn ones I needed removed easily. I feel I am right back with my chin issue which has increased during my menopause. Neoplasm is tough enough without dealing with increased facial hair! LOL!  I was very disappointed with over-all purchase, for me it just did not all my issues</li>
    <li> Does not work.... Very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use it several times, using all technics suggested in the revisions but I ended up storing it in a drawer. It&#x27;s very weak and it doesn&#x27;t remove any hair, despite its size or color.</li>
    <li> It did work very&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk. Maybe I didn&#x27;t understand what exactly I was buying, but it was loud, painful and not effective at removing unwanted hairs. Not really sure how this keeps being made or who this is for.</li>
    <li> Just got this yesterday and used it last night and it exceeded my expectations.  I now don&#x27;t have to make an appointment to get a facial wax. So nice to have the flexibility to do this at my own home.  I still had to pull a few hairs with tweezers, but only a few.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and  had no redness afterwards. Yes, it hurt, but not agony.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with the way it works for the most part.  it removes a lot of the hairs, but not all.</li>
    <li> I was struggling with fine hair on my face with little time to go and have it removed regularly.  I purchase this product and it did the trick!!</li>
    <li> I recently bought the &amp;#34;Epilady Esthetic - Delicate Facial Epilator&amp;#34; ... and it hasn&#x27;t worked.  I have been very happy with the other Epilady products I have, but this one is worthless - it hasn&#x27;t removed any hair, and I tried it on different areas - thinking that maybe the hairs were too thin, but no - it just doesn&#x27;t work.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  I&#x27;ve only used it once.</li>
    <li> I find my skin too delicate to use it regularly as  the information (from several ads) indicated it would be gentle.  I was disappointed.  Caro</li>
    <li> Great for face and quick touch ups on sparsely haired areas.............be careful with it. If you drop it, consider it gone for good</li>
    <li> The first couple of tries I thought thid wad not going to be what I wanted. Then I figured out the right way to hold it.....works great.</li>
    <li> If you planning to buy this product you will waist your money, it doesn’t pluck any facial hair at all!</li>
    <li> Very disapointed power not very great like electric wish I wud have returned it .Not wat I thought it would do performance wise :(</li>
    <li> This product sort of works but it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair. Youll have to go over an area quite a few times on your face and be careful because it heats up fast and can burn your skin like it did to me. Not my top pick for epilators thats for sure.</li>
    <li> sorry but this product was defective and wouldn&#x27;t turn on, so no way could tell if it would actually do what it says it would</li>
    <li> Not what I had hoped.  I doesn&#x27;t get the stubborn hairs that have been plucked for years.  The epilator is a great dissapointment.</li>
    <li> Is not very powerful, does not pull out thicker facial hair, still have to use tweezers for &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; hair which is most of them, coil gets very hot &amp; batteries weaken quickly.</li>
    <li> Delivery on this product was extremely fast, for which,I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I am much less impressed with the actual product. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be a painless endeavor,but this product seems particularly uncomfortable. It heats up and at the same time tweezes the hair from the skin. It is ok for very fine hair but anything remotely stronger and it tugs without removing. The heat seems to help the hair \\&quot;stand up\\&quot; more, supposedly making it easier to tweeze. That doesn&#x27;t seem to happen. You end up having to tweeze by hand. Ouch! The heat feels a little uncomfortable as you have to keep going over the same area to,hopefully,remove the hair. I don&#x27;t know if this is because I have somewhat sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product particularly to people with sensitive skin .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an Epilady on my legs for more than 30 years, and been very happy with it.  But this one for the face didn&#x27;t do the job, in fact nicked me twice.  Didn&#x27;t grab the hairs at all well.  Back to tweezers for me ...</li>
    <li> Did not work at all on my facial hair.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I like the facial Epilady. It&#x27;s easy to use. It is difficult to get all the hair but has noticeably reduced the amount of them.</li>
    <li> I am not as satisfied with this product as I would lke to be.  I had an Episilk that was much more effective.  This product doesn&#x27;t remove course hair very easily.</li>
    <li> I’m very familiar with another Epilady product, so when I saw the Delicate Facial Epilator, I had to order it.  It really does remove hair on the face. Just follow the directions and be patient; take your time rotating it over the areas of your face. I really like it...it does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright but not strong enough to do a really good job, I will still have to get waxing done because it can&#x27;t get close to your lips or nose.</li>
    <li> Small, a bit of a change for me because I&#x27;ve always used the full size epilady, but it can be used anywhere @ anytime, takes no room to store practically, and it feels like I am going to get used to the battery power!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s effective, easy to use, and small enough to take camping. It kind of hurts at first but stretching the skin tight helps and very quickly one gets used to it.</li>
    <li> worthless! It has no power to pull your hair out! it keeps grabbing hair but yet it has no power to pull it out.</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It works well.  It takes a little time to get the angle correct to get it to eliminate all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used the Epilady for my legs for over 25 years, and barely have any hair remaining on them.  The Epilady I puchased for my facial upper lip hair is wonderful.  If one uses this product correctly, it WORKS.  You must have the coil placed directly on the skin, not just the tip of the product.  One must move the product in circles, do not stay in the same spot.  Make sure your skin is clean, without makeup, facial cream, etc. before using this product.  To all those who have read bad reports from the nay sayers, this product works if used properly.  Highly recommended from a all most life time user.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, but her expectations were not very high.  Doesn&#x27;t work on the fine hairs.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time reading other reviews before my purchase. Over the years I have been tweezed, waxed, and threaded. I even went for five laser hair removal treatments that were expensive and for those moments even painful, despite the numbing cream. For several years I have used the larger Braun product on my legs and underarms, but knew it would be too much for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does work. I will say that it is important to change the position, maintain contact with the skin, and have patience and persistence. I use a 10x magnifying mirror to see the hair and areas I want to focus on. You can both see and feel the hair removal- I bought but did not use the Greencaine. After a few uses I empty the receptacle and the evidence is there!</li>
    <li> I have had my Epilady for about a month, great product, it does sting a little, but it pulls the hair out, better than a No-No!</li>
    <li> This thing does not pull even the thickest coarsest hairs.  I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I like it but it isn&#x27;t as good as I would want.</li>
    <li> This product barely works and is extremely painful.  Would not suggest anyone purchase it until it&#x27;s been tweeked a bit.</li>
    <li> I had read a lot of negative reviews right after I ordered this product, so I had my doubts as to how it would work.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it and it was very successful in removing a lot of the &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; on my face that I hated for so long!  It does not remove it all like a razor, and must be used every few days at first, but it also does not hurt as others had said.  You will still have to use regular tweezers for the heavier stuff, but I&#x27;m hoping in time that this will be better.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible! I was not happy with it at all. It hurts and doesn&#x27;t even remove all hairs!</li>
    <li> The Epilady does the job it is supposed to do. I was just not quite expecting it to be as painful as it was the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Like product and was recommended by a friend.  Used a long time ago, but this is better.  Truly met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all, very unSatisfied!</li>
    <li> The product is painful to use and left my skin very red and sore.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything but hurt.  I don&#x27;t think it managed to actually remove a single stray hair.  it hurt like hell when it grabbed them but then let them go before they were removed.  Tried it with varying lengths of hair.</li>
    <li> I did not feel that it worked as it said it would. And certainly not worth $40.00 I own a manaul which works much better. The problem is always the chin line and I was hoping this would have done the trick. It did not.</li>
    <li> It is a battery operated piece of junk. It BREAKS off hairs and does not epilate facial hair causing skin irritations and terrible acne. I have never been one to have problems with acne and I am very particular about hygiene. No amount of lotions or alcohol cleansing helped before or after. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> i want to return this item! it removed less than 1% of the finest hairs and got hot right away. sorry I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> I was tired of the sugar facials.  After six months I saw no decrease in facial hair.  I like having the convenience of at home hair remmoval.</li>
    <li> I love the Epilady coiled products because they all work great! I tried their other ones &amp; they did not do a good job at all. I would have given this 5 stars as it was a little rough on my skin &amp; it heats up pretty quickly so you have to keep emptying &amp; brushing out the hair.  My skin was fine though after a couple of hours so I would suggest using it on days you are not going anywhere.</li>
    <li> I had another one similar to this one but it wore out. This one is ALMOST as good and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it, yet</li>
</ol>
