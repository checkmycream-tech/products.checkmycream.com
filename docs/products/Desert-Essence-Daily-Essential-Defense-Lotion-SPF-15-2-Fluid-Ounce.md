      <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, which reminds me of Fruit Loops.</li>
      <li>Love the feel and the sent.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m one who easily burns.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a strong, tropical scent.</li>
      <li>Seems to work fine.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the scent.</li>
      <li>It smoothed out well, and my foundation went on ok, but I don&#x27;t think this is a good daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast, which is really nice.  </li>
      <li>Can get a little oily at the end of the day but better than most products at this price point.</li>

      <li>Overall, its just an okay product.</li>

      <li>I had trouble using this in my first trimester of pregnancy because it was so strong.</li>
      <li>It has been difficult for me to find a moisturizer with a barrier SPF, so I was happy to find this option.</li>

      <li>I live in Nevada and needless to say it is very dry and very sunny and so far my skin looks clear, but most importantly hydrated and protected.</li>
      <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, and it provides SPF without a concoction of chemicals.</li>
      <li>Feels a little heavy going on but that is very light feeling once it absorbs.</li>

    <li> Good as a winter moisturizer with SPF protection. Absorbs pretty well and is only lightly scented.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen every day. It leaves my skin feeling soft, and it provides SPF without a concoction of chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen that would not clog my pores for so long that it&#x27;s hard to believe I finally found it. This has a really wonderful texture, it goes on smoothly and can even be used under make-up. Its got a fab orange scent too, but never fear, it doesn&#x27;t linger and does not conflict with your perfume.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this lotion. I use it daily and the bottle lasts quite a while with daily use. I like the scent and texture. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine.  Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t make you look white.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, has SPF and less chemicals than other moisturizers. It&#x27;s a repeat purchase for me!</li>
    <li> I use it daily in the morning. I enjoy the scent. It blends into my skin nicely with no residue. I&#x27;ve used it and then gone outside in the sun afterward, and haven&#x27;t gotten sunburnt yet. And I&#x27;m one who easily burns.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s priced better on here than what I&#x27;ve seen it sold for in local stores in my area.</li>
    <li> It has been difficult for me to find a moisturizer with a barrier SPF, so I was happy to find this option. This blends well and doesn&#x27;t leave any of the white tint that barrier sunscreens sometimes leave. This product worked best for me in fall-winter-spring. It&#x27;s a little heavy for summer, so I&#x27;ve switched to Yes to Carrots in the heat and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside - minus one star for smell. They do emphasize that their fragrance is a healthy blend of natural and artificial fragrances, but I do not like the smell. I had trouble using this in my first trimester of pregnancy because it was so strong. Now that my pregnant nose has calmed down, it&#x27;s not offensive but still not ideal. It&#x27;s a strong, tropical scent. I would prefer this unscented.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, but for some reason, this product makes it less oily. Love the feel and the sent.</li>
    <li> Very impressed and happy with how easy it blends and is absorbed into my skin. Good sun protection as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years and I love the way it makes my skin feel. Goes on very smooth, never greasy. No harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion. I get very dry winter skin on my face and this helps it look so hydrated! I love the smell, which reminds me of Fruit Loops. Only complaint is that they don&#x27;t have a bigger size!</li>
    <li> I did some extensive research trying to find a vegan sunscreen for daily use. I used to use Alba Botanica&#x27;s SPF 15 sunscreen and was very happy with it, but I was just not 100% sure that is was 100% vegan. This is why I decided to go with this sunscreen instead, and I can honestly say I am not at all disappointed with my purchase. The lotion is not only completely vegan but it is also free from several harmful ingredients. I live in Nevada and needless to say it is very dry and very sunny and so far my skin looks clear, but most importantly hydrated and protected.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast, which is really nice.  However, it failed to impress me much.  I have combination skin and thought this didn&#x27;t moisturize that well.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad at first, but starts to have a strange scent as the day goes on.  Overall, its just an okay product.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that works for me and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out!</li>
    <li> This product has a very odd texture -- it is sort of putty-ish. It smoothed out well, and my foundation went on ok, but I don&#x27;t think this is a good daily moisturizer. It seems like it would be better if you knew you were going to be outside for an extended period of time.</li>
    <li> Good product. Not tested on animals which I appreciate. Has very little smell going on and no lingering smell. Feels a little heavy going on but that is very light feeling once it absorbs. Lasts all day. Can get a little oily at the end of the day but better than most products at this price point. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a non-chemical sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t turn my face white, and this is it!!  Note that it is only SPF 15, but that is usually sufficient for daily use.  Works well under makeup too.  This scores well (2) on the EWG sunscreen guide.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!  Great coverage, no greasy feel, lasts forever, great price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently gone on a no paraben/SLS in products kick...and so replaced my Aveeno spf 15 with the desert essence one. Maybe I&#x27;m just used to that other one, but I found this product to be quite oily. My skin is combination with the tendency to breakout....and this certainly didn&#x27;t help the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve kept it around to use in the wintertime, as it might be just what my skin needs when it&#x27;s cold/dry outside.</li>
