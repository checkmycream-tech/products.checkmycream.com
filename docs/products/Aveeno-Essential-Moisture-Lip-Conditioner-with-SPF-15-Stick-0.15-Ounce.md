      <li>Great product and would HIGHLY recommend to others.</li>

      <li>but if it makes her happy so be it the only thing i have a problem with</li>
      <li>Good texture, keeps lips soft and smooth longer.</li>
      <li>I go out of my way to find this balm and it is well worth the time!  </li>
      <li>This is a simple easy to carry stick form, has a great consistency that is easy to put on and not to \\&quot;viscous\\&quot; and really works.</li>
      <li>My son is on a special acne medicine that drys out your lips and skin.  </li>
      <li>Aveeno Essential Moisture Lip Conditioiner feels good for about the 10 seconds</li>
      <li>I love this particular Chapstick.</li>
      <li>and it was worth it.</li>
      <li>if that is true, it is a real loss!</li>
      <li>I love Aveeno products, and this is by far the bext lip balm on the market.</li>
      <li>But diligent application of this stuff frequently clears them up in a day or two, so I&#x27;d say that \\&quot;Lip Conditioner\\&quot; is a fairly accurate description of this product, I could not be happier.</li>
      <li>I tried a lot of different lip conditioners but most did not work well.</li>
      <li>no more lipstick love this better.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>Our family actually use many of the Aveeno products....</li>
      <li>Most lip products contain some form of fiberglass in them, which actually continues to make your lips chap</li>
      <li>It works quickly and leaves lips soft.</li>
      <li>so many lip things are too gunky, to dry</li>
      <li>If they lower the price, I will certainly continue to buy it - probably in bulk.</li>
      <li>thanks .</li>
      <li>Very good&lt;br /&gt;Wipe</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I like it better than any other lip conditioner I have used.</li>
      <li>highly recommend, will not want to use another product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>I first found this product at my local Walmart in a clearance bin and decided to try it.</li>
      <li>Definitely keeps my lips smooth during the dry winter months.  </li>
      <li>Makes my lips smooth and soft with out the mess.</li>
      <li>This lip balm is really nice, unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to find and kind of expensive.</li>
      <li>It is soft not waxy and moisturizes well without being sticky or gooey.</li>
      <li>Well this is the only product he wants to use out of the tons of lip products I have purchased for him to try out.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the reviews that say it does.</li>
      <li>Keeps lips soft.</li>
      <li>It gave fantastic, long-lasting moisture, without feeling heavy or being too shiny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It may be pricier than other lip balms, but it&#x27;s worth it for me</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the price, even though it was a little high, mainly because I like it so much</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This can be a little hard to find so I was glad to find it on Amazon. It had no scent or flavor, which I like. And it does its job...very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!  Having a heck of a time finding it in the stores now and wonderful Amazon had it!  Yahoo!  My son is on a special acne medicine that drys out your lips and skin.  Well this is the only product he wants to use out of the tons of lip products I have purchased for him to try out.  Our family actually use many of the Aveeno products....Love them and Love this lip conditioner...</li>
    <li> Great Lip balm one of the best &amp; has sunscreen in it too ~ love it, one of my favorite, no more lipstick love this better.</li>
    <li> This is the only chapstick I use. No others work for me. It has a slight glossyness to it though, so men be warned. No stores in my area carry this product any more so I&#x27;m glad to be able to order on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Cant find it in stores anymore but it works great, great smelling, and doesn&#x27;t make you nauseous if you accidentally taste it.</li>
    <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;Wipe your lips very wet then recognize this brand&lt;br /&gt;Use it to wipe your lips dry weather is very wet</li>
    <li> I hear it will no longer be made...if that is true, it is a real loss! Please ask aveeno to bring it back</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so picky.  I don&#x27;t want any waxy, or that smells bad.  This is the BEST Lip Moisture stick I have found.  It&#x27;s so disappointing not to find it easily anymore.  My lips feel moist after use, it definitely keeps the chapped lips away. It has a very smooth neutral smell &amp; goes on very nice.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST conditioner for my lips.  So of course, it has been discontinued by Aveeno.  Why?  I haven&#x27;t got a clue.</li>
    <li> i got this for my girlfriend who loves this and since you cant find it in the stores anymore i figured id spend the money about $17.00 which is expensive for 2 tubes of chapstick to me but if it makes her happy so be it the only thing i have a problem with and i don&#x27;t even know if this matters because its only chapstick is they were past their expiration date she doesn&#x27;t care because like i said you cant get them anymore i just thing you should inform the buyer or show it in the pictures all that being said when she runs out im sure i&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
    <li> This is amazing. very moisturizing lip balm, and very hard to find.  I Looked for it for years after buying it at a local pharmacy, but never saw it again.  I am thankful to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I just love the smooth feel going on and the way it lasts.  Hard to go back to regular lip balms after using this product!</li>
    <li> Great vanilla like smell and excellent hydration. Definitely keeps my lips smooth during the dry winter months.  Sadly its been discontinued. :(</li>
    <li> Anyone who has dried or chapped lips will appreciate this item. It doesn&#x27;t actually cure the problems but it comforts your lips when you apply it. I like it better than any other lip conditioner I have used. I&#x27;m not a specialist but it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Works great..I put it on as soon as I received it..my lips feel softer and smoother already! Love it..thanks .</li>
    <li> I get cracks in my lips now and then... and they used to linger for weeks with regular use of lip balm... But diligent application of this stuff frequently clears them up in a day or two, so I&#x27;d say that \\&quot;Lip Conditioner\\&quot; is a fairly accurate description of this product, I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> so many lip things are too gunky, to dry, have a taste, look feminine, feel weird, rub off fast, don&#x27;t work, sting, or whatever -- tons of flaws out there. This is a simple easy to carry stick form, has a great consistency that is easy to put on and not to \\&quot;viscous\\&quot; and really works. I have been using this for years and it is definitely the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> (I purchased this at a local drug store--not on amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of my favorite chapsticks for MONTHS. It gave fantastic, long-lasting moisture, without feeling heavy or being too shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback for me  was that at the end of the second month of use the scent changed. It wasn&#x27;t a horrible change but enough for me to notice. I found that very strange since I&#x27;ve never had that experience with a chapstick before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tossed it but I would actually buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love Aveeno products, and this is by far the bext lip balm on the market. It works quickly and leaves lips soft. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I find I have to reapply other lip balms constantly. i use this lip balm in the morning and before bed, and my lips are never chapped. It may be pricier than other lip balms, but it&#x27;s worth it for me</li>
    <li> Most lip products contain some form of fiberglass in them, which actually continues to make your lips chap so you&#x27;ll use more of the product. This stuff does not! Great product and would HIGHLY recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite chapstick.  I cannot go anywhere without it.  However, now I cannot find it in any stores.  And it is like 3x the price online.  So I am forced to continue hunting for alternatives.  If they lower the price, I will certainly continue to buy it - probably in bulk.</li>
    <li> I was SO disappointed when stores stopped stocking my favorite lip balm. So, of course I looked on Amazon! I didn&#x27;t mind the price, even though it was a little high, mainly because I like it so much and it was worth it. It&#x27;s soothing and has very little taste. I hope Aveeno continues to make it!!</li>
    <li> I first found this product at my local Walmart in a clearance bin and decided to try it. I loved the smooth feeling when its applied. I put it on before I sleep and when I wake up my lips are still soft. I ran out for a while and  have not found it for years, I was so happy to find it on here. I am fair skinned and after I talked to my dermatologist about the sun spots on my lips this was his first recommendation. I would recommend this to anyone. I sometimes have bad reactions to lipstick/stains/gloss/balms/butters but I have not had a problem with this.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a one-stop shop on a lip moisturizer that you can use under you lipstick and/or for everyday wear as a balm buy this. don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive lip primers because this conditions, moistens, primes, etc. Aveeno products are made to improve the skin anyway so of course, this has minerals that aid in smoothing out your lips with SPF. great product. great price.</li>
    <li> Keep lips from becomming chapped. Keeps lips soft.Glides on easy. I would reccommend this product. Aveeno over all makes good products.</li>
    <li> I love this particular Chapstick. I tried many others but this is the best! Good texture, keeps lips soft and smooth longer. highly recommend, will not want to use another product.</li>
    <li> As all Aveeno products are this lip conditioner is no exception.  I keep one in my car and my purse as well as at home. It is soft not waxy and moisturizes well without being sticky or gooey. My grandsons keep them in their coat pockets and use them often. There is no after taste and you can feel the softening effects immediately.</li>
    <li> light feel, not sticky.</li>
    <li> Great product. Best lip balm I have found. Really glad I could purchase it on Amazon.  Very hard to find since they no longer make it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t condition my lips, kind of just sat on the top of my lips. Very little deep moisture. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Aveeno lip conditioner is one of my favorite brand.  It helps soothing my dry lips from winding or biting lips.  It is one brand I can rely on.  Many stores don&#x27;t sell them.  Online ordering is the only option I have.  Pray that it will continue be sold on Amazon online.</li>
    <li> I had used this a couple of years ago and I was really impressed with the results.  Tried getting these in stores and I could never find it.  So I ordered online and it is great for winter time! As always, I trust Aveeno since the time my kids&#x27; pediatrician recommended Aveeno products!</li>
    <li> have had tons of issues with other products that weren&#x27;t just a balm with extra ingredients or additives, and lips feeling worse after a little time using the product - almost as if your lips got addicted and needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have used this product for at least 5 years now and the whole house is converted.  instead of just coating, seems to moisturize and even in the winter one time in the morning on the way to work ,maybe one time at night and life is good.  no could taste like some of the bees wax products either.  purchased online to get a bunch while I was thinking of it and price seemed just as good for this two as in the store and with amazon prime no shipping costs!</li>
    <li> This lip balm is really nice, unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to find and kind of expensive. I need to see if it comes in a case, since it seems to always go missing! ;)</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both love this stuff. Can&#x27;t find it in stores so always have to order it from Amazon.  Goes on smooth, not goopy or waxy, taste if very mild so it does not interfere with your drinking or eating.  Makes my lips smooth and soft with out the mess. I go out of my way to find this balm and it is well worth the time!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of different lip conditioners but most did not work well. Burts bees kind of worked but i couldn&#x27;t stand theirs scent/flavors (it might be just me but i cant stand the strong scents). I like the fact that thise aveeno product comes without any tates/scents and does its job like a champ. I have this on subscribe and save and never have to try any other conditioner.</li>
    <li> i will continue to get this, as we totally enjoy it, and use it all the time. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I am usually a huge Aveeno fan, but I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product. Aveeno Essential Moisture Lip Conditioiner feels good for about the 10 seconds it lasts on your lips. That&#x27;s the problem is that you constantly have to reapply every few seconds. If you lick your lips, talk, eat breath, it disappears. It doesn&#x27;t last at all. I&#x27;m surprised at the reviews that say it does. Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the product but for me this product was a waste of money and I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> The best of all lip balms---but unfortunately not made anymore.  I have looked everywhere.  Why do companies make a great product, get customers hooked on them, and then quit making them?  Frustrating!</li>
