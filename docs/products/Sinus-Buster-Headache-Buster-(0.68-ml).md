      <li>It did, however, provide a pleasant burst of tingliness that got my sinuses draining.</li>
      <li>Very effective when taking at the onset of the cluster but also effective if cluster is in progress.  </li>

      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>and it is nice to have a product that helps.</li>
      <li>this is very important.</li>
      <li>$8.99 or $9.99 seems more in line with the others sprays by this manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>This seems to work better.    </li>
      <li>It works better than anything that I ever tried before</li>
      <li>Althouth this may work for many people, It did not work for me.</li>
      <li>Glad to hear it works for others, but no luck for me.  </li>
      <li>Please correct, because I would love to start buying this spray.</li>
      <li>It does burn when you take it, but it is much better than having a migraine for two days.</li>
      <li>I have warded off many migraines using this method, about 50-70% off the time, if I can take a nap</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t yet been able to test it on an incipient headache</li>
      <li>It many times will stop a migraine before I need to use a stronger medicine like Sumatriptan.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>but I enjoyed my dinner thoroughly about 45 minutes after using the product.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I could stand it</li>
      <li>The product seems okay</li>
      <li>This stuff remedies most of my families headaches.</li>
      <li>All natural, and good for you!</li>
      <li>These additions make the stuff burn more than the original formula, but the sensation is short-lived and you will probably get used to it as you use the product.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, that&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit strong.</li>
      <li>That is fine.  </li>
      <li>This stuff does significantly reduces my headache pain.</li>
      <li>I have suffered from headaches and sinus problems for so many years and Sinus Buster is the first thing that ever worked for me.</li>
      <li>I found it more effective than the original Sinus Buster formula; Headache Buster is different in that it also contains feverfew and peppermint.  </li>
      <li>I sent Sinus Buster to my sister, whose headaches are more frequent and more severe than mine.  </li>
      <li>it jumps to about 90% the time I will not get a full blown migraine.</li>
      <li>tried Headache Buster once, with a full blown migraine, and it didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
      <li>As some other reviewers have experienced, if the headache is full blown, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it permanently...</li>
      <li>The company upon contact quickly replaced the 2 bottles that were not up to \\&quot;snuff\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I try to take at the very first sign of a migraine attack.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s powerful and can bring a full grown Marine to his knees if you&#x27;re not prepared.</li>
      <li>It is the first time in my life that I have been able to find something to give me some real migraine relief without taking pain medicine.</li>
      <li>This time the result was AMAZING and almost instant!  </li>
      <li>Since then, I have tried many, many different preventative medications, herbs and supplements, but nothing has really worked.  </li>
      <li>Why would they discontinue a product that clearly is working miracles for so many???  </li>
      <li>She was able to make it through the rest of the night at my house with a screaming, teething 1 year old without holding her head in agony.</li>
      <li>(hey, if you suffer chronic headaches, you know that ANY relief is welcome), but after a second use maybe an hour later, the headache was gone.  </li>
      <li>Of course, the box does show a picture of what looks to be a hot pepper.  </li>
      <li>She proclaimed \\&quot;you shouldn&#x27;t squirt hot pepper spray up your nose\\&quot; as she chuckled</li>
      <li>Migraines are caused by many different reasons, so it may work for others.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>and although she did not wait to be taped using the product I have first hand account of her experience.  </li>
      <li>or I catch it with the Headache Buster at the first sign of symptoms  --</li>
      <li>I was thinking hot pepper spray in my nose when I am having a migraine.</li>
      <li>It sounded like exactly what I needed, (and I have tried it all.)  </li>
      <li>Overall I am satisfied with Headache Buster, but my results have been inconsistent.  </li>
      <li>As far as I know, there are no bad side effects from using this product.  </li>
      <li>This product is highly effective in eliminating or toning down the severity of the headache.  </li>
      <li>I first tried their classic formula months ago and it really helped, but once I tried this headache formula with feverfew, my migraines were gone forever.</li>
      <li>but of burning depending on how much you sniff and expect runny nose and sneezing after.</li>
      <li>Fast relief from headaches.</li>
      <li>This really works - but it&#x27;s not for the timid.  </li>
      <li>A rather unusual story on how the capsician spelling) used for pepper spray helps headaches.</li>
      <li>IF TAKEN AT THE VERY OUTSET of a headache (i.e., the pre-pain phase).  </li>
      <li>It really, really, really takes away my head pain.</li>
      <li>It really does blast our your sinus headache quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>But everyone is different and if you are a migraine sufferer and there is a non-prescription option available, by all means see if it works for you.</li>
      <li>as the directions suggest -- the product works very well.  </li>
      <li>Five minutes into the whole ordeal, after the laughing from all parties had ceased, she looked over to me and said \\&quot;Hey, my headache is gone\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>(No problem with Sinus Buster because it&#x27;s non-addictive and you can&#x27;t really overdose.)  </li>
      <li>If I take 2 or 3 snorts up each nostril when a headache is just starting, it knocks it right out!</li>
      <li>You simply have to try the product if it interests you and take full advantage of the manufacturer&#x27;s guarantee if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.    </li>
      <li>This product has validity as a natural spray that really opens up the sinuses.  </li>
      <li>As long as the headache is mild</li>
      <li>I have suffered from cluster headaches - the most painful kind of headache - for 25 years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a natural cure for migranes!  </li>
      <li>She even spritzed the second nostril, ran to bathroom with what she at first thought to be a bleeding nose, but turned out to be a runny nose.</li>
      <li>These headaches can last for days and can be very debilitating.  </li>
      <li>So far I like it, relieves my sinus pressure.</li>
      <li>Though it hurts the sinus passages for about 5~10 seconds, this product really cuts through the migraine headache and relieves it instantly.</li>
      <li>Admittedly, there were days when I had to use it frequently to ward off the onset.  </li>
      <li>This product along with Migrelief completely stopped my migraines.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had migraines since I was a young child and have taken just about every migraine medicine over the counter and prescription</li>
      <li>We always laugh at each other watching the wincing and jumping around after the family or friends give it a try.</li>
      <li>If you are squeamish you might try a little bit in your nose before giving it a full squirt.</li>
      <li>The next morning I had a worse headache, and the relief wasn&#x27;t quite as good, just lesser intensity</li>
      <li>this product works pretty well for the sinus head aches that I have had but not for other types of headaches though.  </li>
      <li>Once you get past the initial \\&quot;burn\\&quot; you are fine.  </li>
      <li>The only bad side effect i&#x27;ve had is smelling blood shortly after use, and becoming congested after i used it, hopefully it fairs better for others that buy it than it did for me</li>
      <li>This is the only natural product that has helped.&lt;br /&gt;These headaches are almost unbearable without this product.</li>
      <li>If I spent this much on this spray, I would expect not to have headaches for a month.</li>
      <li>/&gt;OK, so thinking this product is so wonderful, I should order one to take in my purse, I came back to Amazon to order another one, and to my extreme disappointment, there seem to be only 2 left, and the price jumped from $14 to $68!!!!!  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s going to be my new routine for a while, as long as it works.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> $89.99 for .68 ounces of this spray? Is this a mistake? How could this price be correct? $8.99 or $9.99 seems more in line with the others sprays by this manufacturer.  If I spent this much on this spray, I would expect not to have headaches for a month. Please correct, because I would love to start buying this spray. I have used the sinus and allergy spray from this company and they work GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> Have had cluster headaches for years.  This is the only natural product that has helped.&lt;br /&gt;These headaches are almost unbearable without this product. Thanks!  Great pricing too!</li>
    <li> Saw this product and thought I would purchase.   It is a bit strong.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from CHA, this is a big help in cutting down the event duration. It&#x27;s a godsend.</li>
    <li> This product (now called Headache Buster) works and the company service department is great. I received a bottle that had a dilute solution that was shipped without correction. The company upon contact quickly replaced the 2 bottles that were not up to \\&quot;snuff\\&quot;. Though it hurts the sinus passages for about 5~10 seconds, this product really cuts through the migraine headache and relieves it instantly. Nothing else has worked for me.</li>
    <li> Dr. Oz recommended this for migraine so I tried it. Well, once the fire went out in my nasal cavity, the headache was gone.  It does work. Once you get past the initial \\&quot;burn\\&quot; you are fine.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> As some other reviewers have experienced, if the headache is full blown, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it permanently...but does bring temporary relief. As this is not a drug, I don&#x27;t mind follow-up applications.  I get both migraines and cluster headaches, and while I have prescription medication for the migraines which will usually work, at least after a couple doses, NOTHING has previously brought even marginal relief from the cluster headaches.  This actually helped ease it to a tolerable level for 20 minutes or so at a time.  That may not sound like much, but to me, it is a godsend.  I haven&#x27;t yet been able to test it on an incipient headache (I tend to wake up with them already at the fiercely painful stage).</li>
    <li> As others have pointed out, it&#x27;s hard to review a health product that is going to offer differing degress of success and satisfaction depending on the person.  You simply have to try the product if it interests you and take full advantage of the manufacturer&#x27;s guarantee if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.    My migraines are relatively infrequent enough to where I don&#x27;t need prescription treatment, but I do have frequent sinus headaches.  As long as the headache is mild or I catch it with the Headache Buster at the first sign of symptoms  -- as the directions suggest -- the product works very well.  At least, it works well enough to where I can function through my day.    I found it more effective than the original Sinus Buster formula; Headache Buster is different in that it also contains feverfew and peppermint.  These additions make the stuff burn more than the original formula, but the sensation is short-lived and you will probably get used to it as you use the product.  If you have a sinus blockage, I find that the product will help loosen whatever crud you have up there and make it easier to get rid of it.    Overall I am satisfied with Headache Buster, but my results have been inconsistent.  Still, I am glad to have an alternative when taking pills for a headache seems almost like killing a fly with a rocket launcher.</li>
    <li> this product works pretty well for the sinus head aches that I have had but not for other types of headaches though.  That is fine.  Sinus headaches are the worst and it is nice to have a product that helps.</li>
    <li> As the \\&quot;Item being reviewed\\&quot; states, I ordered Sinus Buster Headache and even though that is what my order slip stated too, I received the basic Sinus Buster product. Whether or not they are the same product I should have received the \\&quot;labeled\\&quot; product that I ordered. I kept the product because I didn&#x27;t want the hassle or cost of returning it. In addition, I paid for overnight delivery so I could take the product on vacation with me. Because of some situation with the company (South Coast ?). It took 6 days (4 working days) to recieve. The product seems okay but I will not purchase anything again from South Coast...</li>
    <li> I seen this product for your nose on Dr Oz.  It really does blast our your sinus headache quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Does have an shock factor in your nose as it does sting, but works great.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried every product out there - Stadhol, every triptan, DHE, Migranol, etc. and NONE of those worked so I was highly skeptical about this product, but I thought - what do I have to lose, I&#x27;ve tried everything. I normally have a migraine very single day (uggghhh, I know) but I am on my 7th day without a headache!!! Amazing.</li>
    <li> Figured the reason this works for headaches is that the searing pain in your nostrils distracts from the pain in your head.</li>
    <li> If giving this a 4.5 were an option I would, but I&#x27;ll round up. This stuff does significantly reduces my headache pain. Doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate it, but makes it bearable enough to go back to my life as long as I don&#x27;t do anything too strenuous. I would recommended anyone with migraines give it a try.</li>
    <li> Althouth this may work for many people, It did not work for me. I got relief for a few minutes. Migraines are caused by many different reasons, so it may work for others.  However, it did clear my sinusesThe spray is not as bad as I thought it would be, it was a little uncomfortable that&#x27;s all. I am moving to other cures such as potassaium gluconate (spelling?) and calcium, they type that fizzes. This seems to work better.    With all that said, I would not hesitate to try this product if I were a sinus or other type of headache sufferer.</li>
    <li> Chronic headache sufferer here.  Headache Buster did not work for me.  Not even a little bit of relief.  Glad to hear it works for others, but no luck for me.  On to the next one...</li>
    <li> This really works - but it&#x27;s not for the timid.  If you don&#x27;t like hot peppers in your food, you won&#x27;t like this, however, the relief is almost instant and the burn isn&#x27;t so bad.  I use it almost daily as a preventative in allergy season.</li>
    <li> This product along with Migrelief completely stopped my migraines. It does burn when you take it, but it is much better than having a migraine for two days. Try this before you try any prescription drugs; I have not even noticed any side effects with this spray. It works better than anything that I ever tried before but, you must take it with Migrelief.</li>
    <li> In the throes of a migraine cycle, I googled \\&quot;migraine remedy,\\&quot; and Sinus Buster came up.  It sounded like exactly what I needed, (and I have tried it all.)  Couldn&#x27;t wait for it to come in the mail so I traveled to the only store in L.A. that carries Sinus Buster products.  Immediate relief from a residual headache.  That was about a month ago.  Since then, anytime I felt a migraine coming on, I used the product.  Admittedly, there were days when I had to use it frequently to ward off the onset.  (No problem with Sinus Buster because it&#x27;s non-addictive and you can&#x27;t really overdose.)  It worked every time, and now my cycle has vanished.  I sent Sinus Buster to my sister, whose headaches are more frequent and more severe than mine.  Again, wonderful results.</li>
    <li> I received Headache Buster and immediately tried set up a trial.  I was advised that if I used the product without experiencing a headache that I would feel a tingling sensation.  Now I feel I need to mention that since taking on a regular yoga practice I no longer suffer from headaches, but a close personal friend of mine does and although she did not wait to be taped using the product I have first hand account of her experience.  She reported \\&quot; a burning sensation in her nostrils\\&quot; as her eyes watered up and her face turned red.  Of course, the box does show a picture of what looks to be a hot pepper.  She proclaimed \\&quot;you shouldn&#x27;t squirt hot pepper spray up your nose\\&quot; as she chuckled - proving the sensation wasn&#x27;t unbearable.  She even spritzed the second nostril, ran to bathroom with what she at first thought to be a bleeding nose, but turned out to be a runny nose. Possibly sinus pressure had caused the headache.  Five minutes into the whole ordeal, after the laughing from all parties had ceased, she looked over to me and said \\&quot;Hey, my headache is gone\\&quot;. To be honest, that&#x27;s good enough for me.  She was able to make it through the rest of the night at my house with a screaming, teething 1 year old without holding her head in agony.</li>
    <li> I have killed migraines and sinus headaches alike with this. Helps drain, helps open and doesn&#x27;t take 3K sprays to do so. Beware - it&#x27;s powerful and can bring a full grown Marine to his knees if you&#x27;re not prepared. I watched this happen in my kitchen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Headache Buster for over 3 years.  It many times will stop a migraine before I need to use a stronger medicine like Sumatriptan.  Since I can have almost daily migraines this is very important.</li>
    <li> This product has validity as a natural spray that really opens up the sinuses.  As for it&#x27;s Migrane Headache claims, it seemed to make a small difference in the severity of the pain for about 30 minutes.  I ended up having to take the over the counter pain reliever to end the headache.    On the up side, knowing that nothing works for all people, this company does stand by it&#x27;s claim to refund if not satisfied.  I&#x27;m thankful for that!  I&#x27;m still looking for a natural cure for migranes!  Signed:  Hope-filled to Let Down.</li>
    <li> I had an intractable migraine for over 200 days and was desperate to try anything for potential relief. This product did not relieve my migraine. It did, however, provide a pleasant burst of tingliness that got my sinuses draining. I plan to use it when my allergies are bothering me and/or if I am really stuffed up from a cold. It definitely gets things moving in your sinuses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to get off my prescription nasal sprays so I ordered this. So far I like it, relieves my sinus pressure. Not a pleasant sensation, spraying capsaisin up your nose, but the burning and coughing wear off fast. I was concerned it would effect how I tasted food but I enjoyed my dinner thoroughly about 45 minutes after using the product. Don&#x27;t yet know how it will work for the long term.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from migraines and/or daily recurring headaches for over 5 years. It&#x27;s been quite an experience for me. HOWEVER!! I recently discovered Sinus Buster with feverfew. It really, really, really takes away my head pain. If I take 2 or 3 snorts up each nostril when a headache is just starting, it knocks it right out! If I&#x27;m \\&quot;in the middle\\&quot; of a severe headache, it helps some but does not eliminate it. I love this product!!! The Sinus Buster story needs to be publicized!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from headaches and sinus problems for so many years and Sinus Buster is the first thing that ever worked for me. I first tried their classic formula months ago and it really helped, but once I tried this headache formula with feverfew, my migraines were gone forever. It keeps them from coming. There have been some copycats trying to make pepper nasal sprays for headaches, but none of them can even come close to Sinus Buster. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product! You can feel it&#x27;s working and helping with the headaches. When someone suffers from migraines,you&#x27;re desperate to get some relief from the pain, try this product! Great great great..is all I can say. I have the regular sinus buster, the cold and the migraine one on my shelf just in case I need it.</li>
    <li> well i&#x27;m not saying its not worth a try, it is, especially if ur like me and have headaches everyday and conventional medical treatments don&#x27;t seem to be an effective (my neurologist put me on some meds and didn&#x27;t do anything, so i decided to try this). The only bad side effect i&#x27;ve had is smelling blood shortly after use, and becoming congested after i used it, hopefully it fairs better for others that buy it than it did for me</li>
    <li> I suffer from bouts of cluster headaches.  These headaches can last for days and can be very debilitating.  Was taking ibupropen like candy even though not very effective.  This product is highly effective in eliminating or toning down the severity of the headache.  One spray in the nostril on the same side of the headache substantiates eleviates the pain.  Sometimes headache ends, other times need to spray periodically to keep headache toned down till goes away.  Very effective when taking at the onset of the cluster but also effective if cluster is in progress.  This is the best product I have tried for cluster headaches and I don&#x27;t travel anywhere without it.</li>
    <li> I must admit I was a little afraid to try this product. I was thinking hot pepper spray in my nose when I am having a migraine. Wasn&#x27;t sure if I could stand it but I gave it try and I&#x27;m glad I did. I won&#x27;t lie there can be quite a but of burning depending on how much you sniff and expect runny nose and sneezing after. I don&#x27;t how it works but it does.  I try to take at the very first sign of a migraine attack. I do two sprays in each nostril then I put some cooling product on my forehead, such as Headon, Migrastick, or Wellpatch. I have warded off many migraines using this method, about 50-70% off the time, if I can take a nap it jumps to about 90% the time I will not get a full blown migraine. So to me this has been a big help. It is the first time in my life that I have been able to find something to give me some real migraine relief without taking pain medicine. I&#x27;ve had migraines since I was a young child and have taken just about every migraine medicine over the counter and prescription there is. I have tried just the cooling patches, Wellpatch, and cooling sticks and they just don&#x27;t work alone to stop the migraine they give some relief but not the same if I use the spray and the cooling.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from cluster headaches - the most painful kind of headache - for 25 years.  The only medication that would prevent them from occurring was Sansert, but that med was pulled from the shelves about 10 years ago.  Since then, I have tried many, many different preventative medications, herbs and supplements, but nothing has really worked.  During a recent cluster cycle, I was doing some research and discovered this product.  I decided to order some and give it a try.  To my amazement, this stuff can actually prevent a cluster headache IF TAKEN AT THE VERY OUTSET of a headache (i.e., the pre-pain phase).  The key is to use a liberal amount (3-4 sprays in each nostril) of Headache Buster BEFORE the pain phase begins.  Once the pain begins, this stuff will not abort a cluster headache (although it will lessen the intensity somewhat).  As far as I know, there are no bad side effects from using this product.  When you use it the first time, the capsaicin in the nasal spray will burn like hell, but it&#x27;s less unpleasant after each subsequent use, and eventually it becomes quite tolerable.  This product has saved me from having to endure the excruciating pain of a cluster headache at least 20 times, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s worth its weight in gold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that this is a bad product, or that you shouldn&#x27;t try it for yourself, it&#x27;s just that it didnt help me at all.  But everyone is different and if you are a migraine sufferer and there is a non-prescription option available, by all means see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works for my husband.  I&#x27;ve NEVER paid $99 for it!!!  When &amp; why this ridiculous cost?  Forget it!!!  I&#x27;m not supporting such thievery!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered Headache Buster last February after seeing a recommendation on the Dr. Oz Show.  I&#x27;ve suffered migraines for over 20 years and not many products offer much relief, especially because I become nausiated with a migraine and can&#x27;t keep anything down long enough for it to work.  So I usually have to wait them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Headache Buster once, with a full blown migraine, and it didn&#x27;t help.  However, I used it again this week, because I&#x27;ve been getting a low to mid grade headache almost nightly while sleeping.  This time the result was AMAZING and almost instant!  The headache was GONE!!!  The next morning I had a worse headache, and the relief wasn&#x27;t quite as good, just lesser intensity (hey, if you suffer chronic headaches, you know that ANY relief is welcome), but after a second use maybe an hour later, the headache was gone.  So last night I decided I&#x27;d make a preemptive strike, and use it before I went to bed.  This morning, NO HEADACHE!  That&#x27;s going to be my new routine for a while, as long as it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so thinking this product is so wonderful, I should order one to take in my purse, I came back to Amazon to order another one, and to my extreme disappointment, there seem to be only 2 left, and the price jumped from $14 to $68!!!!!  What&#x27;s going on?  Why would they discontinue a product that clearly is working miracles for so many???  Does anyone know what happened?</li>
    <li> This stuff remedies most of my families headaches. My wife gets an occasional migraine that this will not stop. It helps about 90% of the time.</li>
    <li> I read and watched information on this product. I suffer from Cluster Headaches and unable to take the prescribe meds due to side affects. I use this product when I start having the shadows and it seems to take the edge off and when I have the Cluster attack I take a pain reliever and the sinus buster and wait it out. I suggest that anyone who suffer from chronic Cluster Headaches give it a try for your self. I carry a bottle every where I go.</li>
    <li> Fast relief from headaches. It helps with migraines also. A rather unusual story on how the capsician spelling) used for pepper spray helps headaches.</li>
    <li> I can tell you that the burning once sprayed into the nose is electrifying! lol Will wake you up in a hurry! I can&#x27;t attest to headache relief but sinuses are cleared in a hurry. I&#x27;m quite used to it now, use several times a day if it&#x27;s cold season or allergy season. All natural, and good for you! If you are squeamish you might try a little bit in your nose before giving it a full squirt. We always laugh at each other watching the wincing and jumping around after the family or friends give it a try.</li>
