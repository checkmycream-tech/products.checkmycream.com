<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved these two items:   Flat iron: makes my hair smoother, shinier, and looks healthier  Dryer: does all the above plus hair feels better</li>
    <li> I have african american hair, though not super course. It came not 24 hours later via next-day air saver shipping. When I took it out the box, it felt really lightweight. I also own the FHI Nano blow dryer which is really light but the Babyliss was lighter than that. I assumed it would be like a cheap Conair or Revlon blow dryer you can get from CVS, but NO! It was fantastic. With the attachment, the high heat setting, and a round brush, my hair (which is natural and kinky), was dry and all the curly-kinks I have were gone in about 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, I used the flat iron, which was a dream! I also own a Chi, Hot Tools Titanium, and FHI flat iron. The titanium gives it a natural sheen without having to use any oils. And for the price.....just wow! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick corse hair and have had a hard time finding a good flat iron. This one is amazing my hair has never been so straight &amp; shiny. The hair dryer has cut my dry time almost in 1/2. Love this</li>
    <li> This straightener and dryer is absolutely amazing. It is so smooth when I pull it threw and it leaves my hair feeling wonderful. I have had a remington, conair, and FHI this one definitely tops them all!.</li>
    <li> Both the flat iron and dryer work great. I love all of the settings on the dryer and how the iron goes up to 140*.  This is a great brand and a great deal.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it. Left my hair super sleek, shiny healthy looking. Zero frizz and very natural and soft. This straightener is the best I&#x27;ve tried. Even better than my bed head straightener. I&#x27;m only sorry I just barely discovered it. Just be careful with brushes because it gets very very hot. It comes with a concentrator but no diffuser.</li>
    <li> If you long for silky straight hair, this product is for you! Thick, coarse, unruly hair is straightened with ease. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Babyliss Pro Diamond Titanium is a kit of a good performance. when you first start be amazed at the brilliance that gave my hair after using it several times the results were better. always taking care of my hair from damage by high temperatures, have been satisfied. I do not give 5 stars for being made &#x27;&#x27;in China but shows that it is high-efficiency, and professional.</li>
    <li> Love that my hair dries faster and my hair is softer than it used to be and I use it every day... love the long cords too!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is lightweight and dries my hair in half the time it took my old dryer.  The flat iron is really nice &amp; does a good job. Very good value.  I have priced these items out individually &amp; this is a really good deal.  Would highly recommend this set.</li>
    <li> My hair turns out FABULOUS! I love the flat irons and blow dryer! WWhen I do other&#x27;s hair, they rave about them too!</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair shiny and silky. I am looking for another babyliss to keep at work for touchups. This flat iron is perfect for my long thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I thought this looked like a good deal and the Babyliss brand is supposed to be \\&quot;high-end\\&quot;.  I was wrong.  The blow dryer was cheap and has two settings... 1) You&#x27;re better off standing in front of the microwave and allowing the radiation to dry your hair and 2) A much louder version of number 1.  The flat iron pulled my hair and left it frizzy.  I had to send back for a refund.</li>
    <li> This dryer blows a lot of air which is good.  The only negative is that it&#x27;s quite loud.  Drys hair much faster than other dryers I&#x27;ve used including my Chi dryer.</li>
    <li> So happy with my new Babybliss flat iron! I bought it to replace my Chi and it is so much better.  I just wish I wouldn&#x27;t have given the dryer to my daughter.  I have a Chi dryer and thought I wouldn&#x27;t need it.  I have used it a few times and it dries so much faster.  Next time I will keep them both for myself.  A great buy and received it quickly with no problems.</li>
    <li> I ordered my baby bliss  flat iron and blow dryer (combination package).  After I placed the order I was kept informed  what was going on and where my order was. It was delivered promptly and in great condition .  I have enjoyed every minute of both using products.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing!!! i love using it so when i have free time i do my hair and it takes me much shorter to do my hair with the dryer and iron!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and this set works wonders on it!! Kinda felt cheap at first but works great!!I&#x27;ve never spent any more than $25 on a flat iron so this is a great deal for as well as it works.</li>
    <li> The iron is very hot.  Heats up quickly.  The dryer takes my long hair from wet to dry in less than 10 minutes.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I have ever owned. I am a professional certified Cosmetologist. This blow dryer blows hot and with alot of power, yet extremely light weight. Lasted for about 2-3 years. Great machine.</li>
    <li> I love the flat iron. It gets really hot for African American hair. I had to turn it down to a lower temperature because it can get too hot.&lt;br /&gt; I do not like the blow dryer it takes too long to get hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very cute set with all the bling on it.</li>
    <li> I have always had to straighten my hair......Always.Too much wave to be straight but not enough to be curly, so aggravating, that&#x27;s my curse. I always notice that whenever I had my hair styled at the salon that not only was it straighter &amp; shinier than I can ever get it at home but she does it in half the time &amp; so effortlessly. So I asked her why can&#x27;t I do this good of a job at home? She said your not using the right tools. She said suggested Babyliss to me &amp; it turns out that that&#x27;s what every stylist in the entire salon used. They even had the same set there but it was $135.00 so I went home &amp; ordered one. That was six months ago, now I get to go to work everyday with perfectly straight hair. The hair dryer was just an added bonus, I was a little skeptical about the dryer bcuz I already had a great dryer &amp; had originally planned to give the Babyliss dryer to my daughter but after pulling it out &amp; giving it a try I decided to keep it. And not that this is all that important but the swarovski (spelling ?) crystals on it are gorgeous &amp; really spoke to my inner diva. Bottom line&#x3D; buy it!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is awesome! And I got the set for $60! Not sure why it was such a great price at the time, but I&#x27;m not complaining &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Both work fabulously and the hair dryer dries my hair super fast. Love them.</li>
    <li> I have used multiple flat irons in the past, from Andis to Chi to random Sally&#x27;s GVP products...this is the best one I have EVER used...I even straightened my sister-in-law&#x27;s hair (very, very THICK &amp; coarse) with ease. The blow dryer is simply awesome...very quick results &amp; I love the overall look of the two. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Same as my hairdresser uses so I was excited to find this set. I paid an Awesome price for the pair. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that I came across such a great deal. Just one Babyliss Pro item usually runs $130 and I now have a matching limited addition set for less than half price. I love my blow dryer and flat iron &amp; both work very well. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist so quality and value are important to me. Thank you!</li>
    <li> El proceso realizado sin ningun problema, la entrega fue realizada a plena satisfacción, durante el tiempo establecido, se recomienda el vendedor</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this iron. I have medium-length wavy/thick hair and I can straighten by entire head in less than 10 minutes. It gets hot REALLY fast, also. I already had a really great blow dryer (speedfreak), and this one was no comparison - the wattage was way too low to dry my hair fast. I&#x27;d say buy the set for the iron and give the blowdryer away.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best hair dryer I have ever owned, and I have owned many over the years.  It is extremely lightweight, and it dries my hair in half the time without drying it out and without frizziness or static flyaways.  It leaves my hair soft to the touch, and the ends are not burnt up (it is color treated blonde).  I have long, very fine hair - and I could not be happier with the performance of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bonus flat iron with the purchase of the hair dryer, and although I have used it minimally thus far - I am very happy with it as well.</li>
    <li> My daughter has the thickest hair in my family.  Instead of buying the cheaper dryer&#x27;s for $20 or less it is worth the little extra to buy a good hair dryer. It takes her less than 5 min to dryer her with this dyer. And one swipe with the straightener. I have very fine and thin hair no kidding about 45 seconds my hair is completely dry. I bought this for one of my daughter&#x27;s friends for Christmas. My daughter has had hers baby bliss for over 2 years no problems. We switched because the chi iron was burning and breaking her hair an mine as well . We  Love this product would not use anything else. Great buy it is a must have !!!!</li>
    <li> This was better than my Chi &amp; Remington I wear weave &amp;the silky remit velvet will not hold a curl but this iron did the job.the price is amazing the curl lasts. But read the settings because the iron gets super hot.  Best buy for my buck.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto de buena calidad la entrega fue a tiempo adecuado y el precio excelente, recomendada pueden comprar aqui con toda confianza.</li>
    <li> Best investment ever!!! Got like 2 years with this bad boy &amp; working perfectly !!! I love it!!!! Leaves my hair better than any other flat iron</li>
    <li> The blow dryer is light yet powerful &amp; the flat Iron gets the job done! Not to mention this set is a fashion statement - everyone always ask where I purchased the set from!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend despite hearing that chi was soooooo great from my mom and sister. well I read the reviews I figured how could I go wrong for the price? well I didn&#x27;t...turns out my mom and sister want a babyliss after their chi burns out and my girlfriend loves her gift. her hair is so nice after blowdrying it, she barely even needs the iron. these great reviews aren&#x27;t a fluke, these are quality products.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron and blow dryer ive ever had, hair stays straight always even if you have frizzy hair! thanks</li>
    <li> that is the best dryer ever! I love it I been working with it all day&lt;br /&gt;for fast shine and silky smooth looks #1 \\&quot;Love it\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend so much money on this product when I could get it much cheaper from Wal-Mart like I usually do. I&#x27;m so glad I went for it. This set is great quality. The blow dryer does not get hot to the touch after you use if for a long time, and it doesn&#x27;t suck your hair into the back. It is just the right size. The straightener heats up almost instantly, and works like a charm. It cools down quickly as well. There are multiple heat settings on the straightener to make it adaptable for any hair type. On top of it all, they look so sleek and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to invest in a better performing hair dryer and flat iron.  I ask my hair dresser what she used and she said Bablyliss and when I seen these two together, I bought them and they do work great !</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel because they are little. Very practice and useful. Good price for the product. I suggest it .</li>
    <li> This is the &amp;#34;cadillac&amp;#34; of hair dryers.  Well done!</li>
