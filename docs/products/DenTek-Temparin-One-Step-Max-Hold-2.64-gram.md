      <li>great product great seller</li>
      <li>Great product works it well when you can&#x27;t go to a dentist.</li>
      <li>Again something you hope not to need, but great to have</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m assuming that Play Doh will hold your bridge as effectively as DenTek Temparin Max!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that I do not work for this company as it&#x27;s been implied that anyone leaving a good review might.  </li>
      <li>These are good for any tooth repair</li>
      <li>(Check out their website for good instructions.)</li>
      <li>Keep up the good work DenTek...</li>
      <li>Good value good product</li>
      <li>The applicator for the Dentek is also superior to that of the Dentemp.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, adheres to tooth great .</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled with putting anything into the gaping hole which was my mouth.</li>
      <li>The next best thing you can have till u get a dental visit.</li>
      <li>However if you must choose, DENTEK IS BETTER</li>
      <li>But this makes its MORE than bearable until you can see your dentist.</li>
      <li>but of course dental issues love to happen during weekends, holidays, vacation ect.</li>
      <li>Maybe 1/2 a day or better.</li>
      <li>I always make sure my cabinet has this stuff in case of another emergency.  </li>
      <li>But this makes its MORE than bearable until you can see your dentist.</li>
      <li>but of course dental issues love to happen during weekends, holidays, vacation ect.</li>
      <li>Eventually that tooth is going to need more than a filling to replace the lost filling.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ll see if this product works any better.</li>
      <li>I chewed on the repair and forgot about it most of the time.</li>
      <li>This works a thousand times better than the \\&quot;refilit\\&quot; product.</li>
      <li>I think most of the problems others encountered were with lost fillings, not crowns, and not crowns with posts.</li>
      <li>I can see how these 2 products might be good for fillings and/or pain, but neither one was capable of keeping my two-tooth temporary bridge in place for more than 6-8 hours.</li>
      <li>I started really becoming concerned after I took my temp.</li>
      <li>i buy the kit that contains the eugenol liquid which might work out better value if you can tolerate the eugenol, i find that vile tasting so use corsodyl instead to clean area before filling</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still holding strong.  </li>
      <li>Run it under warm water first to prevent any sticking of material to filler.</li>
      <li>DenTek works fine, just wish it would stay in the tooth a lot longer.  </li>
      <li>It stood up to brushing just fine, but didn&#x27;t risk flossing around the repaired tooth.</li>
      <li>First you need to understand this is a temporary filling and if the cavity is in front of your mouth it will show up bright white and won&#x27;t look good.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a huge bonus while you wait to see the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This type of product is great to use for emergencies but the brand I meant to buy was Dentemp in the blue container.</li>
      <li>The dentist&#x27;s office recommended RecapIt and said it is very important to follow the directions exactly.  </li>
      <li>Dentek Temparin Max held my crown in place by suction, sealing the crown to the intact prepared tooth as in the original repair.</li>
      <li>Success!  </li>
      <li>The trick is to make sure you rinse your mouth and the area to be fixed with warm water right before you apply the product.  </li>
      <li>If you are using it because you lost a filling, chances are very good that not only did the filling come out, but you also broke away part of the tooth so temporary fillings are not going to stay very well.</li>
      <li>(again, finger should be rinsed in warm water first - it really helps smooth the product.  </li>
      <li>It seems to give most patient&#x27;s decent pain relief.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and would recommend for quick dental emergencies.</li>
      <li>It set and hardened quick.</li>
      <li>I quickly Google what to do, and cleaned it with just water.</li>
      <li>If you have the time and you need a quick fix me up</li>
      <li>I considered myself lucky to have the crown stay on even an hour after the 2 - 3 hour set-up time of the Temparin Max concoction.  </li>
      <li>I might be a super rare occasion because I could not find anyone else on the internet experience this after using this product</li>
      <li>I still use this for a minor chip I have while I await my dentist to determine the best solution for my second tooth.  </li>
      <li>It never loosened even slightly and worked as good as the original had been working for 15 years.</li>
      <li>But the alternative of pain and grumpyness just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>Yes, putting it on wasn&#x27;t fun.</li>
      <li>But the alternative of pain and grumpyness just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>Den Tek lives up to its advertising and this is a rare feat.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure your fingers have warm water on them when you roll this material into a small ball (see instructions).</li>
      <li>I got mine from a rite aid, and at a 7 bucks, was happy to see that it wouldn&#x27;t cost a small fortune to get thro till Monday.</li>
      <li>I definitely plan to go buy more as soon as I see my dentist tomorrow, so I can have a thing of it on hand and keep it on my first aid kit ( could you imagine being on vacation or a road trip and have that happen?!</li>
      <li>I definitely plan to go buy more as soon as I see my dentist tomorrow, so I can have a thing of it on hand and keep it on my first aid kit ( could you imagine being on vacation or a road trip and have that happen?!</li>
      <li>Fortunately the tooth was \\&quot;dead\\&quot; so it didn&#x27;t hurt, but there was a huge, gaping jagged hole in one of my molars that would have not been possible to ignore all weekend.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly yet</li>
      <li>I first used this product around lunch time yesterday.</li>
      <li>Given I have several crowns and this product also works to secure them, I never travel without it!ecure them, I never travel without it!</li>
      <li>Finally I tried some Fixodent that my dentist gave me, and the Fixodent did hold the crown on better.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly, twice.</li>
      <li>I finally gave up on it and tried DenTemp O.S. and had much better results.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t harden and therefore comes out the first time you eat anything.  </li>
      <li>I had mistaken this for Dentemp, similar product that works much better.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s another brand that comes in a white superglue-looking tube that works slightly better than this one.</li>
      <li>You &amp;#34;simply&amp;#34; roll, put it on, tap gently and viola!  </li>
      <li>my current lit i have had more than 6 monthes and was on the powdery side when i broke a piece off.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just say if you are not having luck keeping Temparin to stay, most likely a dentist would see the problem and wouldn&#x27;t use a temporary filling in that case either and go to plan B.</li>
      <li>Better than similar products on market, easy to apply and last longer.</li>
      <li>i have used both the temparin max and temporary filling material on myself and my daughter, i first came by this product after losing a whole filling on a friday night, i just shoved the filling piece into the hole and bit down job done, it stayed in for nearly a year, dentist was impressed enough to leave it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own, since the dentist will remove it for a more permanent fix (hopefully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a few extra of these to put in my car and home first aid kit since it worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was told that the positive reviews about this product are from people who&lt;br /&gt;work</li>
      <li>It does not hold the tooth at all, even when just speaking, so eating with it is pretty much out of the question.  </li>
      <li>product is easy to use, especially once you get the hang of it.  </li>
      <li>have used this in the past with great  results but this set must be old...</li>
      <li>I suppose, if you had a very particular issue that semi-hardened caulk-like putty would help you, then give it a shot.</li>
      <li>I had a large filling come out and couldnt get in to see my dentist for 20 days</li>
      <li>/&gt;The repair material hardened reasonably quickly and I was able to chew on it within a few hours.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much adherence with zinc oxide eugenol.</li>
      <li>and I ended up taking out about twice as much as needed.</li>
      <li>I was taking way too much ibuprofen</li>
      <li>In my opinion, you should bypass all of these temporary products and get the real dentist&#x27;s cement.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had a loose fill and decided to use this item. It packs more than other sellers yes. However it never dries. I allowed it to set overnight. By the morning I thought it would have been solid. So little did I know it was still unsettled. By the time I washed my teeth the entire paste was gone.</li>
    <li> It held my crown (with post) in upper right 2d bicuspid position for 5 days over a long holiday weekend until my dentist could see me. It worked flawlessly. I chewed on the repair and forgot about it most of the time. It never loosened even slightly and worked as good as the original had been working for 15 years. This surprised me, because about half the reviews mentioned problems of all sorts. I followed the directions exactly and was skeptical and watchful, afraid the crown would loosen and fall out in my sleep, and be inhaled or swallowed. Thankfully, I did not have to deal with those problems. I think most of the problems others encountered were with lost fillings, not crowns, and not crowns with posts. The stuff didn&#x27;t harden, and I never expected it to harden. Dentek Temparin Max held my crown in place by suction, sealing the crown to the intact prepared tooth as in the original repair. The product worked as described in the sales literature and package directions. [[ASIN:B002WTCK50 DenTek Temparin One Step Max Hold 2.64 gram,(Pack of 6)]]</li>
    <li> Oopps bought this by mistake.  I decided to try it anyway.  Its way thick and sort of melts away. This type of product is great to use for emergencies but the brand I meant to buy was Dentemp in the blue container. You can put in place of a lost filling until you can get to the dentist.  And eat on it, too, as long as you give it time to dry - several hours. Its the difference between rushing to the dentist versus taking the appointment that&#x27;s convenient for you.</li>
    <li> Good value good product</li>
    <li> If you have the time and you need a quick fix me up then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Its a perfect space and crack filler, that&#x27;s if you have the time to allow it to set that it. If you don&#x27;t have the time to wait then you might want to head to an emergency dentist asap.</li>
    <li> Gifts requested by receiver.  I assume he knows what he wants. . . .</li>
    <li> Great product! Works well.</li>
    <li> waste of money, doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> have used this in the past with great  results but this set must be old... will not firm together or stay in tooth, just crumbles away with an hour or so, very disappointed</li>
    <li> This crap worked for 2 hours.</li>
    <li> Great product works it well when you can&#x27;t go to a dentist. Den Tek lives up to its advertising and this is a rare feat.</li>
    <li> Ever been on vacation and lost a filling or oracked a tooth?  It&#x27;s a hassle, especially if there is pain involved. Or, ever had the same thing happen but have to wait to see the dentist because of low cash flow? This inexpensive product may help and relieve any pain.  And, as my dentist recommended it to me over the phone when I had a filling come out of a tooth while on vacation, I trust it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to use, especially once you get the hang of it.  The trick is to make sure you rinse your mouth and the area to be fixed with warm water right before you apply the product.  Also, make sure your fingers have warm water on them when you roll this material into a small ball (see instructions). If the material isn&#x27;t sticking together, add a little warm water to the outside of the ball. A reminder: a cavity or piece of tooth that cracks off feels much bigger in our mouth than it actually is, so you&#x27;ll probably need less product than you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it easiest to use my fingers to put the product in place and smooth it down, although there is a little plastic tool that comes with and helps, too. Run it under warm water first to prevent any sticking of material to filler. There likely will be some extra product and some that comes lose, especially when you check your bite.  I find it easiest to remove pieces not connected to the piece I want to stay in my mouth with a dry q-tip. Last, I find it helps to gently smooth the product down with a finger (again, finger should be rinsed in warm water first - it really helps smooth the product.  Follow the instructions not to eat for an hour (overnight is best - yet I drink during that time). The product provides a nice barrier between any raw nerves due to the tooth problem and the air/food, so cool air, sweet foods, etc. are far less likely to be a problem.  That&#x27;s a huge bonus while you wait to see the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck.  Given I have several crowns and this product also works to secure them, I never travel without it!ecure them, I never travel without it!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist. Temporary, but works GREAT!</li>
    <li> This works a thousand times better than the \\&quot;refilit\\&quot; product. I ordered both of them and I could not get the refilit brand to stick, this DenTek brand will fill the cavity-lost crown, etc and actually harden. I had a large filling come out and couldnt get in to see my dentist for 20 days, This got me through the wait and prevented further damage to the tooth. The average application lasted 3 days before I had to do it again. No problems eating or regular brushing. Would have given it 5 stars if it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Great product and price!  Arrived quickly and would recommend for quick dental emergencies. Better than similar products on market, easy to apply and last longer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is hard to use and very messy. I do not think anyone should waste there time or money on this crap.</li>
    <li> Saw the sad reviews but in desperation tried it anyway as I was able to get it at the big box store. It holds less than my crown did with nothing in it. I am actually going to return it even though it was under 3 bucks. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this.</li>
    <li> First you need to understand this is a temporary filling and if the cavity is in front of your mouth it will show up bright white and won&#x27;t look good. With that being said, if you lose a filling or need a temporary filling until you can get into the dentist this is perfect. Just realize you still need to get into the dentist ASAP because while this will help prevent breakage due to weak spots and will alleviate some pain, it won&#x27;t stop the rot that causes cavities to expand. If you use it as intended, it&#x27;s a great product. East to use. Affordable. And it will hold you over until your dentist appointment. Just don&#x27;t drink anything after applying it for about 20 minutes to half an hour or you&#x27;ll experience a nasty aftertaste.</li>
    <li> I used this for a temp. filling for the back of a front lower tooth. I would get a small piece (like putty) on the tip of my finger and push it into the cavity. Than I used the tool to scrape away any excess material. It was ez to apply but it tasted kind of like wet chalk in my mouth and left a funky taste when eating or drinking. It didn&#x27;t really last too long.  Maybe 1/2 a day or better. It could have been due to the location of the  filling. It did keep my tongue from rubbing the sharp area of the tooth until I got it re-filled. Funky tasting stuff  that melts slowly in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that I do not work for this company as it&#x27;s been implied that anyone leaving a good review might.  I didn&#x27;t purchase this product from Amazon.  I found it at a brick and mortar store close by for $2.97 a piece.  I was in serious pain from filling that came out leaving a huge hole in one of my back molars.  I was taking way too much ibuprofen and it was barely making a dent in the pain and I can&#x27;t see my dentist until next week.  It&#x27;s been approximately 24 hours since I packed that hole with this stuff and the relief I felt was immediate.  I followed the directions to the letter and didn&#x27;t eat on it for three hours after applying it.  I just finished lunch and ate like I normally would before I lost the filling.  It&#x27;s still holding strong.  Even if I have to reapply this once daily, it was extremely simple to apply and it will be well worth the relief provided.  I will never be without this product in my house again.  Three bucks stopped my suffering completely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m assuming that Play Doh will hold your bridge as effectively as DenTek Temparin Max! I followed the directions exactly yet it will hold my bridge for around 10 hours. That is without eating on that side of my mouth! Tomorrow is Thanksgiving, I can not get into see my dentist until Monday. I first used this product around lunch time yesterday. It&#x27;s now 9:00am and the bridge has fallen out for the third time. Please, do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I used this to try to hold a temporary crown in place.  I made about 6 attempts, but it didn&#x27;t work at all well.  Finally I tried some Fixodent that my dentist gave me, and the Fixodent did hold the crown on better.</li>
    <li> I was in terrible pain. Lower rear moler. Coulodn&#x27;t drink hot, cold, or sugar drinks. I see stars!  Terrible pain. Filled the bad tooth and it helped the pain. about 50% improvement . slept whole night without needing advil. (Advil is a great drug for toothache pain. A godsend) I still have a mild pain constantly without advil in me vs severe pain.  Easy to use, adheres to tooth great . drys like cement.&lt;br /&gt;In my case this tooth may need root canal, or extraction. This is for temporary use until u see your dentist</li>
    <li> DenTek works fine, just wish it would stay in the tooth a lot longer.  You need to keep refilling the tooth.</li>
    <li> I have an 8 crown bridge which needs replacement after 25 years of wear. It does not stay in as it should. This Temparin allows me to put in in and keep it in when I go out of the house. I don&#x27;t expect miracles from a temporary cement, but it fulfills a real need.</li>
    <li> The next best thing you can have till u get a dental visit.</li>
    <li> Says &amp;#34;Pack of 6.&amp;#34; Was really &amp;#34;Pack of 1.&amp;#34;  Avoid this product as you will only receive ONE packet instead of SIX. False advertisement.</li>
    <li> I have reordered serveral times so that should tell you how much I like it. It does every thing you want it to do,as far as filling a cavity, it won&#x27;t last for ever so you may have to keep using it, its alot cheaper than wallmart or other places like half the money</li>
    <li> I used both this DenTek product and its competition Dentemp within the last 48hrs. This review is for  RE-CEMENTING TEMPORARY CROWNS. I can see how these 2 products might be good for fillings and/or pain, but neither one was capable of keeping my two-tooth temporary bridge in place for more than 6-8 hours. However if you must choose, DENTEK IS BETTER THAN DENTEMP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for this is that DenTek instructions have you roll the product into a ball and then insert into where you need it, but Dentemp requires that you spread a thin layer (thickness of 2-3 sheets of paper) on the inside wall of the crown. This is next to IMPOSSIBLE when dealing with the texture &amp; stickiness of these products. The applicator for the Dentek is also superior to that of the Dentemp. And finally, the Dentek just plain lasted longer &amp; felt more secure than the Dentemp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should also be noted that there&#x27;s no way either product could have lasted through chewing a meal on it.</li>
    <li> This is essentially zinc oxide and eugenol which is a type of temporary filling used by dentists. For longer term temporary use, dentists use IRM which is zinc oxide and eugenol plus some fibers to strengthen the filling. I see some people are reporting it not lasting very long. That is not due to wear but to the fact the hole in the tooth is open and wide as opposed to small. There isn&#x27;t much adherence with zinc oxide eugenol. It doesn&#x27;t bond to the tooth....just mechanical retention. If you are using it because you lost a filling, chances are very good that not only did the filling come out, but you also broke away part of the tooth so temporary fillings are not going to stay very well. Eventually that tooth is going to need more than a filling to replace the lost filling. It will probably need a crown. Same thing with crowns or bridges coming out. They do not normally just come out unless there is decay or part of a tooth breaks off with the bridge which again means there is little for the Temparin to attach to. So you have a product that is going to be fantastic or almost useless depending on what your particular situation is. The material itself is very good. Let&#x27;s just say if you are not having luck keeping Temparin to stay, most likely a dentist would see the problem and wouldn&#x27;t use a temporary filling in that case either and go to plan B. We don&#x27;t have a plan B other than get thee to a dentist.</li>
    <li> Found this today, traveling and a crown popped off. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the result.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply. It set and hardened quick. And the nerve pain stopped almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Saved my sanity until i can get to a dentist.</li>
    <li> I did NOT buy this off Amazon, after this weekend, I just wanted to share my story about. After a long week, I&#x27;m getting ready to go to bed. I feel, what feels like a popcorn kernel on one of my teeth. I hadn&#x27;t eaten any, but just couldn&#x27;t think of what it might be. Raised and sharp, it was bugging me. I gently brushed, but to no avail. I then gently used floss sideways. Success!  But then to my horror, I realized what I just did. It was a VERY loose filling. I just popped it off. I quickly Google what to do, and cleaned it with just water. It was like electricity shocks in my mouth. I then remembered, but aha! My dentist will be open! So I manned up and went to bed. Of course, I then remembered my dentist was only open on the 2nd weekend of each month. Not every weekend. Sadness. I tried calling at least 50 surrounding dentists. Not ONE could get me in, or used my insurance. Wah?! I sat and cried. Of course it had to happen on the weekend. And I couldn&#x27;t even drink water. And since this didn&#x27;t qualify as an emergency, I wouldn&#x27;t see my dentist until Monday. So I tried looking up what to do until then. I finally scrolled across this &amp;#34;temporary&amp;#34; filling substance called dent temp. I wasn&#x27;t exactly thrilled with putting anything into the gaping hole which was my mouth. Especially something temporary that they&#x27;d have to re get out. But with even breathing hurting, I decided to give it a try. I got mine from a rite aid, and at a 7 bucks, was happy to see that it wouldn&#x27;t cost a small fortune to get thro till Monday. It&#x27;s in a tiny lil tube, and has what looks like white play doh. You &amp;#34;simply&amp;#34; roll, put it on, tap gently and viola!  My filling was alllllll the way in the back, so with a friend holding a flashlight, and tears, I began. Yes, putting it on wasn&#x27;t fun. But it did NOT hurt like fluids did. I put it on early Saturday morning, and it has lasted through Sunday. I have been able to eat, drink and go about work and such with no pain, and less worries. I&#x27;m still careful, and I&#x27;d suggest you do the same ( try and chew on the opposite side, no candies, sticky gooey treats or gum, nothing hard ) but this stuff exceeded my expectations and more. I didn&#x27;t want to use it, but of course dental issues love to happen during weekends, holidays, vacation ect. Can never happen on a Monday when we can see our dental person. But this makes its MORE than bearable until you can see your dentist. I still have mine in, and it&#x27;s been perfect. You can definitely feel it, and if you have a front tooth affected, people would very clearly see you have something in/on your teeth. But the alternative of pain and grumpyness just isn&#x27;t worth it. I definitely plan to go buy more as soon as I see my dentist tomorrow, so I can have a thing of it on hand and keep it on my first aid kit ( could you imagine being on vacation or a road trip and have that happen?! Eek no ty ) as for how it would hold up for a bridge or crown, I have no idea. As my opinion stated, I only used it for a large filling, but it seriously saved my weekend.es.

    <li> i have used both the temparin max and temporary filling material on myself and my daughter, i first came by this product after losing a whole filling on a friday night, i just shoved the filling piece into the hole and bit down job done, it stayed in for nearly a year, dentist was impressed enough to leave it. same with my daughter she was complaining of toothache for days then when it became unbearable i found my filler and rolled a piece up and pushed it where she could feel the hole, pain eventually subsided and lasted the three weeks it took for the dentist to fit her in, i recently lost a piece of tooth and tried the temparin max, it dose the job but not for as long as the filling material, working hours and a dentist that regularly is booked solid for weeks on end means i resort to using this product in the meantime, for those that say the product crumbles slightly moisten fingers and roll it it will turn into a cement like ball. my current lit i have had more than 6 monthes and was on the powdery side when i broke a piece off. i buy the kit that contains the eugenol liquid which might work out better value if you can tolerate the eugenol, i find that vile tasting so use corsodyl instead to clean area before filling</li>
    <li> The glue never lasted,my teeth fell out after 1 day,garbage.I used it on temporary crowns that I had installed at Los Algodones MX.It was supposed to last 1 week but it was a daily repeat to glue them back in.</li>
    <li> Another item to have on hand, these are for emergency only, so I can not rate product.  Again something you hope not to need, but great to have</li>
    <li> I was told that the positive reviews about this product are from people who&lt;br /&gt;work for the company and/or or get paid by internet programs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows this product is worthless.</li>
    <li> I have several teeth issues all at once. I read up on possibly using Superglue and my other option was this. I&#x27;m afraid to try Superglue even after extensive reading. So, I got this DenTek stuff. It was only $3 at Walmart by the way. Well, it&#x27;s like caulking. It comes in a super tiny vial and looks like a long eraser. You pull off a small hunk and apply it to your tooth. (Check out their website for good instructions.) Well, after hours and hours, it just chips away. It just doesn&#x27;t dry completely, ever. I can&#x27;t imagine how ANYONE could chew on food after using this stuff. I suppose, if you had a very particular issue that semi-hardened caulk-like putty would help you, then give it a shot. The only help it gave me was very temporary filling to keep food from getting into a (dropped a filling) cavity in my tooth. No way I can chew on it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheri Gill - Writer, Mom, Mage!</li>
    <li> It falls easily but the description says that once put only a dentist can take it out but truth is more simple, you canremove it with just a few chews of a bubble gum</li>
    <li> great product great seller</li>
    <li> I grew weary of the hospital not stocking temp fillings so I bought these. It seems to give most patient&#x27;s decent pain relief.</li>
    <li> A crown/cap from an implant recently fell off, and since it is one of the front teeth, I bought this product at a local drugstore.  It is a paste that is placed inside the crown then placed on the tooth/post.  It hasn&#x27;t worked at all on the post/crown of the implant.  It does not hold the tooth at all, even when just speaking, so eating with it is pretty much out of the question.  Since I can&#x27;t get in to see my dentist for another 2 weeks, I will try a different product instead.  The dentist&#x27;s office recommended RecapIt and said it is very important to follow the directions exactly.  We&#x27;ll see if this product works any better.</li>
    <li> Basically powder that is ineffective.  Makes a mess during the procedure.  After application, you still can&#x27;t use the reattached crown to chew on even the softest food after all directions are properly followed.  Try ordinary chewing gum, these even temporarily reattaches the crown better.</li>
    <li> These are good for any tooth repair</li>
    <li> This DenTek \\&quot;Temparin Max\\&quot; saved me from having to call my dentist for an emergency appointment when I lost part of my tooth that previously had a root canal. Fortunately the tooth was \\&quot;dead\\&quot; so it didn&#x27;t hurt, but there was a huge, gaping jagged hole in one of my molars that would have not been possible to ignore all weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions for using this are fairly straight forward, rinse the tooth area with warm water, roll a small amount of the material between your fingers, cram the material into the cavity, and clean up the rough spots with a moistened cotton swab. The package comes with a small scoop to remove the clay like material from the canister and I ended up taking out about twice as much as needed. It does not come with the cotton swab so I didn&#x27;t use one when applying this while sitting in my car, leaving my repair a little rougher than it could have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The repair material hardened reasonably quickly and I was able to chew on it within a few hours. It stood up to brushing just fine, but didn&#x27;t risk flossing around the repaired tooth. Not sure how long this will stay in one it&#x27;s own, since the dentist will remove it for a more permanent fix (hopefully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a few extra of these to put in my car and home first aid kit since it worked so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t depend on this at all</li>
    <li> Tried more than a few containers and they were all dried out.  Terrible product.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It did what it said temporary fix...</li>
    <li> This product holds my crown on for about 24 hours, and I can NOT eat on it. There&#x27;s another brand that comes in a white superglue-looking tube that works slightly better than this one. In my opinion, you should bypass all of these temporary products and get the real dentist&#x27;s cement. (You don&#x27;t need to go to the dentist, you can buy it online too).</li>
    <li> I have used the product to fill in for partly broken and missing filling. Got me through untill I could manage dental treatment.</li>
    <li> Motrin and pain relievers only do so much. This product will help but not cure sensitive pith and exposed nerve areas for lost fillings as I don&#x27;t know how it works on caps and crowns. Eat and drink with it as if the area is still exposed, that has been the only way I&#x27;ve found to not have to repeat the process before seeing a dentist. It will subside the pain and sensitivity to hot and cold and allow you to sleep and in that regard it can be a god sent. I have used it on a broken tooth with exposed nerve and gum and don&#x27;t recommend it for that purpose also use this as soon as possible after losing the filling or an infection can set in and an abscess won&#x27;t have a place to release pressure causing more severe and possibly deadly circumstances. This is from experience not third party research.</li>
    <li> It is like a clay almost for sticking things back temporarily.  Doesn&#x27;t work on dentures which is why I wanted it</li>
    <li> I tried the DenTek Temparin Max to recement a crown that had come off and was very disappointed in its performance.  I considered myself lucky to have the crown stay on even an hour after the 2 - 3 hour set-up time of the Temparin Max concoction.  I finally gave up on it and tried DenTemp O.S. and had much better results.</li>
    <li> This product does not work well.  It doesn&#x27;t harden and therefore comes out the first time you eat anything.  I had mistaken this for Dentemp, similar product that works much better.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product that holds firm even in the most difficult situations...Keep up the good work DenTek...</li>
    <li> Excelent product compared to other brands! Temporary fix, doesn&#x27;t adhere once food consumed yet fits the purpose otherwise!!</li>
    <li> Great for a temporary fix until you can get to the dentist</li>
    <li> Works ok, doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is just me, but, I had a hard time to get this product to stay in place. I followed the instructions, but, I never really seemed to harden all the way.</li>
    <li> Because I changed jobs and did needed to build up leave I found myself having to use this stuff for well over a few months as I waited my new insurance to kick in.  All I can say is thank goodness because I had a pretty severe tooth break in half and this stuff was a life saver.  I always make sure my cabinet has this stuff in case of another emergency.  I still use this for a minor chip I have while I await my dentist to determine the best solution for my second tooth.  The price is right there with other stores and not having to worry about stopping after work to pick it up is just fantastic.</li>
    <li> This stuff should be in all medicine cabinets as it works well for any filling that has fallen out and you need something to take its place until a dentist can be seen for a replacement filling.</li>
    <li> Great product !!! Really holds loose caps in place.</li>
    <li> Wonderful delivery, wonderful price...</li>
    <li> Hard to manipulate.  Impossible to shape.  And even after following directions for curing time, the filling fell out the first time I ate something.  Several times.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly, twice. I gave 14 hours the first time before eating and 5 hours the next time and both fillings came out while eating lunch despite trying to avoid the areas with food. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Within 15 mins of using this product on two of my teeth which had lost fillings I began to feel nausea and some jittery sensations- within another half hour I felt feverish and ill.  I started really becoming concerned after I took my temp. and it read 101.6- I have not had a fever like that in years...I was really worried but fever did go back down within several more hours and some advil.  Use caution people.  I might be a super rare occasion because I could not find anyone else on the internet experience this after using this product</li>
