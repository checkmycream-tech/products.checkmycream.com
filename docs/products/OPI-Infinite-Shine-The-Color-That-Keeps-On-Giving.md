      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice lacquer that applies easily and dries quickly.</li>

      <li>but then becomes more opaque.</li>
      <li>If you like \\&quot;Doctor Who\\&quot; and want a nail polish to match, OPI DS Magic is the answer.</li>
      <li>Seems like that is getting more</li>
      <li>and this was a better price than eBay.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
      <li>Anyway,i ordered Magic bc</li>
      <li>I ordered this OPI Designer Series color, Magic, bc</li>
      <li>I have worn it during the holidays and received many compliments.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for my wife because OPI is her favorite brand</li>
      <li>bc its matte but can be shiny if u put on a top coat..</li>
      <li>, TNX :)</li>
      <li>and this is one of her favorite colors.  </li>
      <li>I love the shimmer.  </li>
      <li>I love this bright and vibrant color....</li>
      <li>so my relation was born &amp; i just love the disco-ball like fabulous (diamond dust) shimmer of the DS line bc</li>
      <li>Nothing much to complain about, looks good.</li>
      <li>&amp; it dries very quickly</li>
      <li>Amazon.com, always make it so easy to find any item, that I can&#x27;t find anywhere else.</li>
      <li>So Pleased that I was able to find the exact color nail polish, that I wanted.</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I live on L.I., NY &amp; cannot believe of all the amazing shopping here &amp; having worked in the cosmetics industry that I&#x27;ve never come around this line of OPI.</li>
      <li>Came in original packaging and shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>You can check out O.P.I.&#x27;s website directly too at [...] to get a more accurate picture of how well the color will fit your hand specifically.     </li>
      <li>It looks really cool in the sun too</li>
      <li>Texture is strange, but after adding a clear top coat, it looks and feels great.</li>
      <li>Love opi just doesn&#x27;t get any better,the color is long lasting and beautiful ....used it for the 4 th of july</li>
      <li>I just put on this new color and love it already.</li>
      <li>Not only is Magic the same warm navy blue as the TARDIS, but there&#x27;s a nice bit of sparkle that catches the light without diminishing the color.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, a deep blue with purple in certain light.</li>
      <li>Thanks for having it Amazon!</li>
      <li>This is my first O.P.I. nail lacquer</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>This is a recognizable, eye-catching TARDIS blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a gorgeous deep ultramarine blue with hints of purple and navy sparkle...</li>
      <li>This polish is a great color, that is a dark blue with lots of sparkle.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend really likes it which is always a positive</li>
      <li>This polish makes me feel like a straight up cosmic mermaid.</li>
      <li>So much for that</li>
      <li>Its absolutely gorge, &amp; tho</li>
      <li>Really stands out and very glittery.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s at least as good as the Sally Hansen polish that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t really get a deal on this particular Amazon purchase</li>
      <li>Liked the color, long lasting.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this for a special occasion, especially around New Year&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gotten a little thick over time and it tends to chip easily (like most glitters).</li>
      <li>for the quality, this is the first OPI nail polish that I&#x27;ve ever used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other lines and colors of this brand.</li>
      <li>It is a sparkly dark blue that really shines.  </li>

    <li> So Pleased that I was able to find the exact color nail polish, that I wanted. Amazon.com, always make it so easy to find any item, that I can&#x27;t find anywhere else. &amp;#34;My Hats Off To You.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I ordered this OPI Designer Series color, Magic, bc I already own Lapis &amp; I was introduced 2 the DS when visiting my sister while getting a mani in NJ. I live on L.I., NY &amp; cannot believe of all the amazing shopping here &amp; having worked in the cosmetics industry that I&#x27;ve never come around this line of OPI. I have some nail polish from Henri Bendel that looks lime denim jeans &amp; while getting my mani i noticed that Lapis looked very similar 2 my polish that i wanted them 2 use bc mine is on the tbicjer side &amp; it dries very quickly bc its matte but can be shiny if u put on a top coat.. So is the same with, Lapis, &amp; so my relation was born &amp; i just love the disco-ball like fabulous (diamond dust) shimmer of the DS line bc its understated, yet explosion of color @tge same time if thats @all possible! Anyway,i ordered Magic bc I love &amp; am obsessed w/all blues &amp; this color remibded me of a cross between 2 of my faves of the OPI collection in colors Russian Navy(bc its a blue w/a purple oplal-hue), &amp; Yoga 2 B Blue. &amp;Since I love those 2, this is like their beautiful baby! Its a little sheer on tbe 1st coat but then becomes more opaque. Its absolutely gorge, &amp; tho i didn&#x27;t really get a deal on this particular Amazon purchase, I sort of did bc i got 2 colors in 1, plus i ordered this on the 6th i think, &amp; it was supposed to come anywhere from Monday the 12th thru Fri the 16th &amp;  w/standard delivery i still got it waayy earlier than I expected bc its Fri tbe 9th, &amp; so I&#x27;m also very happy about that!! Loving it!!, TNX :)</li>
    <li> This color is just awesome!  It is a sparkly dark blue that really shines.  I love the shimmer.  It is hard to find.</li>

    <li> This is my first O.P.I. nail lacquer and I&#x27;m loving the color! It&#x27;s not exactly as pictured here though - it&#x27;s darker, but it&#x27;s still nice. You can check out O.P.I.&#x27;s website directly too at [...] to get a more accurate picture of how well the color will fit your hand specifically.     Came on time with good packaging as well. Nothing much to complain about, looks good.</li>
    <li> This polish makes me feel like a straight up cosmic mermaid. It&#x27;s gotten a little thick over time and it tends to chip easily (like most glitters). I can mystify myself for hours just watching it change colors.</li>
    <li> Love opi just doesn&#x27;t get any better,the color is long lasting and beautiful ....used it for the 4 th of july</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colors!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, a deep blue with purple in certain light. Great go to color.  My boyfriend really likes it which is always a positive</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife because OPI is her favorite brand and this is one of her favorite colors.  OPI has discontinued this color and my wife had been searching for it to have an extra bottle.  Thanks for having it Amazon!</li>
    <li> Favorite polish of life!...it&#x27;s a gorgeous deep ultramarine blue with hints of purple and navy sparkle...amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my toes at a salon that didnt have any of this to sell. Looked around online and this was a better price than eBay. Seems like that is getting more common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this color, my toes got compliments from everyone... even my mother. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Liked the color, long lasting. Really stands out and very glittery. Good for going out and wedding occasions. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t even get the bottle open, the threading is messed up or something. So much for that</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it from a friend, ever since then I have absolutely loved this colour. I have been looking for it for almost a year now and I finally have it. It&#x27;s a really lovely eye catching colour.</li>
    <li> If you like \\&quot;Doctor Who\\&quot; and want a nail polish to match, OPI DS Magic is the answer. Not only is Magic the same warm navy blue as the TARDIS, but there&#x27;s a nice bit of sparkle that catches the light without diminishing the color. This is a recognizable, eye-catching TARDIS blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality, this is the first OPI nail polish that I&#x27;ve ever used, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other lines and colors of this brand. However, it&#x27;s at least as good as the Sally Hansen polish that I&#x27;m used to. After a few cosplays, I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this bright and vibrant color....I think that you could even use this color for the Christmas season.....,it has just enough sparkle in it to pass for a festive type of color.</li>
    <li> I just put on this new color and love it already. It&#x27;s a very nice lacquer that applies easily and dries quickly. It also has a multicolor shine to it that gives off shades in midnight blue, purple, and magenta under different types of lighting. I would definitely recommend this for a special occasion, especially around New Year&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Came in original packaging and shipped quickly. Love the color!! Texture is strange, but after adding a clear top coat, it looks and feels great.</li>
