      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>Cheap price!</li>
      <li>I LOVE these hair clips.  </li>
      <li>These are cute but don&#x27;t hold well.</li>
      <li>There are silicone grip strips inside that prevent he clip from sliding out of your hair, but magically doesn&#x27;t tug at your hair either.  </li>
      <li>more sales &amp; more</li>
      <li>these clips are ok for when my hair is on the shorted side</li>
      <li>lighter clips that are easier to break + customer needs more after breaking them &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>I kept them but won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
      <li>they are ok for the price</li>
      <li>, it seems to work ok.</li>
      <li>Just doesn&#x27;t seem to grip my hair at all unless I put the hair bundled up with the clip on top of my head which is not a style I like for &amp;#34;going out.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>The quality is very good - they&#x27;re durable and not flimsy (though I did have to replace my old ones after a couple years of use, not bad for $5!).</li>
      <li>I am willing to pay for a good clip, these were not it.</li>
      <li>They are so easy to use, and I love the fact that they don&#x27;t slip.  </li>
      <li>Great product,  super fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Broke easily</li>
      <li>It keeps it in your hair but is easy to remove without pulling hair.  </li>
      <li>They break easy.</li>
      <li>I am not, nor have I ever been, unusually strong or brutish.</li>
      <li>these clips are strong and the hinges haven&#x27;t broke yet - had for over 6 months now.</li>
      <li>I feel this is a medium size clip but is well made, strong, &amp;</li>
      <li>My fine hair seems to cause the clip to loosen</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this works well for me.  </li>
      <li>They feel really light and seem like they would break easy if you used them-</li>
      <li>I love these, they&#x27;re so pretty!</li>
      <li>Cheap quality.</li>
      <li>but this clip just doesn&#x27;t fit around my hair to stay on.</li>
      <li>The teeth have rubber coating inside so the hair is held securely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the larger ones, and they work great until they wear out.</li>
      <li>Also, comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>I tried two at one time and they still didn&#x27;t have a secure hold on my bun.  </li>
      <li>They are really great for fine hair, they clamp securely WITHOUT pulling and slipping.  </li>
      <li>New style for me love the gripping pads</li>
      <li>DEFINITELY worth the buy!</li>
      <li>Otherwise I&#x27;m sure they would have been just fine with straight hair.</li>
      <li>The rubbery stuff along the inside of the clip really does work to prevent your hair from slipping out, and the clips are the perfect size for my hair.</li>
      <li>I love the claw/octopus shape of these clips - very excited to find these online since the dollar tree stopped selling them near me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Look nice and works great.</li>
    <li> So disappointed with how small these are.  My daughter has really thick hair and a lot of it and the photos make these look like they would work well.  They are tiny and I would definitely not recommend them until you have really thin hair.</li>
    <li> Great clips. My hair is getting so think to a point that I have to use clip, which I haven&#x27;t done for years. I wear it every day. It is good quality.</li>
    <li> They work as you would expect them to.</li>
    <li> Holds my thick curly hair well.  Just wish they were both brown.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected but works fine.</li>
    <li> Horrible clips. They break easy. They are not non slip at least not in my hair. I love hair clips to keep my hair out of my face and these are the worst I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> Nice clips, inside is lined with silicone to help hold hair. Fair warning: these are smaller than I expected but I have very long hair and they still work.</li>
    <li> These look like they will grip nicely and she will love them.</li>
    <li> I love the claw/octopus shape of these clips - very excited to find these online since the dollar tree stopped selling them near me. These are actually a little better than the dollar store ones since they have soft rubber pieces on the inside that keep super slick hair like mine from slipping through the clip during the day.    I have really thick, smooth, long (waist length) Asian hair and these clips are perfect to hold hair up during the day and keep hair dry during showers. With most other clip shapes, my hair slides out of them constantly and I have to keep re-adjusting/re-clipping. Not with these though! :)    No, these won&#x27;t fit around an entire bun, but there are larger versions of these clips that do (those are really awesome too). I find that I put my hair in a bun anyways and clip one of these smaller ones on the side - attaching one side of the bun to my head.    My only gripe is that when I got the clips, there were faint marks on the plastic - possibly from being thrown around during storage/transport. It&#x27;s not enough to dampen my enthusiasm though, I&#x27;ll definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> It dosent hold any hair all that well it falls out and u have to keep putting it up and taking it out</li>
    <li> I love it. For some reason I only have 1 and I make sure I know where it is at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick shoulder length hair and used these same ones I have now back when my hair was much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically put my hair up in one after the shower and it literally stays and holds the entire day until whenever I decide to take it out let my hair air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree that they work much better on my wet hair than my dry hair but they still work.</li>
    <li> One of the clips looks like a spider - spooky ...ugly... I got rid of the ugly one ....</li>
    <li> Both broke within 1 week of normal use... don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> They won&#x27;t stay on. I love how easy they are to open. I had another clip that I loved but it was very hard to open. These are, however, very loose. I have very fine hair and the clip just can&#x27;t hold it even when I make my hair into a bun. Looks like I&#x27;ll just keep looking and these will have to be donated.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re fairly cheap plastic hair clips, with no real surprises. The claws of the clips are coated with a rubbery no-slip grip, which yanks a few hairs out each time, but is not that bothersome on the whole. The clips are too small to hold all of my hair wound into a circular bun, but they&#x27;re a decent size nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to complain about the packaging, however. The clips come, as pictured, attached to a backing that&#x27;s meant to be hung from a store&#x27;s display rack. However, the clips are zip-tied to the backing so tightly that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get them off of it! Each clip has two ties holding it down, and so little wiggle room that it&#x27;s impossible to just pull the clips out or easily cut them out. I struggled for ten minutes with scissors and a boxcutter to get the first clip free, then decided the second clip wasn&#x27;t worth the effort. It&#x27;s still attached to the backing, buried in a drawer somewhere. I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying these again.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they looked big enough to hold my hair like what I was replacing, but they were mini in size and not big enough. The picture does not show the size so be careful that you are getting the right size.</li>
    <li> Love the no slip-grip. Wish they were made for thicker hair, as they don&#x27;t hold my hair up.</li>
    <li> They broke quickly after wearing them for about a month.</li>
    <li> Broke after a few months.</li>
    <li> These Scunci No-Slip Grip Octopus Clips are just the right size for my fine,long hair. When choosing the clip which would work best, I compared the measurements given to clips I have. Years ago I had found a pack of this size clip and have not seen them for as low a price recently locally or online. This size clip doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, come loose or dig into my scalp as some larger clips have done. It was good to find these smaller clips for a less than one would pay elsewhere!</li>
    <li> I needed some new clips to put my hair up and thought these would work. My hair is long and very thick &amp; course so it&#x27;s hard to find hair clips that will close around all of my hair. I thought these would be large enough, but they&#x27;re not. I take my hair and twist the length of it, then twist it into a bun but this clip just doesn&#x27;t fit around my hair to stay on.</li>
    <li> I have thick fine hair so a lot of hair clips don&#x27;t stay in place either because my hair is too heavy or because it tends to slip out of place. These work pretty well, the octopus style has always worked well for me when all the rest fail. These aren&#x27;t the largest ones though, which hold up better, but these are still good if your hair is just long enough to pull back and twist into a bun shape.</li>
    <li> I thought they would be a lot larger.  Clips to small to hold my long hair.  I will give to my daughter she has shorter hair and they might work for her.  Do not buy if your need a clip for long hair.</li>
    <li> They are really great for fine hair, they clamp securely WITHOUT pulling and slipping.  The smaller clips don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> My hair is down to my butt. I twist my hair in half once and put on e of these bad boys in. Keeps it up and out of my face all day.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!!</li>
    <li> The clip at it&#x27;s most closed state still has quite a large gap that my hair falls through. Unless it is holding my hair in some kind of bun, it just falls out and I have very thick hair.</li>
    <li> Thought they were bigger when I ordered them.  They would work if I didn&#x27;t have hair that is both thick and long.  I&#x27;ve had the larger ones, and they work great until they wear out.</li>
    <li> They slip. the spring doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough. My hair is pretty thick. It just wont stay put.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and have bought clips like this before. They work great....except this set is a little small for my needs.</li>
    <li> This is the second set of clips I&#x27;ve gotten.  My first set were worn out from almost daily use for a year.  They are very sturdy and keep my thick hair out of the way without pulling on my scalp like a pony tail.  The grips on the inside of the clips helps keep my hair from slipping out of the clip.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, but I have super thick long hair. My mom and cousin have used it and it works very well.</li>
    <li> These are cute but don&#x27;t hold well.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my girlfriend because she has very thick and long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only type of clip that works for her; her other option to hold up her hair are a few hairbands (thick ones), so this gives her another option that is less work.</li>
    <li> these clips are ok for when my hair is on the shorted side but if I let it grow for a while these are way to small to hold a whole head of hair up.  Good for short hair, not long.</li>
    <li> No slip grip is fantastic, especially because these clips are about half the size that I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that these are very small.&lt;br /&gt;They would be great for someone with very thin hair or a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair so they don&#x27;t work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with purchasing the next batch at Walmart so that I can see exactly what I am getting!</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold my hair up during deep conditioning, protein treatments, and just to throw my hair up. I was a little worried by some of the other reviews that I had read that they were going to be too big or too small, however, they were a great size. I have thick hair that is a on the longer side, and I relax so I do not need anything tugging at my hair. These were well worth the price. I would agree with some of the byers on the plastic, if you do deep conditioning under a hooded dryer I would not use these they will bend and break under high heat.</li>
    <li> bought these awhile back, still use em every day. ive found, these are the only type of hair clips to actually stay in my hair. DEFINITELY worth the buy!</li>
    <li> We had a couple of these we had purchased locally.  My daughters loved using them.  These are such weird colors that my daughters don&#x27;t want to use them.  Wasted money.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these in the store and fell in love with it.  I have really long (down to my waist) and thick hair and I was able to clip my hair into a bun with it so I thought I would get more but the store stopped selling them.  These clips should have a title of MEDIUM sized clips.  I can clip about half of my hair into a bun with one of these.  Not really what I was going for but it&#x27;s ok.  I will continue my search for the large one that I have and hope it doesn&#x27;t break on me before I can find another one.</li>
    <li> I have fairly normal hair, down past my shoulder blades, straight as a pin. The no slip part is a joke. I can put these in my hair wet or dry and they fall down doing tasks as simple as walking at a normal pace. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the larger version of the óctopus clip,&#x27; but it is a smaller one, does not work in the least for thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I have thick non-ethnic hair about halfway down my shoulder blades.  I bought a variety of octopus clips to see what would work.  These clips were far too small for my hair, but the no-slip grippy things on the teeth seemed as good as ever.  I&#x27;m sure they would be great for thinner, shorter hair.</li>
    <li> i have trouble keeping my hair up with large pins because I have very thin hair (and not a lot of it). These keep my hair up perfectly! whether my hair is wet or dry, they are the perfect solution to get my hair out of the way while looking nice.</li>
    <li> These are not as large as I thought they would. I am able to only put the front area of hair up.</li>
    <li> I have waist length, thick curly hair. And these things were far too small to hold any of my hair. The tortoise colored one is ugly as well. It doesn&#x27;t look the picture. They feel really light and seem like they would break easy if you used them- I wouldn&#x27;t know for sure since I can&#x27;t wear them.</li>
    <li> Wore these for a couple of months, and then the plastic snapped.  Had to throw them out.</li>
    <li> I love these. They&#x27;re very sturdy and hold my short hair very well. I usually break clips very quickly, but I ordered 4 of these over 6 months ago and have only broken one so far!</li>
    <li> Came up under a search for THICK hair and under large clips but is not as large as the octopus clips I bought at walmart so will not hold all my hair. I can use it for half of my hair and the nonslip rubber coating inside keeps my hair from sliding out. I feel this is a medium size clip but is well made, strong, &amp; the nonslip works better than any other I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> I use these clips to hold my hair back for half-up styles, and it works well enough with my thick hair. I would use a larger clip for my thick hair if I needed all of it up though. The no-slip grip works great.</li>
    <li> These are the only type of hair clips that keep my hair up, otherwise, it is constantly slipping out of other hair clips.  I couldn&#x27;t find these in the store where I usually shop, so I was very glad to find these at Amazon at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Seriously--not well made.  I clipped one in and rather gently pushed the teeth together with my thumb and forefinger to close the clip through my hair.  Snapped instantly.  Then I was dumb enough to put in the other one and did the same thing.  I did it even more gently, mind you, since I just broke the first one.  Snapped again.  I am not, nor have I ever been, unusually strong or brutish.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately these did not hold up well at all. The rubber grip on the inside helps, but then it started to peel off and my hair would get caught between the rubber and the plastic claw- ouch.  One clip could not hold my hair up in a bun.  I tried two at one time and they still didn&#x27;t have a secure hold on my bun.  My bun is about larger than my fist, and these clips are half as small.  I read a review on here that it worked for thick hair.  My fault for not seeing that the review mentioned nothing about the length.  These would work for shorter hair.  Not for me though.</li>
    <li> I love these clips! They have the no slip, so it catches on my hair and stays put. And they don&#x27;t stick way far out from the back of my head. Works great when I need to just pull my hair all up!</li>
    <li> Good clip, but I have really thick hair and can&#x27;t get it all inside the clip. Would be good for younger girls or women without super thick hair - or for only putting some of the hair back.</li>
    <li> New style for me love the gripping pads my granddaughter hair stays put</li>
    <li> I am very glad I bought these, I was running out of clips because I have a toddler in the house who has a grudge against any and all of my hair accessories so I am constantly replacing them. I have been wearing one continuously since I received it 2 weeks ago and am very happy. These are very sturdy and the claws themselves are flexible so they give a great hold and wont snap apart so easily. These will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick and wavy hair. These did not hold well and both broke in less than a month.  This, too, is heavy on the head.</li>
    <li> These are great clips for fine hair.  I have a ton of hair but most clips pull on the back of my head and allow my very fine hair to slip out.  The Octopus clip stays where I put it and keeps my hair with no pulling.  It&#x27;s the only kind of clip I use.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length thick hair and these clips do not hold all my hair. I would return them but the return shipping costs aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I love these, they&#x27;re so pretty! The brown one is a brown color with caramel lines, and the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; is just a dark dark brown color. They&#x27;re both really beautiful and clip in your hair perfectly. They&#x27;re easy to open and they grip all the hair!</li>
    <li> Great clip for long and thick hair, not too big or bulky, like most heavy duty clips. Have ordered many more!</li>
    <li> I ordered these after my last claw clip was lost in an unfortunate battle with my dog. They just arrived today and are hideous.  I don&#x27;t write reviews often, but I feel like this needs to be said.  I&#x27;m not going to worry about the hassle of returning something so small, but will look into donating them somewhere.  The &amp;#34;tortoise&amp;#34; is anything but.  It&#x27;s an odd gray brown color with brown lines drawn on top.  Pretty much looks like someone gave a toddler a plain clip and brown marker and let them go to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. Never again.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t think i would love this so much. Its very comfortable and sturdy.  A little smaller than what you think when you order it but works well.</li>
    <li> hair falls out within minutes. badly advertised as &amp;#34;no slip&amp;#34; they slip!!</li>
    <li> I love these clips! I have thick hair that is about shoulder length and the clip holds in for the whole day! I wear them all the time and they are very durable.</li>
    <li> Definitely does not slip. Works as intended, though I wish they had other designs.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when these arrived. I would call these &amp;#34;medium,&amp;#34; and what I had before was &amp;#34;large.&amp;#34; I have a ton of hair (it&#x27;s both long and thick). These will work, but their smaller size means they don&#x27;t hold/stay as well.</li>
    <li> Too big unless you have thick, long hair.  The spring is not very strong.  As positives, the clip teeth won&#x27;t pinch together on your hair and have rounded edges.</li>
    <li> I have long thick wavy hair and these clips hold a loose up do with no readjusting throughout the day. The flat design is nice when driving. It doesn&#x27;t dig into my scalp. I wish I could get 2 black ones instead of brown and black.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. I gave it three stars because they were too small for my thick hair. Otherwise I&#x27;m sure they would have been just fine with straight hair.</li>
    <li> Nice grip but anything with these tension like springs...you know it won&#x27;t last forever. Cheap price! Enjoy! Keeps hair tidy.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife.  They were a bit smaller than I expected, and way smaller than what is listed in the product dimensions.  Other than that, it seems to work ok.</li>
    <li> these clips are strong and the hinges haven&#x27;t broke yet - had for over 6 months now.</li>
    <li> The one that is supposed to be black is dark brown. Both are damaged and look old. Don&#x27;t buy it, go to the pharmacy and choose the ones you like. I won&#x27;t return it just to avoid the hassle. I&#x27;ll try to use them at home but not for the purpose of why they were bought. I don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are the medium size octopus hair clips. When I was buying them, I couldn&#x27;t tell if there were the big ones, or the ones just a bit smaller. These are the slightly smaller ones. However they still hold hair well. I have a bunch of thick hair, but it&#x27;s only shoulder length right now, so these clips are fine for it. Back when I had hair past my shoulders, I would have needed the larger size (because of how super thick my hair is). For most hair types, these clips are fine in size and are strong enough. If you have that long, thick hair that looks like a horses tail when it&#x27;s in a pony tail (like mine is when it&#x27;s long) then you&#x27;ll want the clips the next size up.</li>
    <li> These are the only clips i use. they are the only ones that stay in place once they are in your hair thanks to rubber on the claws!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t indicate a size.  These are medium clips.  Does not work well with my long hair.  Cheaply made plastic, but it holds well without the pain of other clips.</li>
    <li> These work well for what I would say , I have long thin hair. Holds well.</li>
    <li> I placed an order thinking they would be the medium size clips, but they are actually the large size. Will have to return them because i only use the medium size. This one give me a headache</li>
    <li> smaller than expected, not as useful for my long and very thick hair as some of the other brands of spider clips I have.  I kept them but won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
    <li> My hair is shoulder length and pretty thick. These are the only clips I&#x27;ve ever found that I can actually pull my entire head of hair up with. Probably not a great choice if your hair is thin or fine, or both, but if you have thick hair you&#x27;ll probably be happy with these. They&#x27;re not the most beautiful thing the world but what clip is?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these before, but these ones seemed to be of poor quality.  They both broke quickly.</li>
    <li> Holds lots of hair. I have long hair, it can firmly hold it in place for hours. The price was right on, too.</li>
    <li> What happened to these clips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been buying these at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the Scuncis have changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for the better either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some of these that are older by about 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;Those were on the weighty side.&lt;br /&gt;The new clips are much lighter.&lt;br /&gt;They also break so much easier as well.&lt;br /&gt;It is almost like they want them to break easier.&lt;br /&gt;I have actually taken one of the new ones &amp; put one new, one older in each hand.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to tell which is new &amp; which is older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it is like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;make lighter clips that are easier to break + customer needs more after breaking them &#x3D; more sales &amp; more money!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint though is not so much about the money as it is about them breaking at an inopportune time.&lt;br /&gt;My mind is like a sieve so when I am going to &amp;#34;town&amp;#34; or  get online at Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;I always forget to order them.&lt;br /&gt;The next time I think about it.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get back in the shower or want to pull my hair up for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;Then some times I do remember &amp; run to Amazon to get some more.&lt;br /&gt;Alas, then they are marked with the lovely &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; label. (Grrrrrrr......).&lt;br /&gt;I can not find $25 worth of stuff to buy so I can get my claw clips.&lt;br /&gt;Then I start to wonder &amp;#34;Why am I a prime member (again).???!??!!!&lt;br /&gt;Then we do this all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though.&lt;br /&gt;These used to be great, strong, and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;They should not break from a small distance drop or when you are attempting to just clip your hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have touch hair &amp; hair about a third of the way down my back (once you straighten out the curl)&lt;br /&gt;The older ones of the same size as these do not give any fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone got any ideas as to another type or manufacturer of a claw clip that does not stroke out each time you try to use them??&lt;br /&gt;By all means, please share your ideas!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vermin.</li>
    <li> I live in a climate that is mostly warm to too hot and so I keep my hair up a most of the time. I&#x27;m disappointed, since I thought these were much larger given that first of all the listing says \\&quot;Product Dimensions: 6.5 x 2.8 x 2\\&quot; inches and I would take that to mean that the clip itself, being the product, is that size, not the dimensions of the card the clips are clipped to, with the 2\\&quot; being the height the of the clip. The ones I received are 2.5(l)\\&quot; x 2\\&quot;(w) x 2\\&quot;(h), which is pretty small. The second reason I thought the product dimensions would be the size of the actual product is that someone said on their review that the clip was too big for their long hair. My hair is pretty long and the last octopus clip I had was about 4\\&quot; and worked beautifully to keep my hair up in a bun with minimal pulling on the hair it is fastened to and so I thought these were like that clip, given the information I was supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said,which isn&#x27;t the fault of the clips themselves, they are well made and have some rubber type material inside to help it to stay in place, which the package calls \\&quot;No Slip Grip\\&quot; and \\&quot;all day hold\\&quot;. While I can&#x27;t put all my hair in these clips, it does work to put it on the circumference, in other words, if I twist my hair and clip it, much like a pony tail it works great and stays in place. So while I am disappointed they weren&#x27;t the size I expected, this clip itself is well made.</li>
    <li> These are great hair clips to throw your hair in a bun and go. Only thing is that they were smaller than I expected (than previous ones I had bought in stores). However, since I have pretty thin hair and medium length they still work and accomplish what I want. I think a size a tad bit larger would be perfect though.</li>
    <li> I got these clips for a gift, and I was excited at how big they were... but only after a few days of use, one of the claws broke off.</li>
    <li> Please note- these are huge; designed for thick hair.</li>
    <li> they are ok for the price&lt;br /&gt;What I do is put my hair in a ponytail&lt;br /&gt;with a elestic band and they wrap in around&lt;br /&gt;in a bun and stick the claw around it,&lt;br /&gt;stays put and no bobby pins.</li>
    <li> These are the only Clips I can find that will keep thick hair up. Pros and Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Holds up thick longish hair&lt;br /&gt;Has rubber lining inside to keep hair in place&lt;br /&gt;Lasts longer than other brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;There is another slightly larger of this clip sold as a one pack&lt;br /&gt;Lasts longer than other brands, but if it is dropped, it is probably going to break</li>
    <li> The brown is not as dark brown as is pictured here, it is more khaki colored, which was disappointing.  There is a rubber grip around the edge of the clip though, which really helps keep hair in place and keeps strands from falling out.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase overall.</li>
    <li> I love these clips generally, but when I ordered them this time, one of them broke the first time I wore it.</li>
    <li> Great for thick heavy hair, half up, w/out a band first.</li>
    <li> These are a nice size.  I have finer, long hair and the more widely available larger sizes are just needlessly heavy.  These are the porridge that goldilocks picked.</li>
    <li> I was hoping the joints would be a little stronger as I have pretty thick but soft hair and while it holds for a while my hair tends to spill loose. I would recommend to anyone with thick courser hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe looks good, but could not grasp my hair tightly. I can only use this when I hang down my hair loosely at home.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality. Plastic is flimsy and not finished very well.  They are simply cheaply made and the plastic flexes too much.  Do NOT buy.</li>
    <li> These clips do exactly what they say they will - they keep your hair back very effectively. The rubbery stuff along the inside of the clip really does work to prevent your hair from slipping out, and the clips are the perfect size for my hair. (I have fairly thin, straight hair that goes a few inches past my shoulders, and I can clip it all up in a bun with one of these clips.) I don&#x27;t love the coloring of the brown one - I would much prefer a solid color over the weird stripes - but I only wear these at home, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.</li>
    <li> These are really small, I was given a large one that looks identical to these, same brand and everything, but it is much larger and actually holds all my hair. It is really hard to tell from the picture and description that these are small not full size. Wish they would put a size on then.</li>
    <li> These are tiny. Not good for long hair. I can only really use these for clipping over a small half pony (half up, half down).</li>
    <li> I really love these clips for  my hair. While being somewhat small they seem to hold a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter is very pleased with these clips. She has extremely thick hair and these keep her hair in place.</li>
    <li> It easy to use and comfortable for the baby, especially if you have a long walk and cannot use a cart.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t hold my thick hair well.</li>
    <li> I generally like Scunci products, but these clips are just so-so. My hair is about five inches below my shoulder and fairly fine and these clips don&#x27;t really hold it up unless I use a lot of hairspray (which I rarely use). My fine hair seems to cause the clip to loosen it&#x27;s no-slip grip within minutes. Just doesn&#x27;t seem to grip my hair at all unless I put the hair bundled up with the clip on top of my head which is not a style I like for &amp;#34;going out.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> They are nice looking, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so small.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair, these are not for you. I had these before but they were larger, I had never seen any smaller ones before so I bought these assuming they were the same thing. These are smaller, I&#x27;d say these are medium compared to the large ones I had before. Still holds my hair up, but I need the extra support of a rubber band.</li>
    <li> I love these clips. I have long (mid-back), thick, fine hair and these are the only clips I&#x27;ve found that can hold it. The quality is very good - they&#x27;re durable and not flimsy (though I did have to replace my old ones after a couple years of use, not bad for $5!). Target stopped selling these so I had to get my fix on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Very solid clips. Works well if you have lots of hair. They should sell it in pack of 2 black, I won&#x27;t use the beige/brown one, not my taste, style and color...</li>
    <li> I needed something for bigger/thicker hair. This works great, I wear it every morning and night when I take off my makeup and sometimes wear them to work. Easy to use, durable, strong, and best of all they hold a-lot of long &amp; thick hair. Color is nice too, I like both patterns.</li>
    <li> Great product,  super fast delivery!</li>
    <li> love these! best hair clips I&#x27;ve ever ordered.</li>
    <li> The tortoise clip that I have received is NOT tortoise and not as pictured, it is ugly yellowish color with deep brown stripes. Went straight to trash! Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> These are smaller than they used to be, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I like this clip.  I think it could be a little more clear on the ad what the shape is, as I&#x27;d never bought an octopus clip previously, so I did not realize it was more round on the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; part...but as far as use, it holds my hair very well and everything looks as advertised, everything came in one piece.  I suppose I could have done better research on what the shape is, but I don&#x27;t usually like to have to research every item I buy online...who has time for that?  I would say the only reason a star is left off is because of that one issue, but it is a very small issue and I have no other complaints.</li>
    <li> I have owned several of these clips in two different sizes.  I have fairly thick hair, slightly wavy just past my shoulders and these work perfect for creating a bun.  I would first use a brown thin elastic ponytail holder, make a pony tail then twirl it and put one of these clips over the top.  They would stay all day like this.  The problem I have with these clips is the plastic is fairly thin where the metal spring clip connects in to the plastic tab and eventually the plastic tab breaks off and the whole clip falls apart.  They are not that inexpensive, so I am disappointed that they don&#x27;t last longer.  I agree with other reviewers - they don&#x27;t work well with thin hair or if you try to use them without a ponytail holder first but the no slip coating does work better than those without.  I keep buying these because they are the faster way to make a bun without using a million bobby pins.</li>
    <li> These are nice clips but one of mine broke with little use. I loved the size but they seem to have weak springs or plastic in the part you need to squeeze to open.</li>
    <li> Broke after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Broke easily but I really liked the small bun-like shape it made</li>
    <li> SUPER small hair clips. Don&#x27;t do a good job at all of holding up thick or long hair.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using these about 2 weeks now - great to get hair up out of the way in hot weather! The clips are somewhat compact in shape, sort of flattened out - they look better than other bulkier clips. The teeth have rubber coating inside so the hair is held securely. This would probably be helpful for those with fine/thin hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length and one of these clips is sufficient to hold 98% of my hair when twisted up.  The one drawback I can think of is that  the 2 pieces you squeeze together to open the clip are flat and smooth and make it a bit difficult to get a grip on it and open it when reaching around to the back of your head!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these hair clips.  They are so easy to use, and I love the fact that they don&#x27;t slip.  I had bought them years ago at the store, but couldn&#x27;t find them anymore.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  They are also very comfortable.  A lot better than the regular claw clips, that dig into my scalp.</li>
    <li> smaller than your large standard size clips</li>
    <li> Nice to find everything I need at Amazon!!! Great prices too!</li>
    <li> These were purchased to replace similar items that my wife has broken/lost over time. These seem to be similar good quality as those (same brand) they replace. In fact, the material seems &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34;, more flexible and less prone to breakage than earlier versions.</li>
    <li> I bought this set at Walmart. I liked the size and the shape of the clip, as it was different then most I have tried. It appeared to have a lot of room. I thought I had found a clip that would hold my thick, very long hair(just below middle of back).  It does NOT hold long and/or heavy hair, and the room it appears to have is deceiving. It wont grasp at the scalp to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addition: I found an item that does hold my hair in a Bun for ballet or a side-way twist, or pretty much any creativity you have.  I bought it at Discount Dance Supply and it is called a Jumbo Whirl by Style I think.  Its great!!!!</li>
    <li> I am picky about my clips, I have very thick hair and these no slip grips do the job. They are smaller than I thought so I use them together but I like them!</li>
    <li> These are MASSIVE, and I didn&#x27;t not expect it. Even all of my hair isn&#x27;t enough to fill these clips.</li>
    <li> Hold my hair up in a bun as intended. Like the 2 different colors on a pack for variety. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened, but these don&#x27;t seem to be as well made as the exact same Scunci clip purchased 3-4 years ago.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and very good quality... I highly recommend this item and encourage others to try it our too :)</li>
    <li> These are a lovely soft plastic that seems durable and not likely to shatter.  There are silicone grip strips inside that prevent he clip from sliding out of your hair, but magically doesn&#x27;t tug at your hair either.  These were a bit too big for me, I have very fine hair and I just don&#x27;t have enough to effectively fill this size of clip when it&#x27;s up in a bun, but my sister in law has medium thick curly hair, and I plan to give them to her.</li>
    <li> I have long, curly hair and used to use those narrow clips, but these are so much more comfortable!  They hold my hair better and don&#x27;t seem to pull on my hair as much as the others do.</li>
    <li> Great for thick, long hair.  Also, comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> Well constructed and stays put.  I have a lot of thick hair.  I am able to put half of my hair up.  No slipping or tugging.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hair clip. They aren&#x27;t as good as they used to be.</li>
    <li> It turns out there are two sizes of these ball-shaped clips.  The item description didn&#x27;t cover that, and what I got was two little bitty ones that won&#x27;t work for me.  :(</li>
    <li> The design makes it easy to hold a bun of hair into place, or even just a regular loop. I have fairly long hair and have no problem using these.</li>
    <li> Surprised how bad they hold my thin hair. Definitely not worth my money.  I am willing to pay for a good clip, these were not it.</li>
    <li> ..........great hair products.....WISH THEY WOULD COME IN SILVER AND WHITE !  some of us don&#x27;t color our hair. please ?</li>
    <li> no slip??? yes slip! Very easily slips off my hair and pulls my hair while doing so, there is a rubbery membrane sort of thing on the inner side of the claws, i&#x27;m guessing that makes it &amp;#34;no-slip&amp;#34;, but in all actuality it only makes it so its painful when it slips, and the brown one broke a few days after i received them</li>
    <li> Seriously, these clips are the best thing in the world. I have EXTREMELY thick, long hair and they are the only clip that works without falling out or breaking. I am glad I found them here on Amazon as they are getting hard to find locally.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this works well for me.  I put it in a pony tail holder first and then wrap my clip around it and it holds well.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are NOT the large size! I probably should have read more reviews before I purchased and &amp;#34;assumed&amp;#34; they were the same size as my broken one I had bought at my local store. Since I had moved I was in desperate need for my octopus clip and was excited to have found them online. I was slightly disappointed when I saw they were smaller than I expected. It does the job but I have medium thick hair to my shoulder blades and it just doesn&#x27;t clip with the same ease as my larger one. I would definitely buy again, just would get the larger size!</li>
    <li> I love these clips.  They have rubber on the inside that makes them a no slip grip.  It keeps it in your hair but is easy to remove without pulling hair.  Very inexpensive for the value!</li>
    <li> It has been really hard for me to replace my favorite claw clips as they break over time. I ordered these because they were as close to what I was looking for that I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: the inside is coated in a rubbery material that must help your hair stay put. I didn&#x27;t know that when ordering but it is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;the spring seems strong but not so strong that it is hard to open/you worry about it slamming closed and breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: I wish the pack contained 2 black clips. the paint on the brown one is not consistent and there are bubbles and missed areas. my hair will cover that but it seems like poor quality control.</li>
    <li> Love that they are made of more flexible plastic that doesn&#x27;t snap and break as easily as other hair clips I&#x27;ve had</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I had thought they were.  These are much cheaper in stores - for this price I expected the larger clips.</li>
