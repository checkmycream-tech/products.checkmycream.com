      <li>It&#x27;s more toothpaste-y tasting now and kind of makes me gag, unlike before.</li>

      <li>very happy, amazon was the only place i could find this toothpaste</li>
      <li>Frankly, I don&#x27;t like either of those flavors, so that leaves me with children&#x27;s bubble gum or Tom&#x27;s strawberry, neither too appealing.  </li>
      <li>It makes my mouth feel refreshing, and the taste is pretty good as well.  </li>
      <li>I have loved the citrus splash since it was first put out.</li>
      <li>but of course, I liked it so it was quickly discontinued.</li>
      <li>Completely worth buying him his own toothpaste and saving the tears for something I can&#x27;t control.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years, and it has significantly whitened my teeth, and leaves a nice clean feeling.</li>
      <li>easy</li>
      <li>so strong</li>
      <li>It can seem minty from the strong fluoride, but it has no mint or peppermint in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>but that is too sweet, and any &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stuff is off limits because I&#x27;m allergic to so many of those ingredients.</li>

      <li>Cleans teeth fine and contains everything That I want in a toothpaste</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very crisp and refreshing with NO mint taste.</li>
      <li>the product available.....</li>

      <li>For years I used AIM original, which they discontinued.</li>
      <li>Mouth feels clean afterwards without any burning feel mint pastes give.</li>
      <li>Grand kids generally think its OK with one saying its &amp;#34;to spicy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
      <li>Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels clean and fresh and tingly.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste.  It does a good job in cleaning my teeth and I really like the taste.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. Wal-Mart no longer offers it and now I have to purchase it online. I am not complaining as it cost me about $7.25 in the store and I picked up 6 tubes for alot cheaper. Even with 2 day delivery costs, it is cheaper.</li>
    <li> As someone who cannot use anything with mint, I love this. It can seem minty from the strong fluoride, but it has no mint or peppermint in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Have you ever stopped to take note of the fact that virtually every kind of toothpaste except kiddie stuff is mint flavored?  Good grief...talk about limited choices! This is the only toothpaste my daughter will use as she does not like the flavor of mint.  We looked at every tube of toothpaste in our local drug store and there was nothing else available.  If you don&#x27;t like the citrus, Crest also makes a cinnamon flavor.  She doesn&#x27;t like that either.  Amazon is the only place we are able to purchase this stuff, so if you&#x27;ve got a kid who doesn&#x27;t like mint but you still need a \\&quot;grown-up\\&quot; toothpaste, give this a shot.  Thanks Amazon...you&#x27;ve saved us a LOT of grief!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Crests citrus flavored toothpaste is very difficult to find.  When I am out and do run accross it I buy a lot...lately I haven&#x27;t been able to find any. Now I know it&#x27;s one click away.....easy</li>
    <li> First of all, I can&#x27;t believe I am writing a review about toothpaste.  Secondly, I can&#x27;t believe I actually buy toothpaste on line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is my all time favorite toothpaste.  I LOVE this stuff.  And I got tired of various grocery stores being out of it.  So, I bought a supply on Amazon and I am pretty sure I will continue to buy this stuff because there is no other flavor of toothpaste I like as much as this one.</li>
    <li> The only flavor my son likes. Just wish it came in flip top.  You would think citrus would be to sweet, but it does leave your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> How hard is it to create a toothpaste that isn&#x27;t your standard mint? Pretty damn hard, apparently, if you walk into most supermarkets, drug stores or other places with literally 50 toothpastes that do everything you could ask except for one: don&#x27;t taste like mint, spearmint, cool mint, dazzling mint, winter mint or excre-mint. Is it too much to ask to come up with a non-mint? Crest, you are my heroes.</li>
    <li> Does the whitening job well, and my kids love the taste of it, so they brush their teeth more readily.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. My whole life I&#x27;ve struggled with toothpaste because I don&#x27;t like mint flavor. Toothpaste usually makes me gag but not this flavor! I&#x27;ve been using this TP over a year and my teeth look better for sure.&lt;br /&gt;If you see it in stores, pick it up. Just don&#x27;t pay over $7 for one tube! I bought my tubes on sale for 99 cents at the store I work at. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 10-27-12:&lt;br /&gt;After a short disapearence, this tooth paste has been \\&quot;re-released\\&quot; and the box has been redesigned and I can find it much easier now. However, I think they slightly changed the formula! It&#x27;s more toothpaste-y tasting now and kind of makes me gag, unlike before. :/ so I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This beats all the mint and cinnamon flavored toothpastes hands down.  For some reason, it&#x27;s hard to find it in the Birmingham, AL area right now, so I was really glad to find it in bulk on Amazon so I could order enough to last me for awhile.  Jealous friends ordered some too once they saw what I got for the price.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it, cause I don&#x27;t like peppermint or mint much. Too bad the lemon isn&#x27;t made any longer, but this is good too.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing.  I&#x27;m not a huge mint fan, so this toothpaste has just enough mint, with a splash of orange taste.  It makes my mouth feel refreshing, and the taste is pretty good as well.  Definitely a good toothpaste to have if you aren&#x27;t a huge mint fan when it comes to toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really find this in stores. It is my favorite flavor.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the only place I can find this discontinued flavor so I bought what I could find.  I still have about 6 tubes.  My husband and I have used this for a while and though others have commented about the nasty taste, we love it.  It makes your mouth feel fresh.</li>
    <li> I have always had a curiously queasy stomach in the morning and mint-flavored toothpaste always exacerbated the problem. Thank goodness for Citrus Splash! Gets my teeth nice and clean with a fresh citrus flavor. It can be difficult to find in stores at times, so I was greatly relieved to find it here on Amazon. Definitely recommend trying this to anyone that isn&#x27;t a fan of mint or cinnamon. You don&#x27;t have to be shackled to the same old toothpaste flavors any longer! :)</li>
    <li> Remember the Crest orange? It was kind of spicy and a little gross. This is worse. Then they made the lemon, which was fantastic! I should have bought cases of it but of course, I liked it so it was quickly discontinued. For years I used AIM original, which they discontinued. It&#x27;s a conspiracy! The best thing I can say about this flavor is it doesn&#x27;t make me gag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is disgusting because the STRONG flavor lingers for a super long time. If I had to to do over again, I would have just stuck with Tom&#x27;s silly strawberry, because it has a mild taste that really goes away fast even though it&#x27;s way overpriced. This is the first time the reviews on Amazon have steered me wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to update this review and boost my rating from one star to three. Because I bought this much of it, I used this toothpaste and it took me a week to get used to it, but I did and it&#x27;s not bad at all. It&#x27;s a blast of flavor though and when I&#x27;m finished with it, I&#x27;m going back to Tom&#x27;s strawberry which isn&#x27;t a blast.</li>
    <li> No hint of mint in my mouth (as some reviewers said). Tastes like navel oranges, really does! Mouth feels clean afterwards without any burning feel mint pastes give. I have to wonder why this isn&#x27;t promoted more by Crest, it could really be a top-seller if more more people were aware it existed, every other adult paste is some form of minty something. I like mint chocolate chip ice-cream but not toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Remember how bad OJ tastes if you drink it after brushing your teeth with a mint toothpaste?  Not a problem with this toothpaste a great alternative to all the minty stuff out there!  My kids like it too.</li>
    <li> hard to find locally..USed to order alot but now the price is getting crazy nearly $5 tube!!! I can live with $2 tubes locally until they realize the need to perhaps lower the price...Great alternate taste to a &#x60;multi&#x60; tp but seriously high price for this considering &#x60;natural&#x60; (toms/burts bees etc) are in that price on their owm</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so buying it 6 packs at a time makes sense!  I love the citrus.</li>
    <li> I feel like toothpaste makers channel Henry Ford&#x27;s ghost, we can have any flavor at all as long as it&#x27;s mint!  If a mfr gets really edgy, you might even see a cinnamon flavor!  oooooh!  Frankly, I don&#x27;t like either of those flavors, so that leaves me with children&#x27;s bubble gum or Tom&#x27;s strawberry, neither too appealing.  This orange flavor comes along and woo-hoo, my taste buds no longer writhe in disgust at every back and forth of my toothbrush!  My wife found and bought the 6 pack for me, and depending on the &#x27;use by&#x27; date I might buy another.  I&#x27;d pay double or even triple the normal rate for this toothpaste, it&#x27;s a ray of orangey sunshine in a minty-cold brushing world.</li>
    <li> I hate the taste of mint--even in a toothpaste, so this is great. The orange taste is refreshing, without being overwhelming. Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever found that isn&#x27;t mint flavored, but stores just don&#x27;t carry it.  Mint makes me gag, so this is a wonderful find - so glad to have found this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I was already a user of this product but previously purchased from local big brick and mortar retailers. It&#x27;s the exact same thing you get from the store. Makes my teeth all shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> My husband HATES mint.  He won&#x27;t even brush his teeth when the only toothpaste available to him is mint.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find my favorite vanilla flavored toothpaste ANYWHERE, and I can only find this orange toothpaste online now.  -___-  Thank goodness Amazon has it at a decent price!  And the toothpaste is great.  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Same as you buy at the local store.</li>
    <li> I hate the burnin of regular mint flavored toothpastes. This is like perfect, I&#x27;m in love. Bought for 2$ at Walmart.</li>
    <li> My husband and I cannot stand the minty toothpastes. It is really hard to find something palatable that does not cause us to up-chuck. We had tried another Orange flavored brand and tossed it the first time we tried it. It tasted like barf. This toothpaste tastes good and non-minty toothpastes are hard to find!!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is excellent because it has all the benefits of Crest without the stinging flavor.  I prefer a paste without the excess mint so strong it winds up stinging my tongue and gums.  The flavor is great and I brush more now.</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t taste like chalk. Cleans teeth fine and contains everything That I want in a toothpaste</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great value price.  I would do it again without any questions.</li>
    <li> Man I hope i can use all this paste before it expires! I hate mint. HATE. This is a great alternative. The fact that it&#x27;s so hard to find is really annoying. I&#x27;m glad I found it here and will gladly pay a little more. I just wish I could buy one box at a time.</li>
    <li> Love that there&#x27;s an alternative to using Mint!</li>
    <li> NASTY TASTE. It&#x27;s not just citrus, it&#x27;s citrus and mint. if you want/need a mint-free toothpaste, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> It can be very difficult to find a good quality toothpaste for the person who just doesn&#x27;t care for mint.  Most toothpastes out there are some variety of mint, with an occasional variant of hot cinnamon.  This is a citrus flavor, which my son prefers, and I know that Crest toothpaste products are effective.  It can also be very difficult to find these variants in your local store, so it makes sense for us to buy it online, in bulk.  Thanks, Crest and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this flavor of toothpaste but can&#x27;t find it locally.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to go back to the gross mint flavored toothpastes since I tried this product. I actually like to brush my teeth now and it seems less of a chore.     They used to sell this in lemon flavor as well, but that disappeared before the supply of the orange flavored product started dwindling. I spent a few months last year looking for this toothpaste in local establishments. I would find a couple of boxes once in while and buy &#x27;em up. Not sure why they are not selling them in stores anymore. At least not where I live.</li>
    <li> Mint toothpaste makes me nauseous and as Crest discontinued their lemon and green tea products I was in trouble.  I found this on Amazon and took a chance and am very satisfied. I hope they continue it as I have heard rumors that it was going the way of the others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a refreshing alternative to all the mint flavor toothpaste which I don&#x27;t like.  It should be sold in stores also like it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many people who don&#x27;t like minty toothpaste, so I hope Crest continue to offer flavored toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite toothpaste and I can no longer find it in stores regularly. During my pregnancy I had an aversion to all minty toothpastes and this was the only one that didn&#x27;t make me sick. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Santa brings my 6 year old son a pack of this every two years because he hates mint toothpaste.  Completely worth buying him his own toothpaste and saving the tears for something I can&#x27;t control.</li>
    <li> I love this Crest toothpaste that promises to whiten teeth while offering an&lt;br /&gt;amazing citrus flavor! I ran out of my last tube and at the time Amazon did not&lt;br /&gt;have the product available.....patience is a virtue. I received an email from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon that I could now order the product and I did so immediately, quantity of 6.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I will always have access to Crest Citrus Splash and will make certain to&lt;br /&gt;have faith in alerts from Amazon regarding notifications of when the products are&lt;br /&gt;available to order because this has been successful on many occasions.  My teeth&lt;br /&gt;are happy, I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;m so very very happy with Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Our family got hooked on the citrus orange toothpaste years ago.  We were able to buy it at Giant food and CVS.  However, none of those locations sell it anymore.  I buy it online through Amazon and get 6 at a time.</li>
    <li> FOR ME THIS IS THE BEST STUFF, HARD TO FIND, NO PROBLEMS AT THE DENTIST</li>
    <li> Not the worst tooth paste I&#x27;ve used, but not the best. I like the flavoring, but doesn&#x27;t whiten as much as my old brand did. For the price I paid and getting six it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to menthol so this is the only toothpaste I can use that is not kids&#x27; bubblegum flavor or &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; that tastes bad because it has fennel in it.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love this toothpaste! In fact, we fought over the last bit in the tube as we weren&#x27;t able to find any more in the stores. I don&#x27;t have a problem with mint toothpaste- but the citrus flavor is so much better!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste ever,it makes you want to brush your teeth like 7 times a day. The taste is delicious, you almost want to eat it, after brushing you feel your mouth fresh without beeing minty like most toothpastes. Recommended 100% to all customers.</li>
    <li> This is the best quality product of its type that we can find. If you&#x27;re looking for a name brand, high quality, easily accessible toothpaste that works for pretty much everybody in the family, this is is. Especially if you can&#x27;t stand minty flavors, this is one of the few options out there. I like the more natural alternative brands better, but this product often wins out where the quality and value axes cross.</li>
    <li> This is literally the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve used since I found it years ago. It&#x27;s hard to find, but Meijer seems to have it at some locations as well. It&#x27;s very crisp and refreshing with NO mint taste. Very tasty- nothing like the toothpaste you&#x27;re used to!</li>
    <li> even though it&#x27;s orange flavored it does have a hint of mint. they used to have a pure orange flavor. not sure what happened to it.</li>
    <li> I HATE mint.  For years have struggled to find a toothpast that didnt make me discusted.  While pregnant I had/have a hard time brushing my teeth.  I could no longer find this in stores as of about 5 years ago.  So happy I can buy it online now.  It has made this pregnancy go WAY smoother!</li>
    <li> I found this toothpaste last year at our local Wegman&#x27;s. My kids loved it! My son has  a sensory disorder where certain tastes, textures, smells can send him gagging from the room , and he&#x27;s 20! It&#x27;s better than when he was little but still challenging because he cannot handle any minty toothpastes. My problem is that I&#x27;ve developed a sensitivity to minty toothpaste which causes blisters in my mouth. My dentist said they are chemical burns and for people with lots of allergies (like me) that this is pretty common. You can imagine my frustration, then, when our local store stopped carrying this toothpaste. Yeah, there&#x27;s kiddie toothpaste but that is too sweet, and any &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stuff is off limits because I&#x27;m allergic to so many of those ingredients. I am so very grateful that I found this toothpaste on Amazon. I am not exaggerating when I say that I would cry if the company stopped making this. I really don&#x27;t want to use baking soda like my doctor said I might have to use. This flavor is not for everybody, that&#x27;s for sure, but it&#x27;s great to my family.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a toothpaste in the store that is not minty.  This has a definite citrus taste and doesn&#x27;t seem to be on the shelf at my local store.  It is comparable to an Aquafresh Citrus toothpaste that also seems to have been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. It tastes so good and the kids want to use it.</li>
    <li> It is toothpaste.  Nothing to it really.  The taste is fine and the price seems good.  I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s the best whitening bit.</li>
    <li> Have troubler finding this locally - thanks</li>
    <li> Great tasting toothpaste!!!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, I hate mint flavored toothpastes.  Qty 6 is a bit much but I probably have a lifetime supply now.  :)  Guess it wasn&#x27;t a retail hit, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  THANKS!!</li>
    <li> I have always disliked the taste of mint and often have to rely on getting kids toothpaste just to avoid it. But I like this citrus flavor.</li>
    <li> I have loved the citrus splash since it was first put out. I had to order it through amazon once before because suddenly I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Now again!!! Crest needs to keep making this product.It has to be popular or I would be able to find it easier.</li>
    <li> If you want something different than Mint this is your toothpaste</li>
    <li> very happy, amazon was the only place i could find this toothpaste</li>
    <li> I tried Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening + Scope Citrus Splash Flavor toothpaste after seeing it listed on Amazon. I have to wonder why this Crest flavor can&#x27;t be purchased in retail stores, in addition to all the Spearmints, Peppermints and other minty flavors. If you like the flavor of orange, this is a great tasting toothpaste and it leaves your mouth feeling great.</li>
    <li> Only toothpaste my son really likes. He doesn&#x27;t like mint. Can&#x27;t find it in stores near me any more</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like mint flavored toothpaste because of the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; feeling. This product has a nice citus orange flavor with the scope benefits without out the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; involved. The pack of six was a great way to purchase also so I don&#x27;t  run out. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years, and it has significantly whitened my teeth, and leaves a nice clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Son love&#x27;s it, can&#x27;t buy it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Since stupid f--king Walmart&#x27;s not selling the only toothpaste I can deal w/having in my mouth on it&#x27;s shelves anymore...I have to order it now on the internet...  It&#x27;s perfectly adequate toothpaste w/a lovely orangy taste.  I&#x27;ve read that kids like it...whatever.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the only orange flavor toothpaste hat you can find. So if you don&#x27;t like mint toothpastes, that&#x27;s the right product for you. Tastes great and does its job great!!!</li>
    <li> My son will only use this Citrus flavor to brush his teeth, now the whole family enjoy using it. Much more refreshing then mint!!!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like mint taste in the morning. It makes me gag ,so I looked for something different and found this. The taste is great.</li>
    <li> Sent to my mom in California.  She can no longer get out to shop.  She will be 99.</li>
    <li> When this first came out it just sounded gross to the hubby &amp; me. I&#x27;m not sure why we tried it but I think it was maybe a sample that we got because it was all that was available. Now its all we use. He does still use his Listerine. Its getting very hard to find locally. Grand kids generally think its OK with one saying its &amp;#34;to spicy&amp;#34;. No cavities unlike when I tried Justins for 6 months. Crest kid all my adult life and that was the only time I had cavities.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like mint. Most toothpaste has mint in it.  What a dilemma.  But now I can get fresh breath, with a nice citrus paste.  My mouth feels clean and fresh and tingly.  And, it&#x27;s crest, so I trust it to prevent cavities and keep my teeth healthy and white.</li>
    <li> Yes, there is some mint in it but it is tolerable for me. I find I cannot tolerate alote of mint taste in toothpaste.</li>
