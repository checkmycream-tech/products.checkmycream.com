    <li> Bristles became twisted and bent after only a few uses. Too cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Not as good as Dr West but you just can&#x27;t find these anymore -- bristles are a little soft but would buy again and the service was FAST!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s 4.25 inches long and skinny. It doesn&#x27;t fit into any of my toothbrush holders without having the bristles touch the hardware.  It&#x27;s too small for my hand to use comfortably.  The heads are good.  I&#x27;m trying to replace an Oral B that evidently isn&#x27;t made any more and I now have four new ones that don&#x27;t work for me.  I can&#x27;t find them in stores either.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because the wrong one was sent to me and I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> Yep!  That&#x27;s why I bought it.  This brush would have to sit out in full view.  I needed eye candy in my beautiful, newly renovated bathroom.  It is much shorter than the usual denture brush you see--and the brush part is less substantial.  So far, though, my husband has not dragged back the old, clunky, bright blue brush this one replaced.  And for him, that is satisfactory approval.</li>
    <li> I have been seeking a replacement brush that is the same as my old old brush. All other new brushes I have found are too soft the remove anything from a denture. This brush has hard bristles that clean quickly and with ease. Love It!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush with a thin enough handle to fit in our toothbrush holders.  This fits, but the handle is so short that it is for occasional use, not everyday.</li>
    <li> a good purchase as the price was right and sent to my door quickly</li>
    <li> Hard to hold the brush.it is little small  but the price is is right for the size</li>
    <li> U have had a few different Brushes from the one the Dentist gave me for my New Dentures and have bought at the Store several types LOVE this one better than any am buying more!  I can&#x27;t be without a decent good brush.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Some of the partial brushes are way to big but this is just the size I was looking for and this size is hard to find.Its small and way easier to use.</li>
    <li> The Denture Brush that I received is smaller then the old one. But I can still use it even if the handle is shorter.</li>
    <li> Arrived on Thursday, Aug 20, 2015.</li>
    <li> I use the brush for woodcarving. My old brush had a longer handle and stiffer pointer brush on the short side it was also wider than this one.</li>
    <li> Good name brand. High quality and it was a pretty color too.&lt;br /&gt;I have been unable to find  this brand in stores so I&#x27;m glad&lt;br /&gt;I can get it on line.</li>
    <li> Great does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Very satusfued,. Especially the light color and shape of brush..</li>
    <li> Very good, inexpensive brush! Bought 5 for my wife &amp;amp; I. 4 lasted 20 months. On the last one &amp;amp; ready to re-order. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> The denture brush that I ordered I expected to be like the one I currently use...the head was OK but the handle is half as long as my brush at home.  I have been trying to replace it for over a year.  Would like any advice you can give me.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the denture brushes. been looking for them for years. will definitely get more when I need them.</li>
    <li> Does not deserve a star....worthless!</li>
    <li> Much too small.  Not at all what I expected.  Would not recommend</li>
