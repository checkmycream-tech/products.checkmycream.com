<li> I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it, but it isn&#x27;t worth a higher price</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s the first winter in 20 years that I have not had trouble with painfully dry, cracked hands.</li>
<li> It lasts forever and so much easier than filling the small bottle that was attached.</li>
<li> It is a little bit more expensive but also lasts a lot longer than regular soap.</li>
<li> Though it&#x27;s expensive, the scent leaves my hands smelling fresh, not medicinal or perfumey!  </li>
<li> I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
<li> the olive oil helps moisturize my hands so they don&#x27;t dry out when I&#x27;m washing my hands a while preparing meals.  </li>
<li> if you can find it for less than method or close to same price</li>
<li> I say his because I have ordered from other sites and they were not new &amp; think water was added..</li>
<li> Still haven&#x27;t tried any other scents.</li>
<li> Only complaint is that the cap was loose on one of the bottles and the contents leaked out causing a real mess when received.  </li>
<li> The picture of this is a little deceiving as it looks like it could be a gallon of soap</li>
<li> In addition, the bottle was missing about 1/5 of the product because the lid was not on tightly.  </li>
<li> Heading says &amp;#34;Hand Wash Soap Refill Sanguinelli Orange and Fennel&amp;#34;, but we received &amp;#34;Fruits and Passion DISH DETERGENT&amp;#34;, so not a very potent orange scent.</li>
<li> I would like to try some of the other scents, but like this one so much, I&#x27;m afraid to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Still</li>
<li> We keep this soap in our guest bathroom and everybody loves it; and I mean everybody!</li>
<li> I was so disappointed when I ran out, thinking I&#x27;d never find it again!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it - smells so clean and fresh</li>
    <li> I have tried the Cucina coriander and olive oil liquid soap.  However, I decided to try this scent to see if I liked it any better.  It is okay but not great.  I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it, but it isn&#x27;t worth a higher price so I will stick with the olive oil and coriander in the future.</li>
    <li> purchased this to refill my smaller pump at the sink</li>
    <li> Heading says &amp;#34;Hand Wash Soap Refill Sanguinelli Orange and Fennel&amp;#34;, but we received &amp;#34;Fruits and Passion DISH DETERGENT&amp;#34;, so not a very potent orange scent. In addition, the bottle was missing about 1/5 of the product because the lid was not on tightly.  Everything in the box with this was soap-covered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now. It&#x27;s a good soap, and a nice smell that removes kitchen odors from your hands such as garlic and onions. Very highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promise..bottle was sealed &amp; new..I say his because I have ordered from other sites and they were not new &amp; think water was added..wonderful product been using Cucina products for years and LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> We keep this soap in our guest bathroom and everybody loves it; and I mean everybody! Us too of course, it&#x27;s high quality and smells great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my kitchen sink. We have it connected by a tube we bought at Lowes to the soap dispenser that is part of the sink hardware. It lasts forever and so much easier than filling the small bottle that was attached.</li>
    <li> Really like the smell and leaves your hands fresh and clean. Buying the refills is a better deal. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Only complaint is that the cap was loose on one of the bottles and the contents leaked out causing a real mess when received.  The shipper should have taken better precautions.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this hand soap and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands. Love the lotion too! Fresh scent!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands. It isn&#x27;t overly scented, so I don&#x27;t need to worry about it giving me a headache.</li>
    <li> Love this hand soap! It was given to me as a gift and I love it! I use it in the kitchen. It has olive oil in it and does not dry your hands out. Love it!!!! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Best price around also.</li>
    <li> I love the natural scent of this soap &amp; it cleans without over drying my hands. I used it through this last winter and it&#x27;s the first winter in 20 years that I have not had trouble with painfully dry, cracked hands. I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> It might not be the least expensive hand wash, but you don&#x27;t need very much and it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Beautiful smell ..... Very condensed and you won&#x27;t need a lot to wash your hands.</li>
    <li> a little pricey but a nice luxury i walk around smelling my hands after washing and it lasts a while too</li>
    <li> i absolutely adore this soap. This particular scent - orange and fennel smells amazing! I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my hands. This soap is gentle and does not dry out your hands like most hand soaps. I will not buy any other kind and highly recommend this line.</li>

    <li> This is the best hand soap I have found, thus far.  Cucina is a great product, and I have ordered it numerous times before.  Always quick delivery,and product is always in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! It&#x27;s fresh and makes your hands feel super clean. We keep ordering it!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t recommend this over method - which is about 1/3 the price. if you can find it for less than method or close to same price then yes purchase it.</li>
    <li> Originally i received this hand wash as a hostess gift from a friend.  I was so disappointed when I ran out, thinking I&#x27;d never find it again!  Lo &amp; behold it was available on Amazon!  Though it&#x27;s expensive, the scent leaves my hands smelling fresh, not medicinal or perfumey!  And my skin feels soft and smooth!  Definitely worth the splurge.  I would like to try some of the other scents, but like this one so much, I&#x27;m afraid to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Still in love with this stuff!  I have bought it four times.  Still haven&#x27;t tried any other scents.</li>
    <li> this is a great soap for the kitchen!  it smells so fresh and clean and the olive oil helps moisturize my hands so they don&#x27;t dry out when I&#x27;m washing my hands a while preparing meals.  my husband loves it too!</li>
    <li> over priced but effective and smells good.</li>
    <li> This is a new flavor for us to try as we&#x27;ve been repeat buyers of the Sicilian lemon one.  I equally like this scent, and even my husband made an &#x27;ooohhh&#x27; sound when he used it for the first time - so obviously this one is a winner in our household.  I&#x27;ve been happy with all the Cucina washes - albeit, they are pricey, but the refills offer a better value and you can&#x27;t beat the luxurious feel of this hand wash and wonderful scents.</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.  The smell is very pleasing but not over powering</li>
    <li> Nice scent, helps to clean and deodorize hands after food prep. I actually prefer the scent of the Sicilian lemon/Ginger but it wasn&#x27;t available at the time of my purchase</li>
    <li> I keep this nice soap and lotion in my kitchen and bathroom. Smells great and is concentrated, seems to last longer than my other liquid soaps.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and it is the correct item.</li>
    <li> I love that there is a refill for my favorite soap that I seem to go through often.  It is enough that it will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Cucina&#x27;s Sanguinelli Orange and Fennel has  a clean, crisp orange scent enhanced by a hint of fennel.  Like all Cucina products, it is mild and safe to use frequently.  I keep it by the kitchen sink, and hope I never have to do without this great product.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this soap, and I like it as well. No store close to us stocks it, so it was nice to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This soap has a pleasant and subtle orange scent.  I would compare it to L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Shea Butter soap, but Cucina is a little thinner in texture and a more subtle scent (I prefer L&#x27;Occitane, but my wife likes Cucina better -- so we compromised and got Cucina). Does not dry out your hands.</li>
    <li> The Fennel hand wash is a staple in my kitchen.  It is the best hand soap that I have used.  I would highly recommend it.  My sister loved it also--so I shared some with her.</li>
