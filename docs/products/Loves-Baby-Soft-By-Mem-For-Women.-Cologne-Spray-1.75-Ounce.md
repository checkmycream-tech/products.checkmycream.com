      <li>Has more of a chemical smell than I recall, but it&#x27;s still pretty close.</li>

      <li>Very soft &amp; light fragance.</li>
      <li>First of all, the color was off.</li>
      <li>Exactly as promised.</li>
      <li>this was the first perfume I bought.</li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t really understand why so much?</li>
      <li>and I always end up paying so much for it because of postage.  </li>
      <li>She uses way to much since it comes out fast.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell at all like it used to.  The fragrance smells old and not fresh?  I was very disappointed as this used to be my all time favorite.  :(</li>
    <li> Loved it in high school and was nostalgic for that light scent of clean and baby powder. The initial alcohol smell wears off and leaves that baby soft scent lingering on your skin. This is best sprayed directly on skin instead of clothes.</li>
    <li> This item did not smell the way I remember it from the 70s.  I still have worn it by applying it very passively.  It smells mostly like the light baby powder scent I always enjoyed but has an undertone that I do not recall from the original fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume for years.  It has a very soft smell like baby powder.  If you are like me and can&#x27;t take those strong perfumes.  I&#x27;ve had several compliments on it smelling good too.</li>
    <li> When I was in jr high school  this was the first perfume I bought. I love the scent. I was sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it. I was really surprised  and happy when I saw it on amazon.</li>
    <li> i just love the smell. so fresh.</li>
    <li> Lid was broken into pieces upon arrival.</li>
    <li> What a nice powdery smell. Just as good as when my siblings and I were teens. They were very happy to receive such a nostalgic gift!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I found this fragrance on Amazon, although I&#x27;m not surprised though, Amazon is the best website for whatever you&#x27;re looking for. I used to use Love&#x27;s Baby Soft when I was a teenager, 35 yrs. ago, and was always drowning myself in it because I absolutely loved the smell!! It was a combination of baby powder and a fresh flowery smell, just like I imagined a teenager should smell. Every morning, before I walked to the bus stop, I would give myself ten sprays from the bottle and start my day, it always made me happy. When I found and ordered it online, it came within two days, perfectly packaged, just like I remembered, and when I opened it up and sprayed it on me, it was heavenly and brought me back to my high school days, such a wonderful time in my life, and so many great memories, especially of my Love&#x27;s Baby Soft! Next item I&#x27;m going to purchase is the perfume I used when I graduated from the Love&#x27;s Baby Soft, which, believe it or not, was Love&#x27;s Lemon!! Looking forward to experiencing even more happy memories with that one!!</li>
    <li> Great scent if you like one that is light and sweet. Maybe from the 60&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s sweetness is timeless.</li>
    <li> Always my mom&#x27;s favorite!</li>
    <li> Nasty smelling, does NOT smell anything like the original. I would send it back but costs too much to send it back.</li>
    <li> The order was shipped quickly.  The fragrance remains the soft, pleasant frangrance that it has always been.  It is pleasant and well-received by those who have fragance sensitivities.</li>
    <li> I love Loves Baby Soft and have worn it for many years.  The only bad thing about this product is it is soooo hard to find in any local stores and I always end up paying so much for it because of postage.  Just wish I could find it locally.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old and still love Love&#x27;s Baby soft.  I started using this as a teenager.  My mother said I would grow out of it, but I never have.  It has such a light fragrance, not overpowering.  I&#x27;ve receive several complements on this fragrance.  Yes it smells like baby powder, but with light floral notes.  It is a light fragrance for those that would like to wear a perfume that is not strong and overpowering.  For those of all ages.</li>
    <li> A nice light smell. Great for everyday use.  would Buy again</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance since High School!!!  Love it...</li>
    <li> When you first spray on some of this perfume it almost has a floral fragrance. But give it a few minutes and it turns warm and powdery. You can&#x27;t help but feel cozy when wearing this fragrance. You can spray it all over to make your skin smell like fresh soap. This is one of the perfumes my husband doesn&#x27;t complain about when I wear it. He thinks everything else I use is too strong. So this might be a good option if you usually get headaches from other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> My 12 yr old daughter loves this.  This one is a continuos spray.  Which is the only reason why I gave it a 4.  She uses way to much since it comes out fast.  It smells so good though</li>
    <li> This scent is definitely NOT the scent I used years ago!  The bottle looked used &amp; the color was a dark pink!  I would NEVER buy this again!! Thank goodness it was only $10</li>
    <li> I love loves. I was running low and ordered this. First of all, the color was off. Purple vs pink. It smells like loves perfume that has sat on the shelf for about 10 years. not nice at all</li>
    <li> For some reason this does not at all smell like the original. I would have sent it back but I had thrown the box away.</li>
    <li> This is not the same Love&#x27;s Baby Soft that so many of us bought back in our teens. It smells nothing like it. This stuff stinks! It&#x27;s reminiscent of bug repellent, with a chemical smell. I would strongly discourage anyone from spending a cent on this!</li>
    <li> Miss this oldie but goodie.  You can get it at Amazon.  Still very good.</li>
    <li> I remember using this as a teenager and I still love this cologne...It is not over powering...Just perfect!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> love the fragrance but not long lasting</li>
    <li> Good as ever! It was a gift.</li>
    <li> The nozzle on the last three that I have purchased gets clogged. You have to take the cap off and rinse in hot water to get it to work again. Not a huge issue but certainly and inconvenience when running late.</li>
    <li> Lots of memories come back wearing this. It&#x27;s soft and baby powdery smelling. Just so nice and dedicate. A nice day time scent</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it should!  Smells old.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, who loved it in when she was young, but didn&#x27;t smell like she remembered. They don&#x27;t let you return it citing for some reason it can&#x27;t be put back in thee mail, so beware.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells the same as it did 30 years ago. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s impossible to put it on too strong. It makes me happy when I spray it on, and I don&#x27;t worry it will be like a real perfume and make someone else get a headache.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a gentle little spray of happy.</li>
    <li> Okay... Okay. I am too darn old for this, I know it. But I still love the stuff and wear it to bed. It actually soothes me to sleep!</li>
    <li> Very soft &amp; light fragance. Similar to Baby Powder. Don&#x27;t smell like alcohol or strong chemicals. It stays for long periods of time but it can vary dependiing our body chemistry I think.  I wear it during the morning for work and evenings. This is my 3rd order.</li>
    <li> Now I have my daughter wearing it. This a perfect fragrance for a little girl. This bottle will last for months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old lady, not a baby. But this scent still makes me feel clean and feminine. I like it.</li>
    <li> Instant time machine to high school crushes on the soccer boy, walks in central park, drama rehearsals, fun times that were not fraught with the perils of being an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than smell like a flashback in public at my age, I&#x27;ll spray a t shirt in this and sleep in it from time to time to be transported back to high school. Not quite the same as the original which is why I gave it 4 stars; i found a bottle a few years ago that was a dead ringer. Formula may have changed, slightly. Still, this scent will really take you there.</li>
    <li> always love !!!!! the smell is soooo wonderful and summery I always like adding it to my cologne collection in the summer. does look smaller than pictured. so make sure you know what size you are ordering.  I made the mistake of orering a smaller size for a bigger price......</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND DELIVERY!</li>
    <li> I used to use this stuff in high school (been at least 15 years). I don&#x27;t feel it is much different then and now. It&#x27;s light fragrance and not over powering.</li>
    <li> Has more of a chemical smell than I recall, but it&#x27;s still pretty close.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very close to the original but it isn&#x27;t bad. Something nice and light to put on after an evening shower.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. It is not overpowering. Very soft and gentle fragrance. I have had many compliments and no negative reviews from friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance since I was a little girl and still love it!! I will definitely purchase another bottle of it!</li>
    <li> Best fragance ever fir girls. Fresh!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, light scent that is still relevant and ideal today.  It is good for the younger crowd and is not obsolete with the older crowd.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected, I was not in the least disappointed.  Reminded me of Jr. High and High School.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites! Will buy again</li>
    <li> What a blast from the past! For those of us who just can&#x27;t let go!</li>
    <li> I used this when I was in high school over 20 years ago.  I loved the smell then and I still do.  It makes you smell good, but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  It is a very feminine teen fragrance.  I bought this for my daughter to use, and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my niece.  Unfortunately, I mistakenly had it sent to my address instead of my mothers.  So I had to order a second bottle shipped to my location, figuring I could just return the extra bottle.  Unfortunately, while Amazon can ship it, perfume is considered a hazardous material, and cannot be returned.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff since I was young. Soft, clean powdery scent.</li>
    <li> Products are top of the line! All arrived as promised :)</li>
    <li> This item arrived in a damaged box, and the perfume smelled awful.  I threw it out.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent!  I, too, wore this fragrance in high school.  I am a Philosophy, AMAZING GRACE, girl......but, sometimes I like to mix it up with a scent that is just as light and natural....LOVES BABY SOFT is a perfect alternative.  It&#x27;s not easy to find so I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> The only perfume I wear and I am 52 years of age.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent. The only caution is it does spray a lot, just like another reviewer noted. I  would order it again though and I am just careful when I spray it.</li>
    <li> Arrived On Time and Un-Damaged. Exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> Ordered 3 bottles of Loves and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the purchase! The packaging was great and the scent was just like I remembered from when I was little. I will definitely re order when I run low!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores. Wonderful soft clean fresh scent. So happy I foundbit on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I got this for my young niece for Christmas because I know young girls like it, like I did.  I remember it back in the good old days at the drug store.  It was so popular with my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for this product in stores. Not easy to find. I do love the scent !</li>
    <li> I remember when I used to buy this for $1.00 now its 8 to 12 bucks wow have we changed! I can&#x27;t really understand why so much?</li>
