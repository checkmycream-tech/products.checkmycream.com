      <li>My hair is very fine - this boosted it up and and felt like I had a lot of hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, but I have had much better results from a $2.97 bottle of thickening mousse than I did with this product.</li>

      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Cheap foam volumizers work better.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve been so happy with every product I&#x27;ve tried from this line.</li>
      <li>I was all excited after reading some good reviews, but the product does absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
      <li>AS I HAVE FINE HAIR</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it will do and keeps my hair looking and feeling more healthy than it ever has before.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick too!</li>
      <li>I use it with lifting foam at the roots of course and then smooth a dab of this at the ends.</li>
      <li>I have used many hair volumizing products and this is the same as most, nothing outstanding.  </li>
      <li>So happy I am finally spending my money on something that really works.  </li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t need much!!</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair that&#x27;s not colored or permed.</li>
      <li>Like most other reviewers, I have very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair which was even thinner in the aftermath of recent surgery and Living Poof</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>Having no idea how it actually makes that happen, I am gratefully using it each day and recommend it without hesitation as an outstanding addition to any type of hair.</li>
      <li>Really liking this product!</li>
      <li>it was a waste of good money.</li>
      <li>I have short, fine hair</li>
      <li>i have used many products on my thin hair and most without much luck.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Living Proof.</li>
      <li>For all the hype and the price, I expected more.</li>
      <li>I did use it about 6-8 times, and there are much better thickening products out there for less money.</li>
      <li>Overall, pretty satisfied, but not really the miracle cream it is advertised to be.</li>
      <li>I found I needed to use twice as much as specified to get even modest results.</li>
      <li>The product does not work...and makes hair greasy,if hair is greasy then it will be even more limp and lifeless...</li>
      <li>or it does weight fine hair down.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this being that it was developed at MIT</li>
      <li>Believe me this is not a waste of your money.  </li>
      <li>I agree with some of the reviewers who said the product doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down - that was true for me too, but it gave me no feeling of increased fullness, thickness or volume.  </li>
      <li>The body which is gives to my hair is different from any other product I have used as it feels so naturally full and not stiff or coated.  </li>
      <li>I have used other products that increased my hair&#x27;s volume, but I found that most left my hair dry and brittle.</li>
      <li>Be sure to use a very small amount; the first time I used a small amount (not VERY small) and my hair felt yucky.</li>
      <li>, maybe I expected too much.  </li>
      <li>Have to be careful not to use too much</li>

<li> WELL WITHOUT GETTING HEAVY.</li>
<li> Mine is also stick straight and thin (poor me!).  </li>
<li> Not up to the hype.......left my hair feeling thick, yucky, and gunky.  </li>
<li> Not good at all no results</li>
<li> and I really was very disappointed.</li>
<li> but I was really disappointed.  </li>

    <li> I have very fine hair, but I have had much better results from a $2.97 bottle of thickening mousse than I did with this product. For all the hype and the price, I expected more. I found I needed to use twice as much as specified to get even modest results. I did use it about 6-8 times, and there are much better thickening products out there for less money.</li>
    <li> Not up to the hype.......left my hair feeling thick, yucky, and gunky.  Tried using varying amounts but did not seem to matter.&lt;br /&gt;Am disappointed.......given that Living Proof Full line of shampoos and conditioners are excellent.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Love Love Love this product.  Thanks Living Proof.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair a lot &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; feeling after I blow dry it out. Love it</li>
    <li> The product does not work...and makes hair greasy,if hair is greasy then it will be even more limp and lifeless...</li>
    <li> Hair thickening cream.  It was okay, maybe I expected too much.  I&#x27;m still looking</li>
    <li> This product definitely worked for me. For those of you who didn&#x27;t see results: try applying it before blow drying (I blow dry my hair upside down to increase volume). This cream has given my hair thickness that doesn&#x27;t feel gross. I have used other products that increased my hair&#x27;s volume, but I found that most left my hair dry and brittle. This product doesn&#x27;t do that at all, and it also smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference with using this product. Which is pretty disappointing factoring in the pricey cost of this product. Oh well, you win some and you lose some!</li>
    <li> I am a sucker to try every new product out there claiming to thicken hair, and this is no exception!  The sad truth is, for all you fellow fine and thin haired people...if you weren&#x27;t born with it, you will never have it!  Save your money on all those thickening products, and take a vacation, or buy yourself something to make you happy! I feel taken, having fallen once again, for some magazine hype on how to improve thinning hair. Learn from my mistake. The only thing this product did was cause my hair to tangle.  Cheap foam volumizers work better.</li>
    <li> I was all excited after reading some good reviews, but the product does absolutely nothing for me.  I have short, fine hair and I really was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used many hair volumizing products and this is the same as most, nothing outstanding.  Be sure to use a very small amount; the first time I used a small amount (not VERY small) and my hair felt yucky.</li>
    <li> This is the worst stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair that&#x27;s not colored or permed. I thought I&#x27;d try this being that it was developed at MIT but they didn&#x27;t create a very good product. This cream left my hair feeling greasy and heavy...there was not much body or lift and when I tried to curl my hair the curl immediately fell of my hair. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I&#x27;ll be returning this product it was a waste of good money.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything on the market for my hair --- This stuff along with the living proof root lifting spray is all I need -  I decided to try it on a whim.  I read the reviews and thought maybe just maybe this will do the job-  It acts as a detangler too -  My hair is very fine - this boosted it up and and felt like I had a lot of hair.  It is so wonderful.  I will never be without it -  So happy I am finally spending my money on something that really works.  I can fix my  hair anyway I want too - It is like getting a permanent without the frizz.  This stuff works -  my hair looks like it is in tip top condition -  Believe me this is not a waste of your money.  Merry Christmas !!!</li>
    <li> Really liking this product! Be careful to use only a very very small amount as directed- you don&#x27;t need much!!</li>
    <li> This is one amazing product!  I have very fine hair which was even thinner in the aftermath of recent surgery and Living Poof came to the rescue.  The body which is gives to my hair is different from any other product I have used as it feels so naturally full and not stiff or coated.  Having no idea how it actually makes that happen, I am gratefully using it each day and recommend it without hesitation as an outstanding addition to any type of hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AS I HAVE FINE HAIR AND THIS WORKS SO WELL WITHOUT GETTING HEAVY.</li>

    <li> Product was OK. Have to be careful not to use too much or it does weight fine hair down. Overall, pretty satisfied, but not really the miracle cream it is advertised to be. Am going to order the mousse and give that a try.</li>
    <li> Used it on dry hair by mistake as I could not read the teeny tiny instructions. It works quite well to tame the frizz I get at the ends without weighing down my fine, limp hair. It makes my hair manageable enough to just comb and go. I use it with lifting foam at the roots of course and then smooth a dab of this at the ends. Next, I will try using it on wet hair per instructions.</li>
    <li> I love using Living Proof thickening cream. I was very happy to see it for sale here and at a better price. Delivery was quick too!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Makes hair feel thicker with no build-up</li>
