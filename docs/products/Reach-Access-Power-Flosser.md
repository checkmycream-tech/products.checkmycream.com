### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Yes, a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I have used one of these for years and find them to be the best way to floss.  </li>
      <li>this is the best way to floss....</li>
      <li>The item works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>, I think they are awesome</li>
      <li>great product.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Executive Producer with dazzling gums and teeth.</li>
      <li>I am delighted with the item and the vendor.</li>
      <li>I loved this product; had one for years and when it broke I scoured the stores looking for one:</li>
      <li>Good product, but a bit over priced.</li>
      <li>So Reach.... don&#x27;t cancel a product which is easy to use and has great results ...</li>
      <li>The Hummingbird product doesn&#x27;t use floss, but barbed plastic tips, which are not as effective.</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find one on the internet available via Amazon.  </li>
      <li>and I love it....</li>
      <li>Okay, I have to admit it ...</li>
      <li>The manual version works much better.  </li>
      <li>I am Totally satisfied...</li>
      <li>This was a wonderful product, which I have used for several years.  </li>
      <li>I just came back from the dentist and my teeth are in perfect shape... and have been for years...</li>
      <li>Love this machine.</li>
      <li>and I might add is a bit refreshing with the minty floss.  </li>
      <li>I floss with this device twice a day and at 73 my dentist and hygienists all are amazed how healthy my gums are.</li>
      <li>And because the top potion does&#x27;t wobble when you are trying to get it between closely spaced teeth, you have better control.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The better choice is the manual version -- also made by Reach.</li>
      <li>A lot more pricey than the original but well</li>
      <li>Mine is still working fine...</li>
      <li>, It worked great  until recently when it quit woking.  </li>
      <li>and they had none available.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I found one here, placed my order and had it in 5 days as promised.  </li>
      <li>IT is very handy to reach the back molars, even if you do not need the vibrations.</li>
      <li>but this makes it worth the effort!...</li>
      <li>Luckily, they still make the flosser refills</li>
      <li>It uses the same snap-on floss refills, but the handle is thinner and rigid, more like a toothbrush, which improves access even more.</li>
      <li>It works really well, is easy</li>
      <li>worth it.</li>
      <li>you always have a fresh flossing tool.</li>
      <li>I have both the manual and power versions of the Reach flosser, so I figured it&#x27;d be worth comparing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The single AA battery operation made flossing quick and effective.  </li>
      <li>My flosser is years old and still works fine.</li>
      <li>I should have tried the manual one first.</li>
      <li>and now I want to find more as a back up as the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to be replaceable.  </li>
      <li>Thanks !</li>
      <li>for the last many years every time the dental hygenist says, are you flossing?</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to decide if it really does a better job than just a manual Reach flosser, but I am going to give it a try anyway.  </li>
      <li>Since the part that does the actual flossing is replaceable, disposable and easy to find ( read Reach manual flosser )</li>
      <li>Thanks you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian</li>
      <li>For a sense of that immediate post-floss, clean-feeling, there&#x27;s nothing that compares to &#x27;Reach Power Flosser&#x27; &amp; i&#x27;m not motivated to write product reviews very often</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>Only the manual version is still available.    </li>
      <li>Only Amazon has this available.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>The power rotation doesn&#x27;t help get between tight teeth and the snap on heads break more often.</li>
      <li>agree with the other reviewers that the design of the Reach flossers, with the floss at a right-angle relative to the handle, makes access and control easier, but the power version is more of a gimmick than a help.</li>
      <li>I even emailed them to ask if they were still making them and if they had some that I could purchase directly from them.</li>
      <li>I ordered immediately and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived ahead of schedule during the holiday mail rush.  </li>
      <li>The bulky handle/body of the power version, coupled with the fact that the top portion (the vibrating flossing portion) wobbles where it connects to the main body of the handle makes getting to tight spots in the back of the mouth harder than it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had one for a couple years but couldn&#x27;t find another in stores anywhere. The on/off switch went bad and used it anyway for months until I decided to go ahead and replace it. A lot more pricey than the original but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Yes, a wonderful product. So sorry REACH stopped making them.</li>
    <li> Okay, I have to admit it ... for the last many years every time the dental hygenist says, are you flossing? my answer has been no, I am not.  So she told me about this nifty little tool and I am now addicted.  It works really well, is easy and I might add is a bit refreshing with the minty floss.  No more threading the floss, no more wrapping it around my finger while my circulation gets cut off.      I have been using it for three months now, every day!  Every day ... miracles!    The only sad news is that this product no longer appears to be sold in any stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for one of these flossers for well over a year.  It seems they are no longer produced for some reason, I think they are awesome and now I want to find more as a back up as the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to be replaceable.  Fast shipping.  Thanks !</li>
    <li> The manual version works much better.  This is too big and clunky.  The power rotation doesn&#x27;t help get between tight teeth and the snap on heads break more often.</li>
    <li> IT is very handy to reach the back molars, even if you do not need the vibrations. The strings are sturdy, unlike products you see at pharmacies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Manual; i&#x27;ve used Water-Pik; Pre-Rinsing.....For a sense of that immediate post-floss, clean-feeling, there&#x27;s nothing that compares to &#x27;Reach Power Flosser&#x27; &amp; i&#x27;m not motivated to write product reviews very often but this makes it worth the effort!...I might suggest getting some sort of battery recharger(Alkaline or NIMH); it&#x27;ll noticeably pay-off(economically) in the long run.  --  Buy It!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too big to try to get into your mouth to get the hard to reach places.  What&#x27;s the point of all that power?  I even had a hard time with flossing the front teeth because of the power let alone trying to get the back teeth. I should have tried the manual one first.</li>
    <li> I have both the manual and power versions of the Reach flosser, so I figured it&#x27;d be worth comparing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with the other reviewers that the design of the Reach flossers, with the floss at a right-angle relative to the handle, makes access and control easier, but the power version is more of a gimmick than a help.

And because the top potion does&#x27;t wobble when you are trying to get it between closely spaced teeth, you have better control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual one is here:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001LUCDKI Reach Flosser with 1 Disposable Head (2 Pack) Colors May Vary]]</li>
    <li> I have been using the Reach Power Flosser for years and had been looking for a replacement for a long time.  I was delighted to find one on the internet available via Amazon.  I ordered immediately and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived ahead of schedule during the holiday mail rush.  The item works perfectly.  I am delighted with the item and the vendor.</li>
    <li> On February 24, 2011, I phoned Reach Customer Service (a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson) at 866/983-5677.  I was told that this product has been out of production since 2006.  Only the manual version is still available.    This was a wonderful product, which I have used for several years.  The single AA battery operation made flossing quick and effective.  I am not aware of any similar product on the market.  The Hummingbird product doesn&#x27;t use floss, but barbed plastic tips, which are not as effective.</li>
    <li> I have had this battery operated device for years and I love it.... Mine is still working fine... but I can&#x27;t find it in the stores... which worries me... so I need a backup... this is the best way to floss.... I just came back from the dentist and my teeth are in perfect shape... and have been for years... I want to purchase a dozen of these to give to my friends... and of course stash for myself... So Reach.... don&#x27;t cancel a product which is easy to use and has great results ...Please !!!!! Where is their corporate office ????  I need to talk to the CEO. you have a product that works... I am Totally satisfied... Executive Producer with dazzling gums and teeth.</li>
    <li> It stops all the time</li>
    <li> I frust bought this power flosser at Wak mart about 4 yers ago, It worked great  until recently when it quit woking.  Walmart does not carry the product any longer; however,  I found one on he internet and have ordered it through Amazon. Hoefully I will get it a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Not a big time on-line shopper...I loved this product; had one for years and when it broke I scoured the stores looking for one: no luck.  Fortunately, I found one here, placed my order and had it in 5 days as promised.  Thanks you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian</li>
    <li> Great product.  Only Amazon has this available.</li>
    <li> Got what I expected in the time promised.</li>
    <li> Good product, but a bit over priced.</li>
    <li> I have had one of these for several years now which I purchased at Walmart. I love it and was so disappointed when they took it off the market. I even emailed them to ask if they were still making them and if they had some that I could purchase directly from them. I  was told that they were not produced any longer and they had none available. I still hope that they will reconsider at some point. Luckily, they still make the flosser refills so I continue to use it. When it finally gives up I&#x27;m not sure what I will do. Please Reach, begin producing these little wonders again.</li>
    <li> My flosser is years old and still works fine. I have had a lot of work done on my teeth and an investment to protect. I floss with this device twice a day and at 73 my dentist and hygienists all are amazed how healthy my gums are. Love this machine.</li>
    <li> Discontinued and crazy high price, but not a better flosser on the market.</li>
    <li> This is not what was advertized by the seller.  Way to expensive for what we got.</li>
    <li> It works very well. I do not know why stores stop selling it. I have yet to find anything else out there that compares to it.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be rechargeable like an electric toothbrush, but it requires a AA battery.  It&#x27;s so overpriced I am amazed J&amp;J would ever sell something like this.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to decide if it really does a better job than just a manual Reach flosser, but I am going to give it a try anyway.  I just hope it holds up for a while.  The switch and the motor seem like real &amp;#34;bottom of the line&amp;#34; quality, but the ergonomics aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> great product.  I have used one of these for years and find them to be the best way to floss.  Since the part that does the actual flossing is replaceable, disposable and easy to find ( read Reach manual flosser ) you always have a fresh flossing tool. It also uses a AA battery so you do not have to worry about a rechargeable battery failure.  A shame that they have discontinued producing them.</li>
