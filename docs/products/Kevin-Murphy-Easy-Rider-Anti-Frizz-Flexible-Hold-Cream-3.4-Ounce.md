      <li>Impressive for humidity control on naturally wavy or frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>Easy Rider combats the frizz and adds definition--love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>The problem is that most products either harden up, flake, etc.  </li>
      <li>And I can&#x27;t wait to try out more products from this line</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>So do most hair gels etc</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Better than hairspray or gel</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light and effective, something to put in your hair for us who don&#x27;t like feeling anything in our hair.</li>
      <li>After about a year which is probably longer than most would keep a product of this sort, it gets a bit plasticky.</li>
      <li>and then this on top - seems to be the most full-proof frizz-protection and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, over-gelled look at all.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products over the years</li>
      <li>It gives me a more polished look.</li>
      <li>One of the better styling products I have used.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>Kevin Murphy makes a product (or more than one) for that purpose.  </li>
      <li>Having tried many men&#x27;s hair care products I can honestly say that ALL Kevin Murphy men&#x27;s products are far superior to anything else on the market today.</li>
      <li>And its worth it!!</li>
      <li>Love Easy Rider for my curls.</li>
      <li>Always glad to find this product available.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great to control frizz and leaves my hair looking natural, not</li>
      <li>&quot; whatever that is) and have spent a great deal more than on THIS product, but NEVER have I had such excellent results!  </li>
      <li>I still have so Easy Rider.</li>
      <li>I purchased Kevin Murphy \\&quot;Easy Rider\\&quot; after my daughter had given me a sample to try (which I did over a period of weeks).  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and makes my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>Good product to create a smooth finish and tame the fly aways.</li>
      <li>to get such great hair results.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick and price was right!!</li>
      <li>Works great without weighting down my hair, has a great natural smell and leaves hair looking shinny</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light but creamy, smells great, and tames my long hair.  </li>
      <li>This is rich and  is a must for moisturized l curly hair.</li>
      <li>As my hair dries, it looks rich, smooth and shiny, and more sophisticated (with almost no effort) than the old styling products that over-texturized my hair and sometimes resembled glue.</li>
      <li>good use if ur gonna be outside</li>
      <li>Your hair will not look as if it&#x27;s full of product.</li>
      <li>Easy Rider is exactly what I need to put some sort of manageability in these curls.  </li>
      <li>it was so quick to deliver</li>
      <li>Great hold, not greasy, easily last throughout the day, and a mild (not overwhelming) clean and pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more money than I would normally pay for hair product</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled to find it here on Amazon, because it&#x27;s significantly cheaper here than it is in my local salon.</li>
      <li>Definitely ordering more!</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of my natural hair...</li>
      <li>Soft curl, frizz is tamed (for the most part).</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have EVER used for fly-aways, those tiny hairs on your forehead that just don&#x27;t know where to go, or that piece of hair in the front (or back) that sticks up straight</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it, though.</li>
      <li>My salon sells this for way less and it is a nice salon!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve searched for years trying to find the right product for my bi-racial curly hair and pea-sized amount of this stuff</li>
      <li>The best part now, is that I can purchase this item from Amazon.com since my local salons that sell it are such a far distance from my home.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too... 5 stars yo!</li>
      <li>I have curly hair, and I have tried many products so avoid my hair frizzing out and getting bigger over the course of the day.</li>
      <li>Love the texture of this product for my short hair.</li>
      <li>Makes me look like I know exactly what I&#x27;m doing with my head.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> best product on the market for curly frizzy hair</li>
    <li> This hair product is applied after hair is styled.  It tames frizzy ends or flyaways.  Excellent</li>
    <li> My hair dresser in Chicago uses Kevin Murphy products. Besides the best packaging (great for travel), Easy Rider really works. I have thick hair, and cannot use heavy, pasty products. They glue my hair down. This is the best product yet for styling, keeping bangs,etc. in place -- but without sticky residue. Your hair will not look as if it&#x27;s full of product. The stuff works invisibly. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Not many salons in Atlanta carry it so I found it easier to order online.  I have \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair - regrowth after total hair loss from chemo.  My new hair is soft and very curly - chemo curl.  Easy Rider is exactly what I need to put some sort of manageability in these curls.  There is no residue and the fragrance is very nice.  Great product.   The Gritty Business Kevin Murphy product is also very good.</li>
    <li> Kevin Murphy Easy Rider is a very good product for mens hair.   Just a small amount smoothes out your hair, giving it seperation, a nice look and texture.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I dont have curly hair- I have Short, not so thick hair. I put a little in my hair before styling and it helps keep the frizz away and hold style. It gives me a more polished look. It provides a soft, flexible and natural style.</li>
    <li> My stylist just started using the entire kevin murphy line in her salon.  I have short, thick, but impossibly straight hair that needs a little assistance in the texturizing department...this product fits the bill, perfectly! It tames frizz and fly-aways while subtly defining layers and providing smooth shine...I highly recommend this product! And I can&#x27;t wait to try out more products from this line</li>
    <li> I suggest that anyone with wavy hair buy this product.  I just put a little on and don&#x27;t really even need to blow dry if I don&#x27;t feel like it and it still looks good with no frizz.  My sister has horrible colored frazzled hair and she tried some my kevin murphy easy rider and now her hair is soft and almost silky.  Even tho she is flat  broke and a starving artist, she always finds money to buy this product now.  And its worth it!!</li>
    <li> Works great without weighting down my hair, has a great natural smell and leaves hair looking shinny not oily a must have</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Such a shame it&#x27;s so expensive ... It&#x27;s definitely worth it, though. It lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve searched for years trying to find the right product for my bi-racial curly hair and pea-sized amount of this stuff does the trick. I like to use Miss Jessie&#x27;s Multi-Racial Curls first and then this on top - seems to be the most full-proof frizz-protection and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, over-gelled look at all. Oh, and it smells good.</li>
    <li> I like to use a little bit of Easy Rider to style my hair after I blow dry it to add some fullness. It works well. One container will last at least six months or longer. Good product.</li>
    <li> Really strong, not very touchable hair but fine if you do not touch your hair throughout the day</li>
    <li> Good product to create a smooth finish and tame the fly aways. A little goes a long way, and there is no product feel in the hair</li>
    <li> I have frizzy curly hair and another curly-headed friend suggested this stuff. It&#x27;s more money than I would normally pay for hair product but it works wonders. I put a little bit into my wet hair, scrunch a bit and then use Herbal Essences curly mousse and I&#x27;m good to go! Soft curl, frizz is tamed (for the most part). The container has lasted me around 4-5 months! Definitely ordering more!</li>
    <li> Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products are a great find! My daughter is a stylist who has worked with countless products - she recommended it and I love it. The Easy Rider gives great definition while preserving the curl, and keeping the fly-aways under control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve looked for so long for a hair product with hold that&#x27;s not sticky.  This is it.  It&#x27;s light but creamy, smells great, and tames my long hair.  The hold isn&#x27;t the greatest, but I still love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had short hair most of my life, so I&#x27;ve had to rely heavily on styling products. A lot of the ones I&#x27;ve found over the years have been discontinued, so that leaves me forever looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was growing my hair out the past few years, but recently decided to go short again. My stylist turned me on to this, and at first I didn&#x27;t like it - it&#x27;s subtle and I wanted something to give more significant texture. But over a few weeks, I started to fall in love. This stuff leaves your hair looking much more natural, but takes away the negatives of going natural - frizz, flyaways, dull look. I put it on while my hair is still damp, but not wet; about 10-15 minutes after my shower. As my hair dries, it looks rich, smooth and shiny, and more sophisticated (with almost no effort) than the old styling products that over-texturized my hair and sometimes resembled glue. It looks so nice that, for me, no more styling is required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled to find it here on Amazon, because it&#x27;s significantly cheaper here than it is in my local salon. But a little goes a long way, so hopefully I won&#x27;t need a refill for a while yet. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this, do it! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent...  good hold and not sticky!!  One of the better styling products I have used.  Delivery was quick and price was right!!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this products for years, and they quit carrying it locally so we&#x27;ve had to start ordering it online.  It&#x27;s the only product he will use in his hair - worth the money!</li>
    <li> This product is great except that it was a little heavy. It certainly controlled the frizz, I&#x27;d even go so far as to say it&#x27;s the reason I was able to let my curly hair down 2 days after showering (a miracle).&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels. Besides that, it&#x27;s great. The container is brilliant, wish more products had this.</li>
    <li> use it once in a while..good stuff but regular gel is fine for normal days..this stuff does not flake..good use if ur gonna be outside or if ur hair might get bumped or moved.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have EVER used for fly-aways, those tiny hairs on your forehead that just don&#x27;t know where to go, or that piece of hair in the front (or back) that sticks up straight no matter what you do. It holds the finest of hairs in place and smells AMAZING. You barely have to use any so it lasts forever, and somehow it keeps my hair in place sometimes up to a full day. I&#x27;ve seen it cheaper on Amazon previously, but I&#x27;d pay a little extra for this product, it is worth the money if you have hair that doesn&#x27;t always stay in place the way you like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product forever. I refuse to use any other products.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally wavy and this product helps define my waves/soft curls and prevent frizz!&lt;br /&gt;My typical routine is once I step out of the shower I comb through my hair. I then scrunch my hair with a t-shirt or paper towels (this helps prevent frizz, unlike towels). Then I scrunch small amounts of this all over my head (make sure not to use too much or else it will feel heavy and a little greasy.) Remember to start off small. If you think you need more, add a little to your hair at a time. I usually let it air dry because I don&#x27;t like using heat but if I need my hair dry, I use a defuser.</li>
    <li> I bought this on recommendation of my cousin, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. You only need a very little bit (I just dip my finger in), and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair too dirty looking (I&#x27;m blonde). It makes the curls turn out rather nicely, and it smells lovely.</li>
    <li> While I like to look put-together, I am somewhat lazy about my willingness to put forth effort in maintaining my appearance.  This product works well to keep me looking nice with very little fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have always hated about most hair products is that they end up making a mess or feeling gross after a while.  I work 12 hour shifts, so I don&#x27;t need any help making myself greasy.  This stuff does a good job of keeping the frizz down and making my look professional, but the best part is you don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;krispy kreme dried glaze&amp;#34; effect like with other products.  Have you seen a glazed donut before?  Know how it starts out all nice and wet looking and then over time the glaze dries and turns all white and flaky or powdery?  So do most hair gels etc but this does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job with varied lengths.  I get my hair cut to what would be considered the shorter end of the &amp;#34;medium length&amp;#34; spectrum and then it grows considerably before I get it cut again.  This works well to give some texture and messiness when its short, but it continues to work well for the george clooney style etc as the hair gets longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not have a TON of hold - it is not meant for that.  Kevin Murphy makes a product (or more than one) for that purpose.  However, for shorter hair I&#x27;ve found it does have SOME hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s pricey stuff but it requires a pretty small amount each day so the container likely could last you several months.</li>
    <li> This is rich and  is a must for moisturized l curly hair. Your hair will be curly and  not crunchy.  It only requires a small amount on the ends. Too much and you won&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for me.  I have long hair which I wear in a pony tail.  This controls the frizzy stuff but still keeps my hair looking natural, not greasy.</li>
    <li> Does a great job holding my wavy short hair without making my hair feel icky or weighed down!</li>
    <li> Great product, absolutely love it. Great hold, but not too sticky. Use in wet or dry hair - equally as good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I have used for a long time and hope it continues to be available c</li>
    <li> Good stuff, does the job and is not greasy. After about a year which is probably longer than most would keep a product of this sort, it gets a bit plasticky.</li>
    <li> This product ahs eliminated my need to dry my hair in the morning. Just rub a very small amount into my wet hair after showering, comb and it stays in place all day without a sticky, hard or greasy look. Better than hairspray or gel and I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time given the small amount needed to do the job.</li>
    <li> This works so well and isn&#x27;t messy. I take this stuff everywhere with me. Will buy again...will always buy again.</li>
    <li> I use all Kevin Murphy product line and it is by far the best hair products on the market today.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair (goes down to my mouth) and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other pomades, mousse and gels but nothing worked as well as this. Smells good and stays in my hair till I take a shower, comes out easy as well. Even though its $40 theres a lot and it will last you a while, been using it for almost two months daily and I&#x27;m not even halfway through it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used to keep my hair under control. It tames the frizzies, but doesn&#x27;t make hair stiff or gummy. The price might seem a little steep, but it lasts a long time. I like to partially dry my hair and then apply it.</li>
    <li> Great product however I feel it dries out the hair a bit. Based on other reviews I had higher expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male with curly/wavy hair that is a little past shoulder length.  It can get very unruly/frizzy if I don&#x27;t put anything in it.  The problem is that most products either harden up, flake, etc.  This stuff works great to control frizz and leaves my hair looking natural, not like I put a bunch of goop in it.</li>
    <li> Love Easy Rider for my curls. I use just a little, mixing it in between my hands and then applying to damp hair. Then I either spiral my curls or just let them dry wild. Easy Rider combats the frizz and adds definition--love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! It is my favorite product and the best part is I didn&#x27;t have to wait long for it at all it was so quick to deliver</li>
    <li> Expensive, but you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve been looking for sometime like this product for awhile. This is the good stuff, it holds without clumping or feeling like glue, even if you have thin hair. Your hair stays in place all day somehow. Makes me look like I know exactly what I&#x27;m doing with my head. Fast shipping too... 5 stars yo!</li>
    <li> I like the product. I thought I was saving money on Amazon, and later found out I could get it at my Salon for $30 less than what I paid. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this wonderful hair product one day when my Sister was visiting AZ. from WA. State. She showed me how to use such a small amt. to get such great hair results. So after blow drying your hair, either long or short hair, you put a dime size amt. on the palm of your hand, then rub your hands together, &amp; your hair will style as you would like it to be, just by styling with your hands. Easy to work with, light in texture, and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down as I have found with other hair products. Non-sticky in nature, with a light pleasant smell too. All around, the BEST light, creamy styling hair product I have EVER used! BRAVO!!! The best part now, is that I can purchase this item from Amazon.com since my local salons that sell it are such a far distance from my home. I am sold FOREVER!!!!  :0)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and like how it works in styling my short hair after drying. It gives my hair lift and body.</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever!</li>
    <li> Always glad to find this product available. It&#x27;s so light and effective, something to put in your hair for us who don&#x27;t like feeling anything in our hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Having tried many men&#x27;s hair care products I can honestly say that ALL Kevin Murphy men&#x27;s products are far superior to anything else on the market today. Great hold, not greasy, easily last throughout the day, and a mild (not overwhelming) clean and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !</li>
    <li> Impressive for humidity control on naturally wavy or frizzy hair.  No more &#x27;fro!</li>
    <li> I have been usiing this for years and absolutely love it!  It is the perfect hold wax with the added shine value.  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Great product but the cost is OUTRAGEOUS!!  My salon sells this for way less and it is a nice salon!</li>
    <li> I received the product and it had been packed already damaged.  The seal was broken and the cream was discolored and the consistency was too liquid.  The provider could not replace the item and gave me a refund.  I still have so Easy Rider.</li>
    <li> Love the texture of this product for my short hair. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased Kevin Murphy \\&quot;Easy Rider\\&quot; after my daughter had given me a sample to try (which I did over a period of weeks).  This product is simply amazing!  I have very thick, fine hair that absorbs moisture and tends to be waivy/frizzy.  Before trying this product, the only way my hair could look smooth and shiny (without fly-aways) was when my Hair Stylist would blow-dry it, then flat-iron it.  Well!  I am too lazy to do all that!  I just put a pea-size drop of this product on my finger tips, rub it into the palms of my hands, then work it through my hair, starting at the tips.  I blow-dry only until it is almost dry, then follow up with a Hot Styling Brush.  That&#x27;s it.  It looks pretty good, too!  Almost as if my Stylist had visited my home.  I have tried many products over the years (yeah..I am \\&quot;middle aged\\&quot; whatever that is) and have spent a great deal more than on THIS product, but NEVER have I had such excellent results!  BTW, the container arrived in a padded envelope, with an air-pillow inserted, then the whole thing folded over tight... this allowed it to arrive completely intact, no dents or cracks.  Just perfect condition. Try it!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, and I have tried many products so avoid my hair frizzing out and getting bigger over the course of the day. I went for a haircut a few weeks ago and the hairdresser used this stuff. It has a pleasant smell and makes my hair so soft! It&#x27;s key to only use a small amount, too much and your hair will become greasey-looking (as with all products). My hair dresser put a small amount all over my hair, especially to the ends, and then proceeded to wrap coils of my hair around his finger to create individual curls and use a diffuser to lightly dry my hair. The curls stayed in place and soft all day long even into the next day! But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of my natural hair...Regardless, if you have wavy or curly hair, you should try this product out. And the amount of product you get will last a very long time. My boyfriend likes the smell as well, so it&#x27;s a win-win. Hope this helps!</li>
