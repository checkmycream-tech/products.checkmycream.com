      <li>and I like it for night wear the most.</li>
      <li>Simply the BEST.....</li>
      <li>I ordered a sample of this cologne from another site and it was my favorite of the four samples I ordered.</li>
      <li>i get many compliments when i wear this</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t be sure that it is counterfeit although I have been wearing this for years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great scent and great delivery ..... i get many compliments when i wear this</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son for his birthday. It&#x27;s his favorite and he says this girls all love it too!</li>
    <li> Armani Code? I just think I broke the Code: the scent of liquid baby powder. Thanks but no thanks......I will stick with Acqua Di Gio with an occasional spray of Armani Code Sport [which at least has more defined citrus notes]. But regarding plain old Armani code - do me a favor, save your money.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne , but I don&#x27;t know I feel like the smell don&#x27;t last long .</li>
    <li> The cologne is weak.  Maybe it&#x27;s old.</li>
    <li> Delicius!!! Very good!!!</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my son and he loved.  Shipping time was fantastic.</li>
    <li> This cologne is my husband&#x27;s favorite and it was hard to find in the big box stores, plus it was much more expensive there; I will continue to purchase colognes from this vendor; cost is much better than retail stores, and the turnaround was great!</li>
    <li> Purchased as gifts for four (4) sons.  They all use it and everyone likes the scent.</li>
    <li> I opened the box of the perfum that I purchased two month ago. I have used this parfum for many years and I know the smell and the quality and this seems not be original. Also the bottle is different than others that I had bougth. I think that is a copy of the original perfum and that is not what I pay for. I am going to ask to Amazon for any compensation of the return of money.</li>
    <li> Bought this since I liked it when I found it on the very first cruise that I ever took. Then, I go to an outlet mall and found it with a kit of two other products by Armani, and it was half the cost. But it at outlet malls!</li>
    <li> Armani Code has been one of my favorite colognes.  My wife really likes the scent and I have received compliments at work.</li>
    <li> I love cologne and have been using a couple religiously for the past couple of years. I thought maybe I would venture out and see what else is out there. I read some reviews and thought maybe, just maybe this was worth the price. I was wrong. The initial spray is a huge blast of baby powder mixed with some fall leaves. After a couple of hours of wear...it&#x27;s just baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this, Issey Miake and a couple of others....now I know why I should just be happy with what I wore before.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the price and delivery time, LOVE this scent!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband and we both love it! Almost have a sweet but masculine smell . Can&#x27;t go wrong with this and it is authentic.  Shipping was awesome as well.</li>
    <li> Great product and lasts a long while.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted - thanks</li>
    <li> Like the smell of this so much, drives girls absolutely wild. I like good stuff and this is good stuff. and you cant beet the price you would pay 3 times more at the store</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I will ever buy my hubby... I hope they never stop making it!  Cologne is such a subjective item, it&#x27;s hard to put into words, but this one just works perfectly with my husband&#x27;s chemistry! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my dad and he loved it! And it smells so good! Any guy would love this cologne</li>
    <li> This is a fake.. the armani on the bottle is supose to be in lower case letter, but mine is in all caps. very disappointing and the smell only last about two minutes.</li>
    <li> Very good scent lasts women love it. Tried &amp;#34;Tens &amp;#34;prior until I found out it was for attracting Men which l am not interested in</li>
    <li> love the smell of it!!</li>
    <li> Not authentic, avoid.</li>
    <li> It was damaged and since it is inflammable I couldnt even return it! very un happy! also it seems fake!</li>
    <li> Husband smells fantastic!!  I&#x27;ve been wearing Armani Code for women for a long time and get compliments&lt;br /&gt;all the time so I bought the men&#x27;s cologne for my husband for his birthday.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fragrance. I do too. I love that Amazon sells it at a more affordable price and that they deliver on time.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Definitely buying again</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!! It smells amazing and my fiance wears it everyday!! I highly recommened this for any man! LADIES WILL LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> With so many to choose from I never skip a week without using this scent I have a number of fragrances that I purchase and use and this one ranks up there with some of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  I have been wearing Armani Code for many years.  Buying through amazon is much cheaper than buying it in the store</li>
    <li> Scent is original........&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot....&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time...</li>
    <li> My wife bought me this cologne.  I hear how great it smells from all kinds of people on a weekly basis. I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> People don&#x27;t even realize I&#x27;m wearing it. Which is a good thing. There&#x27;s a difference between smelling nice and smelling like you have cologne on. This is the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its sweet scent goes better with formal attire. Those who dress casually might do better to get something with a citrus smell, like Aqua De Gio if we&#x27;re sticking with Armani.</li>
    <li> Excellent fragrance...Get plenty of compliments.  Not overly strong and lasts a good 6 to 7 hrs.  I would purchase again it&#x27;s become one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this and so do I!&lt;br /&gt;He prefers the Toilette Spray because it keeps him from using too much.&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant is smart because it allows him to continue the same scent instead of introducing something that might fight with the Code he is wearing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for husband as a Father&#x27;s Day gift and he loved it</li>
    <li> This is easily one of the most iconic scents ever made, along with Acqua di Gio, Cool Water, and so forth. Interestingly, Armani Code seems to be one of the only iconic scents that is not overused and overplayed, and I say this not as a cologne snob. Scents like Acqua and Cool Water are quickly becoming &amp;#34;ex-boyfriend scents&amp;#34;, in that because so many people wear those scents the chance of you smelling the same as other people that a girl (or anyone else smelling you) knows is quite high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armani code, on the other hand, is something I&#x27;ve rarely smelled on other people before, yet it is easily identifiable. It has a strong base note/dry down of tobacco and leather, and thus exudes classiness and elegance. People tell me that it reminds me of dark suits and cocktails, and indeed the smell goes wonderfully on a classy night out. I almost didn&#x27;t want to give it a positive review for fear that the scent might become more and more popular, but believe me--you can&#x27;t go wrong once the sun goes down with Armani Code!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful spraying this, more than 2-3 sprays and you&#x27;re getting into cloying/eye-watering territory. On most people, this scent is quite strong and projects farther than some may like.</li>
    <li> Got here in time ... My son loved it on Christmas.. It was just what he wanted n more thanks</li>
    <li> Great Mens Fragrance! The small lasts a long time, not like other mens cologne we&#x27;ve tried. Not too strong and very masculine!</li>
    <li> This cologne has one of the best scents I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of encountering. I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days and I&#x27;ve already been complimented more times than I ever have been before for any other cologne I&#x27;ve worn. It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> This Armani Code for Men was a Christmas gift for my husband.  While I ordered this item early in December and was advised it would arrive for the holiday, it arrived after Christmas.  Otherwise, the present was enjoyed. Will have to order my gifts earlier in November this year!</li>
    <li> this is more than I would normally spend for a men&#x27;s cologne, but my daughter said that is the only scent her fiance&#x27; wears...I was pleased with the price and the fast shipping.  Now they broke up....somebody kick me, please!</li>
    <li> I really love th Armani Code! I have been buying this for 5 years and still is my favorite out of all my men&#x27;s products</li>
    <li> My husband got the first bottle of Armani Code in Italy a few years ago! He absolutely LOVES it!!!</li>
    <li> I recieved a fake bottle of Armani Code. I have been buying this stuff for years from my local Bonton and decided to get it from Amazon. When I took it out if the box the and tried it out the scent wasn&#x27;t the same and smelled off. I looked over the box and noticed it was tampered with. The barcodes on the box were stickers and when I pulled them off to see what was underneath their were pieces of the box cut out. I took the the bottle to Bonton to compare my bottle with theirs and found out the bottles box was different and the scent was completely different like I thought. I highly recommend not to buy this!</li>
    <li> Just as I had hoped. Love the fragrance on my man!</li>
    <li> Love it. Best price on amazon.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on this all the time - great fragrance and price!</li>
    <li> Still one of the better colognes in the market. Smells like a million bucks.</li>
    <li> This does not smell quite right. I can&#x27;t be sure that it is counterfeit although I have been wearing this for years. Always bought from Saks fifth avenue. I received this bottle and it smells very much like alcohol than anything else. The scent doesn&#x27;t last either. As I said before it looks legitimate but something is off.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cologne, shipping was excellent</li>
    <li> good quality. sent is wonderful</li>
    <li> GTG, great fragrance and ships directly from Amazons warehouse so little to no chance of getting a counterfeit</li>
    <li> Best scent ever. Everybody compliments me on how I smell.</li>
    <li> I ordered a sample of this cologne from another site and it was my favorite of the four samples I ordered. It is a clean scent that just smells downright good. I found that two or three spritz of this on clothing lasts for about 8 hours or so. I have gotten a few positive comments on it and would definitely buy it again. As for receiving a genuine fragrance, it smells like the sample I ordered and the box didn&#x27;t appear to be tampered with. When purchasing, I highly recommend purchasing ONLY THROUGH AMAZON if possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this cologne for years. It smells nice and I like it for night wear the most. It gives me that feel of black-tie type of events. Especially when I&#x27;m going on a date at night. The scent is long lasting and its quite pleasant. I get compliments on the scent, all the time.</li>
    <li> Sweet fragrance for men.  I have used it for 5 years. The delivery time was great.  Very quick, within a few days.  I realize we all have different opinions, but highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The smell of this is amazing. People say the scent doesn&#x27;t last long, but i&#x27;ve sprayed it on my overcoat several times &amp; it&#x27;s embedded w/the scent. Even when I go out &amp; the winds blowing, the scent doesn&#x27;t fade. Pretty much the trick is I never wash my overcoat, (I see no need to, it&#x27;s clean &amp; spotless lol). With regular use, it still lasts, but the more time that passes, the more the scent becomes faint/faded. Though yeah, I recommend this product 100%.</li>
    <li> This product smells fantastic. I was skeptical at first because I never buy cologne online and having never smelt it before I didn&#x27;t know quite what to expect. Its not a overwhelming smell either. I have gotten many compliments on it and have only had it for a week or so. Amazing product will be buying again in the future!</li>
    <li> yay cologne...stuff smells awesome. I would recommend this to anyone that wants someone to get a little closer. must buy.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome, some might not like the Powdery sent but i love it. Only downside is the price, Its a little pricey for me, buy could be that I&#x27;m just a cheap skate lol</li>
    <li> super quick delivery! My husbands favorite and mine too!</li>
    <li> Right product... right price... delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, only need one shot and it&#x27;s on the edge of too much.</li>
    <li> Original smell, my boyfriend excellent gift charm.</li>
    <li> Good price  fast shipping</li>
    <li> Smells like baby powder for men... Most Ladies seem to really like it.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of my favorite scents for men. I bought it for my husband and every time he wears it, I go weak in the knees. I have also stopped a waiter at a restaurant to ask what he was wearing because it was familiar and smelled very good. I cannot advise whether this scent is authentic online as I have always bought fragrance in person, however, the scent is sultry and sensual and a success on all levels.</li>
    <li> The real deal.  I was afraid that it may not be real at this price.  What a PLEASANT surprise.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  The scent is out of this world!  We both love it.  He stated that this is extremely masculine.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend.  It arrived super fast and was exactly what he wanted.  The price was what would be expected and I would buy this again</li>
    <li> Woow I do not have enough words to say how nice this smells I just do love it!! it was more than I was expecting..........</li>
    <li> The smell is good but not the musk I was hoping for.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would but my boyfriend only does one spritz - that could definitely be the issue.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the smell, and that&#x27;s really all I needed to know. Plus, it was very affordable and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband. He has used this for several years and it smells so good!</li>
    <li> Smells really nice would recommend it for anyone starting a collection</li>
    <li> this product smells great but I was a bit disappointed with the size got it before time which was great</li>
    <li> Received as a gift, Armani Code has a very pleasing, mild scent.  It will not be overpowering even if too much is applied.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cologne. The opening smell is very harsh and achoholy but the dry down is this woodsy sweet pleasant smell. This stuff is very versatile and has solid longetivity of about 7-8hrs on my skin. Overall guys this is a safe purchase and i highly reccomend this for a solid signature scent.</li>
    <li> It was in good condition and still full</li>
    <li> omg it was a wonderful surprise for my friend.  love the scent and was delivered so fast.  thank you.  recommend it</li>

    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it smells amazing! He loves it and so do i.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping very easy to setup and use.</li>
    <li> Product sold from Amazon is so weak, the scent is gone within 5 min applying.&lt;br /&gt;The package was new and not opened. I buy this from Belk regularly at a greater price but a much better quality (last a day verse 5 min).</li>
    <li> It my husband favorite cologne. Its was a larger size than expected which was a plus.</li>
    <li> Great scent, am enjoying it!</li>

    <li> Great smell, and the bottle was a lot bigger than I expected.  You will not be disappointed when purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne and instead of me going on a hunt for it I decided to check Amazon. I was elated to see it available and it was delivered to my door just in time for Father&#x27;s Day!</li>
    <li> My husband wears this cologne and it&#x27;s so sexy. It&#x27;s not musty or too sweet - the blend is just captivating. A few small daps go a long ways and last all day long. I can put my husband&#x27;s jacket on that he left in the closet and it smells as if he just spayed it on. It&#x27;s a great smell and lasts a very long time. My husbands can make a 2.5 ounce bottle last 3 months easy.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. It&#x27;s one of my favorites, and he really likes the scent. It can be a little strong, a little goes a long way.</li>
