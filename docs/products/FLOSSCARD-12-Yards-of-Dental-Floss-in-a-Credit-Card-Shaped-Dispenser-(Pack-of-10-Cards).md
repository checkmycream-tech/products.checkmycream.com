      <li>IT JUST DOESN&#x27;T GET MUCH BETTER</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I had been getting Flosscards from my dentist on every visit but needed to replenish them more often than the annual dental checkup.</li>
      <li>Since I always carry my wallet, I am always able to floss, no matter where I am.  </li>
      <li>But I really like these, so I was happy to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I immediately ordered more.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>

      <li>I find it indispensable!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love them.</li>
      <li>you are able to personalize it.</li>
      <li>I have carried Flosscards  for years and love them.  </li>
      <li>Product is excellent and such a lifesaver for those flossing emergencies.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great when you&#x27;re at a restaurant or somewhere on the go where you wouldn&#x27;t normally carry dental floss.</li>
      <li>This was a way I could recommend my dentist to colleagues and offer them a friendly post-popcorn reminder!  </li>
      <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
      <li>and I am so glad it is now available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Especially for men, these are incredibly convenient.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m all about being able to fit essentials into my wallet.  </li>
      <li>she got from her dentist, and I loved it so much</li>
      <li>and she is not with me, I have floss right in my own pocket.  </li>
      <li>The floss is in a credit-card-like dispenser and the floss fits easily between teeth.</li>
      <li>Unwaxed, fine, strong, just what my dentist recommends.  </li>
      <li>and now I can bring this in my bag or put it in my wallet or pocket, and it&#x27;s so easy and light to carry.  </li>
      <li>but I luckily was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>hope that they don&#x27;t mind that I ammend my review, but I got a piece of paper that said that I get 10 FREE Flosscards if I put a review up and send it to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>About the size of a credit card and easily fit in my wallet.</li>
      <li>I definitely would recommend Flosscard to anyone looking for a great way to advertise his or her business-</li>
      <li>It says they are &amp;#34;Ultra light waxed&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>They each contain 12 yards, and easily fit in a credit card slot of your wallet.  </li>

      <li>Perfect for carrying everyday in your wallet.  </li>
      <li>It works great like many other floss but the difference is that you will ALWAYS have this in your wallet (or bag for ladies)</li>
      <li>This is the best floss if you have very tight spaces between your teeth.</li>
      <li>It is great floss and holds more than the average floss sample we hand out.</li>
      <li>They fit perfect in an Altoids tin if you use one to carry small items.</li>
      <li>I love them so much, I ordered some for me and some to give out for stocking stuffers for Christmas!</li>
      <li>It is not too slippery, I feel that it really does a great job not only getting the food particles out but able to clean/scrub the sides of my teeth.</li>
      <li>totally worth it!</li>
      <li>They are super convenient as they are the size and thickness of a credit card, so they fit in your wallet, and the floss stays clean and protected inside the card until you pull some out to use it.  </li>
      <li>its like a BOGO special.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still working on my first card since I only need it for emergencies, so for the price these are great.  </li>
      <li>, I feel that it really does a good job not only getting the food particles out but able to clean/scrub the sides of my teeth.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is awesome.  I was at a lunch meeting and spotted something in my teeth when I went to the bathroom.  I was trying to figure out how to keep that from happening again....this is the solution!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal! Floss doesn&#x27;t break off like some other cheap flosses I have tried. Nice and slim-just like a credit card. I wish they could figure out a way to put a mirror on it, like another product I reviewed. But that floss item was too bulky, so win some, lose some. But yeah, this is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;-ERIN</li>
    <li> A friend let me use some floss from her flosscard she got from her dentist, and I loved it so much, she gave it to me!! I carried it in my wallet for years to use at those annoying times when you are away from home and get something stuck between your teeth....arghhh. I was so sad when I used it completely up as I didn&#x27;t know how to replace it having never seen them in any stores. Every time I went to my dentist, I tried to talk him into getting them for his patients so I could get another one!.  So, finally I searched on line and was thrilled to find them here!!!!!!!  They are super convenient as they are the size and thickness of a credit card, so they fit in your wallet, and the floss stays clean and protected inside the card until you pull some out to use it.  As far as I am concerned, these are a must have item.  I love them so much, I ordered some for me and some to give out for stocking stuffers for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Fits in your wallet, the size of a credit card.  Always have some floss on hand for an emergency.</li>
    <li> I got one flosscards from my a dentist. I would ask for a few extra because I like the quality of the floss so much. It is not too thick and it doesn&#x27;t break easily. It is not too slippery, I feel that it really does a great job not only getting the food particles out but able to clean/scrub the sides of my teeth. I like this floss very much I have tried many other brands flosses and none can compare to this.</li>
    <li> If there is anybody else, like me, who is driven crazy by anything wedged between teeth, this is a wonder.  I have carried Flosscards  for years and love them.  My kids have made fun of me for this but they have also borrowed floss when we are out and they need it.</li>
    <li> I agree, these would be better if they were waxed, but for the convenience these offer I cannot complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few times I&#x27;ve truly NEEDED these, they saved my sanity.  I keep a card in my wallet and it&#x27;s come in handy a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still working on my first card since I only need it for emergencies, so for the price these are great.  They will last me a few years at the least and I couldn&#x27;t go back to not having these with me.</li>
    <li> I originally got a few of these from my periodontist and loved them so much I had to order some for myself.  They are great to keep in your wallet so you always have some floss with you.  My coworkers thought it was odd the first time they saw me pull out my floss card, but now they ask me for a piece of floss a few times a week.  This is a great product for people who like to take good care of their teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Wow what an excellent idea! Flosscard is a great way to avoid embarrassing food in teeth moments when on the run. I wondered how thin flosscard would be and it is very thin. No bulging out of my wallet. Will definitely be ordering more flosscards when mine run out.</li>
    <li> Have been using for years!  Thrilled to be able to get so easily.&lt;br /&gt;Never gets stuck between tight teeth&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I received a couple of Flosscard credit card dispensers as promotional handout at a conference several years ago.  I LOVE this product.  How convenient to always know that floss is at hand!  When I ran out, I was really bummed...Recently I thought to myself &amp;#34;Amazon has EVERYTHING.... why not check them out?  So I did, and I am so happy to have Flosscard in my wallet again.  Now I will never be without &amp;#34;floss coverage&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Convenient.  It&#x27;s the size of a credit card so it fits perfectly into a wallet.  I showed it to my hygienist and recommended that the dentist include it as part of the &amp;#34;go pack&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Wild horses couldn&#x27;t get my husband or son to use dental floss until a friend gave my husband a Flosscard. He keeps it in his wallet and we all use it now if we are out for a meal. But alas our card ran out and believe it or not, my husband asked for a new supply for his birthday! I ordered the 20-pack with the hope he will share when he opens his present.  I am so happy we discovered Flosscard and so is our dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> Handy to keep in your wallet or purse.</li>
    <li> Perfect for camping.  Perfect for emergencies.  Unwaxed, fine, strong, just what my dentist recommends.  Keep one in your wallet</li>
    <li> My mom had one of these in her purse, gave me one and I immediately ordered more.  Excellent product, fast shipment, and a MUST for everyone&#x27;s pocket!</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as my other flosses, as they aren&#x27;t waxed, but very compact and fits into my wallet, good in a pinch</li>
    <li> FLOSSCARD is perfect! Seriously ... It is sturdy, fits in your wallet, and you have access to much needed floss -- as in when you are in the movies and a kernel gets lodged, or out on a date and ... well you get the idea! But I have been using it for awhile now and it is so useful. I recommend it strongly!</li>
    <li> Very convenient product. Always with you. The product came quickly and was exactly as expected. It works great like many other floss but the difference is that you will ALWAYS have this in your wallet (or bag for ladies)</li>
    <li> Never without floss. Lasts surprisingly long.</li>
    <li> I used to get these from a friend who worked in a dental office and I thought they were fantastic. About the size of a credit card and easily fit in my wallet. They&#x27;re great when you&#x27;re at a restaurant or somewhere on the go where you wouldn&#x27;t normally carry dental floss. Unfortunatey, my friend moved away but I luckily was able to find them on Amazon. For me, there&#x27;s nothing worse than having something stuck between my teeth all day that I can&#x27;t get out.  I highly recommend this product... totally worth it!</li>
    <li> A must have in any wallet!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other types available at drug stores and grocery stores and was unhappy with them.  My dentist recommended this and I was so happy with it that I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Flosscard is the best! The product is so and efficient and convenient. The floss itself is quality and you can carry the card with you anywhere- keep it in your wallet, bag and not have to deal with bulky floss or toothpicks. I have been using these for years and never leave home without one!</li>
    <li> I received one of these from my dentist and thought it was the greatest invention ever made.  When I finally used it up, I was so glad to find that it was available to the public in reasonable quantities and did not have to be purchased in bulk quantities for promotional purposes.  Especially for men, these are incredibly convenient.  They fit right into my wallet.  I used to always rely on my wife to have floss in her purse, but now when I have a business lunch or travel and she is not with me, I have floss right in my own pocket.  I absolutely love them.</li>
    <li> I got one of these from my Dentist as a parting gift.  I find it indispensable! I use floss after every meal and this is the perfect way to have it with me at all times. The dispenser is shaped like a credit card so it fits perfectly into any wallet or takes up no space in a little purse.  :D</li>
    <li> I stocked up on these when I went through Basic training in San Diego in 07, finally on my last card. Shows how much I use them, But I have always had one in my wallet for the past 7 years. It is always nice to have some floss when you are out and about and you never know when you are going to be eating and something gets painfully jammed between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus if your into survival/prepping, you always have some string on you with these, great for camping, first aid kits, or random handouts to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AAANNNNDDD....&lt;br /&gt;I hope that they don&#x27;t mind that I ammend my review, but I got a piece of paper that said that I get 10 FREE Flosscards if I put a review up and send it to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave reviews for the things I really, really like, or really have a problem with. The rest I don&#x27;t bother. But I really like these, so I was happy to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent my email with my review posted to Amazon to their address and the next day I got a reply saying that my 10 Free Cards are on their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So its like a BOGO special. I can&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll get the same slip of paper I did, but today&#x27;s date is 6/24/14 if that helps you make your decision at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I broke a tooth a few weeks ago which is why I have been flossing more; to prevent further decay while I have money for fillings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the broken tooth probably could have been prevented if I FLOSSED MORE! I used mine today at work after some celery got stuck in my teeth.</li>
    <li> No need for something extra in the pockets, just stays in my wallet and easy access.  good product. 5 stars</li>
    <li> This product is different from any other  floss because it stores easily in a credit card slot in your purse or wallet and it has more than one use. Many times the other single use floss gets lost in my purse and I forget I even have it..and when I use it once there is no more for the next time.But the Flosscard is right there with the red Flosscard letters showing up in my credit card slot and I have many uses in there, too.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these! So very handy to carry in purse, book bag, sports bag for an on the run family!  Perfect for removing those popcorn kernels after a sporting event!</li>
    <li> this is perfect item to keep in the wallet. i can carry to anywhere, since it is as credit card size and thickness. i floss after every meal, it is really convenient. highly recommended for everyone.</li>
    <li> Have always been impressed with this product,and it comes in handy when eating out,or just on the run.Thin as a credit card,and will fit well in Ur pocket or billfold.Would recommend</li>
    <li> I am floss-obsessed and I needed a replacement for a cleverly designed flosscard-type product given to me by a friend. I kept it in my wallet for a year+ before it ran out. I ordered this 10-pack; it arrived FAST and just as described. Excellent product and excellent vendor. I actually feel relieved to have floss back in my wallet for those uncomfortable-food-stuck-in-teeth moments! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I received this product from my dentist, with his office contact information.  This was not just a hilarious, not-so-subtle, way of telling me to floss more.  This was a way I could recommend my dentist to colleagues and offer them a friendly post-popcorn reminder!  It also fit in my wallet, which is a big improvement from the last such product I received (which was too thick and stretched my wallet out).  Would totally recommend the Flosscard to anyone needing business cards.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who gets food caught between their teeth.</li>
    <li> I used to get flosscards from my dentist. I would ask for a few extra because I like the quality of the floss so much. It is not too thick and it doesn&#x27;t shred. It is not too waxy/slippery, I feel that it really does a good job not only getting the food particles out but able to clean/scrub the sides of my teeth.  I absolutely love this floss and it&#x27;s handy that it comes in the card size you can fit it in your pocket and take with you. I&#x27;ve tried many other name brands flosses and none can compare to the flosscard.</li>
    <li> Amazing! My boyfriend would alway use paper, etc to get food out of his teeth because he never had floss.  So I bought him these because they fit perfectly in his wallet, just like a credit card!  Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for wallet, And it&#x27;s discrete so no one has to know you&#x27;re carrying around floss. I usually take my purse with me to the  restroom in a restaurant so it&#x27;s a no brainer, should an unexpected need to floss arise I&#x27;ll always have one handy. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> We had some wallet floss like this we got from a giveaway, so once that ran out I was looking for a replacement. Just tuck it in your wallet and it&#x27;s there when you need it!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  The FLOSSCARD fits perfectly in my little wristlet and now I have floss anytime I need it.  I had been searching for a way to carry floss with me and was so pleased to find this clever product.</li>
    <li> Since my teeth are not perfectly spaced, food often gets caught between them.  If I have a meal away from home, the stuck-food sensation drives me crazy until I get back, since there is no way to fix this without floss.  Then I discovered Flosscard.  Since I always carry my wallet, I am always able to floss, no matter where I am.  Since I only need to use it a few times a month, the 12 yards in each card lasts me at least 6 months.  This is a very clever product which suits my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> Product reviews on Amazon are something I always rely upon to make my purchase decision. Before buying this brand of floss, which was first time for my family (We usually buy Oral-B Glide floss at Costco), the straight 5-star reviews caught my attention so I thought this must be really good stuff. But as it turned out, this is nothing near the dental floss we expected - the line is too thin to hold on to; there is no waxing so moving in and out of the teeth gap is frustrating, not to mention the effectiveness of cleaning stuff in there. After a few attempts, we gave up using it and now there are 99% of unused packets. If anyone has really used this brand of floss and likes it, please let me know, so I can send them to you with no charge (but please send a prepaid return envelope). Hate to see the &amp;#34;5-star&amp;#34; stuff got wasted like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, even though the Glide floss quality has somehow gone down in recent years (the line become easier to break, which wasn&#x27;t the case a few years back), it is still 10 times better. So I guess we have to stick with Oral-B Glide floss and pray they will improve their outsourcing process and bring the Glide quality back to where it was before outsourcing production to some foreign place where they don&#x27;t give a damn to Americans&#x27; teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Flosscard maker and vendor, I have to do this to somewhat bring the review ranking to reality so none will be misguided again and make the same mistake we did. I know there are many Glide floss users out there who become unsatisfied with the worsening of Glide floss quality in recent years, especially with the tendency to break prematurely, and want to try something else. I was one of those and now I am here to tell you, my adventure has failed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about being able to fit essentials into my wallet.  I have had several occasions where I desperately need floss, and now I won&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore!  They each contain 12 yards, and easily fit in a credit card slot of your wallet.  I was worried about the thickness, but it is just as thin as a regular credit card.  It says they are &amp;#34;Ultra light waxed&amp;#34; which I would agree with, because you can&#x27;t really tell that it&#x27;s waxed, but it helps keep the floss from fraying.</li>
    <li> A long time ago, we got one as a promotional item from a dentist.  Now, we can&#x27;t live without them.  Great to stick in your wallet or purse.</li>
    <li> I have looked and looked for this online and I am so glad it is now available on Amazon. The floss is in a credit-card-like dispenser and the floss fits easily between teeth. Highly recommended for people who want great floss in convenient packaging making it possible to take this anywhere.</li>
    <li> Thin yet strong, perfect for closely spaced teeth.  Compact size for slipping in pocket or wallet.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss if you have very tight spaces between your teeth. I like having multiple cards, so I can keep one at home, work, car, etc.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered it sooner! Product is excellent and such a lifesaver for those flossing emergencies. I used to carry around a pack of dental floss which was such a burden and now I can bring this in my bag or put it in my wallet or pocket, and it&#x27;s so easy and light to carry.  I also get tons of compliments on it! Everyone should own one!</li>
    <li> These flosscards are great and so convenient to carry in your pocket, purse andeven a wallet. I love them.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. These are super easy to carry around, especially in a wallet. I&#x27;m glad I have found these, much easier than keeping a more bulky conventional floss pack in my pocket.</li>
    <li> Perfect for carrying everyday in your wallet.  I also added one to the dental component of my first aid kit.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about Flosscard and I love it! It fits perfectly in my wallet or my pocket when I am on the go. I am always worried about having something stuck in my teeth during a business meeting or a night out, but now that I carry my Flosscard I never have to worry. The design is very clever. I definitely would recommend Flosscard to anyone looking for a great way to advertise his or her business- you are able to personalize it.</li>
    <li> The Flosscard is very convenient and great to have in a pinch! I carry it with me all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
    <li> Neat idea. I have been looking for something like this for a long time. Beats having a piece of floss floating around the wallet.</li>
    <li> Great handy item to easily have on hand - excellent gift item for customers, they love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best way to carry floss away from home. These little cards fit easily in a wallet are are the same size as a credit card. Instead of carrying a bulky dispenser, you have 36 feet of floss close at hand. I also keep one in the console of my truck (for daily use) and stuck one in my first aid kit (as a spare or to use for an emergency situation). If you backpack or have a Bug out Bag, this is one of those items that you cannot do without. They fit perfect in an Altoids tin if you use one to carry small items.</li>
    <li> A dentist I worked for handed these out to his patients and I always carried one around in my purse.  I just used the last one and decided to order my own to hand out as gifts to friends and patients.  It is great floss and holds more than the average floss sample we hand out. Fits perfectly in my wallet!&lt;br /&gt;Jill - Registered Dental Hygienist</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered Flosscard dental floss from Amazon. I had been getting Flosscards from my dentist on every visit but needed to replenish them more often than the annual dental checkup. So I get them from Amazon and carry one in my credit card wallet at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re out and about, the convenience of having a Flosscard for dental hygeine is unmatched.</li>
    <li> +++++  DEFINITELY A 5-STAR  A+ ITEM.  ARRIVED AS ADVERTISED &amp; FAST.  EXCELLENT WAY TO CARRY YOUR FLOSS &amp; IT IS VG FLOSS.  IT JUST DOESN&#x27;T GET MUCH BETTER - THANK YOU, gene</li>
