      <li>Otherwise i love it..</li>
      <li>I spend a lot more time trying to make this work than a $10 box of hair color from the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>more could you want?</li>

      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>Will use  more  to see.</li>
      <li>Very gentle and safe!</li>
      <li>I think my natural hair color is just too light to get great results from this product.</li>
      <li>I also go it very quickly in the mail.</li>

      <li>This product made my hair shine and filled in all of the damaged areas.</li>

      <li>I just wish there was a color chart available so that the color I was looking to achieve could have been.</li>

      <li>For beautiful color, shine, and healthy looking hair, there is not a better singular product.</li>
      <li>No bad smell.</li>
      <li>I love the cellophane line but most likely I won&#x27;t be buying it from this seller again.</li>
      <li>so healthy looking that the natural hair looks as healthy as it really is now.  </li>
      <li>Love it and cant live without it.</li>
      <li>What fun to mix</li>
      <li>I used this product and noticed that my hair was very shiny but oily especially near the roots at the top of my head.  </li>
      <li>First off...</li>
      <li>Love the various range of colors in one tube.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>Great hair coloring product as long as you know how to time properly.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it without the heat, it did not adhere to the hair as well.</li>
      <li>so I will use it, but I have to alternate with a more permanent color that takes hold of my hair</li>
      <li>i have graduated to semi permanent hair color, doing it less frequently, and using this stuff once a week to help diminish the contrast at my roots with my permanently dyed hair and it is helping greatly while i make the transition.</li>
      <li>and wow BLINDING shine, healthier looking hair and RICH color</li>
      <li>old African American woman who decided to use this product after having an allergic reaction of another hair coloring product that contained PPD&#x27;S. I thought this would be a great alternative.</li>
      <li>my hair turned out almost black but now is lightening to a nice brown</li>
      <li>I have  not used it  much  yet  </li>
      <li>No matter how much I have washed my hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;cool-toned.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Make sure to follow the instructions carefully.  </li>
      <li>I really like this</li>
      <li>It also covers gray very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to continue to use it until I&#x27;m done with my bottle, but I would have loved if it would have at least covered the 10 greys I have.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased the Cellophanes in Coffee Bean, and I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>Since my hair is fine, this product goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s hair needs new life!</li>
      <li>Also when choosing from sebastian&#x27;s color range be realistic, if you are brunette do not expect for any of the lighter colors like the blondes or reds to provided a drastic change because it wont.</li>
      <li>After first applying it, the gray disappeared but after the first wash with conditioner, all the gray was back.</li>
      <li>I used to do it every six months but know that im older</li>
      <li>My hair now has a natural shine that was missing and is so soft and healthy!</li>
      <li>I am transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair, so this gives my hair so much gloss.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the Deep Brunette color and was really reluctant at first to use it.</li>
      <li>Every single product I&#x27;ve used from their considerable product line has been fantastic.</li>
      <li>Cellophane makes your hair seem thicker because it coats the hair, sealing the hair shaft and making your dry split ends disapear  leaving your hair looking SUPER</li>
      <li>I used this product and wow!</li>
      <li>I completely recommend it!</li>
      <li>Besides of the nice coffee bean color,  it made my face look soft, the texture of the product is not too dense, so it does not run down your hair (dry your hair w/ towel first), it also left my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
      <li>First, it looks really dark when it is first put in your hair.  </li>
      <li>It leaves m y hair soft and the color is very natural.</li>
      <li>Many times when African- Americans transition from relaxed hair, the natural hair is left dry and brittle looking.  </li>
      <li>If you want a \\&quot;glaze\\&quot; mix 3/4 clear with 1/4 color Cellophane.</li>
      <li>It looks perfectly natural when washed out</li>
      <li>The last time really damaged my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product was  old, or had been left in a hot warehouse, but something was different and I returned it.</li>
      <li>I have used this for no less than 15 years.</li>
      <li>The product was not harsh on the hair, and actually left it very soft.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was very pleased with my order!</li>
    <li> It works; it left my hair shinier, smoother, and a richer brunette!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a very nice boost to my haircolor in between salon visits.  Would definitely recommend it and wear gloves.</li>
    <li> I really love the shine that this product leaves on your hair with the color coverage it provides. I used deep brunette which looks basically black on my hair. If you are looking for a color product to give you shine and a hint of color that is not permanent this is for you. Also when choosing from sebastian&#x27;s color range be realistic, if you are brunette do not expect for any of the lighter colors like the blondes or reds to provided a drastic change because it wont.</li>
    <li> Its great, keeps my hair shiny beautiful and all my grey hair is gone in a minute.  Love it and cant live without it.</li>
    <li> Bad quality of product</li>
    <li> I ordered the Sebastian Cellophanes Deep Brunett but received the Expresso Brown instead. I&#x27;m very disappointed :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years to keep imy hair healthy an shiny. I used to do it every six months but know that im older i need to cover my gray hair so i do it more often, although it does not cover as well as a permanent dye.  Otherwise i love it.. I recomend for people thtandont have lots of gray hair to keep the hair shiny and healthy.  I use the cocoa bean for my dark hair</li>
    <li> This product made my hair shine and filled in all of the damaged areas. Very gentle and safe! I completely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I recently found out that traditional hair color, even hair rinses was making my relaxed hair break and shed.  I read many reviews and the overview of the Sebastian Cellophanes, and how easy and gentle they were for the hair.  I ordered the Deep Brunette color and was really reluctant at first to use it. I waited a couple of weeks before finally using it.  I am SO HAPPY with this product.  It does exactly what it says it does. I have a magnificent dark hue and awesome shine on my hair now.  I am transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair, so this gives my hair so much gloss.  Many times when African- Americans transition from relaxed hair, the natural hair is left dry and brittle looking.  This cellophane gives hair a sheen that is so healthy looking that the natural hair looks as healthy as it really is now.  It also covers gray very well.  I am extremely happy with this product and have experienced no breakage or shedding.  I am sold on this product, so glad that Amazon stocks it.</li>
    <li> After first applying it, the gray disappeared but after the first wash with conditioner, all the gray was back. Color did not provide shine either.</li>
    <li> First off... I have used cellophanes before, but this one was different that the others I have used. This one STINKS!!!!! I almost threw up while applying. Even after showering and shampooing, my hair still stinks!! The color isn&#x27;t too bad but it also isnt as shiny as the last cellophane gloss that I used. I look at the back of the bottle and realized that it was manufactured in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it might have been spoiled. I love the cellophane line but most likely I won&#x27;t be buying it from this seller again.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair.  I have A LOT of hair and I still have enough product for a second job.  Cellophane dyes usually strip off of my grays after a week or so.  This product has not come off and it has been 3 weeks.  There are a couple of things to keep in mind.  First, it looks really dark when it is first put in your hair.  My hairdresser thought I bought the wrong color.  It looks perfectly natural when washed out and your hair is styled.  Second, the dark dye stays on your scalp until the first wash.  It did not get on my clothes or bedding but my nails were dark after I ran my fingers through my hair and it took me a couple of days to figure it out.  It washed off of my hands very easily.  All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  My hair texture has improved.</li>
    <li> I am a 47 yr. old African American woman who decided to use this product after having an allergic reaction of another hair coloring product that contained PPD&#x27;S. I thought this would be a great alternative. After using Sebastian cellophanes I lost a great deal of hair especially when I washed it and would never recommended this product. I have headaches, tightening of the scalp and my hair is so thin you can see my scalp. USE WITH CAUTION!!!!!!!!!! I scheduled an appointment with my Dermotolgist for a scalp biopsy next week. I am devastated, embarassed to be seen and just plain sick of losing hair and being in pain!!!!</li>
    <li> I love Sebastian Cellophanes! Deep Brunett is dark, the longer you leave it on the hair the darker it gets.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves an amazing shine to the hair!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used \\&quot;Cellophanes\\&quot; for years and hoped this product was still the same,well it was ! Sebastian products have been synonymous with quality for years. Every single product I&#x27;ve used from their considerable product line has been fantastic. After noticing that the 9 bucks a box hair coloring I was using was \\&quot;frying\\&quot; my hair (and not always covering the greys) I remembered Cellophanes.They work differently from other hair products in that they don&#x27;t use a \\&quot;mixer\\&quot; (which is almost always peroxide) Cellophane makes your hair seem thicker because it coats the hair, sealing the hair shaft and making your dry split ends disapear  leaving your hair looking SUPER SHINY.The Deep Brunette color is a very dark brown (Like strong coffee) and next time I will mix it with the CLEAR Cellophane I bought-to get a less \\&quot;intense\\&quot; color . Just wash hair, towel dry (leave damp) apply AND apply heat. I wrapped my hair in Saran Wrap and used a hand blow dryer(moving it around my head for 20 minutes) and wow BLINDING shine, healthier looking hair and RICH color -what more could you want? Oh yeah 1 tube goes A LONG WAY. If you&#x27;re just looking for INSANE SHINE,buy the clear. If you want a \\&quot;glaze\\&quot; mix 3/4 clear with 1/4 color Cellophane.I am not a hairdresser BUT my Sister, Father , Uncle Frank, Brother-in-law and 2 cousins were! I was introduced to Cellophanes years ago. Try them ,you&#x27;ll thank me ![[ASIN:B00187Y4M4 Sebastian NEW Laminates Cellophanes, Deep Brunette (Coffee Bean)]]</li>
    <li> Great product and results; Placed an order for deep brunette and received espresso (brown) instead.</li>
    <li> I think my natural hair color is just too light to get great results from this product. I spend a lot more time trying to make this work than a $10 box of hair color from the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I paid for it so I will use it, but I have to alternate with a more permanent color that takes hold of my hair better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way: It has mauve (pinkish) undertone. It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;cool-toned.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have  not used it  much  yet  as  I had  cellophane treatment  just before I received it. Will use  more  to see.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it!  Works as described. No bad smell. Last long enough. I will by it again. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I love this is covers well and is a great price. I have had several uses from this size and i like the resuslts</li>
    <li> I really do love using Sebastian Laminates Cellphanes.  Coffee bean did a great job of covering my gray.  My only issue is that no matter what I do, this color still comes out black on my hair.  But, I didn&#x27;t notice any damage and the gray was definitely taken care of.</li>
    <li> For beautiful color, shine, and healthy looking hair, there is not a better singular product.</li>
    <li> i mean i&#x27;m really going grey by trying to stop dyeing my hair after 30 years! i have graduated to semi permanent hair color, doing it less frequently, and using this stuff once a week to help diminish the contrast at my roots with my permanently dyed hair and it is helping greatly while i make the transition. i just wish there was a cellophane or two for grey haired ladies i could use to enhance the horridly drab shade of grey i will be when my mission is completed!</li>
    <li> I personally love all things Sebastian.  Love the shampoos, Penetraitt and Drench, are my all time favorites!  I recently purchased the Cellophanes in Coffee Bean, and I was not disappointed.  Although it does not fully cover regrowth and gray it gave my hair a beautiful....sheen? shine?....and the color is AMAZING!! My hair is very dark,  the color is perfect looked natural.  This works more like a glaze.  Make sure to follow the instructions carefully.  I wrapped my hair in a plastic cap and applied heat...you get the best results that way. The first time I tried it without the heat, it did not adhere to the hair as well. My hair felt fuller each time and looked and felt &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34;. Receive many compliments after I use the product.  Washes completely out in a few shampoos. Since my hair is fine, this product goes a long way.  Would recommend if you are looking for a gloss, glaze, type of color. If you are looking for a permanent hair color then this is not it.  LOVE, love, Loveeeee, Sebastian products.  One of the best products out there for hair care.</li>
    <li> product sent to a second party so unable to evaluate</li>
    <li> It did not cover the few grays I have and seemed to fade with the first 2 washes. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it until I&#x27;m done with my bottle, but I would have loved if it would have at least covered the 10 greys I have.</li>
    <li> For a long time i was looking for a product i could use in my black hair right after relaxing it. My sister recommended me try this Deep Brunette from Sebastian, so I decided to give it a try. This is the product I was looking for.  Besides of the nice coffee bean color,  it made my face look soft, the texture of the product is not too dense, so it does not run down your hair (dry your hair w/ towel first), it also left my hair shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, but this tube had an entirely different consistency and smell. The product also did not cover my greys. I don&#x27;t know if this product was  old, or had been left in a hot warehouse, but something was different and I returned it.</li>
    <li> Great for in between color appointments.  Refreshes color and lessens roots.  Get gloves, hair cap and brushes to make life easier.  It will stain everything in your bathroom, so use with care.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It leaves m y hair soft and the color is very natural.I have used this for no less than 15 years.</li>
    <li> The product did not work.  I am concerned with the quality and shelf life of the product.  I am extremely unhappy with this product</li>
    <li> Great hair coloring product as long as you know how to time properly. Love the various range of colors in one tube. Great delivery and dependable</li>
    <li> very, very dark. my hair turned out almost black but now is lightening to a nice brown</li>
    <li> The application was easy and the color held well. The product was not harsh on the hair, and actually left it very soft. I just wish there was a color chart available so that the color I was looking to achieve could have been.</li>
    <li> I am Asian with course thick hair and it felt dull so I wanted to make it shiny.  I used this product and noticed that my hair was very shiny but oily especially near the roots at the top of my head.  No matter how much I have washed my hair I can&#x27;t get the greasy feeling out, it&#x27;s horrible!</li>
    <li> I really like this, the coffee bean color looked black on my dark hair, which I love as it doesn&#x27;t come in black. I would not purchase again as it has parabens and I&#x27;ve sworn off those. For those who don&#x27;t mind, get it, it lasts great 6-8 weeks (using a color safe shampoo), it&#x27;s not going to color your hair like a traditional dye, it&#x27;s doing to give it a shine in the tint of the color you pick (it&#x27;s supposed to compliment  your hair color).</li>
    <li> I have Sisterlocks (I&#x27;m African American) that has been colored several times. The last time really damaged my hair. Then the color faded. It left my hair a reddish brown color that was dry looking and hard. I used this product and wow! My hair now has a natural shine that was missing and is so soft and healthy! I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s hair needs new life!</li>
    <li> This is excellent! While being terribly allergic to even the gentlest color developer in standard hair coloring products, I can use these cellophanes with great results and no fear!!! What fun to mix-n-match!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used it on my hair a few years back and I loved the way it made my hair feel.  It was difficult to get in Bermuda and that&#x27;s why I attempted to order on line.  Have been using it ever since especially because it has no chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> Did not cover grays and where it did cover it&#x27;s washing out after the 1st week.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Best color I have ever used. I also go it very quickly in the mail. Happy!</li>
    <li> I finally found the perfect hair color that covers all my gray and gives me a beautiful shine. love it.</li>
