### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Seriously awesome product.</li>
      <li>$75 on QVC when I saw this demonstrated about 2 years ago - took a chance and have been sooooooo happy</li>
      <li>I still search and experiment with sprays etc and have had great luck in supplementing the volume created by this iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite straighteners on earth!  </li>
      <li>Works on all lengths of hair for straight locks with body (excellent for bobs).  </li>
      <li>Honestly don&#x27;t have the time or the skill/technique  </li>
      <li>This tool is amazing in that it&#x27;s easy,</li>
      <li>Or you can curl and flip better than most straighteners.</li>
      <li>(they will not warrant products bought from unauthorized sellers as they say there are many fakes)..</li>
      <li>or else you pictures should be better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Great idea needs to be a better quality.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>I thought I would like this for adding lift to the top and sides of my hair.</li>
      <li>Got it for the volume at the roots and it is so much better at the roots than the curling</li>
      <li>they have a curved plate which is just perfect for my short, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I did find it tricky to use on longer, fine hair textures.  </li>
      <li>just googled this iron to see if it still available because I don&#x27;t want to ever be without</li>
      <li>T3 make great flat irons and so does Hair Art.</li>
      <li>the flat iron looks good, and heat very quickly.</li>
      <li>My husband a very clever guy has not been able to figure out just how to fix it.  </li>
      <li>it - mine still works fine and it is great to see that it is half what I paid for</li>
      <li>While it is advertised as a tool to give volume to short hair, I actually use it to add awesome curls to my medium-long hair.</li>
      <li>After a while the connection becomes worn and the wires must sit in just the right directions for the iron to heat.  </li>
      <li>Light weight easy to use only wish it had an automatic shut off</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair with very little body of its own without adding a lot of product  </li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>using to curl however, it worked pretty nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this for nearly 3 years and it is still going strong with absolutely zero problems.</li>
      <li>I love them because even though they say they are flat</li>
      <li>Tried all sorts of sprays mouses, gels and of course curling iron absolutely always.&lt;br /&gt;Paid</li>
      <li>fast to use it gives my hair movement and body</li>
      <li>very unsatisfied..</li>
      <li>This is nowhere nearly as effective as the T3 flat irons, which beat Chi and every other kind hands down.</li>
      <li>I do not like the way the light continuously blinks, and it either doesn&#x27;t curl right down low or is too hot at a higher range.  </li>
      <li>I like the curved flat iron and it did heat up super fast.</li>
      <li>I order these again and again because of their particular shape and heat settings with an off and on switch.</li>
      <li>and I am a huge fan--there is nothing that comes anywhere near their blow dryers and flat irons.</li>
      <li>So I didn&#x27;t use it normally.</li>
      <li>Wife promptly went online to register her brand new T3.  </li>
      <li>guess we&#x27;ll keep it, but for sure be careful who we buy our next ROLEX from.</li>
      <li>I have short, fine, flat hair.  </li>
      <li>Small print implies they cannot guarantee the product is authentic.  </li>
      <li>my first experience with a T3 product and I am pleased...recently had my medium length hair cut extremely short and</li>
      <li>It tended to leave kinks down the hair shaft when using it to smooth and add body.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>/&gt;The effects last much of the day, far longer than any curling iron.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it for short hair</li>
      <li>it is already straight and flat.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a flat iron curler really</li>
      <li>this dome-plated iron &#x27;works like a charm&#x27;...much better than a small barrel curling iron, not kinky curls, just terrific volume and style.</li>
      <li>Major difficulty getting it returned.</li>
      <li>Same issues expressed by other user....doesn&#x27;t grip hair so the heat doesn&#x27;t stay on the hair long enough to smooth, curl or defrizz.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, and was probably not worth the money.</li>
      <li>I can do my entire head in under 20 minutes with minimal effort and the curl usually sticks for 2-3 days with minimal touching up.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a flat iron curler really but I love it. T3 make great flat irons and so does Hair Art.</li>
    <li> Has rough areas that pull my hair plus does not completely close. You cannot use a small amount of hair like your bangs as it does not close tight enough.</li>
    <li> I have short, fine, flat hair.  Always desperate for volume.  Tried all sorts of sprays mouses, gels and of course curling iron absolutely always.&lt;br /&gt;Paid $75 on QVC when I saw this demonstrated about 2 years ago - took a chance and have been sooooooo happy since!&lt;br /&gt;Yes there is a learning curve and it takes patience and time.  If you have hair like mine ...you already expect that!&lt;br /&gt;The effects last much of the day, far longer than any curling iron.  I still search and experiment with sprays etc and have had great luck in supplementing the volume created by this iron.&lt;br /&gt;I just googled this iron to see if it still available because I don&#x27;t want to ever be without it - mine still works fine and it is great to see that it is half what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy to straighten my hair....it is already straight and flat.  Got it for the volume at the roots and it is so much better at the roots than the curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;Getting a spare for travel and work!</li>
    <li> The worst product.  Same issues expressed by other user....doesn&#x27;t grip hair so the heat doesn&#x27;t stay on the hair long enough to smooth, curl or defrizz.</li>
    <li> I have all things T3 and I am a huge fan--there is nothing that comes anywhere near their blow dryers and flat irons. I thought I would like this for adding lift to the top and sides of my hair. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much, and was probably not worth the money. It is as though the plates don&#x27;t come close enough to the edges of the sides, and doesn&#x27;t grip the hair tightly. It is difficult for me to get even a curve in the areas I want.

    <li> I like the curved flat iron and it did heat up super fast. Bad things no auto shut off and it died after only a couple months of use.&lt;br /&gt;Great idea needs to be a better quality. Was shocked by the price that it was such poor quality.</li>
    <li> Hinge broke within one week of purchase. Buy on overstock instead, can purchase a one or two year warranty for around $10</li>
    <li> Had it for 2 months and it came apart in my hand.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Light weight easy to use only wish it had an automatic shut off</li>
    <li> Wife promptly went online to register her brand new T3.  One business day later, she received an email from info@t3micro.com that this item was purchased from an unauthorized reseller as specified in their terms and warrantees. Small print implies they cannot guarantee the product is authentic.  Choice is to return or use with no warranty.  Since it&#x27;s pretty hard to explain hair strands- guess we&#x27;ll keep it, but for sure be careful who we buy our next ROLEX from.</li>
    <li> I do not like the way the light continuously blinks, and it either doesn&#x27;t curl right down low or is too hot at a higher range.  I also use a product for curling irons on my hair to help protect and curl my hair.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!  It is the 2nd I&#x27;ve purchased in the last year, both burned out in 3 months, just days after replacement expired.  Item was cared for, babied actually, and used not more than 3 times per week.  BAD INVESTMENT.  Shame-on distributer for having a short replacement time for a horrible product.  It works beautifully....until it DOESN&#x27;T!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t appear to be what I thought it was.  I guess I didn&#x27;t understand or else you pictures should be better.  I didn&#x27;t like it, so I sent it back.</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these flat irons I have had.  I love them because even though they say they are flat they have a curved plate which is just perfect for my short, fine hair.  They do have a weak point where the wire is connected to the iron itself.  After a while the connection becomes worn and the wires must sit in just the right directions for the iron to heat.  My husband a very clever guy has not been able to figure out just how to fix it.  I order these again and again because of their particular shape and heat settings with an off and on switch.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair kit and I really like it for short hair - it adds loads of body and texture. I did find it tricky to use on longer, fine hair textures.  It tended to leave kinks down the hair shaft when using it to smooth and add body.&lt;br /&gt;When using to curl however, it worked pretty nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just know that if you want to use this for voluming and smoothing and you have longer FINE hair, you may find it difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair with very little body of its own without adding a lot of product  This tool is amazing in that it&#x27;s easy, fast to use it gives my hair movement and body I&#x27;d otherwise have to get from a half hour with a round brush and blow dryer.  Honestly don&#x27;t have the time or the skill/technique  It&#x27;s like a flat iron and curling iron (if you want it to) in one. I use on the lowest heat to flatten and flip and I still achieve a piecey look.  I would definitely recommend this item as a must have tool in your tool belt!</li>
    <li> after I bought it, I cut my long hair. So I didn&#x27;t use it normally. the flat iron looks good, and heat very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for nearly 3 years and it is still going strong with absolutely zero problems. While it is advertised as a tool to give volume to short hair, I actually use it to add awesome curls to my medium-long hair. I can do my entire head in under 20 minutes with minimal effort and the curl usually sticks for 2-3 days with minimal touching up. I&#x27;ve attached a picture of my hair curled with the iron. It was probably 90º that day at an amusement park and the curls stayed in tact. Seriously awesome product.</li>
    <li> very unsatisfied..i think it was refurbished..  did not line up and hair caught in plates.</li>
    <li> It initially worked as described but stopped working after 3 uses.  Major difficulty getting it returned.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite straighteners on earth!  Previously owned it personally and purchased an extra one for my salon.  Works on all lengths of hair for straight locks with body (excellent for bobs).  Or you can curl and flip better than most straighteners.</li>
