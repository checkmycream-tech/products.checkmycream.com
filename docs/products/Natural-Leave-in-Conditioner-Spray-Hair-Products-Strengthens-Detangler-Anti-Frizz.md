<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for my dry hair in the winter. I love how I can spray it in, just like hair spray, it makes the conditioner easy to use and control to get it where I need it, mostly on the ends, but I also put a little all over. I am so happy to find a conditioner that is all natural, I had noticed that the more chemicals a product had in it, the worse my hair was later on down the road. This is a great value, I will continue to use this conditioner :)</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about this product but wanted to try something new. My old detangler left my hair feeling dry and brittle, and it usually took a lot of product to detangle my unruly curly hair. The first time I used this product I was blown away! It doesn&#x27;t take too much to work, and as soon as I applied it my hair was so easy to comb I thought it had to be witchcraft! My hair smelled great throughout the day and didn&#x27;t hold on to other odors like it usually did, which I LOVE. I try not to use heat on my hair (dryer, curling/flat iron, etc) so I&#x27;m not sure how it holds up with those styling techniques. The only thing I feel this product is lacking is UV protection (I live in a very hot, sunny climate so this is essential in styling products for me). I can safely say that I&#x27;ve found a permanent fixture to my styling routine!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she really liked it. Her hair is very dry, and as a result, gets very tangled in the winter months.  This products helps her brush or comb her hair without the tearing her hair out while attempting to brush it.</li>
    <li> Package leaked. The conditioner is sticky and smells like cleaning product.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair that developed with age. I applied the product after washing my hair &amp; air dried it &amp; it looks smooth, has a soft feel &amp; shine. I&#x27;ll wait to see how it goes this week &amp; will apply it daily if needed. I&#x27;ve tried so many products that didn&#x27;t work, but I really like this one so far. I&#x27;ll update my review at a later date if I can. UPDATE: I love this product!</li>
    <li> Just got it. Really don&#x27;t know if I like it. Still better than what I was using.</li>
    <li> After several uses I have decided that I like this product It tames, smooths and controls recently permed hair. It does not moisturize very much so this may  be done separately if flyaway hair is a problem. Now that my perm has been trimmed I find a little spray keeps my hair in place without sticky spray and absolutely no frizz!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Hair is soft and smooth, smells good and no static!  Easy to use!</li>
    <li> I really like this hair spray, it is all natural and have a very light smell. It really hold my haiir together and it is not greasy or oily. It also does not drip or stain your clothes. I love that it is all natural</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> My hair does not tend to tangle a lot and needs minimal conditioning, but my sisters, and one of my nieces have different hair types, and one in particular could not get by at all without leave in conditioner. Her hair would look an unkempt tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When her birthday came up recently, I decided to surprise her by buying her some of the leave in conditioner. In addition to the fact that she rants and raves about the stuff, which both her and her daughter began using every day, her hair looks absolutely great now. It has made a great difference for her and she does not need as much time in the morning in order to get ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she really likes the way it smells, and another thing is that the conditioner is not overly greasy either, so you dont look like your hair is dirty when you have this stuff in it, like you sometimes do with cheap leave in conditioners. This was a great find and it has made a big deal for my family. It is hightly recommended.</li>
    <li> My sister purchased this for me and gave me a bottle. I am really impressed with this leave-in conditioner. I have very thick and dry hair, which is a horrible mix. I always get my hair cut short since because my hair is thick and always dry I get the worst knots in my hair, which is always painful to get out. Even with short hair I still get bad knots. This product is excellent to use for detangling and it smells amazing! It makes my hair very shiny and leaves it feeling really soft. Also another thing that I love is that it does not weigh my hair down so I think this product works great for people who have thick hair like myself. I am glad my sister gave me a bottle of this!</li>
    <li> Good product. Leaves my hair feeling manageable and healthy without weight or greasiness.</li>
    <li> Did not detangle my daughter&#x27;s curly and kinky hair.</li>
    <li> I am always careful about choosing a product for my hair. I just don’t want to use a wrong one and make my hair drier as it is. So when I saw that this product has great reviews, I was excited to get one for me. And I didn’t regret it. It works so well on my hair. One thing that I love about this product is, it doesn’t have alcohol. They only use natural ingredients so, no harmful chemicals for my hair. My husband loves touching my hair, and he noticed that it become really smooth. This product has a 30-day money back guarantee if you’re not satisfied with it. Well, I am not getting my money back instead; I will order a lot of this great product. I really love it!</li>
    <li> I seldom use any type of conditioner because my hair strands are thin and oily and I&#x27;m afraid that if I will be exposing my hair to too much chemical, eventually I go bald. But this Leave-In Tensile Strengthener -Natural Leave in Conditioner is amazing. I just tried it because it guaranteed that its made of natural and organic products and help tangled hair, which I always have when outside doing my errands. At the end of the day, it look greasy and plastered to my head. The Natural Leave in Conditioner Spray really met expectations and more.  My hair have volume now and its very smooth and silky, no more greasy-thin looking hair. The scent is very mild also. I&#x27;m very much satisfied. Will never stop using it. I love it!</li>
    <li> A great little item.  I have curly hair that gets damaged pretty easily, and needs to be conditioned well.  This Leave in Conditioner worked perfectly, and is easy to take with me, wherever I go, for whenever I feel the need to use it.  I&#x27;m also a little bit of an eco-warrior, so the environmentally friendly chemicals are a great plus to have here!  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> looks good came n a smaller bottle did not try this product will try then make a comment</li>
    <li> Great product; Can&#x27;t wait to reorder!!!</li>
    <li> When I was growing up, and was well into my 30&#x27;s, my hair was always as straight as could be. For some reason, it decided to take on a natural wave after I hit 40 and I had no idea what to do with it. The waves aren&#x27;t naturally smooth, they frizz like crazy unless I use multiple products to keep it under control. Most leave in products weigh my hair down and leave it feeling heavy, but this leave in conditioner is both light and effective, keeping my frizz under control without having to use a lot of other products with it. I am extremely happy with it and will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I never thought I would be able to find a product for my hair. My hair has been extremely damaged from the countless amounts of coloring my hair and curling it. I used many over the counter products in hopes of my hair becoming healthier, being less frizzy, looking shiny and not having to put a million products just to calm my hair down. When I ordered this product, I was skeptical only because many other products failed me. I was totally wrong. This product has left my hair soft, shiny and no more frizzy hair. I am so happy that I got this product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff at our house! I have 2 daughters and we have tried lots of detangling sprays. I love the ingredients and it makes my daughters&#x27; hair so soft and smooth and much easier to brush. We have bought this twice now.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this were so good that I tried it.  This stuff actually damaged my hair, it&#x27;s in worse shape now than before!</li>
    <li> This product works great on my curly, frizzy, fine hair.  My wet hair combs out very easily after I spray the product on after washing.  Wash out conditioner doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  The smell is great also.  I need to figure out how to either reactivate it or perhaps re-wet my hair and spray a little more on for frizz control on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair since I only wash my hair once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> At first weeks it was a great detangler to my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;But after all it makes her hair so dry, so we thought of a need to always use this product.&lt;br /&gt;She also surprisingly help me with her curiosity checking the ingredients, she mentioned to me that it contains Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) the chemical substance that we have got rid off our household since our kids got allergy and sensitive skins. MIT is a highly corrosive chemical that has been found to be toxic when ingested, inhaled, or applied to the skin or eyes in animal studies according to the EPA in the 1998 document,&amp;#34;Reregistration Eligibility Decision, Methylisothiazolinone.&lt;br /&gt;For a quick, instant fix of your hair, it truly saves your day, but think of a long term use for us. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is different from most because it is liquid rather then a cream. I love it as a liquid more than the cream because I can just spray this leave in conditioner in my hair. I have curly hair and an oily scalp. It always makes me nerves when I add leave in conditioner in my scalp because I don&#x27;t want my scalp to be oilier. With this leave in conditioner it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp any oilier which is amazing because other leave in conditioner have done that. This product makes my hair look healthy and leaves it shiny. The bottle makes it sound like you just spray this product in your hair and you don&#x27;t need heat protective spray. I really like this leave in conditioner because the results are amazing. I received this product to test and review in exchange for my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> After chemo therapy my hair became brittle and split end nightmare! I was given this leave in conditioner to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion. This is a god sent for me. I have tired those store bought hair treatment to try and fix my hair and hope I can get that healthy hair I use to have. After day one of using this conditioner I started to notice a difference in my hair, then using this conditioner everyday my hair is getting that healthy glow, soft to the touch, its getting thicker and I went to hair stylist and she was shocked to see a difference in my hair. I was giving up but this leave in conditioner is the real deal. I also compared to the store bought product to this and I was shocked! There was so much chemicals in the store bought answering so much questions on why my hair was not getting better, this leave in conditioner is natural and it really works. The frizzy, split ends and flat hair is gone. My hair is healthier, fuller, and shiny matching with my health! I highly recommend this leave in conditioner to everyone who is having a hard time controlling their hair. Oh and the scent is so nice I have caught my husband sniffing my hair lol</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner I have ever used.  Leaves my hair silky smooth and soft to touch. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review. I have really thick long hair and its wavy/curly. I have tried many products that claim it will help with the frizz and keep it straight for up to 72 hours after I use my flat iron. If it&#x27;s raining I can&#x27;t wear my hair down if it&#x27;s hot or humid I can&#x27;t wear my hair down, usually only during the late fall or winter is the best time for my hair to be down.  Well, none of those have worked until I found this one. First I was surprised how nice to smelled. It helps detangle my hair and doesn&#x27;t weight it down. All natural ingredients is a huge plus! My hair now is manageable and  I don&#x27;t have to worry about going out with my hair down and becoming a puffy frizzy mess!</li>
    <li> Item shipped quickly and well packaged. Vendor sent follow up email. Have only used the product a couple of times so far. Works very well as a detangler and I like the smell. As a conditioner, it does make my soft when I scrunch my hair and smooth when I straighten, so overall, very happy at this time.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair more manageable. It does not weigh down my hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work leaves your hair sticky</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It left my hair soft and nice feeling.  It has a very pleasant &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; smell, which I like compared to some that are very strong perfume.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo26Y3LDADTRSYZ]]This is a really great and simple leave in conditioner for all hair types. I personally have thin, straight, and damaged hair from bleaching it. I have issues with the bleached ends of my hair getting really frizzy and unmanageable, but it left my hair feeling really smooth and silky without feeling greasy which can happen easily with my hair. Also a big plus that it is paraben free!</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my daughter&#x27;s curly frizzy hair as well as my straight hair that gets frizzy with humidity. This product has worked great on both of our hair types. It&#x27;s easy to just spray on when your hair is damp and comb through. The smell is great too, it has a light peach/apricot scent that isn&#x27;t too over powering. It definitely has made our hair more manageable too, which is a plus! I like that it&#x27;s not a heavy product, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy. It&#x27;s a good size to travel with too. This is a great product and I have no complaints about it! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My girl had problems with her hair not being straight and smooth. She tried other hair conditioners but they did not work for her. This hair conditioner worked perfectly for her. Now her hair is straight and smooth because of this hair conditioner. Every woman should get this!</li>
    <li> I love this product.I have been using this Leave in Conditioner to help repair my hair.It was soo damaged,dry, &amp; brittle.I used a lot of heat tools over time which caused it to get soo dry and damaged.I found this product and have been using it daily.It repaired my hair making it smooth manageable and healthy looking.I love it.I have stopped using heat tools and have not dyed my hair just using this leave in conditioner.It has does wonders!!I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good relairing leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Ordered to help repair my daughters wavy hair before she starts making appointments to meet with local modeling agencies. Her hair has been looking pretty frazzled in this especially dry Texas heat. Did a great job repairing and giving it that long smooth hydrated healthy look. Smells great. I love that it is so easy for her to use, she can just quickly spray before or after she styles and it doesn&#x27;t leave her hair with that greasy or weighed down look.</li>
    <li> When I was younger, my hair was my best asset. It was full and wavy and wash &amp; wear. Now, in my 40&#x27;s, it is very frizzy after a wash. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried tames it completely except for a flat iron. The next best solution thus far is Argan oil. I had high hopes that this product would tame my friz but my hair looked the same as if I did nothing after spraying it on. *Sigh* I&#x27;ll continue my quest for something that&#x27;ll allow me to ditch the flat iron for good. BTW, I am of Asian descent.</li>
    <li> I had problems with my hair not being straight. I tried other hair conditioners but they did not work that good for me. This hair conditioner worked perfectly for me. My hair is now straight and smooth because of it. Every woman should use this!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this product for my hair. With having extremely tight and defined curls, it can difficult to find a conditioner that really feeds my hair, detangles and keeps it well moisturized without making it feel very weighed down. This has really helped with all of that and helped salvage my hair from its very rough state after tough hair styles or climate conditions. I love that it is all natural and Eco Friendly; you can really feel each ingredient do its work...I really don&#x27;t think I have found a product that keeps my hair as soft as this does. Highly recommended to try at least because they offer the money back guarantee which A LOT of people do NOT do. Great great product. Certainly a new favorite.</li>
    <li> Best hair product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find a hair product that compares; this product is so great in my curly hair, and great in my friend’s hair which is straight and thick. It makes hair soft and shiny and easy to brush out, without hair loss, knots or frizz. I love this product because I know that it’s natural, and that it’s doing great things for my hair. I’ve recommended it to a friend who’s a hair stylist, and now she uses it in her salon. I would recommend this product to everyone and anyone who wants great hair.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo21FFJWMWS7UB1]]This is a great product. Excellent for detangling. I love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Taking care of my long hair is very important to me. I have been preparing my hair for my wedding, and I have been trying to grow it as long as possible. The trouble I was having was that my hair was breaking and splitting at the ends due to dryness, tangles, and damage from heat styling. My length was ultimately staying the same month after month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Luxquisite on a whim a few months ago, and it has made a huge difference on the texture and health of my long hair. I believe that this has done a great deal to repair my hair and keep it sleek and smooth so that it doesn&#x27;t tangle as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first time I used it, my hair was less frizzy and much shinier than usual after I blow dried it. While many leave in conditioners make my hair heavy, Luxquisite Leave-In Tensile Strengthener did not. My hair was light, bouncy, and I was still able to get some volume from my hair. My hair always feels softer and more moisturized when I use this awesome leave in conditioner. My hair is finally growing longer, thanks to the fact that I am not having nearly as much knotting or breakage! This is ideal for long hair, damaged hair, color treated hair, or anyone with a bit of dryness or frizziness who could benefit from more strength and moisture.</li>
    <li> Does not control frizz, at all!! My hair is naturally wavy, so I have to have something in it or it will be frizzy and messy. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the pictures. This is a detangler and nothing more. My hair is out of control frizzy with this. Did not &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; it at all.</li>
    <li> Used the leave in conditioner on my hair this morning when I was rushing to work. I didn&#x27;t have time to take a shower because I was rushing and going to be late. I had soooo many compliments on how fantastic my hair looked. I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing my hair looked after a long day working. I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially if you&#x27;re always late like me.</li>
    <li> I really love this deep conditioner here is my video review&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;oU8iFxXinhc&amp;feature&#x3D;youtu.be</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It is controlling my frizziness on these humid weather days. And it keeps my hair tangle free and soft. That&#x27;s a big fear with my highlighted hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement in my hair sine I use this product</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! Smells amazing and not greasy! Also great for when at the beach to keep hair untangled</li>
    <li> I have long, coarse, curly, and heavily unruly hair. I am always on the lookout for something to strengthen it while also calming it down. Leave-in conditioners don&#x27;t always work for me but this one does, and being natural is such a plus. The fact that the ingredients are so amazing (who doesn&#x27;t love aloe vera?) is awesome. I started using it, and my hair was a literal mess. A few weeks later and this is one of my favorite products right now! It has made my hair more manageable, shiny, and I love wearing it down!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I am african american and of course our hair is naturally dry and brittle and we have to constantly moisturize our hair to keep it healthy. With this spray I was able to go 2 days without having to spray my hair the next day. It smells wonderful  love the fruity fragrance not oily at all. I think this spray really is one of the best I have used. I think it works even better after you wash and condition your hair once you are doing washing your hair, spray it on and let it penetrate your scalp you will notice a big difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> This product works great on dry, fine hair and makes my hair smooth and healthy looking. I love that it has natural ingredients which are great for your hair and the environment. It is a great, lightweight product for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Awesome leave in conditioner for my five year old daughter. She has a very curly hair and i had a hard time finding the right product for her. This is perfect and i was so excited about using it in her hair, because i have heard so many good things about it. It leaves her hair so smooth and shiny and we do not have the tangling hair problem anymore. I love it, because everything about it is natural and alcohol free!!! Her hair is full of life, the volume is perfect and it is so silky. My daughter loves the smell too...</li>
    <li> June 26 2015 -  I check on this product regularly, to see if they offer larger sizes at a discounted rate, or if they&#x27;ve lowered their price. They&#x27;ve actually increased it :\ Ugh.  This is a very good hair conditioner. It detangles your hair, it makes your hair shiny and smooth, plus the scene is very pleasant.  I have very thin and straight hair that tends to tangle a lot. I also have a very sensitive scalp. I enjoyed using this product and the way it helped relieve the itch in my scalp.  My 7 year old insisted that I use it on her hair because it smelled like bubble gum (I argue it smells like tootie fruity jelly beans). That leads me to the only problem I find with the product. It is VERY expensive. After a little over two weeks, I am nearing the end of the bottle. To conserve, I diluted the last quarter of it with water, but it isn&#x27;t as effective.  One one hand, when I use it, my hair is extra soft, extra bouncy, and extra easy to manage and style. My scalp is also very pleased when I use this conditioner. On the other hand, I can not justify spending $30 a month on a conditioner.  The product delivers, just not to the average consumers budget. If this was sold in a larger bottle for a more economical price (like a refill) I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many conditioners promising all sorts of things....This one is really amazing.  After my first use the difference in my hair was remarkable.  I am an older woman with  more challenges as my hair has become thinner, dryer and lack luster....I am really glad that I took a chance on this product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Not very good for tangles, but okay as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand what all the buzz is about. My bottle arrived leaky and it smells fishy. I don&#x27;t like it. It stinks and it does nothing for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you experience the same issues as myself make sure you ask for a refund before 30 days. Too bad I waited so long- It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is incredible. Products either make my hair oily, wet looking, crunchy or don&#x27;t they control frizz.  This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well.  My biracial daughter has extremely dry 3c hair.  This is the only product I have used that instantly moisturized and improved the texture of her hair. The cuticle immediately looks sealed and healthy.  I did not use a comb or brush, just worked through her hair.  It defined her natural curl pattern and gave her lots of body and volume.  I wish I had known this was such a winner.  I would have bought two bottles.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as you would expect. I have used it in my thin straight frizzy hair as well as my nieces very curly and out of control hair. It works great in both areas. It leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy without weighing it down. You spray it in damp hair, brush it and style it as you normally would. It has also improved the life of my nieces hair(she uses a flat iron frequently). It seems to help protect her hair from getting any further damaged. It also appears to be bringing her hair back to life over time. I will be purchasing this product in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free of charge for review purposes. All my opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> A. Maz. Ing. This stuff really banishes the frizz from my heavy, thick, 2A/B wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to figure out why all the buzz about this product as it does absolutely NOTHING. I have no time to return it but I would. It is going into the trash!</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair is mixed curly and straighter in other areas also thin and delicate from to much heat. I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and have noticed a big difference in the amount of breakage I was getting. It makes my hair soft and easy to comb as well as not making it to soft and lifeless. I have more body and use it after washing instead of a conditioner. Using a conditioner was making my hair lifeless so I decided to try using this alone and it has made a big difference. I will continue to condition my hair but only once a week using a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> Wonderful spray in conditioner. It is light but does great things for your hair. My hair is very soft and silky after using just a small amount.</li>
    <li> Awesome Item! it leaves my hair just so soft and shiny without weighing it down.  excellent for detangling&lt;br /&gt;great bonus that its paraben free</li>
    <li> Great product for leaving hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> The product is great. Smells awesome and leaves the hair soft and not greasy like some other leave ins. Easy to use and apply. Will use this after a shampoo and not a conditioner since it acts like it.</li>
    <li> Recieved in place for an honest review at a dicounted price ok do me an my girl costantly brush our hair an wash it with both shampoo an conditioner well every morning we get up only to have snarly hair I mean everyday no matter how many times we brush so I decided to check this out from the first day of using it the snarls were not so bad it helps untangle your hair wen brushing an keeps it from tangleing all day ,as well as keeps it shiney an so soft it makes your hair beautiful I love this conditioner it works better than conditioner you wash out an no nasty oily look from leaving in it makes your hair look healthy and shiney its an awesome condioner</li>
    <li> Works well to detangle my hair. I like the fact that it&#x27;s all Natural.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  It makes my hair very manageable and shiny!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite - and only - conditioner. I love how natural it is, and how it is specifically designed to repair my hair from the damaged it has accrued over time. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but the results are still astonishing - my hair feels better, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like there is anything in it. It&#x27;s almost like I put nothing in my hair at all. I will definitely be buying some more!</li>
    <li> this project is very good&lt;br /&gt;my hair is very hard to brush especially when I go without conditioning but When I Spray my hair with this product all of that changes I don&#x27;t like to brush my hair without it now. However 4 stars because I wish I got more product for the price.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3GU8N7H6FBSFZ]]This makes my hair so smooth and shiny without weighing it down  So glad I found this product because it takes hardly any time to apply but makes my hair look so much better.</li>
    <li> This conditioner worked great for me, my hair is very long and tangles easily so I have to use something every time I wash. I loved that it didn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue behind and my hair felt soft and moisturized after use. I&#x27;m pretty sure I could feel the difference with this being a natural rather than chemical based conditioner - it felt different on my hands. The scent was a bit stronger than what I&#x27;m used to - very fruity; but it didn&#x27;t clash with my perfume. I would recommend this product as it did a comparable job to salon brands yet uses only natural ingredients</li>
    <li> I’ve always had dry scalp and oily hair which makes finding the perfect conditioner a nightmare! It seemed like no matter what I tried they were unbalanced. I even quit shampoo and conditioner all together for over a week once as a sort of detox from all the chemical products I had been trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is lightweight and keeps my hair smooth. Even though I have fine hair it is strong and split end free. I apply in the evenings before braiding or tying my hair up. In the morning I take it down and style. Using a quick leave in conditioner versus the traditional rinse out options also saves time during my busy day, which is a bonus.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does a nice job of detangling my hair without making it limp!</li>
    <li> I was always seeking for a conditioner which could make my hair a little bit more smooth and silky instead of leaving it curly and unruly. Well, I found my treasure!&lt;br /&gt;This awesome conditioner didn&#x27;t just make my hair smooth, it also added shine and removed almost all damaged it had. My hair feels like a newborn! I never had that kind of soft hair in my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this, magical conditioner I got it! I can highly recommend it to anyone that has issues with his hair. It will not just cure your hair, but also keep it super-smooth and nice!</li>
    <li> Love this leave in conditioner. Helps to manage my naturally wavy hair, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I have had long hair most of my life. Too keep it long and healthy is not as easy. I have tried many products in the stores and online and nothing seemed to work like this one. The best part its made of Natural healthy ingredients.  This has made my hair smoother,silkier, stronger and it detangles my morning bed hair so easily. I get a lot of compliments on the way my hair looks! It has made me self esteem higher  with all the compliments. This is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I purchased this leave in conditioner to use for my two daughters who both have very curly hair.  Their hair is always tangled and difficult to comb.  I put this is both girl&#x27;s hair after shampooing and was able to easily comb thier wet hair.  The next morning they woke up with soft hair and no tangles.  Love this product and will continue to use it on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> The product did not work as great for my extremely dry hair but it could be that i did not use the product very long. The product did not help with my frizz but did make my hair super soft and it smells great. The seller follows up with an email asking for feedback which tells me they really care about the opinions of the shoppers.</li>
    <li> This is one awesome hair care product. I can&#x27;t stress enough how great it is. I had some seriously damaged and frizzy hair and had gotten used to the idea that my hair was just like that no matter what. A friend recommended this conditioner to me and it&#x27;s like I now have a completely different head of hair. It used to be so difficult to style but now it&#x27;s a breeze to manage. You will not be disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> It strengthens hair as it States.</li>
    <li> WOW WOW WOW!!!!! WISH I COULD GIVE IT 10 STARS. BEST LEAVE IN EVER!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  THANKS FOR AN AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> The product smells good and does make it easier to comb through your hair. I would get this again. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My daughter has quite a lot of really thin hair which gets very tangled very easily. It is a pain (literally) to brush her hair. We just tried this product. I spay it, rub it on her hair, and it does the trick! She is happy. I am happy. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Omg!&lt;br /&gt;Worse product ever,  beside  so expensive  for the tiny  bottle. ...&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I never  will  buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, my hair are so much smoother now, it is so much easier to brush my hair now. My hair are color treated and super dry and damaged, so I am always looking for a treatment for my hair and this leave in conditioner is my new favorite. Plus it smells super good: not overpowering smell of green tea! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this natural leave in conditioner. After I straightened my hair I was always spraying it with hair spray or smothering it with gels and anti frizz junk. It left my hair looking greasy and feeling gross. I heard about this conditioner from a friend and I was so happy to find out it was made with all natural ingredients and is eco friendly. It doesn’t have any harsh chemicals or alcohol which was damaging my hair and making it really dry and brittle. This conditioner makes my hair soft, shiny, smooth and has repaired all of the damage. I would recommend this product for anyone that uses a straightener or blow dryer often.</li>
    <li> This leave-in conditioner is amazing. I have fine, curly hair and most products weigh it down. This one not only isn&#x27;t heavy, but it makes my hair feel soft and defines the curls as well. Will definitely keep an extra bottle on hand so as not to run out.</li>
