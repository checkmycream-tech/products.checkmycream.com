      <li>Love the color its the perfect shade and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>burgundy is like my favorite color now and plus i love dark colors so this was just perfect .</li>
      <li>It does not make my lips chapped and its easy to apply</li>
      <li>when I first looked at it I was like &amp;#34;UGH&amp;#34; but when I put it on it was a nice color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s SUPER comfortable, which I absolutely love.</li>
      <li>I found it to be quite wearable with my light porcelain skin.</li>
      <li>Smooth and creamy, not too shiny.</li>
      <li>The shape of the lipstick and the precise point made it super easy to precisely apply it and cover the lipliner.</li>
      <li>and I love it so much!</li>
      <li>I love it the color is true and last pretty good for me</li>
      <li>Color is bold without being gawdy.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try the trendy, stylish black cherry/burgundy lip color that&#x27;s been prevalent on the runway and in Hollywood.</li>
      <li>Like the color of licorice very much!</li>
      <li>And I loved how I didn&#x27;t have to wait so long for it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard that the nude and light pink colors aren&#x27;t as nice</li>
      <li>I just gave it two stars because it was delivered at the right time.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s pretty much how every light color is.</li>
      <li>It has a healthy staying power, but needs to be reapplied occasionally.</li>
      <li>Def recommend it ESP for the price ;)</li>
      <li>Many dark lipsticks go on blotchy, but this product goes on smoothly and lasts well.  </li>
      <li>It is pretty moisturizing and may require lip liner to prevent feathering.</li>
      <li>Great, long lasting color.</li>
      <li>but when I received it it was more purple than red and the color didn&#x27;t suit me at all.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing tho the shade is a tad dark for me.</li>
      <li>The application is smooth and it has decent staying power unless you&#x27;re having a huge dinner or something, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a moisture-rich formula, so don&#x27;t expect the lasting power of a matte product, but you can easily wear it for an evening without reapplication.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and glides on smoothly :) Definitely would reccomend!</li>
      <li>Very flattering.</li>
      <li>I really get a lot of complements when I wear it.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast as freaak .</li>
      <li>a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tested it out to see true lasting power, but I&#x27;d bet maybe 4 hours if you don&#x27;t touch them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to someone looking to make a bold statement.</li>
      <li>Make sure your lips are exfoliated and use a little balm underneath.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pale so this is really more of a fall color.</li>
      <li>very soft like butter.</li>
      <li>but overall it was a pretty color on me</li>
      <li>Feels like a wet creamy lipstick going on but dries to true color.</li>
      <li>Some brands frequently change the color of the product.</li>
      <li>LOVE how deep and dark red</li>
      <li>it feels heavy on my lips and it comes off quickly</li>
      <li>I did put a little balm on top after that because my lips felt a little dry, but the color did not come off.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved it! it&#x27;s a deep red, similar to revlons black cherry. It is pretty moisturizing and may require lip liner to prevent feathering. Great color!</li>
    <li> I love this color (Licorice), and the formula!  Many dark lipsticks go on blotchy, but this product goes on smoothly and lasts well.  It&#x27;s a moisture-rich formula, so don&#x27;t expect the lasting power of a matte product, but you can easily wear it for an evening without reapplication.  It&#x27;s SUPER comfortable, which I absolutely love.</li>
    <li> Awesome color. Love it ! Stays on fairly long too</li>
    <li> I loved this lipstick when I saw it at Amazon. When I used it, it was perfect for me. I love the fact that it&#x27;s so smooth and the perfect color for me. I would hope they never discontinue this color.</li>
    <li> Well can&#x27;t say more about it but , I just applied the lipstick today , it was glossy and messy since it is made off butter, recommended for teens.</li>
    <li> Hard to find burgundy color. Creamy, stays on.</li>
    <li> it feels heavy on my lips and it comes off quickly</li>
    <li> Color was alot darker than.the picture. The product is wonderful.</li>
    <li> very soft like butter. I suggest also wearing lipliner under</li>

    <li> I love it!  Hope to find it again with no changes in the color.  Some brands frequently change the color of the product.</li>
    <li> I like this lipstick but I have to say that it was just a bit darker than in the picture. It does not make my lips chapped and its easy to apply</li>
    <li> This color is gorgeous. It&#x27;s a moderate blue burgundy with a hint of umber. The application is smooth and it has decent staying power unless you&#x27;re having a huge dinner or something, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> Darker than I expected</li>
    <li> The color did not turn out at all like I expected it to. Online it looks like a dark red almost burgundy color but when I received it it was more purple than red and the color didn&#x27;t suit me at all. I was super disappointed with it I just gave it two stars because it was delivered at the right time.</li>
    <li> I order this lipstick to try something a little dark. I am a brown skinned person when I first looked at it I was like &amp;#34;UGH&amp;#34; but when I put it on it was a nice color.  I really get a lot of complements when I wear it.  Going to try a couple more colors.</li>
    <li> Great, long lasting color. Doesn&#x27;t feel too dry on lips. I&#x27;m really pale so this is really more of a fall color.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted but overall it was a pretty color on me but the lipstick is oily</li>
    <li> Nice color and coverage. Color is bold without being gawdy. I like this shade with my skintone. Very flattering.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing tho the shade is a tad dark for me. It is not drying to my lips. Totally value for money.</li>
    <li> Love this shade!!!!! Looked great on my lips !!!!! Def recommend it ESP for the price ;)</li>
    <li> Great color! Love the feel of this brand. Smooth and creamy, not too shiny. It has a healthy staying power, but needs to be reapplied occasionally.</li>
    <li> LOVE how deep and dark red this thing is. So pigmented it stains your lips a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tested it out to see true lasting power, but I&#x27;d bet maybe 4 hours if you don&#x27;t touch them</li>
    <li> Love the color its the perfect shade and it lasts a long time. And I loved how I didn&#x27;t have to wait so long for it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lipstick as soon as I could find it on Amazon! I was really excited to try the trendy, stylish black cherry/burgundy lip color that&#x27;s been prevalent on the runway and in Hollywood. I found it to be quite wearable with my light porcelain skin. I used NYX&#x27;s Retractable Lip Liner in Dark Red and didn&#x27;t have any problems with the color. Make sure your lips are exfoliated and use a little balm underneath. The color lasted over six hours and didn&#x27;t need a touch up. I did put a little balm on top after that because my lips felt a little dry, but the color did not come off. There was no bleeding. The shape of the lipstick and the precise point made it super easy to precisely apply it and cover the lipliner. I&#x27;ve heard that the nude and light pink colors aren&#x27;t as nice but that&#x27;s pretty much how every light color is. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to someone looking to make a bold statement.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the shipping was great&lt;br /&gt;it was wrapped up and the package  was sucure</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick! The shipping was great, arrived with no damage. I purchased the Licorice color and it did not disappoint! I get compliments every time I wear this. I use 2 coats to achieve a darker color and I line my lips in burgundy. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product arrived unwrapped.  It looked as if if was not used therefore against my better judgement I used this lipstick.  When I woke up the next morning my lips were swollen and have not been the same since.  I would not recommend anyone order from &amp;#34;bluscandal&amp;#34; look at the name.  They could have poisoned me.  Everything else like this I have ever ordered came wrapped appropriately.  Do not I repeat do not order from this company.</li>
    <li> great colour/texture &amp;#34;PRICE&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The color is a dark berry purple and I love it so much! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and glides on smoothly :) Definitely would reccomend!</li>
    <li> Received in my ipsy bag. Goes on reallllly nice. Feels like a wet creamy lipstick going on but dries to true color.</li>
    <li> Very good quality lipstick.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shade!  It goes with just about any outfit and works well played down or dressed up...I will definitely get another tube once my current one is done.</li>
    <li> Like the color of licorice very much! This is what I was searching</li>
    <li> I love it the color is true and last pretty good for me im getting more</li>
    <li> I love the color, It looks really great on full lips</li>
