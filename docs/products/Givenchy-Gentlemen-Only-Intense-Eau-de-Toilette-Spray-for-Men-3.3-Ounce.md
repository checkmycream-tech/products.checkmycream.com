    <li> I love the smell of this fragrance. This is definitely be bait for coeds and the milfs out there. Oh yea!!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent, this is a great spring scent</li>
    <li> I like the scent, but it does not last. Not sure why... is this the authentic product? It looks and feels like it is. The scent does not even last an hour. I am quite disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried it all over (wrists, arms, neck, hands), I&#x27;ve tried saturating my clothes -- but in each case, it dissipates quickly. So, won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Good choice and smells very good.was very popular with my lady</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE! IT&#x27;S THE REAL GIVENCHY! GOT IT SUPER QUICK AND I&#x27;LL BE BACK FOR MORE SOON.</li>
    <li> good product, Very good service</li>
    <li> The scent is fantastic.  When I got a sample packet at a store, the fragrance lasted for hours.  When I ordered it, the first thing I noticed was the fragrance wasn&#x27;t as intense as I remembered from the sample.  I sprayed some on the first day, and it disappeared quickly.  The following day I put on a substantial amount on my shirt and neck.  I timed this.  I put it on at 5pm.  By 6:45 pm, less than two hours, there was not even a hint, I used the eau toilet. Perhaps I should have purchased it from the store that gave me the sample. ( Norstroms )</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance. My husband love it more. I smoke this fragrance on someone and I died when I smelled it. so I decided to buy for my husband and he wears it everyday and it turns me on.</li>
    <li> Great transaction experience and great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of the original. So when I sampled this a Sephora, instantly fell in love. The ITENSE ingredients in this fragrance really stands out. The leather note added was perfect! Great for Fall and Winter. However, it can be a signature scent for those who can pull it off.</li>
    <li> not that bad, nobody ask about it .</li>
    <li> like that it sprays and its not a mist of cologne, and after you spray it it stays on all day</li>
    <li> Awesome cologne - fast delivery!</li>
    <li> One of the best perfumes I ever have, you smell the wood and the patchouli, but they are totally balance creating an extrordinary fragance. This is a classic for any man. If you are woman and want to give this as a gifts, do it, one recommendation, use small quantities.</li>
    <li> Authentic. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I put it on and women flock to me.</li>
    <li> This item get me notice.  But rather buy product straight from Amazon.</li>
