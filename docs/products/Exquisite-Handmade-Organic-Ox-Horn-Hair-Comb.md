      <li>Great comb for just invigorating the scalp too</li>
      <li>it is a horn comb, great feel</li>
      <li>It is great for your hair.  </li>
      <li>Feels great in the hand and on the hair.</li>
      <li>I look it up in Amazon, and I have find it, at the great price, and organic.  </li>
      <li>Just received this comb and it is attractive.  </li>
      <li>Great comb</li>
      <li>Feels so good to the scalp.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>but I love it anyway!</li>
      <li>This magnificent work of art, craftmanship and sorcery did the one thing that no other could do.</li>
      <li>Runs through hair very smoothly and wont snag strands.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>I dropped the comb out of my pocket and most of the teeth broke.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I like it and have no complaints :)</li>
      <li>But in the meanwhile I&#x27;m going to enjoy this comb.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous, hand-made, natural horn material.</li>
      <li>Are you looking for a high quality product that is cost effective?</li>
      <li>when my hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a beautiful, dramatic-looking product, but carefully consider how you plan to use it.</li>
      <li>This tool of awesome tamed the wild beast that is my facial hair.</li>
      <li>I clean mine with cool water.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this comb, I have a very course beard and</li>
      <li>an in comparison this one is a little &amp;#34;ruffer&amp;#34; around the edges, but still very nice.  </li>
      <li>Having spent time around horses and cows, I know that wet hoof and horn aren&#x27;t the most pleasant odors.</li>
      <li>First, I would prefer a smoother finished edge between the teeth of the comb.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use hot water &amp; do not soak in water.</li>
      <li>A beautiful comb, much larger than expected, but it does not pull any hair out, which is unlike any comb I have used before</li>
      <li>Beard hair to be exact.</li>
      <li>I use a very soft brush to clean between the teeth because I use a lot of product on my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller than i expected, but it feels very nice and does the job as stated.</li>
      <li>It is also fairly ergonomic, with a shape and weight that feel good to use, however, I would not recommend this product to someone with long, fine hair who wants a comb they can use daily, wet or dry.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend does not even have a large or bushy beard.</li>
      <li>Without the teeth at the handle, the ones left have made a huge improvement.  </li>
      <li>seems like plastic, cant really tell, not an ox horn expert</li>
      <li>you can tell it is real.</li>
      <li>I was surprised by the size, I had hoped to be able to keep it in my back pocket.</li>
      <li>I wish it had a few more teeth.</li>
      <li>Feels really strong, also feels like it will last for a very long time.</li>
      <li>So far this is my favorite comb, no static and supposedly it gives off keratin protein to your hair...</li>
      <li>If you have long, fine hair that you comb daily, wet or dry, you may prefer a fine sandalwood comb, as I now do.</li>
      <li>As far as combs go the shape works well with the curvature of your head.</li>
      <li>The teeth don&#x27;t scrape your scalp and it doesnt pick up all that much product if you use pomade or something to style your mop, which I definitely dump a bunch in mine every day.</li>
      <li>Esthetically, it&#x27;s nice, but no good on actual hair.</li>
      <li>and he was so excited to get it, only to be let down.</li>
      <li>Nay, no other could dream of doing.</li>
      <li>If such a thing can be, I would say this comb has a masculine personal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I usually have a comb full of hair.  </li>
      <li>Second, and perhaps the least pleasant thing about it, the comb smells like, well, wet horn when it is wet.</li>
      <li>Not a single thread.  </li>
      <li>but my hair after one day is as soft as baby hair and it is normally long and kinked.  </li>
      <li>Teeth are a little close together for very curly hair (as is mine)</li>

<li> I would totally recommend this, it doesn&#x27;t cause static with hair, and I have thick hair and that is usually an issue with combs.</li>
<li> I recommend this seller to anyone who wants to receive a high quality product from a company that stands behind their customer and ensures satisfaction.</li>
<li> They come in different style, and I wish, I have long hair, to use the Spanish style.  </li>
<li> I actually bought 2 combs the other from a different company</li>
<li> tugged like a curious 1 year old (which is the worst if you haven&#x27;t yet experienced this).</li>
<li> this comb did not pull out a single hair out.</li>
<li> The edge is rough on my long hair, so this can&#x27;t be my daily-use comb.</li>
<li> Quit acting like a little bitch and get the comb.</li>
<li> I have, the comb is not in the least flexable &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t be overly surprised if the teeth break in time.  </li>
<li> Total waste of money</li>
<li> I will absolutely not be using this comb again</li>
<li> My beard actually looks thicker after a few strokes and stays in place for hours.</li>
<li> Well, for starters, it didn&#x27;t smell like other reviews stated.</li>
<li> This product came to me damaged in the package and within 5 days after emailing the seller a new one arrived without any hassle or return needed speaks volume to me in regards to how they stand behind the product.</li>
<li> looks like black platic not horn like the picture pitches.</li>
<li> When I was a child I worked on a farm and had the experience of dealing with dead livestock....</li>
<li> product was delivered in a timely manner, used the comb for a few weeks, like the way it made my hair feel.</li>
<li> But I still use it everyday.</li>
<li> I seen them in Northsrom, a small man size, for $49.  </li>
<li> : Too fragile :(</li>
<li> yea that sounds crazy but also take into consideration its mad out of a horn, horn is a completely natural material and will degrade overtime, so i can see how using it could pull microscopic parts of it off and onto your hair...</li>
<li> this comb smells worse.</li>
<li> Weird sounding product</li>
<li> Seriously, you have a bad ass beard, then get a bad ass comb, get this comb.</li>
<li> Get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wish it had a few more teeth. Otherwise I like it and have no complaints :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Too fragile :(</li>
    <li> it is a horn comb, great feel and you can feel the grain of the horn. you can tell it is real. I would totally recommend this, it doesn&#x27;t cause static with hair, and I have thick hair and that is usually an issue with combs.</li>
    <li> Well, for starters, it didn&#x27;t smell like other reviews stated. Two teeth broke after a week. Esthetically, it&#x27;s nice, but no good on actual hair. Beard hair to be exact.</li>
    <li> When I was a child I worked on a farm and had the experience of dealing with dead livestock....this comb smells worse.</li>
    <li> On the day that I received the comb I began the combing therapy for my circulation.  I don&#x27;t know how to measure that but my hair after one day is as soft as baby hair and it is normally long and kinked.  One problem, It lost two teeth already but for the price I cannot know whether that was my fault leaving it to fall.  Without the teeth at the handle, the ones left have made a huge improvement.  I usually have a comb full of hair.  Not a single thread.  But for the teeth falling out, it is a perfect tool.</li>
    <li> Weird sounding product but does the job.  Has no smell at all.</li>
    <li> Just received this comb and it is attractive.  No smell at all that I can decern.  I actually bought 2 combs the other from a different company an in comparison this one is a little &amp;#34;ruffer&amp;#34; around the edges, but still very nice.  If such a thing can be, I would say this comb has a masculine personal.&lt;br /&gt; There is 1 concern I have, the comb is not in the least flexable &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t be overly surprised if the teeth break in time.  But in the meanwhile I&#x27;m going to enjoy this comb.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the size, I had hoped to be able to keep it in my back pocket. But I still use it everyday. As far as combs go the shape works well with the curvature of your head. Runs through hair very smoothly and wont snag strands. The teeth don&#x27;t scrape your scalp and it doesnt pick up all that much product if you use pomade or something to style your mop, which I definitely dump a bunch in mine every day.</li>
    <li> This magnificent work of art, craftmanship and sorcery did the one thing that no other could do. Nay, no other could dream of doing. This tool of awesome tamed the wild beast that is my facial hair. Seriously, you have a bad ass beard, then get a bad ass comb, get this comb. My man mane flows through the teeth with zero snags, breaks or plucked wiskers. I have used combs, brushes, you name it and every thing tugged like a curious 1 year old (which is the worst if you haven&#x27;t yet experienced this). My beard actually looks thicker after a few strokes and stays in place for hours. Quit acting like a little bitch and get the comb.</li>
    <li> A beautiful comb, much larger than expected, but it does not pull any hair out, which is unlike any comb I have used before</li>
    <li> Are you looking for a high quality product that is cost effective? This Handmade Organic Ox Horn Hair Comb is a must have for anyone who has a beard with length. This product came to me damaged in the package and within 5 days after emailing the seller a new one arrived without any hassle or return needed speaks volume to me in regards to how they stand behind the product. It has proven to offer both quality and durability. I recommend this seller to anyone who wants to receive a high quality product from a company that stands behind their customer and ensures satisfaction.</li>
    <li> This comb is beautiful, as advertised. It is also fairly ergonomic, with a shape and weight that feel good to use, however, I would not recommend this product to someone with long, fine hair who wants a comb they can use daily, wet or dry. I have two reasons for saying this. First, I would prefer a smoother finished edge between the teeth of the comb. The edge is rough on my long hair, so this can&#x27;t be my daily-use comb. Second, and perhaps the least pleasant thing about it, the comb smells like, well, wet horn when it is wet. Obviously, but I hadn&#x27;t thought about this before purchasing. Having spent time around horses and cows, I know that wet hoof and horn aren&#x27;t the most pleasant odors. I will absolutely not be using this comb again when my hair is wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a beautiful, dramatic-looking product, but carefully consider how you plan to use it. If you have short hair and don&#x27;t frequently comb it wet, this might be the comb for you. If you have long, fine hair that you comb daily, wet or dry, you may prefer a fine sandalwood comb, as I now do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than i expected, but it feels very nice and does the job as stated. So no complaints</li>
    <li> Gorgeous, hand-made, natural horn material. Feels great in the hand and on the hair.</li>
    <li> Great comb for just invigorating the scalp too</li>
    <li> product was delivered in a timely manner, used the comb for a few weeks, like the way it made my hair feel. I dropped the comb out of my pocket and most of the teeth broke. Not fragile but brittle to sudden drops.</li>
    <li> seems like plastic, cant really tell, not an ox horn expert</li>
    <li> looks like black platic not horn like the picture pitches.</li>
    <li> Great comb I&#x27;m in love with this comb, I have a very course beard and this comb did not pull out a single hair out. Glad I bought this. Feels really strong, also feels like it will last for a very long time. Buy it trust me, buy it if you want a comb that&#x27;ll glide through you&#x27;re hair with ease.</li>
    <li> Shipped from China so shipping took forever. Within two days three teeth broke and fell out, just with regular use. My boyfriend does not even have a large or bushy beard. Total waste of money and he was so excited to get it, only to be let down.</li>
    <li> I love it! Feels so good to the scalp. Ox horn is made of keratin the same as our hair so it doesn&#x27;t pull. Don&#x27;t use hot water &amp; do not soak in water. I clean mine with cool water.I use a very soft brush to clean between the teeth because I use a lot of product on my hair. Teeth are a little close together for very curly hair (as is mine) but I love it anyway!</li>
    <li> I used to have horn combs in my youth. It is great for your hair.  I seen them in Northsrom, a small man size, for $49.  I look it up in Amazon, and I have find it, at the great price, and organic.  They come in different style, and I wish, I have long hair, to use the Spanish style.  Get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> So far this is my favorite comb, no static and supposedly it gives off keratin protein to your hair...yea that sounds crazy but also take into consideration its mad out of a horn, horn is a completely natural material and will degrade overtime, so i can see how using it could pull microscopic parts of it off and onto your hair...either way its still an awesome comb!</li>
