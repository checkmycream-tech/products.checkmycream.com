      <li>I will NOT be purchasing any more.</li>

      <li>YOU RUINED MY FAVORITE DEODORANT</li>

      <li>Great product for decent price.</li>
      <li>Very cool</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way too strong.  </li>
      <li>It is not KNOCK YOU DOWN strong, but I always know its working, because ladies I work with tell me all the time I smell wonderful even on days when I know I&#x27;m not wearing cologne.</li>

      <li>so far so good, no complaints</li>
      <li>Best deodorant for me hands down!!  </li>
      <li>She loves it so much that she uses it too, and she&#x27;s impressed with how dry it keeps</li>
      <li>After Hours deodorant/antiperspirant click type every day (2 clicks per armpit, sometimes more) since the first catchy</li>
      <li>Still searching for that mythical formula that can actually smell good for 16 hours and stop my sweat...</li>
      <li>The active ingredient is the highest without paying for the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; and does a great job.</li>
      <li>After Hours is my particular preference, but all of their scents are so much better than the competition.</li>
      <li>was the best price I could find and will last me a long time.</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant by far.</li>
      <li>Old Spice has way too many scents and formulas of deodorant.</li>
      <li>Used to be a great product when it had the clear white cap.</li>
      <li>I used to work in a fast paced deli that would get very, very hot</li>
      <li>very disappointed in the change of what used to be a very effective and pleasant deodorant without having an overwhelming scent.  </li>
      <li>I always thought the smell of it was perfect and got a lot of compliments on it (seriously, old spice was drawing some serious compliments from a deodorant).</li>
      <li>,I picture this deodorant being kept in a hot warehouse and you can&#x27;t do that it melts,please do not buy this.</li>
      <li>Also, I love the different fragrances on offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t figured out exactly what triggers it, maybe getting sweat or water or something on the applicator part, but probably 1 out of every 3 or 4 times I put it on</li>
      <li>It was great, and now it is ruined..at least for me.  </li>
      <li>the last however many years</li>
      <li>I bought locally just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the source.  </li>
      <li>I tried so many different deodorants.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted, delivered in very timely fashion.</li>
      <li>They are truly the happier days of the year on my calender, because I get a fresh new stick of manliness to boost my day.</li>
      <li>Very flowery smell/fragrant.</li>
      <li>I switched to this deodorant from my last one, which worked great too, because that one left white pit stains on all of my shirts.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping</li>
      <li>The deodorant looks like its been melted from heat and reformed and it doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>but they have changed the ingredients of this deodorant and now it is trash cheap chinese bullcrap.  </li>
      <li>I love this deodorant but its getting harder to find by me.</li>
      <li>This is not the same smell (AFTER HOURS) of the one with the clear top.</li>
      <li>Love the soft solid and can&#x27;t beat the value</li>
      <li>Not only are the new scents super potent and overwhelming, but they also get hard and crusty.</li>
      <li>EVER STOP MAKING THIS PRODUCT, OLD SPICE!!!</li>
      <li>While I usually think After Hours smells great, this one smells very strong, and very cheap, like a bad body spray that a teenager might use.  </li>
      <li>I grabbed an After Hours stick from my large reserve supply in my closet (in case of SHTF, I would still smell like my normal, sane self).</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The After Hours scent is my favorite, and in this is a little on the stronger side.</li>
      <li>But these issues exist with all deodorants that I have seen, so this is nothing new or particular to this brand.</li>
      <li>I love this scent, it&#x27;s subtle but still strong enough to combat sweat</li>
      <li>The search for a new one begins.</li>
      <li>Yesterday was a new stick day.</li>
      <li>I called it a fluke for the first two sticks, but I&#x27;m now on stick # 5, and still the same thing.</li>
      <li>The Red  top smells different And doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
      <li>Upon slumber time, I laid down in bed next to my love</li>
      <li>This is my favorite style, with the little holes at the top and a small amount of white deodorant comes out every time you click - not stick style.  </li>
      <li>As a woman, it feels a bit odd to be so in love with a &#x27;man&#x27;s&#x27; deodorant, but Old Spice Red Zone is the ONLY deodorant I&#x27;ve ever found that really, really works for</li>
      <li>Even within Old Spice products.</li>
      <li>the old product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swing and a miss, old spice.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer stated, Old Spice has changed the ingredients of this product.  </li>
      <li>Plus, the prices here on Amazon are far lower than comparable products in the grocery store or drugstore.</li>
      <li>I dont know WHAT old spice is thinking</li>
      <li>Could not find where to contact seller directly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly 15 years.  </li>
      <li>Background/Credibility: I&#x27;ve been wearing Old Spice</li>
      <li>Will be changing to something else non old spice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a soft vanilla.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used to be a great product when it had the clear white cap. But now Old Spice has reformulated the product and it smells weird. I guess few years of not worrying about finding a new deodorant are over. The search for a new one begins.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff available on the market. It doesn&#x27;t stain clothes after a few washes like whitesticks do, is most definitely hypo-allergenic (as I can&#x27;t use gels or the blue sticks due to allergies), and actually does prevent perspiration like this type of product is supposed to do. With all this said, everyone back off cuz I&#x27;m buying all of this stuff out to have a lifetime supply.</li>
    <li> Background/Credibility: I&#x27;ve been wearing Old Spice After Hours deodorant/antiperspirant click type every day (2 clicks per armpit, sometimes more) since the first catchy After Hours commercial aired on my non high definition television. I wanted to amount to that man; coming home in the morning with a smirk, passing the boring folk who were leaving for their Monday to Friday &amp;#34;American Dream.&amp;#34; Did I ever amount to him? No, but I smell-....errr......smelled good.  Story: Yesterday was a new stick day. They are truly the happier days of the year on my calender, because I get a fresh new stick of manliness to boost my day. I grabbed an After Hours stick from my large reserve supply in my closet (in case of SHTF, I would still smell like my normal, sane self). Throughout the day yesterday, I wondered what this weird, sporty, unsettling smell was rising from my body. Did I walk through a mist of Axe teenager body spray? Maybe. I ruled this out based on the recollection of my day&#x27;s steps. I was at a loss.  Upon slumber time, I laid down in bed next to my love and she commented on this &amp;#34;new scent.&amp;#34; We were both confused, and slept terrible last night. Was it my chronic night toots that disturbed our beauty sleep? Or were our minds racing, trying to solve this unknown nostril puzzle?  This morning I woke up, and upon further research, my trusty After Hours stick with the new &amp;#34;red cap&amp;#34; instead of clear cap, has forsaken me...What shall I do? What shall I do with my supply of foreign smells simply nesting in my closet?...</li>
    <li> The deodorant looks like its been melted from heat and reformed and it doesn&#x27;t work very well,I picture this deodorant being kept in a hot warehouse and you can&#x27;t do that it melts,please do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Favorite deodorant. Arrived as expected</li>
    <li> Too fragrant and caused allergies to flare up.  Very flowery smell/fragrant.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> As a woman, it feels a bit odd to be so in love with a &#x27;man&#x27;s&#x27; deodorant, but Old Spice Red Zone is the ONLY deodorant I&#x27;ve ever found that really, really works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts up to 24 hours at a time, so it definitely lasts between morning showers.  Also, I love the different fragrances on offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T EVER STOP MAKING THIS PRODUCT, OLD SPICE!!!</li>
    <li> very disappointed in the change of what used to be a very effective and pleasant deodorant without having an overwhelming scent.  the new formula with a red cap is horrible, nothing like the subtle old scent, and the antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t last me all day any more... please bring back the old recipe!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this brand on me, and so do I. After Hours is my particular preference, but all of their scents are so much better than the competition. I recommend buying in bulk - it just makes things easier.</li>
    <li> what is there to say... it&#x27;s old spice, it keeps me dry, the wife likes the way it smells, the co-workers appreciate i don&#x27;t stink as do the strangers at the bar!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is the only anti-perspirant I&#x27;ve ever found that is strong enough to keep me dry all day long.  It&#x27;s really impressive how well it works.  I also love the scent, and so does my wife.  She loves it so much that she uses it too, and she&#x27;s impressed with how dry it keeps armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from sweaty pits, this is your secret weapon!</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant by far. Smells great, works great and is a great price! I used to work in a fast paced deli that would get very, very hot and I stayed smelling good and not looking (too) sweaty while running around that place. People would even tell me that I smelled nice!</li>
    <li> As another reviewer stated, Old Spice has changed the ingredients of this product.  It went from smelling great, to smelling cheap.  It now reminds me of the deodorants I would buy as a teenager.  It&#x27;s way too strong.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly 15 years.  It was great, and now it is ruined..at least for me.  &amp;#34;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Totally changed the scent. Smells like crappy garbage deodorant. If you are accustomed to the After Hours scent DO NOT BUY THIS, it is not the same scent!</li>
    <li> All these were not the &amp;#34;After Hours&amp;#34; scent we were accustomed to.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula and now it smells like rancid baby powder.  I&#x27;m stuck with a 6 pack of this nonsense plus one more stick I bought locally just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the source.  All smell the same and it is awful.</li>
    <li> This is not the same smell (AFTER HOURS) of the one with the clear top. The Red  top smells different And doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, it&#x27;s subtle but still strong enough to combat sweat</li>
    <li> I never stink!!! Even after hours!!! Lol!!!</li>
    <li> It lasts for hours and I&#x27;ve been using this scent for a while now. Definitely recommend it.  Great! Very cool</li>
    <li> Love the soft solid and can&#x27;t beat the value</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Sweat Defense&amp;#34; antiperspirant/deodorant line is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. I never sweat while using it, and the smell is fresh and pleasant without being too overpowering. This product is hard to find in stores, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon for a decent price.</li>
    <li> I tried so many different deodorants. Even within Old Spice products. These are the ONLY ones that don&#x27;t let you sweat and smell great</li>
    <li> Used this antiperspirant (multiple scents) religiously for the last 20 years or so, back when it was called Red Zone (can&#x27;t remember when used a different deodorant...)  There are tons of negative comments regarding the new &amp;#34;red cap&amp;#34; version - STAY AWAY! Horrible. Not only are the new scents super potent and overwhelming, but they also get hard and crusty. Haven&#x27;t figured out exactly what triggers it, maybe getting sweat or water or something on the applicator part, but probably 1 out of every 3 or 4 times I put it on, what was already in the holes on the applicator is dried and crusty. Actually hurts to rub it on my underarms. I called it a fluke for the first two sticks, but I&#x27;m now on stick # 5, and still the same thing. Keep in mind I NEVER saw this issue before the formula change, not once over the last however many years I have been using it. I will NOT be purchasing any more. Have to find a new antiperspirant, and not happy about that. This stuff went from perfect to crap.</li>
    <li> Seems to work better on reducing sweat than other antiperspirants I&#x27;ve tried, but typically can&#x27;t get me through a whole day without needing at least a quick 2nd swipe. Still searching for that mythical formula that can actually smell good for 16 hours and stop my sweat...</li>
    <li> Great product for decent price.</li>
    <li> After trying lots of different products, this is the only thing that works for me. I get a six pack auto delivered regularly.</li>
    <li> so far so good, no complaints.......it does what it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s available OTC. Keeps you dry and smelling decent. Also, it disappears with application as long as you do not apply an excessive amount; and does not leave reside on the interior of your shirt sleeve.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant but its getting harder to find by me. Old Spice has way too many scents and formulas of deodorant. And they keep changing the packaging, its hard to know if your buying the same product you had previously.&lt;br /&gt;This was the best price I could find and will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I switch deodorant every once and a while and I keep coming back to this. The active ingredient is the highest without paying for the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; and does a great job. Sweat Defense is appropriate named... Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant for me hands down!!  Luv it!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this purchase.  I&#x27;ve been buying this same deodorant for years from the usual local stores, but it&#x27;s often out of stock, so I thought this would be a more convient way to stay stocked up.  Unfortunately, the scent of this product is very different from the ones (with the same name &amp;#34;after hours&amp;#34;) that I have been buying for years.  While I usually think After Hours smells great, this one smells very strong, and very cheap, like a bad body spray that a teenager might use.  Avoid and buy this at your local store.</li>
    <li> Whoever changed the formula here should be checked for sanity. It WAS the best deodorant and now it smells like a Christmas tree car freshener. Will be changing to something else non old spice. Such a shame.</li>
    <li> Good Quality. Fast Shipping</li>
    <li> Great deodorant and antiperspirant. In my experience, I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a product that does both well, but there are no issues here. Plus, the prices here on Amazon are far lower than comparable products in the grocery store or drugstore.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, delivered in very timely fashion.</li>
    <li> This is the good stuff. It&#x27;s light, It lasts, it doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue. And it smells great. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Smells good, cheaper than buying at a brick and mortar store.</li>
    <li> Love this product; it work&#x27;s super well. I hope and pray they never stop making it. Buying it on amazon.com in the 6 pack proved to be cheaper than buying the singles at local wal-mart, so I am happy with my purchase. The After Hours scent is my favorite, and in this is a little on the stronger side. It is not KNOCK YOU DOWN strong, but I always know its working, because ladies I work with tell me all the time I smell wonderful even on days when I know I&#x27;m not wearing cologne.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deodorant. I&#x27;ve never had a bad experience with it. I have had bad experiences without it. I&#x27;m not going to bother talking about scents of deodorant on here. Go smell and buy a pack at your brick and mortar. If the ladies, or gents, give you compliments, come back here and order the 6 pack. Put one everywhere: gym bag, desk at work, car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be the stinky guy, use some.</li>
    <li> A lot of people dislike the solid stick style deodorant like I do.  This is my favorite style, with the little holes at the top and a small amount of white deodorant comes out every time you click - not stick style.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> product pics and reviews were not clear. i took the chance and, yes, it is actually the current model of sweat defense that you&#x27;d find at target today. that being said, i&#x27;m not sure i saved any money..</li>
    <li> I dont know WHAT old spice is thinking but they have changed the ingredients of this deodorant and now it is trash cheap chinese bullcrap.  Doesnt smell the same, the parfume of it doesnt emanate anymore. IF IT AINT BROKE DONT FIX IT YOU RUINED MY FAVORITE DEODORANT</li>
    <li> Best deal for the price this is the only deodorant that works for me.</li>
    <li> WTF old spice. This was by far the best deodorant I&#x27;d found. Now it smells like Axe and all the other ones. Feels like an assault on my nostrils. You guys took something awesome and ruined it. https://youtu.be/C08WmKiwcSs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHANGE IT BACK PLEASE.</li>
    <li> All 6 were melted on the inside. All the deodorant was pushed to one side and barely usable.  Could not find where to contact seller directly.</li>
    <li> I sadly have to confirm what others are posting. After hours deodorant has been my product of choice for the past 8-10 years. I always thought the smell of it was perfect and got a lot of compliments on it (seriously, old spice was drawing some serious compliments from a deodorant). This reformulated product is quite garbage. It smells unpleasant, simply put. Naming it &#x27;after hours&#x27; is frankly dishonest as it in no way resembles the old product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Swing and a miss, old spice.</li>
    <li> Did not like the scent and it worked marginally to prevent wetness.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am a very heavy sweater and often change deodorants because they stop working for me. I have been using this one for a year now and it still works great. I like the smell of it too, it is not over powering like some other men scents. I switched to this deodorant from my last one, which worked great too, because that one left white pit stains on all of my shirts. This one has yet to stain any of my shirts. A good tip with this deodorant or any deodorant is to apply it at night right before going to bed, instead of in the morning. It works much better this way. My only complaint with this deodorant is that when the container is new you do not get an even amount of deodorant out of the tube and it is also hard to tell when you are almost out until the last couple days. But these issues exist with all deodorants that I have seen, so this is nothing new or particular to this brand.</li>
    <li> Two parts to this review,    One is that even before I sweat, this product smells awesome.  Well, it smells like chick perfume but I like the smell.  It&#x27;s like a soft vanilla.  Second is that it kills all sweat problems.  I sweat like a mofo at the gym and this kept all of it at bay.  S***  was cash</li>
