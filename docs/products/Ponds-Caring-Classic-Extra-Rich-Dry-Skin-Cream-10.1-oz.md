      <li>If you have dry skin this is THE best product I have ever used on my face.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar of this now and have found it to be a very good moisterizer.  </li>
      <li>Ponds has always been good to my skin as a moisturizer and as a gentle make-up remover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light and clean scent.  </li>
      <li>The first night I couldn&#x27;t control myself and kept touching it!</li>
      <li>my Mom loves it and easy to find here.....</li>
      <li>What I love about this more then Jergens is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily, it&#x27;s non-greasy, and there are no artificial colors or smells.</li>
      <li>The smell was just too strong.</li>
      <li>and I am someone who cannot tolerate perfume or strong smells.</li>
      <li>Very nice product, you can get better prices at your local stores though!</li>
      <li>Since I turned 50 some years back, my beautiful skin has changed.</li>

      <li>Smells fresh and clean and makes me feel pretty again!</li>
      <li>I have been blessed with good, albeit dry, skin.</li>
      <li>I use this moisturizer right before putting on my make up, but I agree that it is super oily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered the Ponds Crema S Nourishing Moisturizer which is a little bit more expensive and gets great reviews and also the SPF day lotion which is a very good buy if it works well.</li>
      <li>It makes them so soft and smooth !</li>
      <li>Smells fresh.</li>
      <li>55 years young, for my skin, the simpler, the better.</li>

      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>but my skin soaks it right up.</li>
      <li>Smells good and works really well for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Now, 2 weeks later, my skin absolutely glows and looks (and feels) better than ever!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this to remove my makeup.  Leaves a clean, moisturizing feeling</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar of this now and have found it to be a very good moisterizer.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something less expensive than the high price cream I&#x27;ve been using.  I started out just using this on the days when I&#x27;m just going to hang around the house and still used the expensive stuff at night and when I was going to work.  But, honestly, this cream seems to do a very good job of moisturizing and it lasts all day. After I use up my supply of expensive cream (of course they stopped making it and it&#x27;s terribly expensive now even on Amazon) I&#x27;m going to switch to Ponds all the time.  I&#x27;ve ordered the Ponds Crema S Nourishing Moisturizer which is a little bit more expensive and gets great reviews and also the SPF day lotion which is a very good buy if it works well. The sun is hot in Texas in the summer.</li>
    <li> Sometimes the old standbys are at least as good if not better than newer over-priced creams. Ponds has always been good to my skin as a moisturizer and as a gentle make-up remover.</li>
    <li> Ponds is a very gentle moisturizer for my face. I use this specifically to prep my face before I put my makeup on. I find that foundation primers never have enough product in them. This has been a nice alternative.  While I have used a variety of foundations over this cream, I find it works well with each one. It lasts me months but when I run out I stick this same jar. You can also find it at Walgreens drug stores and department stores like Target and Walmart.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my mother in-law, she&#x27;s been using it all her life.</li>
    <li> As expected it&#x27;s the usual night cream.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream.  Item was delivered on time and packaged separately and for a good price.</li>
    <li> I love ponds have been using it for years!</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion.. my face has never felt so soft and good. My skin has always been dry to some degree and now it feels so amazing.. I cant even describe all the reasons, but i do recommend this lotion if you have dry skin.. no flaky no clumping, it does not make your skin oily at all it is a wonderful lotion.. i will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> As i suffer of skin allergy, this hypoallergenic skin cream is wonderful. It leaves my skin face hydrated. Love it! I usually used it after my morning bath and before going to sleep. It really works and you can feel your skin softer</li>
    <li> This product is so heavily scented I had to wash it off. The smell was just too strong.</li>
    <li> I just started using this cream two days ago and I am so impressed.  My senior citizen (that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying) skin looks hydrated, plumped up, and thicker.  I&#x27;ve been wasting so much money on all types of expensive skin care over the years and none of them ever showed any difference; in fact, some of them really irritated my skin so I was getting desperate.  I read about this Ponds cream on a beauty forum and decided to try it. Boy, what a wonderful surprise.  Now I&#x27;m not saying it reduced wrinkles or sagging, but it sure did plump up my skin and it is glowing and my makeup goes on beautifully.  Won&#x27;t go back to any other skin care.</li>
    <li> When I could walk 64 years ago I remember my Mom and Grand Mother opening that exclusive green top to a white jar. It was Ponds Cold Cream. That is all I heard from them. \\&quot;Put nothing on your face but Ponds Cold Cream.\\&quot; Being a naive child, I thought the jar contained \\&quot;Cold Cream\\&quot; a dairy product.Grandmother and Mom bragged and I confirmed that they had the most beautiful skin alive! Most Interesting was that Mom introduced Ponds Cold Cream to my Super Model wife of the late 60&#x27;s through early 80&#x27;s. Well, I am not at liberty to disclose her name for legal reasons, but she used nothing but Ponds products and still does. She did commercials for other products and box covers too, but could not wait to get them off her face and back to Ponds. Throughout 7 of those years, she was the Top NY Agency&#x27;s earner. I am a \\&quot;He\\&quot; and use Ponds daily. Bottom line. It just Works,Works! Why pay more. Only if you want to waste your money and waste your face on expensive promises that do nothing and actually can have a poor effect. I and almost 100 years of a family who have used Ponds. I swear by Ponds.</li>
    <li> Been a good product for many years...my Mom loves it and easy to find here.....packaged well and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Great for hydrating dry skin</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this does the trick or not. I have been using Cetiphil (spelling?) and in the shower I use a small face pad and moisturizing cleanser to clean and hydrate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably wont buy this again. Smells nice though</li>
    <li> As a flight attendant, I am prone to dry skin. I&#x27;ve always used regular face cream, but noticed that the skin on my face was looking more dry as the day went on. I purchased ponds dry skin cream (much less expensive at Walmart) mainly because it advertised &#x27;dry skin&#x27; cream and that it was very inexpensive. I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it, or if it didn&#x27;t work, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal because ($3-$4) not much was lost either way. About a week into using this cream, I received my first compliment on how perfect my skin looked. Since then at least once a day, I receive another compliment. My skin feels smooth and not greasy at all. It lasts all day and has a great clean scent to it. I&#x27;ll never use anything else! The compliments alone are worth it!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years! Tried other expensive products and have gone backt to Ponds! I am 46 and people always say I have great skin and I tell them that it&#x27;s because of Ponds!! My 24 year old daughter loves it too! Not greasy, my skin feels great all day!</li>
    <li> Love. This. Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 55 years young, for my skin, the simpler, the better. I&#x27;ve tried the higher end stuff only to end up with irritated, broken out skin. Why I keep straying from what works is beyond me. I wash with Noxema in the pump then put on this cream and my skin is so soft and smooth and naturally dewy. It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
    <li> this is my first time used Ponds . am hoping for the same results as my friend did .(soft silky skin)</li>
    <li> Nothing better in the whole wide world for dry skin!  Love it&#x27;s rich creaminess.  Thanks.  Sincerely, Dixie</li>
    <li> 2 years ago, at 40, I finally decided I needed a facial regime. True, I had no wrinkles, spots or deep lines yet but everyone tells you, it all goes downhill at 40, right? So I invested in quite an array of product for we 40+ women.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind I have a terrible time sticking to a daily/nightly regime. I have been blessed with good, albeit dry, skin. So I&#x27;m LAZY.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 years of using many expensive creams, potions and serums, I found myself with the dryest facial skin of my life these 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;HOW COULD IT BE??&lt;br /&gt;I thought of the decades I had used Pond&#x27;s to remove my makeup, and whatever was left on my face, I let it soak in.&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this nice tub of the extra rich for dry skin Pond&#x27;s. Within 4 days of using it nightly as a leave on mask, my crazy bad dry skin was GONE!!&lt;br /&gt;Now I have supple, bouncy skin with no patches of dryness to ruin the look of my foundation. A few weeks in, I am still SOLD!!&lt;br /&gt;Grandma used this, Mom uses this, I should have never strayed for &#x27;ceramides&#x27; and &#x27;wrinkle filling plumpers&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with Pond&#x27;s until the grave!! SO HAPPY I came back to it!!</li>
    <li> This cream is a little greasy but it moisturizes my face without making me break out. It&#x27;s nice and rich and has a nice powdery smell. I have very dry skin and this does the job.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every product there is during the winter months or after my face gets insanely dried out after being in the pool for hours, daily.  My face gets very itchy dry and flaky!  That&#x27;s the worst kind! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried Aveeno&#x27;s Positively Smooth Facial Lotion...but the flakes were still there.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other products as well, but none work that great.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin cream comes in a fairly small container, and I was somewhat skeptical at first as to it being enough for more than a month!  But this stuff, you hardly need more than half a fingertip for just one cheek!  My face feels incredibly smooth, and the flakes are gone!  Also, there isn&#x27;t too much of a scent.  It&#x27;s a very light and clean scent.  This stuff is also hypoallergenic and won&#x27;t clog your pores, so it&#x27;s perfect under make-up! And like many lotions tend to do, this cream will not even leave your skin shiny OR greasy!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll EVER go back to any other facial lotion.  This is the one for me!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and I found that this stuff hydrates well while not irritating my skin or making it breakout. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for a couple of months having graduated from the very oily and uncomfortable Jergens All Purpose Face Cream. This is the BEST facial cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It does exactly what it says it will do. Supplies moisture and softness to dry skin. I use a dime dize amount with a papaya lotion and sunscreen and dilute it with water. Absolutely beautiful combo to keep my skin hydrated and toned. What I love about this more then Jergens is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily, it&#x27;s non-greasy, and there are no artificial colors or smells. It&#x27;s clean, white colored, and seems to be of higher quality texture. All in all, great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll always be up for trying new face moisturizers, especially if they come with extra ingredients to feed my skin with nutrients. And I&#x27;m well aware that this Ponds cream is simple moisturizer... however, in 10 years, this is has been the only product that keeps my skin hydrated the entire day, and doesn&#x27;t leave me overly (keyword) greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it comes down to it, given that I have dry skin, I&#x27;d rather be a little over hydrated than suffer eczema/hives from dry skin. I have no hesitation giving this product 5 stars because I know it&#x27;ll always be consistent. My trick is to apply it right after washing my face or showering when there is a lot of moisture already in my skin. Plus it&#x27;s cheap! Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every kind of skin cream for dry skin and nothing seemed to really do the job for me. I have skin that flakes just about all the time.  Usually in the morning I would wake up and my skin would be flaking. I was really starting to think I was going to have to go to the dermatologist because some days it would be awful and I was getting sick of it. Now I put this stuff on before bed and my skin is nice and smooth when I wake up, and best of all no flakes! I use it before I put my make up on too, some people say it&#x27;s too greasy but my skin soaks it right up. If you want to use it as a moisturizer before you put you make up on I would suggest only using enough to cover your whole face which is really only a dab of cream, then after a few minutes, gently pat some powdered foundation over it , you can even pat your face with a dry towel before applying the powder. that&#x27;s what I do and it seems to work fine for me. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> If the price was like the product price in the stores may I give it 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;but because the price I give this stars. The product is very good and I like it</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and had been purchasing numerous moisturizing face creams for years! Every single face cream has been watery and my face would feel dry again ten minutes after applying. It was as if I never put anything on my face.  Not Ponds. My face stays moisturized with no breakouts (I get those too).  I really love this stuff and will continue to buy it. Next up: The cleasing line !</li>
    <li> This is a great cold cream. That is all my mom ever used way back when and I am 83 and just started using this brand and I love it.</li>
    <li> one of my mom&#x27;s favorites.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin cream every winter for several years, especially when my face needs an extra boost of moisture all over. My oily skin still gets flaky and has dry patches in the winter, and this moisturizer takes care of that problem immediately. In the morning, my skin is smooth and flake free. I only use this at night because for my skin it is a bit heavy for use under make-up. Perhaps someone with very dry skin can use it under make-up as well. This is my favorite night cream and the price is unbeatable. A definite must have for me.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion on my face after every shower - especially in the winter season. I feel the effects of the cold weather when my skin is itchy on the days I forget. This is a mandatory toiletry for anyone with seasonal dry skin.</li>
    <li> Received promptly, good cream.</li>
    <li> poorly presented. jars are dirty. really bad service. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin.some spots are so dry,but this cream doesn&#x27;t help me at all :( it makes my skin so oily,I feel like my skin can&#x27;t breath.i got some rash  after couple days&lt;br /&gt;BUT when I started to apply cream on my legs after shaving ! It is amazing! It makes them so soft and smooth ! Also I put it on my hands! Works perfect! But I don&#x27;t like smell,I have to put Olay cream after and then it smells ok :)</li>
    <li> Since I turned 50 some years back, my beautiful skin has changed. I used to get compliments on my skin often. My hair stylist used to call the other hair stylists over and show them my skin. And now it had turned to feeling like leather. Due to menopause, I felt there wasn&#x27;t anything I could do for it. Whatever I tried just didn&#x27;t seem to work. Even expensive creams. I just had to live with it. But I could not stand it any longer.   I started reading through reviews here on Amazon for various skin moisturizers. Then I discovered that Ponds, which is a very well known brand, was STILL getting raves from its users! I bought the Ponds Caring Classic Extra-Rich Dry Skin Cream to try. From the first application my skin has been improving. The first night I couldn&#x27;t control myself and kept touching it! It is soft again! I will keep using it and am once again happy with my skin. Even my husband is commenting on it!  It is just the best there is and I suppose a company that has been in business this long knows what it is doing. I love the fact that it does not feel greasy yet is a moisturizer for dry skin. No greasiness at all. Smells great and I am someone who cannot tolerate perfume or strong smells. Not Ponds. In fact, I love the smell. Smells fresh and clean and makes me feel pretty again! Thank you Ponds!</li>
    <li> Very nice product, you can get better prices at your local stores though!</li>
    <li> My grandmother used Ponds all of her life until the day she died. She had the best looking skin! I am 38 now and have started using Ponds. It totally slipped my mind as I ordered and used product after product. Now I&#x27;m going back to basics! My grandma used it for 50+ years! My turn!</li>
    <li> My mom used it forever.  Now I am 71 and still consider it the best facial cream you can find.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom, as it has been a longttime beauty favorite basic for her.  I think she really loves the deep penetrating moisture it gives her maturing complexion.  I would recomment it to anyone wanting these benefits!</li>
    <li> I was blessed with naturally clear, blemish-free skin... or so I thought. I didn&#x27;t suffer the high school acne or attack of pimples, but after graduating from college, I started getting the occasional break out. I decided to add Neutrogena to my daily regimen. BIG mistake. The break outs got worse and were accompanied by dry, flaky, cracked skin on my face. I tried everything I could to restore my skin after the damage Neutrogena did, but my skin remained damaged and lifeless. Then, by sheer coincidence, I purchased Ponds from Target. Best decision I ever made! Within 3 days, the dryness of my skin was completely gone. Now, 2 weeks later, my skin absolutely glows and looks (and feels) better than ever! This product is not just for older adults. I am 22 years old, and will swear by the product. I will not moisturize my skin with anything else. If you are struggling with dry, unattractive skin, try this product!</li>
    <li> I. am  little disappointed in this product.  I would expect my face to feel a little moist after applying this but it seems to dry and not feel moist afterwards.</li>
    <li> A very Good moisturizer for the Face and the Whole Body. Was a great Stocken stuffer for the One who is Hard to Buy For</li>
    <li> I could kick myself for buying all the expensive creams over the years when this is better.  It makes sense because the big companies have the money for research.  I&#x27;ve graduated to the Ponds with the gray top and label for my face, but this is great for the rest of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be stupid about face and body creams again!</li>
    <li> Ponds Caring Classic Extra Rich Dry Skin cream is great.  It works well on sensitive skin and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s products have always been exceptional.  Great product for aging skin.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good replacement for the discontinued Dove Face Moisturizer. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> Good size for the price. Not greasy. Lasts all day. Smells fresh. Nice and soft on skin. Ponds has always been better than other more expensive creams. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 40 years.</li>
    <li> Absoultely great product. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and have come to realize I can&#x27;t go without it. Smells good and works really well for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love Ponds , I have been using this since I was in my 30&#x27;s and I am now 50. I use this at time and my skin in the morning is soft and dewy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream as a mosturiser specifically for my face.It is subtle and gentle and very soothing for the skin plus it is not so costly,so it makes it a good value for money.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin this is THE best product I have ever used on my face.  I have tried dozens of products and nothing beats Ponds Dry Skin or classic cold cream.  I learned about this when I was a child in an acting group.  Theatre people swear by it.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of fancy, expensive products and nothing comes close to dependable moisturizing in any weather, especially for your delicate facial skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I did not find this product extra rich at all, in fact it made my skin feel less pliant. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Could&#x27;ve been good if it wasn&#x27;t for my skin skinning the day after</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer right before putting on my make up, but I agree that it is super oily.  The only way I found it to work best is to apply it with a make up sponge (those white wedges) and then pat it dry with a tissue.  It&#x27;s a little too much work just for moisturizer though, it should be easy.</li>
    <li> I remember my Mom using this product and she was always glowing with beautiful skin.  I decided to try Pond&#x27;s and have noticed plumper skin and it actually makes me look younger!  This maybe a less expensive brand of facial cream...BUT, it works for me :)</li>
