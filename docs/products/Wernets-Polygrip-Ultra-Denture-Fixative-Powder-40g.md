      <li>You used to be able to get it at grocery stores but no longer.</li>

      <li>Love the product</li>

      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>If you have dentures that need that extra help to stay in, this powder is the best.</li>
      <li>DirectKart 3 out of 5 \\&quot;Pleased with Product but horrified by the Shipping &amp; Handling charge of NZ$43.95</li>
      <li>and I wish I could make something better for her.</li>
      <li>I am happy he can confidently eat and be social and forget about wearing a denture.</li>
      <li>Works better then the original Poligrip.  </li>
      <li>Comes from UK but got here very quickly.</li>
      <li>Over all great product and will definatley buy more until Polident powder is back on the shelves in the states (if ever)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why the Ultra is better than the Super, but it is.</li>
      <li>This powder holds my denture securely ALL DAY and into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>product is my favorite for the lower plate in particular where most of the problems of staying put can occur.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed Colonel Lacey&#x27;s book very much.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Super Poli-Grip\\&quot; for it (also available through Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He said he doesn&#x27;t have to use as much each time and that it cleans up better at night.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brand.  </li>
      <li>This adhesive works very well on my top denture.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I found this here on amazon and had 2 bottles sent to me and works so good for the upper plate.</li>
      <li>this is a superior brand that I&#x27;ll continue to prefer, as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>With  polligrip powder becoming more and more harder to find the version from UK and Ireland works just as well.</li>
      <li>Since the Poligrip Super Hold Powder can no longer be bought..</li>
      <li>I see no difference between Ultra Wernets and Super Poli Grip.</li>
      <li>I used to use Super Wernets then they stopped making it.  </li>
      <li>I ordered both Poligrip Wernets Super and Poligrip Wernets Ultra.  </li>
      <li>Not as strong/long lasting as Super Poligrip but pretty good.</li>
      <li>I have purchased Ultra Wernets Poligrip for my husband, who had always used and liked Rigident since he has had an upper denture.</li>
      <li>I think it is well worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>to me it is worth it.</li>
      <li>until a few years ago, I was able to buy Super Wernets at local drugstores, but there was one of those government &amp;#34;investigations&amp;#34; of denture powders and Super Wernets, as superior as they were, nevertheless had to stop selling in the U.S.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t take as long to get it as they thought it would, which was nice.</li>
      <li>But, as previously mentioned, a very good book, obviously well researched, and very much worth</li>
      <li>The company has very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Much better than the wernets regular</li>
      <li>so much I will most likely buy it again</li>
      <li>He was very upset that Rigident was not going to be manufactured any longer, however, after buying and trying several others, he has concluded that the Wernets is even BETTER than the Rigident was.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and holds very well (generally for 24 hours).</li>
      <li>No mess to clean up if you need to reapply</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t really like it</li>
      <li>Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to Ireland.</li>
      <li>really works</li>
      <li>Much nicer than goopy, gooey fixatives.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;to go much longer than tube adhesives.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I much prefer it to the pastes.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this for my mom and she did not like and said it did not hold her dentures in very well.</li>
      <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll continue to buy it for as long as it remains available.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT, LOVE IT...NOT MESSY LIKE OTHER POWDERS</li>
      <li>Both Super and Ultra work about the same.</li>
      <li>Almost the same as Super poligrip powder (which isn&#x27;t made anymore).Hope</li>
      <li>This is a great product and is very hard to find!  </li>
      <li>Despite previous books I&#x27;ve read, I learned many new (to me) facts from this book.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Since the Poligrip Super Hold Powder can no longer be bought..I have switch to this product, I have bought it 3 different times now and will continue to do so..It is a G R E A T product..holds tightly and doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste in your mouth..I would recommend this to anyone. I give it a 5 star</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brand.  If you are a new user, their instructions may be different from other brands you may have used in the past.  I shake only the LEAST possible amount of powder onto my dampened dentures, just enough to gently coat all areas, so there is NEVER any gooey mess such as I had with ANY other denture powder.  This powder holds my denture securely ALL DAY and into the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until a few years ago, I was able to buy Super Wernets at local drugstores, but there was one of those government &amp;#34;investigations&amp;#34; of denture powders and Super Wernets, as superior as they were, nevertheless had to stop selling in the U.S.  During the time of its disappearance from the marketplace, many regular users of the powder were extremely upset at their loss of a dependable denture powder they&#x27;d come to rely on.  They had no idea they could still purchase the brand imported through Drugtore.com where I was able to continue my use of it.  Next thing I learned was that Poligrip bought the company so that Wernet&#x27;s quality powder was no longer threatened with disappearing.  At least, that&#x27;s the perception I&#x27;ve gotten over the years.  Bottom line:  this is a superior brand that I&#x27;ll continue to prefer, as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this product anywhere and I much prefer it to the pastes.  It is twice as expensive but to me it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered both Poligrip Wernets Super and Poligrip Wernets Ultra.  Used one one day and the other one the next.  It is the Wernets all of us love to use.  When I googled Wernets Powder I went to the Amazon site.  It is still made in Ireland but sold from UK.  I had the order in about a week.  So go for it.  Both Super and Ultra work about the same.</li>
    <li> not as good as it use to be bought in the store</li>
    <li> Much nicer than goopy, gooey fixatives.</li>
    <li> terrible for bottom plates, no hold at all</li>
    <li> This seems to work as well as the original Poligrip, but it takes longer to get, since it comes from Great Britain. I order several at a time for that reason. The powder works so much better and is less messy than the gooey gels or creams on the market. I&#x27;ll continue to buy it for as long as it remains available.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations will order again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Sorry , this stuff was just likeall the others , not very good at all. I guess I will continue to keep on trying stuff, until I try something that does work.  Also I need a powder without zinc.  Thanks anyway.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. It holds all day, as a matter of fact if too much is applied it is difficult to remove your dentures. I see no difference between Ultra Wernets and Super Poli Grip.</li>
    <li> Not as strong/long lasting as Super Poligrip but pretty good.</li>
    <li> This product does the job!  Much better than the wernets regular</li>
    <li> This has got to be the worst denture powder I have every tried. It was a complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my elderly aunt since they removed polygrip powder off the shelves. My aunt says it works as good or better then what she used to buy.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to get a trial size of Wernet&#x27;s from my dentist several years ago.  Since I am allergic to all the denture adhesives. this was wonderful.  It works great and no sore throat from using Wernets.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it is  made in the UK.  No wonder it is not available in the US.  Thanks to Ireland.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I don&#x27;t know why this product is not available in drug stores and markets in the US. It arrived from England via Royal Mail. The product is made in Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like powder adhesive, because it can be sprinkled over the entire denture surface rather than a few lines of paste that has to be \\&quot;squished\\&quot; when the denture is put in place. I also like the fact that powder becomes more adhesive with moisture rather than breaking it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is my favorite for the lower plate in particular where most of the problems of staying put can occur. My upper denture fits like a glove so I use the standard \\&quot;Super Poli-Grip\\&quot; for it (also available through Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is definitely an overkill, rather than running water over my dentures prior to sprinkling the adhesive powder , I use an mister to just dampen the denture where contact will occur. If that interests you, Amazon sells these 2oz atomizers (Maya Road 2-ounce Size Mister Bottles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product. I think it is well worth the purchase. I hope you do to.</li>
    <li> If was not as good as we had hoped.  Nothing compares to Rigident that my husband said worked the best, however Rigident is no longer made.</li>
    <li> Waaaaaaay Better than Poligrip powder. Comes from UK but got here very quickly. Excellent product</li>
    <li> The best on the market</li>
    <li> Holds better than anything I have found at the drugstore. No zinc. No metallic taste like other powders.</li>
    <li> service was prompt. Item was good, will use again</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT...NOT MESSY LIKE OTHER POWDERS</li>
    <li> Works better then the original Poligrip.  Love it.  Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  Do you ever run deals or specials</li>
    <li> Best product of this use on the market today.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Keeps dentures secure for hours!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.  My dentist told me about this years ago and it was good advice.  Wish we could get it in stores.</li>
    <li> I still look for the &amp;#34;best of the best&amp;#34;, and haven&#x27;t found one yet, but yours is OK. I wish it would hold longer and better, but I still like these types than the &amp;#34;gooey ones.</li>
    <li> Next best thing besides polygrip powder</li>
    <li> My friend raved about the powder adhesive the dentist put on her new upper denture. It was called just Wernets, I can only assume before Poligrip bought them, because there was no Poligrip on the label. Hoping to help her out I ordered the Poligrip Ultra Wernets from the UK, the only place it seems to be sold after I found the link on Amazon. Well, turns out it doesn&#x27;t work as she hoped. Food gets in, it never holds for more than a few hours and she has gone back to using the paste adhesive made by Fixodent which does have zinc. I thought maybe she wasn&#x27;t using enough of it but after reading some of possible negative results of the powder in a few reviews, I didn&#x27;t even want to suggest that. Any helpful comments or suggestions would be great. This was an unexpected and traumatic process for her and I wish I could make something better for her.</li>
    <li> I found this powder to be much better than the fixodent powder that contains zinc.  It holds all day!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This adhesive works very well on my top denture.&lt;br /&gt;This powder lasts all day and the container seems&lt;br /&gt;to go much longer than tube adhesives.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this!!</li>
    <li> worked the same as other well know powder fixative</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok as a backup (for me) but I didn&#x27;t really like it, it started to ooze out after a few hours so I use another powder adhesive. But everyone is different, some things work well for some but not others. Thankfully it&#x27;s not too expensive so it can&#x27;t hurt to try it to find the best adhesive for you.</li>
    <li> DirectKart 3 out of 5 \\&quot;Pleased with Product but horrified by the Shipping &amp; Handling charge of NZ$43.95, the Product itself was just NZ31.96\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed Colonel Lacey&#x27;s book very much.  I have read quite a number of books on the War in the Pacific.  I served as a teen age Marine with the SecMarDiv for about three years but never had time to read what really happened until after I retired.  Despite previous books I&#x27;ve read, I learned many new (to me) facts from this book. There were a number of typos in the kindle edition, not the fault of the author, no doubt. (For example, the Japanese banzai attack on Saipan occured on 7 July, 1944, not 7 August). If I were to make any critical comment on the book it is that Colonel Lacey let her bias toward Lt. General Holland Smith, USMC, show too much and, conversely, her support of Major General Ralph Smith, USA, was very obvious. I have also read General Holland Smith&#x27;s Coral and Brass and have the same criticism of him. I guess there will always be an Army point of view and a Marine Corps point of view on this controversary. As a reader, I feel authors should be objective and not let their biases, if any, show. But, as previously mentioned, a very good book, obviously well researched, and very much worth reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wm A. Nichols (formerly an enlisted Marine in I Company, 3rd Bn, 8th Marines, SecMarDiv. Served again as a commissioned officer in the marine Corps during the Korean Crisis.)</li>
    <li> really works I like it so much I will most likely buy it again it comes from England you know</li>
    <li> This is a great product and is very hard to find!  It is not available in the U.S. Using a search engine, I located this in the United Kingdom.  The company has very fast delivery. My only wish is that the U.S. Poligrip company would manufacture and sell this product!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom and she did not like and said it did not hold her dentures in very well.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> Best stuff around.  Can&#x27;t believe I have to ship it in from the United Kingdom.  I don&#x27;t know why the Ultra is better than the Super, but it is.</li>
    <li> I have worn partials and flippers for more than 40 years and I have used many over the counter adhesives.&lt;br /&gt;While this product is not Regident,it is the best that I&#x27;ve used since Rigident became unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;We,former Rigident users need to get over it and move on.&lt;br /&gt;Wernets is the best on the market</li>
    <li> Much better than the gels. Easy to use and holds very well (generally for 24 hours). No mess to clean up if you need to reapply</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take as long to get it as they thought it would, which was nice. Love the product but I used to get one box of powder at local drug store for 1/3 of the price. It was shown as Polident ultra Wernets powder adhesive on site but when I received my order its called Ultra Wernets denture fixative powder.  Polident is not mentioned anywhere on package. Over all great product and will definatley buy more until Polident powder is back on the shelves in the states (if ever)</li>
    <li> I used to use Super Wernets then they stopped making it.  Nothing in the stores worked.  I found this on amazon and it works great.  They must have bought the rights from Wernets.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Happy to have found a place I can get it.</li>
    <li> If you have dentures that need that extra help to stay in, this powder is the best. You used to be able to get it at grocery stores but no longer. I found this here on amazon and had 2 bottles sent to me and works so good for the upper plate. I do not like using cream for uppers and the powder gives perfect coverage. I get a good 7-8 hours out of one useage.</li>
    <li> Did not hold dentures in place at all.  Gooey and came out no matter what I did.  Made me cough and gag.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this polygrip Wert nets since she had dentures, works very&lt;br /&gt; Also bought for two other people after she recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;Jack</li>
    <li> Recieved this and it was just as described.</li>
    <li> I could no longer find this in the U.S.  It&#x27;s the right size to carry in your toilet kit and the product works well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a good product which does as stated. Thank you.</li>
    <li> With  polligrip powder becoming more and more harder to find the version from UK and Ireland works just as well.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. No mess, works as expected.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Ultra Wernets Poligrip for my husband, who had always used and liked Rigident since he has had an upper denture. He was very upset that Rigident was not going to be manufactured any longer, however, after buying and trying several others, he has concluded that the Wernets is even BETTER than the Rigident was. He said he doesn&#x27;t have to use as much each time and that it cleans up better at night. We are very satisfied customers and hope THEY continue making this product. I am happy he can confidently eat and be social and forget about wearing a denture.</li>
    <li> best product I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only powder that works and its very secure!!&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Almost the same as Super poligrip powder (which isn&#x27;t made anymore).Hope it will be for sale in the US soon which should be cheaper then.</li>
    <li> ultra wernets poligrip is really a great product, can no longer get it in the US for some reason.  They should bring it back.</li>
