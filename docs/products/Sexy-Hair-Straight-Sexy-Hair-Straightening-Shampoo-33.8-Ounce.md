    <li> I have a curly jew-fro, but I don&#x27;t think that this actually relaxes/straightens anything. I use it because I am hopeful I wake up looking like Zac Effron one day.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair what so ever I wouldn&#x27;t recamend it</li>
    <li> This product really worked!  It transformed my hair from frizzy to soft and straight with a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the salon brad I used. My hair was thick and fuzzy, but this help me to smooth my hair a lot. But the time it is delivered, it was not well packed and so leaked.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo sad to see it&#x27;s not available anymore.</li>
    <li> The straight sexy hair products work miracles with my fine color-treated hair.  My stylist keeps giving me new samples of other products to try and nothing compares.</li>
    <li> Smell is horrible (that&#x27;s why the 4 star rating) but the product works well.  Don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron!</li>
    <li> love it - product really does make a difference</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted to straighten her curly hair.  We are such unsatisfied people.  The product did NOT straighten her hair.  She still has curly hair and she&#x27;s been using it for at least three months now with the conditioner.  Now she&#x27;s using a straightening iron, which I don&#x27;t like because that craziness has got to damage your hair!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is getting white and that white hair is so frizzy!  So I bought this and its great!!</li>
    <li> My favorite brand for straightening really long hair.</li>
    <li> I wonder if the people who wrote all these wonderful reviews about this product work for the company or were paid to do so... They&#x27;re just not true.

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t relax or straighten my hair and leaves it feeling dried out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I&#x27;m always ordering more.  I definitely recommend it.  The only issue is that you do need to mix it a little as it seems to separate while in storage.  It&#x27;s fine once I turn it upside down and right side up several times.  It&#x27;s odd but it&#x27;s happened twice.</li>
    <li> I thought the product was worth a try since it claim to do exactly what I was looking for... Instead It turn out to be the worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <li> Great product. Definitely helps to straighten hair.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for about a 2 weeks.  It was difficult to get past the fragrance...It really does not smell good..It left my hair feeling kind of coarse rather than smooth although it did help to relax the wave and curl.</li>
    <li> I began using this shampoo because I have very wavy hair. While using the shampoo, I noticed that my hair was just how I wanted. As soon as I ran out of the shampoo I began to notice my hair returning to normal (which I do not like). This leads me to believe the shampoo really works and is a great buy. Definitely buying more.</li>
    <li> Feels nice but doesn&#x27;t really make my hair straight.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work. And my hair is sort of wavy, not even super curly. I give it 3 stars for its quantity and the smell is pretty good.</li>
    <li> After the first wash, I already saw results. I literally used it and my hair was more straight when it dried. I was quite amazed for the price. and the scent is amazing. I will continue using it with the conditioner. Its worth it and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Sexy Hair Straightening Shampoo is excellent.  The hair is straight and soft.  Excellent produce. Recommended.  Conditioner finishes the required styple of fantastic soft straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more then ten years!, that says it all, and I will continue using it! My hair is kind of short, and it has a wave I don&#x27;t like, that&#x27;s when straight sexy comes in, it leaves my hair soft and really manageable, and smells clean with a touch of perfume! The only problem I am having is finding it, maybe somebody can help me there, helppppp!!!</li>
    <li> We bought this and now my hair is too sexy for my body.</li>
    <li> Both of my daughters and I love this product. Leaves our wavy hair smooth after a blow out. We do not need to use our flat iron for any touch ups</li>
