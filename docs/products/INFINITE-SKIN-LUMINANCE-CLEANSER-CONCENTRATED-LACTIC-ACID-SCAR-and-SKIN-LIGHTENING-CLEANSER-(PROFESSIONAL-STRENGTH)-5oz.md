### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve found that method works best for me.</li>
      <li>This product is very good.</li>
      <li>I have not seen any great results yet.</li>
      <li>Great fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The combined effect is good, my face feels brightened.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Infinite skin makes a great acne cleanser that I love</li>
      <li>A good product however for exfoliation and the minty feel is good except make sure it does not get in the eyes.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice</li>
      <li>it is useable, but the strength isn&#x27;t as effective as I think.  </li>
      <li>, leave it on for 5 minutes, and wash off either in the shower or using a warm face cloth.</li>
      <li>Am loving the results.</li>
      <li>Once I rinse it off my face my skin is very smooth.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is not a cleanser but is a better exfolliant the beads are minute and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin.</li>
      <li>I will continue using this until I find something better.</li>
      <li>However, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t really do a good job of cleaning off my makeup nor do I feel like it does a good job of clearing up all the oil/dirt on my face after a long day.</li>
      <li>Product is working nicely, love the way it leaves my skin feeling clean, and I can feel it working on my skin and</li>
      <li>I love leaving this on my skin for a full three minutes or more and then exfoliating by adding some mild scrubbing grains.  </li>
      <li>As another reviewer mentioned, you should pair it with a good toner/cleanser and a moisturizer to complete your beauty regime and to keep skin supple.  </li>
      <li>I love this product very much.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to use in the morning because it has a pepermint-y smell and it tingles, waking you and your skin up, so after a long night or when I feel like I need a pick-me-up</li>
      <li>I originally bought it because I had heard of all the benefits of lactic acid for acne prone/scarred skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure for someone who actually follows directions this will be an amazing product and will work as it claims.</li>
      <li>It does a great job of clearing out my pores - I have a few scars from breakouts and those are getting lighter/blending into my skin much more quickly since I started using this.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, I just didn&#x27;t use it regularly but it seems to have worked anyway.</li>
      <li>Ok just a heads up, this is not a foamy cleanser, its very fluid and acts better as a 5 minute lotion/mask,</li>
      <li>I was surprised how much I love this Infinite cleanser</li>
      <li>, right?</li>
      <li>Bought this in hope it may help lighten acne scars unfortunatly no difference as per normal cheap brand cleansers toners</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be specific, the chilling effect or the kind of mint experience on the face is good, it feels refreshing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not something that I couldn&#x27;t live without, but the price is reasonable and I plan to buy another bottle once I run out of thisone because, for me, it&#x27;s definitely good to keep on hand for those days when my skin just needs something extra.</li>
      <li>&quot; and this combo is the first to work.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that my skin looks refreshed, feels super clean after and has definitely improved.</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers have mentioned, I wouldn&#x27;t really use it as a cleanser without some kind of follow-up.</li>
      <li>This has all 3 acids in it...makes my skin feel super soft...</li>
      <li>I do recommend be very careful not to get around eyes though the formula is very strong.</li>
      <li>Its strong and definitely helps exfoliate</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really digging it.</li>
      <li>This product would be very helpful for those with acne problems....</li>
      <li>but if that&#x27;s something that might be an issue for you watch out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this.</li>
      <li>It gently exfoliates the skin and cleanses, revealing a softer, smoother appearance.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many other \\&quot;spot</li>
      <li>I use it 2x daily, it has a refreshing feeling and does not dry my skin out like some cleansers do.</li>
      <li>But what I noticed was that it really faded my post acne spots AND prevented new pimples.</li>
      <li>When you apply this product there is a lot of tingling and a slight burn which I love bc</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you trying this.  </li>
      <li>I also purchase the chemical peel of the same brand and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Make up is disolved completely.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had experience, as well as read some articles in internet, that if use products which may make your skin sensitive, then it is advised to use sunscreen to avoid sunburns.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m sensitive around the eyes</li>
      <li>It has gotten rid of my acne right away and as far as lightening/fading some of my dark spots from acne scarring</li>
      <li>I had sun spots, but since using this, along with the toner and moisturizer, they are barely noticeable and still fading!  </li>
      <li>When compared to a lot of other beauty regimens, it&#x27;s actually very affordable.</li>
      <li>so they don&#x27;t really do much - I use it with an slightly textured face cloth</li>
      <li>This feels so good and has removed the flaky skin that I always seem to have that makes makeup look bad.</li>

<li> Its pretty hard to isolate the effect of this product, especially if this is not the only product you use.</li>
<li> I think that there is a slight bleaching effect associated with this product because I noticed that my skin is a little more pale, which doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
<li> other reviewers, I use this mainly as a mask every few days</li>
<li> I rinse then pat dry with a towel.</li>
<li> I have dry, aging skin</li>
<li> You can get the same effect with some Noxzema  for less money.  </li>
<li> I use it everyday but does not seem to help with acne scars or blemishes or future acne.</li>
<li> I use it at night before bed and since using it it&#x27;s definitely taken off some of the harsh signs of aging.</li>
<li> I would recommend for minimal use i would reorder</li>
<li> it has slowly lightened areas that were considerably darker due to hyper pigmentation.  </li>
<li> It is nothing like the other one and I ended up throwing it away.</li>
<li> I had sunburns with other products, so using sunscreen is always &#x27;yes&#x27; for me with any products.&lt;br</li>
<li> A slight sting but does not linger.</li>
<li> I have been using this for a little over a week, twice a day.  </li>
<li> It did nothing for my little scar I had from accidentally scratching my shoulder.</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> so I decided, rather than jump into something harsh like a chemical peel</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.  </li>
<li> I have been using this product for the past two weeks</li>
<li> The exfoliating beads are small and sparse</li>
<li> so I try to keep non drying products on my face, but would usually end up greasy and not feeling</li>
<li> Just remember it is not a cleanser because I usually use a toner after and the cotton ball was still not clean,I had to use another cleanser.</li>
<li> I usually just put a thick layer all over my face</li>
<li> It&#x27;s unrealistic to expect immediate results.</li>
<li> I was absolutely disappointed with this item and would not recommend to anyone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product very much. I use it 2x daily, it has a refreshing feeling and does not dry my skin out like some cleansers do. I was surprised how much I love this Infinite cleanser</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.  It does not do what it claims to do.  I also purchase the chemical peel of the same brand and it did absolutely nothing. The only thing this product does it makes your face tingle.  You can get the same effect with some Noxzema  for less money.  I was absolutely disappointed with this item and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Am loving the results. As another reviewer mentioned, you should pair it with a good toner/cleanser and a moisturizer to complete your beauty regime and to keep skin supple.  I use it at night before bed and since using it it&#x27;s definitely taken off some of the harsh signs of aging. Love it.</li>
    <li> It didn’t work for me. I didn’t notice a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I just didn&#x27;t use it regularly but it seems to have worked anyway. I&#x27;m sure for someone who actually follows directions this will be an amazing product and will work as it claims.</li>
    <li> Infinite skin makes a great acne cleanser that I love so I tried this product. It is nothing like the other one and I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Bought this in hope it may help lighten acne scars unfortunatly no difference as per normal cheap brand cleansers toners</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this again. It did nothing for my little scar I had from accidentally scratching my shoulder. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I had sun spots, but since using this, along with the toner and moisturizer, they are barely noticeable and still fading!  I&#x27;ve used these products for about six weeks. It&#x27;s unrealistic to expect immediate results. I have tried so many other \\&quot;spot removers,\\&quot; and this combo is the first to work. When compared to a lot of other beauty regimens, it&#x27;s actually very affordable.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice I use it everyday but does not seem to help with acne scars or blemishes or future acne.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. It gently exfoliates the skin and cleanses, revealing a softer, smoother appearance. I wash my face, then rub it all over and let it sit for 10 seconds, then I scrub it all over my face using my fingers. I rinse then pat dry with a towel. This product would be very helpful for those with acne problems....Excellent product!</li>
    <li> My skin tingles and glows after using this wash. I do recommend be very careful not to get around eyes though the formula is very strong. Probably why they put the word aggressive in their name.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over a week, twice a day.  My skin is cleaner than it has been in years.  A slight sting but does not linger. Great fragrance.  My skin is luminous - a glow like appearance.  No irritation, non drying and I believe it cleans my pores.  Make up is disolved completely.  I have dry, aging skin so I try to keep non drying products on my face, but would usually end up greasy and not feeling like I cleaned my face.  I highly recommend you trying this.  I would not think it would be for acne but this company makes a glycolic cleanser that would work on that skin type.</li>
    <li> This is not a cleanser but is a better exfolliant the beads are minute and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin.Just remember it is not a cleanser because I usually use a toner after and the cotton ball was still not clean,I had to use another cleanser.A good product however for exfoliation and the minty feel is good except make sure it does not get in the eyes.So buyer Beware.</li>
    <li> Ok just a heads up, this is not a foamy cleanser, its very fluid and acts better as a 5 minute lotion/mask, Its strong and definitely helps exfoliate but I suspect that some of the ingredients are comedogenic(pore clogging) so avoid if you have acne prone skin, I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This has all 3 acids in it...makes my skin feel super soft...I leave it on for about 5 minutes...I&#x27;ve used it on the back of my hands and chest too...it is making my summer damaged skin look and feel younger...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m really digging it. I originally bought it because I had heard of all the benefits of lactic acid for acne prone/scarred skin so I decided, rather than jump into something harsh like a chemical peel, I&#x27;d start by trying this. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I wouldn&#x27;t really use it as a cleanser without some kind of follow-up. It&#x27;s great to use in the morning because it has a pepermint-y smell and it tingles, waking you and your skin up, so after a long night or when I feel like I need a pick-me-up I&#x27;ll use it. However, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t really do a good job of cleaning off my makeup nor do I feel like it does a good job of clearing up all the oil/dirt on my face after a long day. The exfoliating beads are small and sparse so they don&#x27;t really do much - I use it with an slightly textured face cloth and I find that adds just enough abrasion to exfoliate properly.&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, I use this mainly as a mask every few days and I&#x27;ve found that method works best for me. I usually just put a thick layer all over my face (I&#x27;m sensitive around the eyes and I find that sometimes, even if I just use it as a cleanser, that area can get red/irritated so beware), leave it on for 5 minutes, and wash off either in the shower or using a warm face cloth. I&#x27;ve found that my skin looks refreshed, feels super clean after and has definitely improved. It does a great job of clearing out my pores - I have a few scars from breakouts and those are getting lighter/blending into my skin much more quickly since I started using this. I think that there is a slight bleaching effect associated with this product because I noticed that my skin is a little more pale, which doesn&#x27;t bother me but if that&#x27;s something that might be an issue for you watch out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this.

    <li> Its pretty hard to isolate the effect of this product, especially if this is not the only product you use. I use sunscreen all the time along with this product. The combined effect is good, my face feels brightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had experience, as well as read some articles in internet, that if use products which may make your skin sensitive, then it is advised to use sunscreen to avoid sunburns. I had sunburns with other products, so using sunscreen is always &#x27;yes&#x27; for me with any products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be specific, the chilling effect or the kind of mint experience on the face is good, it feels refreshing. I did recommend my friend to give a try.</li>
    <li> This helped with my freckles/ sun damage But what I noticed was that it really faded my post acne spots AND prevented new pimples. This product does sting but I think delivers. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past two weeks and I have noticed a difference in my skin. I use this product as a mask, leaving it on for about 10 minutes while I&#x27;m in the shower. Once I rinse it off my face my skin is very smooth. It has gotten rid of my acne right away and as far as lightening/fading some of my dark spots from acne scarring it has slowly lightened areas that were considerably darker due to hyper pigmentation.  When you apply this product there is a lot of tingling and a slight burn which I love bc that means it&#x27;s working, right? I will continue using this until I find something better.</li>
    <li> it is useable, but the strength isn&#x27;t as effective as I think.  I would recommend for minimal use i would reorder</li>
    <li> I like the tingly feeling on my skin. I have not seen any great results yet. I like the feel on my skin.</li>
    <li> Product is working nicely, love the way it leaves my skin feeling clean, and I can feel it working on my skin and the issues I have with discoloration</li>
    <li> I love leaving this on my skin for a full three minutes or more and then exfoliating by adding some mild scrubbing grains.  This feels so good and has removed the flaky skin that I always seem to have that makes makeup look bad.</li>
