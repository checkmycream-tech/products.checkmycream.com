<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> best body lotion I have ever used, &#x27;nuff said</li>
    <li> no smell, great moisturizing, not tested on animals….favorite lotion for those dry winter months!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and have it in my kitchen, bathroom and vanity.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream due to being very allergic to mi practically everything you can imagine and since the climate in the area that I live in is very hot so I get very bad dry skin, so I went searching for a cream that was organic and not tested on animals and I could use on a daily basis for my whole body, however when I found this cream I instantly bought it when I read that it was 100% vegan and that it had good reviews, but when i recieved the cream the bottle was very dirtyand  I read on the back it clearly states it is Only 13% Organic now that was a let down I wonder why they would say its 100%  vegan if its dilled with alcohol and other hazardous chemicals? I also did not like the smell I was expecting it to have no fragrance but it had a awful alcohol/ chemical smell to it I almost vomited from the smell I do not want to smell like that. But anyways why judge a product without trying it? So I did and.. I have to say I don&#x27;t ushally complain but it was oily, it moisturizes but not too much because its a very thin cream. I am not happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Was very surprised at the quality. Reminds me of Keri Lotion smell and thickness. I did add a little of my own favorite oil Jojoba to make it a bit more oily. Perfect! Glad I gave it a try!</li>
    <li> Great lotion - nice consistency, not sticky at all and works really well.  Like others have said, this doesn&#x27;t burn even when you have a tiny cut.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who is very particular about his lotion being non-greasy. He absolutely loved it and so looks like we will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Love!!!  Best body moisturizer for dry, sensitive, itchy skin.  Will never buy another brand, this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It&#x27;s creamy, rich and absorbs quickly. Not sticky, and made with organic ingredients.  Best of all for me, there is absolutely no fragrance!  Other \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; lotions I&#x27;ve tried still had some sort of faint chemical smell but this stuff is just great! Highly recommended, and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love it!  And, I love the fact that I&#x27;m not benefiting from an animal being cruelly tested for it!  I love animals too much to take advantage of their suffering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of oily lotions and this is definitely NOT oily! The lotion is thick, creamy and works great as a hand / body lotion but is also gentle enough to use on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last summer, I was diagnosed with an MCI/MI allergy and almost all soaps, lotions, etc contain it, so I was happy that this lotion didn&#x27;t contain any of that nasty stuff or other harsh chemicals. Thank you for saving my skin! :)</li>
    <li> My daughter is a vegan and was happily surprised with this lotion. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Since finding this product at a natural food store 2 years ago, I have not purchased any other body lotion. I like the fact that it is unscented (there is a slight floral/lavendar smell but very slight, however others could say Elmer&#x27;s glue) so can add essential oils in smaller lotion containers if want...one for everyday of the week HA! My skin always feels moisturized and soft with the oils they put in this product that really helps to seal/retain moisture, basically what they put in this product is wonderful!  Also it is cruelty-free and you can&#x27;t beat that beauty!</li>
    <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t greasy.  It goes on quickly absorbs completely and feels great.  I have used this product for a number of years and think it is the best stuff out on the market.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> In addition to being vegan and cruelty free,  it is also the best lotion I have found for my legs.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best fragrance free lotion I&#x27;ve used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES NOT contain petrolatum or mineral oil. So it immediately gets thumbs up in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself truly works its magic. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy residue on your skin, and is truly fragrance free. After immediately applying it, I don&#x27;t have any issue leaving \\&quot;lotion streaks\\&quot; on personal grooming bottles, door knobs, keyboard, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there is a slight \\&quot;aloe\\&quot; scent in the lotion, but it is not as noticeable as the shea butter smell in the BWC Extra Rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it over any other fragrance free lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is GREAT for laying your fragrances. Apply immediately after drying off from a shower, wait about five minutes and apply your fragrance where you&#x27;ve applied the lotion. I apply the lotion all over my body, but I spray twice on my chest and once on my neck.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, thick and creamy moisturizer.  I use it primarily in the winter on hands and body.  It is indeed fragrance free without any strange underlying smell (which is sometimes the case with ff products).  I have oily *and*sensitive skin so I do not use this on my face.  It is thick and creamy but absorbs into the skin quickly.  No skin irritation whatsoever.</li>
    <li> The lotion had a strange odor for not being scented. I just didn&#x27;t prefer it over Eucerin calming cream.</li>
    <li> cruelty-free is my mantra for purchases, and this product is excellent ...BWC lotion is just what I was looking for :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite affordable lotion, hands down. It does not have that overwhelming chemical smell that some lotions have, nor does it feel waxy or heavy. I recently bought a bottle of Jergens Original Scent Cherry-Almond Moisturizer, but the smell and the waxiness made me give the almost-full bottle away. I also love Bliss Spa Body Butters, but those are $30 a tube! This lotion makes my skin very smooth and soft (since I have started using it, I have received a lot of compliments on how my skin feels) and you can scent it with oils if you want (I prefer not to). It absorbs quickly, too.</li>
    <li> Love this hand lotion. My favorite. Thick enough so it stays on dry skin areas.</li>
    <li> love that it&#x27;s unscented. It rubs in quickly and leaves no greasy residue. great for really dry skin-- my kids always joke my hands are like sandpaper, but this lotion quickly resolves that!</li>
    <li> I wanted a moisturizing lotion without chemicals.  This lotion is silky, smooth, and absorbs much better than some others I have used.  It doesn&#x27;t smell all perfumey like some and I like that it helps stop the itching from dry skin.  I liked it the first time I used it!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for years for an all natural lotion that hydrates my skin all day without feeling greasy or heavy. This lotion is my all-time favorite. It is so hydrating and my skin feels 10X healthier because of it. No odor either! I highly recommend this lotion and will be buying it regularly.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST everyday lotion I have ever found. I keep a bottle next to my bed, next to the kitchen sink, and in the car.  It keeps areas that tend to dry out: hands, feet, legs, etc. soft and itch-free -- all that, and it&#x27;s FRAGRANCE FREE.  Still, it manages to smell great, because of all the botanical extracts.  In the winter, when my hands get chapped, this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Safety Database website, SkinDeep, gives it a rating of \\&quot;3\\&quot;, which is in the low-moderate range of Health Concern.  When I discovered this lotion, in Whole Foods, several years ago, it was the ONLY lotion that didn&#x27;t have some toxic ingredient that I found objectionable.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my arms and legs and this lotion has truly been WONDERFUL in calming the flare-ups. I&#x27;ve tried so many other creams including a topical steroid (yuck), and this is my favorite remedy so far. The lotion isn&#x27;t thin or greasy, and it has no fragrances or other ingredients that bother my skin. Thank you BWC!</li>
    <li> My son and I suffer from eczema and so we have tried our share of products.  This lotion is creamy.  It goes on and instantly soaks in, so you don&#x27;t feel slimy or sticky at all.  It isn&#x27;t as thick as a cream though, so at night I will most likely still apply a heavy cream, but this is great during the day.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice lotion! I picked it because my skin is 1. very dry 2. very sensitive and 3. having allergy problems. This really has no bad chemicals in it, since I read the label.&lt;br /&gt;It is listed as unscented, but it does have a light, pleasant smell when it comes out of the bottle. It&#x27;s fairly light, not too thick but not too runny.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t revolutionizing my life, but it&#x27;s a nice lotion, does not irritate my skin, and does its job. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Yes, best unscented lotion ever.  Perfect to spray cologne on before blending and putting on.  Moisturizes fairly well, for the body, not for hands though.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion.. Not greasy &amp; your skin stays moisturized for the whole day</li>
    <li> I use this lotion right after a shower mixed with argan oil.  It moisturizes my skin adequately.  I would probably order this product again.</li>
    <li> No odor whatsoever. Great moisturizer...and I love how it doesn&#x27;t feel like there are chemicals over my skin. Highly recommend. Will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> I have started using this for myself and my small children.  Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, and keeps skin comfortable all day.  So glad to find a natural lotion that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg!</li>
    <li> I like that this lotion has mostly natural ingredients and is free of parabens and perfumes, but it is not very moisturizing for my extremely dry skin. So what I do is pump some out and then add shea butter, argan oil or castor oil. Since it works well as a base, I may order again if the price is right.</li>
    <li> First off I have guttate psoriasis and anyone with psoriasis of any sort know they have to use  A HEAVY moisturizer. I however can not because heavy moisturizers usually are very greasy. Those greasy products irritate my skin and make my psoriasis worse which you can imagine is being stuck between a rock and a hard place. This lotion was heaven sent. It went on thick and creamy and I could see it absorb into my skin. I would have given it five stars but with shipping it ended up costing over 20 bucks which is a lot of money for the amount you get which for me I will be lucky if it lasts a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Like it, hope have baby ones</li>
    <li> This hand lotion is not fragrance free, as advertised and as indicated on the label. It has a fragrance.</li>
    <li> i won&#x27;t use any other lotion ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i found this in a vitamin type grocery store over 25 years ago and when i found out that it doesn&#x27;t contain animal ingredients and uses no animal testing, that is why i purchased it back then. i found that this lotion is the only lotion that really does the job in keeping your skin soft without any waxey type of residue or that flaking that often happens with other lotions and you never feel greasy from it. it has all healthy ingredients and i love the fact that this is fragrance free. i don&#x27;t like perfumes of any kind and this is wonderful. and the bottle is recyclable too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll continue to buy this lotion. over 25 years and counting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, thanks for finding this review helpful - i posted my dissatisfaction in finding out that WET ONES wipes (in the list of all my reviews of verified purchases) was found out to contain LANOLIN which is a slaughterhouse ingredient, and I refuse to use anything like that - not to mention wet ones wipes stink AWFUL (even though people say it smells great??? what? they obviously are messed up in their olfactory senses.) but they&#x27;re thumbs downing my review because i mentioned the slaughterhouse ingredients (i added that it stinks afterward when people were already rating my review down). so please, try and find cruelty free products as much as possible. this beauty without cruelty lotion would never even be considered by most people because they&#x27;re content with cruelty to all kinds of animals (say one thing do another). this beauty without cruelty brand lotion is not tested on animals either. please go as much as you can with cruelty free products, even though most people will HATE you for it. :)</li>
    <li> I have pretty dry skin.  This lotion doesn&#x27;t truly absorb into the skin and moisturize.  Instead it sits on top of your skin.  How do I know this?  Because when I shower at the end of the day, all the lotion residue washed off.  Kind of gross.  I would&#x27;ve returned it if I could :)</li>
    <li> my favorite lotion and the service for delivery has never failed me !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to describe this product first. The bottle is just a regular sixteen fluid ounce bottle. So to give youa good idea, the bottle holds the same amount any standard size water bottle holds. For example the regular twenty four pack of Dasani water you buy at the grocery store, one of those bottles holds the same amount this bottle of lotion is holding.&lt;br /&gt;  It has a pump for a top. At first I was concerned about htis because when I travel I was afraid something else in my luggage would press the pump and lotion would spill on my things. But on my recent trip it didn&#x27;t do that at all. I usually like the screw on tops with small lid because it&#x27;s less likely to spill.&lt;br /&gt;  I like the lotion a lot. I tried this lotion for th efirst time only because Amazon keeps running out of the organic Lily of the Dessert lotion.&lt;br /&gt;  The reason I have turned to organic lotions is because the none organic mainstream lotions like Nivea, Aveeno etc. Instead of hydrating my skin actually dry out my skin. For the past year I noticed my skin was just getting dryer and dryer. My skin would only feel hydrated at the instant I put the lotion on and ten minutes later my skin ws super dry if not even dryer than it was before. To the point where people started noticing and calling me out n it even though I put lotion about three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;  This lotion at first was working wonders. My skin was the most hydrated and soft as I remember when I wan&#x27;t having this dry skin problem.I also started using it on my face because others reviewers stated it helped them with acne. Although I don&#x27;t have any noticable acne by touch I could tell I have small blemishes at the bottom of my cheeks near the chin. This lotion has really reduced those blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;  My skin feels super soft and not oily any more. I sweat a ot in the summer and that&#x27;s the only time I et some noticable acne about two or three small zits occasionally. But even though i&#x27;ve been sweating terribly this otion has helped keep the acne away and reduced my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;  It works wonders on my body too. But when summer started I noticed my skin has been a little dryer again. The lotion  definitely is still is better than before but it isn&#x27;t as hydrated and soft as it first when I first started using the lotion. But it could just be the change in weather too.&lt;br /&gt;  I am giving this lotion five stars anyway because even though it&#x27;s not working right now as good as it was at first on my hands the lotion has made my skin way better than before. So I imagine that for any other person with normal skin it owuld work even better than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;  I would definitely consider buying this product again. It is a good product. It was about the same price that the other lotions that weren&#x27;t working for me. I also got free two day shipping with my prime membership. So it&#x27;s definitely worth it and a great deal. I definitely didn&#x27;t lose anything and gained some benefits using this lotion. Thank you.d keep the acne away and reduced my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;  It works wonders on my body too.

    <li> I have eczema and began looking for a lotion that is fragrance free and not full of chemicals that make my eczema worse. I love this lotion. I have added some lavender oil to some of it and also have kept some of it as is. The consistency is just right and makes my skin soft. My eczema was pretty bad before I started using this so I will have to update after I&#x27;ve used it for more than a week. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like it and my wife likes it and no bunnies were tortured to make it. All good.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! Clean, light fragrance, and it lasts all day and all night.  Concentrated so I don&#x27;t feel like I have to apply half the bottle at a time.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a good lotion without all the bad additives in it, preferably a vegan, no cruelty one. I had tried several different ones but had different issues with them. Either the consistency was too thick or too thin, the smell was too strong, etc. This lotion has the perfect consistency and absorbs well. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it either, so the bottle lasts a long time. There is no perfume-y overpowering smell either. I will continue to buy this lotion, it is great!</li>
    <li> This is one of those lotions you can slap on after a shower, absorbing quickly so you can get dressed without residue on your clothes. BUT because of this very factor (higher water content), it&#x27;s not very hydrating for dry skins. Granted, something with more emolliency would feel a tad more oily, or take a little longer to sink in, but that&#x27;s the tradeoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proof for me? My dry, scaly legs reverted to their reptilian state not long after applying. There&#x27;s just too much water in it that dissipates, where it can&#x27;t promise all-day moisturization. I find it very similar to Alba Botanica body lotion, another competitor in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dry scaly skins that need more long-wear hydration, i have since found my Holy Grail: Nuxe 24hr Moisturizing Body Lotion -- a little more pricey, but it&#x27;s emolliency that you can feel and truly see the effects.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have used every known prescription for my eczema but this lotion has soothed and healed the dryness and cracking of my hands.  It never irritates as even some Rx creams and lotions can.  I am so glad I found this. Now I keep it all over the house and carry it everywhere.  Would be great to have small travel sizes.</li>
    <li> Use on body..no smell</li>
    <li> BWC is never tested on animals and does not contain animal ingredients. It is a wonderful scent free moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used to use Nivea cream for my skin. I&#x27;m a man of 23 and I wanted to change to a Cruelty free cream without scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream it has a smell, it really quiet neutral for my taste so i like it. The only issue that I have is that after putting on my skin, it feels a bit sticky. I think I will get used to it</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  When it ran out, I bought &amp;#34;Everyone Lotion for Everyone and Everybody, Coconut and Lemon&amp;#34; because I was looking for a larger size bottle.  Really didn&#x27;t like that product and, despite the bottle being 3/4 full still, I&#x27;m going back to the BWC.</li>
    <li> Great hand cream and cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I love that this is unscented--occasionally I get a slight baby powder scent, I&#x27;m not sure why--but doesn&#x27;t have that chemical smell that so many other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products have.  It is thick but not heavy, smoothes on easily without feeling greasy, and keeps my skin well-moisturized.  I use it as a body lotion for myself and my son and we both love it.  I&#x27;m very glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!  It works great!  It&#x27;s hard to find lotion that doesn&#x27;t have parabens or petroleum in it, not to mention a host of other undesirable ingredients, but BWC fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BWC soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy.  It works quickly and makes your hands nice and soft, even with really dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the smell of bread dough, however, you won&#x27;t like this lotion, because it does have a distinct yeasty smell as you&#x27;re applying it.  (The smell dissipates after it has been rubbed into your skin.)  You can add essential oils, apparently, but I&#x27;m sensitive to scents, so I didn&#x27;t try that.  But I don&#x27;t mind the base smell of the product.</li>
    <li> I am someone that prefers to buy American-made products when possible. I was happy to find that this is one of those products. I bought this as a replacement for Vaseline Intensive Care, and this is working out very well. I have been slowly phasing out all of my chemical laden beauty products and buy things that are better for me and the environment, but I also need to save money when I can. I am on a budget. I realize this is more expensive than Vaseline, but I believe it is worth it. This works just as well or better than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; moisturizers, plus it is paraben free and fragrance free. It is very thick but still applies easily and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;m not sure that one reviewer that said this was very thin was reviewing the correct product, because I can put a dollop of this on my finger and hold it at a 90 degree angle without it moving. That is thick! The downside is that it is hard to get all the product out of the bottle once there isn&#x27;t enough to pump. I have bruised my hand trying to slap out the last of it. This also doesn&#x27;t have \\&quot;that smell\\&quot; that fragrance free products have. You know that kind of off-putting plastic or chemical-like smell that makes you wish it had fragrance added. I really have to put my nose close to the lotion to smell anything at all, and even then it is hardly noticeable. The bottle states that you can add your own essential oils to the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this lotion and have been using it for almost a year now. I have noticed that my shin skin doesn&#x27;t flake during the winter anymore, and I get a lot less hangnails. I apply it once to my legs in the morning and I am good all day. I even use this on my face occasionally and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, and on my lips when I can&#x27;t find my Chapstick. If I really had to nit-pick and find something wrong with this, I would say the bottle is too smooth. It is pretty slippery and I have dropped this on my feet a few times. I thought I broke one of my toes with a full bottle of this, so beware! Or just don&#x27;t be as clumsy as I am.this, so beware! Or just don&#x27;t be as clumsy as I am.</li>
    <li> I love this, takes away dryness and has no smell, no perfumes.</li>
    <li> An effective moisturiser. No icky scent. Absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I use it each night after washing my face.  There is no smell that I can detect, and it does not feel greasy.  Exactly what I wanted.  And cruelty free and vegan!</li>
    <li> I like BWC lotions, and this is my favorite.  The only problem is that sometimes I get a bottle that the pump won&#x27;t work.  So I keep the one that works and use it on the next bottle.  A little goes a long way, no fragrance, great safe lotion!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  raised it to 5 star since every bottle has worked well.</li>
    <li> It is pretty good, has a slight lotion smell.  When I added Frankincense and Spikenard, it smells much better.  Yum!</li>
    <li> Great product for those needing unscented products as I do.</li>
    <li> This lotion is thick but glides on easily.  No sticky residue and is quickly absorbed by the skin.  Definitely ordering more.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple of years for a face lotion both at night and in the morning (in the morning, I use power after a few minutes of it soaking in).  I don&#x27;t break out or have any other issues. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. It isn&#x27;t greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t make me get little red bumps on my arms! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an allergy or what, but other lotions always break me out in tiny red bumps on my upper arms. This is a great everyday lotion that I can use all over, and I am thrilled that it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing not to like is that it isn&#x27;t great for super dry skin. I still have to use something else on my hands, knees, feet etc because this just doesn&#x27;t cut it for those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: I finally got to the bottom of the bottle and am really annoyed with this packaging. The straw inside the bottle is way too short to reach the bottom. There was a good 2-3 ounces left down there so I&#x27;ve had to balance the bottle upside down (not easy with the pump on top but I put it in the middle of a toilet paper roll) and open the lid each time to get some out. I don&#x27;t want to throw out that much product, but I find myself not wanting to take the time to use this lotion now that I can&#x27;t just pump it out quickly.</li>
    <li> My new favorite body lotion! I love how this moisturizes and it smells perfectly fragrance free (some fragrance free stuff kind of isn&#x27;t). Plus, I have really sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t irritated it at all. Will re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I wanted an unscented lotion to underpin my parfums. I read that moisturising the skin before applying parfum gives the parfum much greater longevity. Unfortunately, I did not find this to be the case at all. I applied the lotion to one arm only. I applied my parfum to both arms. The arm with the lotion severely muted my parfum and did not increase its longevity. I do not blame the lotion for this, of course, but I cannot use it for the purpose I planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The thing I am most pleased about with this lotion is that it is cruelty free;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It arrived promptly and in good condition;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It is 99.99% scent free;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Does NOT sink into my skin;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Feels thick, heavy, sticky, and sits on top of my skin;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Applied a little bit at night to my hands only, I still have to wash it off in the morning with soap and water because my hands feel sticky and unclean. I cannot imagine applying this all over my body because I would feel sticky all over and need a bath first thing in the morning to wash it off;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The bottle is too large. A smaller bottle would be nice. I would have rather spent half this much money for half the amount of lotion as it will take FOREVER for me to use up a bottle this large. If you use copious amounts of lotion each day, the big bottle makes sense; however, if you mainly apply just a bit to your hands two or so times a day to moisturise them, it will take you well over a year I am sure to finish this large bottle;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I depended on the rave reviews on Amazon before I purchased this. Amazon reviews usually help me find the best product for myself, but this time they did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad so many people love this product, but it just does not work for me. I must have a lotion that feels clean, sinks into my skin, and disappears. I will use up this lotion so as not to totally waste the money I spent on it, but I will return to my old lotion which is Jergens. Jergens sinks into my skin and pretty much disappears whilst still leaving my skin feeling moisturised. The BWC did not really moisturise my skin so much as coat it with a thick, sticky, and somewhat waxy feeling. Sorry, but I cannot recommend this product.  The makers do not like me to tell you this, though, so they have given my review the &amp;#34;thumbs down&amp;#34; any time I post about it.  Makes me wonder about the maker of any product who cannot take constructive criticism.  The bottom line is this lotion did not work for me for the reasons stated.will return to my old lotion which is Jergens.

    <li> Not as excited about this lotion as I was hoping.  I have used Curel Fragrance Free for years, but was hoping to replace it with something &amp;#34;cleaner.&amp;#34;  Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.  It seems to me to sit on top of the skin, as opposed to really sinking in and moisturizing.  I prefer the Curel.</li>
    <li> The listed ingredients end in an ellipsis, three dots, which I suspected meant they were leaving out ingredients from their description. Why would they do that? So I looked it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the COMPLETE list of ingredients from their web site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Purified water, glycerin, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) oil*, glyceryl stearate,&lt;br /&gt;cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil, Aloe&lt;br /&gt;barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice*, stearic acid, Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba)&lt;br /&gt;oil*, Butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, Linum usitatissimum (flax) seed oil*,&lt;br /&gt;Prunus dulcis (sweet almond) oil*, Aleurites moluccana (kukui) nut oil,&lt;br /&gt;Calendula officinalis (calendula) extract*, Lavandula angustifolia (lavender)&lt;br /&gt;extract*, Rosa damascena (rose) extract, Citrus aurantium (orange) blossom&lt;br /&gt;extract, Anthemis nobilis (chamomile) extract*, Arnica montana (arnica)&lt;br /&gt;extract*, allantoin, panthenol, sodium PCA, ascorbic acid, tocopherol,&lt;br /&gt;magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, soy lecithin, phenoxyethanol, ethyl hexyl&lt;br /&gt;glycerin, benzyl alcohol *Organic 12% Organic Content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bothered to look up just one of them on Wikipedia and the safety section had this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Phenoxyethanol is an alternative to standard, potentially harmful formaldehyde-releasing preservatives.[7]&lt;br /&gt;Patch test&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2005–06, methyldibromoglutaronitrile/ phenoxyethanol was the ninth-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (5.8%).[8]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has warned that the chemical is toxic to infants via ingestion, and &amp;#34;can depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea.&amp;#34; Combined with Chlorphenesin, these two chemicals can cause respiratory depression in infants.[9] Since these chemicals are often present in cosmetics and lotions applied to the hands and are easily ingested, caution should be exercised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;German research in 1999, concluded that it had neurotoxin potential, but in a concentration-dependent manner.[10]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data sheets show chromosomal changes and genetic mutation effects in testing as well as testicular atrophy and interference with reproductivity in mice for other Glycol Ethers, although Phenoxyethanol is not mentioned in the abstract.[11]&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put something on my skin some of it is going to be absorbed into my bloodstream.

    <li> Wow.  It has a nice thick texture like Keri (Keri is so very) lotion.  I will only get this brand.</li>
    <li> One of very few lotions that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my eczema and provides enough hydration. And the price is great too!</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. I love that it is fragrence free and cruelty free, yet still leaves great moisture.</li>
    <li> Lightweight but moisturizing. Very nice.</li>
    <li> great works well with my very sensative skin</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very good service from seller.</li>
    <li> It is very thick and emollient and although it is labelled &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; it does have a slight odor which I find pleasant.  Glad to find such a great alternative to ALBA&#x27;s lotions, since ALBA is a brand I can no longer support.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and no scent. I love this! Makes my dry skin really happy and makes me happy that there is no animal testing!</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this fragrance free hand and body lotion.  It&#x27;s a nice, sort of medium-weight lotion that was good for spring/summer/fall.  For winter I&#x27;ll be looking for something in more of a heavy-weight formulation.</li>
    <li> Has a weird and bad smell but after using it for a while it went away, for the most part. This lotion works very very well so i use it on my hands daily</li>
    <li> I prefer a thicker, creamier feeling lotion, but this one does the job! This is the best cruelty-free lotion I&#x27;ve found so far. I even use a little bit in my hair and it helps control the frizz.</li>
    <li> Not tested on animals and works wonderful to make your hands  soft.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I have issues with ezcema and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve found that helps banish the itching and pain.  I also love that it&#x27;s got a lower rating on the EWG scale.</li>
    <li> This is a very well formulated lotion with no bad preservatives and no fragrance. Comes in 2 weights for winter and summer.</li>
    <li> I feel very strongly about buying products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals, and I&#x27;m really happy with my first BWC purchase.  I thought it was a good price for a generous 16 oz. bottle.  I see some reviewers hated the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; of this fragrance-free lotion, but I must say that the very slight, subtle neutral scent didn&#x27;t bother me in the least and dissipated within seconds of application.  I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed it if I hadn&#x27;t put my hands up to my nose.  The bottle label tells me I can add 1 tsp. of an essential oil to the contents, but I&#x27;m leaving it as-is.  The lotion is creamy and absorbs quickly.  One pump was enough for my hands, neck and elbows.  It&#x27;s absolutely non-greasy and has left my hands velvety and ready to type this review without problem.  I will have no hesitation in trying other BWC products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just received my second order of this lotion and expect it will become a standard.  Good texture and feel, subtle and rapidly disappearing scent, quick absorption.  I thought I had earlier rated this 4-stars but, if so, I am boosting my rating now.  One minor drawback is the relatively quick fading of the moisturing effect--which could be related, in part, to living in New Hampshire in mid-winter.  The ingredient list is reassuring, unlike a vast number of other lotions on the market.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on all the positive reviews and it has met my expectations. Thick rich lotion, dries quickly, no discernible smell.</li>
    <li> I love fragrance free lotions.  This is very good for your skin and goes on smoothly not oily at all.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this.  no smell and it absorbs fast.  it works great!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff. This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve ordered it. I&#x27;m a nurse and constantly washing my hands, the alcohol rubs etc are incredibly drying to my hands. Not to mention I live in Colorado where we have less humidity than the Sahara (true fact, look it up!). Point is, this stuff works beautifully. It is light, fragrance free and absorbs easily into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. I added a couple of drops of lavender oil myself in the second bottle just because, and it added a nice easy scent to it. It goes on smooth enough that I can easily apply it to my whole body, but moisturizing enough that I take a bottle to work with me and keep it on my desk to use throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also to note, my skin is extremely sensitive (I have eczema) and I usually end up with a lot of skin allergies from some of the harsh chemicals added to more mainstream lotions. I&#x27;ve tried Gold Bond, Aveeno, Eucerin, Jergens, Shea Butter... you name it. If you look at the ingredient list for this BWC lotion, this is made up of really good ingredients, and my sensitive skin can definitely tell the difference :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely NO fragrance; NO stickieness whatsoever; perfect consistency;  lasts through multiple hand washings and no chemical concerns. I have been searching for this lotion all my life!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great lotion! It seems to last forever. No smell but nice to be natural!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice to know we can take care of our skin without screwing up the planet or being terribly mean to the little animals on it. It&#x27;s a wonderful, moisturizing body lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s fragrance free--there is a smell to it--but fortunately it&#x27;s pleasant and slight. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. I also buy this for my daughter who suffers from eczema.</li>
    <li> i threw away and returned many creams before I found the right one. this lotion is light but nourishing. leaves my hands soft but not sticky. the fragrance is very light almost smell free. i would recommend it to a queen! beautiful! thank you!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the first time and have to say I really like it. There is no fragrance so I use it on my face also. It sinks right into the skin and does not leave any residue at all. I also appreciate that it is cruelty-free, which is what I try to get whenever possible.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!!! I&#x27;m in my thirties and I find that my skin is dyer than it used to be. So, I need a lotion that really moisturizes. This goes on thick, but absorbs quickly and leaves no sticky residue. Great brand, great product!</li>
    <li> I found this product referenced on a Canadian Breast Cancer forum last year with links to the ingredients and science behind them. After trying it myself through Amazon (TyVm), I&#x27;m hooked and have been using it ever since.  I keep one bottle next to the kitchen sink for after doing dishes, and one next to my computer to remind me to use it at least once a day. I&#x27;m all about feeling comfortable first, but also looking great, well, that&#x27;s even better! The most dramatic results were on my feet. Part of my routine is a minute on my feet with a pumice stone (as needed) right before getting out of the shower, then using BWC on the tops,sides, and between toes. My feet have never looked so good in sandals. No lotions for the bottoms due to  the fact that I&#x27;m usually to impatient to let the lotion dry more than 15 secs and everyone knows slippery feet and sandals turns immediately into slap stick comedy. Totally love BWC, one of the many good things that made a hard time in my life so much easier.</li>
    <li> By far the best cruelty-free, fragrance free hand cream I have found.  Incredibly moisturizing with no smell at all, which is huge, as almost any hand lotion has lingering after-odors.  (I had been using Nature&#x27;s Gate prior to this, but it smelled like stale beer/a bar in daylight for some reason).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin, and I have had no problems with this lotion at all.  Using this after every time I wash my hands has solved a serious hand drying/cracking issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus points for semi-cool packaging.  Nature&#x27;s Gate products look like they belong in nursing homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BWC is definitely worth the couple extra bucks for those who need a cruelty-free, fragrance free hand lotion.</li>
    <li> I received my lotion a week ago. Since then I have been using it several times a day on my hands and on my face morning and night after washing up. It is a luxury product, non irritating for my sensitive skin, and soothing without perfumes or harmful ingredients. I love it, and will buy more when this bottle is empty.</li>
    <li> Awesome organic lotion that moisturizes very well. My fianc&amp;eacute; is sensitive to strong scents so I chose this lotion based on the reviews. We both loved it. It has a light, fresh, natural scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really picky about lotion, but this is great! Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave any weird residue feeling...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely light and mostly fragrance free and the low cost is good. Plus, cruelty free? What could be better?</li>
