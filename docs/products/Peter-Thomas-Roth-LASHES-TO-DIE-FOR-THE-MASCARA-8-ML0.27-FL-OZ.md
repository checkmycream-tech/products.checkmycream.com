      <li>Love this mascara!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been paying $28 for Lancome, and won&#x27;t have to do that any more!  </li>
      <li>So pleased Amazon is carrying this mascara!</li>
      <li>love it !</li>
      <li>love this mascara and will continue to buy it through Amazon!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I love this mascara!</li>
      <li>Love this mascara!</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>I really liked the comb and may purchase again for this reason.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit challenging to take off if you don&#x27;t have a good cleanser.  </li>
      <li>The brush works nicely as well.</li>
      <li>There are many volumizing mascaras out there, I wanted something that would also be good for my lashes.</li>
      <li>the product is really the best product i have ever used.</li>
      <li>and so I do need something spectacular.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK mascara and the price is fair, but whether I would die for it, I doubt it.</li>
      <li>Best part is when you are ready to remove, It comes off with ease.</li>
      <li>and I liked the price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very excited to find something this good.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply and curls nicely.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply, does not clump, separates your lashes, and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I immediately get a water soaked cotton pad and the mascara comes off very easily.</li>
      <li>5 stars-lashes to die for works very well, stays on very good also.</li>
      <li>It does exactly as it claims--the brush is amazing as it separates lashes better than any other product I have tried--and I have tried most of them out there, the consistency is perfect as it goes on smooth and leaves lashes looking thicker and longer, and best of all, it dries beautifully and stays that way all day.  </li>
      <li>This mascara is by far The Best !  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many brands of mascara trying to find one that helps to show up my lashes while not clumping, I was beginning to think I&#x27;d never find one I really liked until I found this brand</li>
      <li>Lancôme, pricey but effective  is so far my favorite on the market, but I continue to search for the perfect brand!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure why it has amazing reviews, but here&#x27;s what happened with me -</li>
      <li>This is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>My lashes are very fine , like my hair, but you could never tell it, with this mascara.  </li>
      <li>And it washes off easily!  </li>
      <li>I saw this on tv and loved the way it looked and was so excited to try it.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s great at first).</li>
      <li>I should have known based on the price that this was too good to be true.  </li>
      <li>This mascara is very smooth, not clumpy at all.</li>
      <li>The water resistance is also a huge plus!</li>
      <li>PTR&#x27;s Lashes to DIE for is much better than CLP.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>just OK</li>
      <li>Also, the brush wasn&#x27;t great, but despite using a better wand in hopes of getting the most out of it, it still wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this and a much more affordable drug store brand.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> nothing to die for;is not as advertise.</li>
    <li> Not only did this product make my eyes water but it also smeared badly.  I was very surprised and also disappointed.  From the description I was definitely expecting a superior product;  When I tried to inquire about returning it I got a reply from &amp;#34;Beauty something&amp;#34; which said they could not respond to my question because I was using the wrong email address.  I only have one and I typed it in several times to be sure it was being transmitted accurately. Each time got the same reply;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They provided a phone no where I can call but I have not had time to do it yet;  I will try to contact them again,  I thought I was ordering from Amazon.  I guess not--even though they are on your website.  I will not order beauty products again. I am on the Prime plan and have never had any problems whatsoever ordering other products from Amazon. .</li>
    <li> I tried to find mascara that has more natural ingredients but still works well. I love this mascara and it looks great!</li>
    <li> Its not worth the money.It is nice and dark but it dose not  make my lashes any longer.was disappointed.</li>
    <li> When you want mascara and not so clumsy</li>
    <li> Not a big fan.  It&#x27;s certainly not the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, but it is not \\&quot;to die for\\&quot;.  No volume, hardly any color, but good if you&#x27;re looking for a very natural look.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my stylist and I&#x27;m hooked.  I&#x27;m on my third purchase.  You do not get mascara under your eyes, no smudging.  It is a bit challenging to take off if you don&#x27;t have a good cleanser.  I&#x27;m using a foaming rose organic number that works really well.  Your lashes will truly look to die for!</li>
    <li> I think this mascara helps my lashes.  I love the brush.  It doesn&#x27;t glob or clump my thin lashes.  Also easy to remove with a lash cleaner.  Doesn&#x27;t flake and move once applied.</li>
    <li> My friends and I love this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, has a great applicator/brush, plus it conditions your lashes. My new favorite.</li>
    <li> So glad to find this mascara on the internet!  I tried it last year and went back to buy some more, but they are always sold out!  This is the only mascara I have ever used that makes my lashes look natural and healthy.</li>
    <li> Merle Norman changed their mascara wand and I decided I didn&#x27;t like it as well and began shopping around for a different mascara and came across this.  After reading the reviews maybe I expected too much or maybe the wand needs some use before I become totally amazed.  Regardless for the price paid it&#x27;s okay,would I order again, probably not.  Of course please keep in mind that I am an \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman with thinning eyelashes and so I do need something spectacular.</li>
    <li> This is the exact brush I&#x27;ve been looking for, its thin and spiky which makes it nice when you are applying it.. it actually separates your lashes instead of making them look clumped together. I must have bought 10 different kinds in the past year trying to find a good brush.  The actual mascara product is pretty good.  Its expensive but I plan on keeping the brush, washing it and using it with another product.</li>
    <li> Mascara is very good gives you long length and does not flake or smudge</li>
    <li> 2 nd re-order; lasts a long time; not one lash fell out during the use of this mascara. lashes seem stronger. great for sensitive eyes! LENGTH! VOLUME!</li>
    <li> this was the worst product. It did not do what it was supposed to do. I ended up throwing it in the trash!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through more mascaras than any one person should be allowed so I know good mascara when I find it!  This has been one of my favorites for nearly 2 years now, which is like a record.  Separates, defines, and lengthens without clumping, thanks to comb-like rubber/plastic bristles.  What I adore about this mascara is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t flake or leave lash lines/marks throughout the day, even when the temperature is soaring!  Definitely recommend to anyone with baby-fine lashes or sensitive/watery eyes.</li>
    <li> Was able to make the lashes look longer and it does separate them well.  It needs a eye remover to get off.</li>
    <li> This is by far the ABSOLUTE BEST mascara!!! I have tried almost every mascara on the market from high end to low end and nothing else compares. My lashes are full, long, dark and sexy. I have actually been asked if my lashes are fake... LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Finally...I&#x27;ve always had a problem with mascara. It just never liked me. Name it, it did it. This stuff, from a guy I never heard of before comes up with a brush that has very little brush. WHO&#x27;D A THOUGHT? Anyway, it doesn&#x27;t glop all over you, and make a mess, and later make your eyes red and tear up. Can we please have a hallelujah!&lt;br /&gt;PETER THOMAS ROTH, whoever you are, thank you!</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a full sized tube , but when it arrived it was a smaller size.  That said, this is one of the best mascaras I have ever used!! I was a avid Lancôme mascara user (for years!).  A beauty consultant recommended that I try the Peter Roth Lashes to Die For. The brush NEVER clumps, the mascara goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day.  ( Post Note: the smaller tube seems to last a long time and may help me remember to replace my mascara on a regular basis)</li>
    <li> This was the first Peter Thomas Roth product I tried. I really like this mascara. It goes on easy and last all day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product that really defines and lengthen your eyelashes, but it does not dry very quickly and stays wet. It pretty much put my eyelashes back to flat and straight after applying it. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! This was my first time trying it and I will keep buying it! It goes on easily and smooth. I put on a coat, let it dry then put on another. It hasn&#x27;t smudged or chipped off at all during the day. I live in the South where it&#x27;s humid and hot as a firecracker and it&#x27;s held up incredibly. Someone asked me yesterday what I used because they noticed it didn&#x27;t run or chip off under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found a mascara that I really like.  They promise a lot of things but don&#x27;t deliver.  Oh well, I guess that&#x27;s just the way it is!!</li>
    <li> This mascara is exactly what I wanted, It goes on even, smooth and does not glue your lashes together, I wanted just a natural dark look on my blonde eyelashes to show them off. I love the brush it applies a thin coat of tint and that&#x27;s all is needed. I will certainly buy this mascara again!!</li>
    <li> This mascara is truly perfect.  It does exactly as it claims--the brush is amazing as it separates lashes better than any other product I have tried--and I have tried most of them out there, the consistency is perfect as it goes on smooth and leaves lashes looking thicker and longer, and best of all, it dries beautifully and stays that way all day.  I have recommended this mascara to all my girlfriends, sisters, daughters, cousins, etc.</li>
    <li> the product is really the best product i have ever used.The design is very special,it make my eye brighter and wider.&lt;br /&gt;you will find it&#x27;s better than some luxuary brand.It&#x27;s really better than the money you cost!I love it !</li>
    <li> I would not have purchased this if I&#x27;d known it was the small travel size.  Too expensive.  Seller could have made that clear.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, it really thickens and lengthens the lashes. This is one of the best mascara&#x27;s I have tried.</li>
    <li> Based on previous older recommendations I saw here, I purchased as I was anticipating something wonderful for my lashes.  It was only so-so and nothing to rave about.  Perhaps it is just about average.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent mascara, but doesn&#x27;t seem to perform any better than any other drugstore type quality mascara.  Not as if you&#x27;re purchasing a Dior or Lancome.</li>
    <li> It was okay but for the price I paid I thought it was going to be better, I will not buy it again I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I can definitely see a difference in the length of my lashes.  The thinner wand is great, and there is no clumping.</li>
    <li> i use to use two different mascaras to achieve what this one does. I love it it makes my lashes look so long</li>
    <li> I ordered this mascara based on the positive reviews I read.. and I gotta say.. it&#x27;s probably the BEST mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 1 week but I am VERY pleased.  It doesn&#x27;t seem clumpy, and it separates nicely, doesn&#x27;t run if you get &#x27;weepy&#x27; nor does it smear ( I HATE when that happens!!).  What more could you ask for!!?  I&#x27;ve been paying $28 for Lancome, and won&#x27;t have to do that any more!  I don&#x27;t always review a product unless it&#x27;s great.. but since the reviews were so helpful for me, I decided to add mine!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and really makes lashes look thicker and longer!  Definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a great mascara.</li>
    <li> I use this mascara for my bottom lashes.  It smudges very little and is not too clumpy to use on the bottom lashes.  I use another brand for the top lashes.</li>
    <li> This mascara isn&#x27;t bad at all.  I noticed that when I put on one coat and wait about a minute than apply another coat, I can see the affect of plumping and separation.</li>
    <li> Definitely to die for!!!!!  Best mascarra.... I have tried.  Brands like lancome, channel, etc... but this one tops it all.&lt;br /&gt;really separate lashes, beautifully.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> When I hear lashes TO DIE FOR I have expections. this is no more than a lash tint which I can get for less than half the price and a very good quality. The merchant was fantastic and customer service was excellent but I was very disappointed in the product after I read it&#x27;s claims. Sorry!</li>
    <li> I like this product for everyday wear. It is expensive but it stays on all day long no flaking or smudging. It doesn&#x27;t give thick sexy eyelashes but it fabulous for everyday type mascara. It makes my lashes healthier and thicker looking. Double coating doesn&#x27;t work to make that sexy cat eye type mascara. I feel its a very good product.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST mascara I have ever used. It stays put once you put it on it without smudging and clumping. I will most certainly purchase this mascara again.</li>
    <li> First thought when I opened the package, I just spent $13 on a sample?!?!</li>
    <li> I have long but thin eyelashes so I was skeptical that this tiny brush with practically microscopic bristles would do anything to add volume. But with all the positive reviews, I knew I had to give it a try. I used it this morning and was pleasantly surprised how thick they looked. The mascara does a great job of separating out each lash and plumping it up as it goes, giving a very full but natural (no sticky heavy lashes) look. I only put on 1 coat as I was just running errands today but I&#x27;m optimistic that a few more coats will add a lot more impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive eyes and wear contacts which makes them super sensitive to products, I had no reaction to this nor did I notice any flaking or darkness under my eyes at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> great mascara works wonders even on tiny lashes .&lt;br /&gt;has two different lengths in the applicator brush .&lt;br /&gt;seems new</li>
    <li> This product really works!</li>
    <li> This makes my lashes very long.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  No more raccoon eyes, clumps or black flecks on my face.</li>
    <li> I must say it does go on smoothly.  You have to put a lot on to achieve a look.  It is not waterproof and I am not sure I would spent this much again on this product. I doubt I will change my mind.  I have only used once and I wish the color were brown.&lt;br /&gt; Itis way overpriced and no one has even noticed a difference as they would fake eyelashes.  Learn how to do your own fake lashes, they are very impressive and not difficult to do yourself with a little practice.</li>
    <li> A light natural looking coverage. Does not glop on when I use it and I do not have to try remove excess.  When I have use other brands, I have always had to wipe excess off of the applicator, and only found mascara easy to use when the mascara was almost empty.  I do have dark and fairly long lashes already, but am at an age where they have thinned and I also have a  couple white/grey ones here and there.  So I am not looking for a real made up glam look, but rather to keep the look I have always had without mascara (but I have alwsays been a consistent eyelash curler).</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite mascara! It does not clump, does not make your eyelashes stiff, but does make them super long.</li>
    <li> I like this so far (have been using for about two weeks) but I began using it when I started Revitalash so it&#x27;s hard to know which product is making my lashes look healthier.  It goes on really clean with no clumping at all.  The small brush makes it easy to get to tiny corner lashes.  Doesn&#x27;t really give much volume but good for separation.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY mascara that will not budge or smudge during the day!  And it washes off easily!  Really extends my natural lashes, making them seem longer, and gets in the corners to grab the little ones.  I work as a designer, where I am likely to sweat on a busy day...at the end, my mascara looks like it did when I left the house in the morning.  Try this if you are tired of racoon eyes!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It does not clump, separates my eyelashes perfectly. I love the natural look I can create with it! Will repurchase. If you are looking for a dramatic effect this might not be a good choice</li>
    <li> Product was totally dried out. Was not in box and had no mascara in tube. Very disappointed.  Will be very careful about who I buy from after this!</li>
    <li> It arrived with no packaging whatsoever to indicate was unused. Was clumpy and the consistency was as if it was old. I would recommend trying another product or perhaps buying directly from a store</li>
    <li> Love this mascara. Didn&#x27;t think anything could beat Diorshow but this works better for me. Separates and lengthens lashes beautifully. If you have a reasonable set of lashes and are looking for something to subtly enhance, this is it. Looks natural but polished.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not all that!  You can get the same results with any mascara you can&lt;br /&gt;purchase in any store.  No big deal.</li>
    <li> Beginning in December, I had an issue with some of my eyelashes on my right eye falling out! This happened to me years ago, so I didn&#x27;t think much of it. But they weren&#x27;t growing back. I used castor oil religiously for months, but nothing worked. I researched different options, including Latisse, RapidLash, etc., but after reading the reviews on this product I thought I would give it a try. All I can say is this product WORKS!! My lashes are back after a month and a half of using it, and I don&#x27;t use it every single day. This is without a doubt the best mascara I have ever used, and it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Brush was not as slim as it appears in picture. The mascara also felt a bit dry, so I hope it is not just an old tube (out of date)? It goes on fairly easy, though I have to apply several coats. It comes off with makeup remover.  All in all, it appears to be of decent quality. I will need more time to see how it works after a couple weeks</li>
    <li> I am VERY picky with my mascara. It seems to be hard to find a mascara that really emphasizes that without making my lashes clumpy and hard. I LOVE THIS MASCARA. It glides on smoothly, and it REALLY makes my eyelashes longer than I thought was possible. It doesn&#x27;t clump, and my eyelashes aren&#x27;t rock hard by the end of the day. I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another mascara. Ever. I definitely recommend this mascara to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous mascara.  It goes on easily and does not clump.  It has good staying power - if I&#x27;m feeling lazy and don&#x27;t take it off at night, I can just touch it up the next morning and go.  That said, it is easy to get off with a mascara remover product.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have real sensitive eyes and I&#x27;m prone to allergy eyes. This does not make my eyes tear or turn red. I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> I wear extended use contacts and have allergies, so have always stuck with waterproof mascaras; Loreal Double extend or Lancome&#x27;s waterproof mascaras.  Once in awhile I read reviews on a mascara saying how it is difficult to get off and  no \\&quot;racoon eyes\\&quot;, etc. so I think, maybe it will work and I try it!  I have been through some excruciating times with non waterproof mascara, some in public places.  It starts with a tiny tear from allergies or a speck of dust or mascara in my eye and then under my contact, which is so painful.  Then I cannot see in front of me because of the watering of my eyes and...UGH, the pain!  Mascara is no longer on my lashes but all over my eye &amp; part of my face.  I&#x27;m sure, many of you, have had these experiences. I even had to have an RX eye medication for an infection due to this, once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m doing just fine with my waterproof mascaras, but I read reviews on another \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot; mascara which says, it is difficult  to get off, no flaking or running and \\&quot;no raccoon eyes\\&quot;.  I have said I will never try a non-waterproof mascara again, but, I love PTR products, so decided to try this one.  Same as always, a mistake, for me.  Now, at least, I try them out at home first, so the disaster thing doesn&#x27;t happen in public!  About an hour after application,  something got under my contact, I assume a very tiny piece of mascara, and then, it begins.  I feel the base of my lashes at the waterline, it is very wet  and I have black all over my finger.  If I don&#x27;t hurry and get it off, it will all be in my eye and I&#x27;ll be in pain, so  I immediately get a water soaked cotton pad and the mascara comes off very easily. Not difficult at all.  I did use some Caudalie oil to clean it up and get it all off, though. it may be water resistant, but it is not tear resistant, just so ya know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, for those of you who do not struggle with these same these things as I do,  and can wear non-waterproof mascara,  this is an excellent mascara. I loved the way it made my lashes look.  I have been using the Careprost (Identical to Latisse  only get it from India Pharmacy for very cheap) lash and eyebrow growth treatment for about 5 weeks and with this mascara, my lashes touched almost to my eyebrows.  It definitely adds volume to each lash, but  not so much, that it is so thick, that you can&#x27;t see through to your eyelid. Some people like that look, but I don&#x27;t.  It is too heavy and fake looking, in my opinion. This mascara is very smooth, not clumpy at all. I used 3 coats, letting them dry between each and it never did get clumpy.  My lashes looked really good and long, after one coat, but wanted to see how long they would go, without getting clumpy .  It builds very well.  Made my eyelashes look so beautiful and long, volumizes, but not overly.  My lashes are very fine , like my hair, but you could never tell it, with this mascara.  It makes them very thick and smooth. This mascara gave me sensational looking lashes, more natural looking than most I have tried.  Just wish they made it in waterproof!</li>
    <li> the best mascara ever!</li>
    <li> No other mascara compares.  It is defining and easy to put on.  I gift this to everyone! The price is so right!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara but see the price went up from what I paid for this one. I don&#x27;t need to reorder yet so hope I can find another good deal on price.</li>
    <li> I was really happy that this mascara was shiny and lengthening and didn&#x27;t run under my eyes through the day. I would love to order it again, but I read PTR now tests on animals because they ship to China and it is required for import. I wish they didn&#x27;t, this may have been in my regimen for years to come. It isn&#x27;t worth the pain and suffering done to animals for cosmetic research. There are plenty of cruelty free options to try.</li>
    <li> I have what I would consider normal sized lashes. Nothing too dramatic, but with some mascara they are noticeable. This product did nothing for me. The formula is thin and doesn&#x27;t stick well to the brush, so I had to keep re-dipping and applying just to get a semi-decent coating. It made my lashes barely stand out in the daytime, so using this for a night out is a no-no. A few pros were that it didn&#x27;t smear, and cleaned off easily with eye makeup remver. The bristles do pick up smaller lashes with a little maneuvering. For the price you could get 2 great mascaras from the drugstore, or a much better one from a makeup counter.</li>
    <li> love it!!I have very sensitive eyes and allergies and this did not irritate them! Made my lashes look great too!!!</li>
    <li> Hands down, this is my favorite mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on smooth, and makes your eye lashes look fabulous! I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara. A friend recommend this. Tried it and love it.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! I was pleased that it really does lengthen with no clumping whatsoever!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 items from PT Roth that irritated my eyes and gave me an infection. Buyers beware!&lt;br /&gt;I am now struggling with a chronic eye infection</li>
    <li> I do like the smaller brush and it does a great job of applying the mascara, but this mascara is really thick and clumps and glues your lashes together - I have to use a lash brush to gently separate them when I&#x27;m done and it&#x27;s another step needed when I really don&#x27;t have the time to mess with it - it does wash off easily and does not flake off, I just wish it didn&#x27;t glue fine lashes like mine together - for whatever it&#x27;s worth, I have found Kirkland mascara to be the best - not thick, has a great brush, no flaking and washes off easily - will be going back to using that one</li>
    <li> I have purchased this mascara to replace my Estee Lauder one. It&#x27;s OK mascara and the price is fair, but whether I would die for it, I doubt it. It colors my lashes great offering very natural look, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any build up. For day time natural look, it&#x27;s just fine, but for the evening I would use something else.</li>
    <li> Great for non-waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mascara despite my skepticism about some of the other reviews. To my surprise it is indeed a very good mascara for the price. I have used several high end mascaras including Yves Saint Laurent and Guerlain and this one is comparable. It didn&#x27;t clump up when applied to my lashes and after three months it still hadn&#x27;t dried up which commonly seems to happen to me. I loved the brush because it got all my lashes including the bottom ones. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see what the hype is about this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t do anything more than the cheap pink &amp; green case mascara does. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review for those women who have tried many mascaras, only to come to the conclusion that bare lashes are best. Aside from the usual qualities that one wants in a mascara, the one that makes this the best mascara to me is the fact that it acts better than a waterproof mascara as to its staying power!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have allergies and even with the benchmark waterproof mascara, I routinely wound up with raccoon eyes by lunchtime. I finally gave up and simply used a lash curler, if that. I had purchased this product at local salon simply because it was on sale. Thereafter, I became hooked. However, I could not find this until Amazon, and I&#x27;m so very glad they have it!</li>
    <li> Nothing beats this mascara! It is really the best...a little pricey but an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This mascara is great. I can feel it conditioning my lashes. It also has a nice small brush so that you can easily get to all your lashes. It doesn&#x27;t clump or flake.</li>
    <li> This was just ok...definitely tended to clump, and I found it was irritating to my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> This mascara really does make my &amp;#34;lashes to die for&amp;#34;! It&#x27;s great. It does not clump at all. I use Mark Kay eye makeup remover to get it off and it works well. If I just try to use water or a makeup wipe, it doesn&#x27;t work that well. Overall, I really recommend this mascara and I think I will buy again!</li>
    <li> The wand is the magic on this mascara; i have long fine lashes and it gets them all.  It is also water resistant, not waterproof which is good because i do not like  waterproof (too harsh and too hard to get off my lashes.) I have been caught in the rain a few times and noticed it did not budge when i thought i would be dealing with a disaster.</li>
    <li> I loved the deal I got for Lashes to Die For!  It is one ofthe bst mascaras I have ever used and pay over $23 a tube for it in the store.  I have very short &amp; thin lashes and this mascara makes them stand out better thaqn any other I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> It is just okay.  Nothing special to write home about.  Lancôme makes a brand new one called Grandiose which is more expensive but like it better.  Really makes shorter lashes look longer and terrific.  I would switch!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s so great about this mascara? Doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look better, and unfortunately, I took a nap for half an hour and the mascara smudged under my eyes. Very disappointed, And I hate to write a negative review.</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome! If you have used Lancome Defincils.. It is a lot like it as well as the brush! AAA+++</li>
    <li> Really good product, especially at this price point.  My favorite is still Prescriptives mascara and I can get that at the local outlet store for a decent price, but this product really does delivery and is less expensive.  The mascara I wear every single day is now this one--which is soooo much better than any drugstore products I have tried.  I will still buy my beloved Prescriptives mascara, but maybe save it for a night out on the town!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It lengthens and curls your lashes and I don&#x27;t find it sticky or messy. Highly recommended. The brush works nicely as well.</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara. I have a hard time finding ones that really bring out my sparse lashes. I&#x27;m in love! I will be back again.</li>
    <li> I love his products.  I have the eyeliner also which goes on with ease.  I have very sensitive skin and his products are great for me.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m a snooty Lancome fan but this mascara was total a waste of money. Even comparable to Loreal or Maybelline, it&#x27;s pretty cheap and crappy. The wand barely has any pull to it, it&#x27;s like trying to wipe mascara onto your lashes with a toothpick or the end of a lollipop. It&#x27;s just flat and has zero pull. I have no idea how this mascara got any good ratings- perhaps these people have never used Dior Show or Lancome Defincils. I would not recommend this mascara to anyone with stick straight eyelashes or anyone looking for volume and dramatic length. To die for? Me thinks not.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes that it was the next messiah in mascara... it wasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not quite sure why it has amazing reviews, but here&#x27;s what happened with me - It was clumpy, not by a lot but enough to say \\&quot;Why is this a miracle mascara?\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure, maybe I&#x27;m the only one, but others should know why it didn&#x27;t work for me. I still think Illegal Length is way better, even if it isn&#x27;t thickening. Also, the brush wasn&#x27;t great, but despite using a better wand in hopes of getting the most out of it, it still wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
    <li> No great mascara but good. Doesn&#x27;t make your lashes look full but just OK</li>
    <li> This is really pretty good mascara. The brush dies a great job of separating my lashes and it doesn&#x27;t run or smear.</li>
    <li> I used this first time this am. for work. I like it but I really like 2 other brands even better. Mary Kay Lash Love and of course Lancome Defincils.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this mascara 2 years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it ever since.  I am 68 years old, and have tried a LOT of mascaras in my life time!  This is by far the best.  It makes your lashes look longer and fuller, and stays put all day.  Ordering it on-line from amazon, rather than buying it retail, saves a lot of money.  While you are at it, order two, trust me, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> It just seems like regular mascara to me.  It does not clump or flake, so I&#x27;m not going to return it, but I thought it would be better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not really any clumps, but not much length or volume on its own either. I wouldn&#x27;t say it would be worth repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Tried numerous mascaras-many different brands but this product is wonderful. Goes on nicely,lasts long time, doesn&#x27;t come off until I take it off.</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to this mascara after reading the rave reviews.  Then I tried it and was so disappointed.  Unlike the Lancôme Doll eyes which has a noticeable difference, this mascara did nothing at all other than color my lashes black.  No lengthening, no thickening.  Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Flakes out on skin.  Looking for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake and fall on cheekbones and underneath the eye.</li>
    <li> This product gives me the most natural looking lashes I&#x27;ve ever had. I have longer lashes, but usually curl them so they showcase better. The applicator is perfect, it gets all my lashes and separates them evenly. I never have to touch up during the day. It doesnt weigh them down, and never clumps. The water resistance is also a huge plus! Amazing product.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great for people who do not seek a &#x27;falsie&#x27; look, it enhances the lashes you have with deep color. It is very easy to apply, does not clump, separates your lashes, and lasts all day. I even fell asleep with it on and woke up the next morning to no smears, no irritation, and looked like I had just applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No harsh smells or burning, a very good mascara that I am glad I tried. Will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> My lashes are noticeably improved since switching to this mascara. The lashes are longer and fuller. The mascara goes on well, it takes a couple of coats to get to the look I want, but It has lasted over a month which is more than most tubes last and I wear it every day. This mascara hardens around the lashes which is why it looks so awesome, but is very difficult to get off. I use a liquid cleaner in the hot shower and then repeat with eye makeup remover wipes to get it all compeltely off before reapplying. You could stretch a day and reapply over some of the old mascara, but it will not look as good as a fresh application.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite mascara... EVER! I&#x27;ve used every brand, from cheap-o brands to very expensive, but this is the best for creating long, black, natural-looking lashes. I constantly get asked if I get lash extensions... nope, I just use this!</li>
    <li> Love it, doesn&#x27;t clump or bleed onto lower eyelid.  Easy to remove.</li>
    <li> 5 stars-lashes to die for works very well, stays on very good also. Great For length. I recommend it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Nice application - small wand for covering individual lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Big fan of most Peter Thomas Roth products - I feel like they produce quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear contacts and with this mascara, there has been no aggravation - There is also no running, flaking or smearing of the product after wearing all day and maybe into to the night.  Best part is when you are ready to remove, It comes off with ease. No nasty residue left behind under your eyes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have longer lashes - both a blessing and a curse - and with this product, it accentuates what you have without making lashes stiff and thickly coated... Which if I wear my glasses or sunglasses they would tend to drag across my lenses and drive me crazy.... This product coats well while your lashes still remain soft and natural.</li>
    <li> Really &amp;#34;to die for&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I really liked the comb and may purchase again for this reason.  It is as described and I liked the price.  I would give it 5 stars but it didn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I ran out quickly. Maybe it was just me.  I really am a fan of Peter a Thomas Roth.</li>
    <li> Mascara is the best I&#x27;ve tried- makes lashes longer/fuller while not looking harsh. I don&#x27;t like the false eyelash look- this gives natural soft lashes.</li>
    <li> There are many volumizing mascaras out there, I wanted something that would also be good for my lashes. So far this product has done really well. The wand/brush are fabulous.  Keep in mind to get the full &amp;#34;lashes to die for&amp;#34; you need about 3 applications. So the good thing if you want to go very minimal looking make-up - one coat will do it, but for the evening of big lashes - go three.</li>
    <li> Just ok -- was not impressed and would not buy again.  Way too much money for a product that seems to be no different than one bought in you local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube, love this mascara.  I&#x27;m 58 years old and old mascara brushes were pulling out eyelashes and making my lashes brittle.  This wand is great, just glides through and the formula seems to really be helping my lashes, they have never looked better or healthier.</li>
    <li> This is good mascara, but not great.  It does a very nice job of lengthaning my lashes.  It does not thicken them or give them a more full appearance though.  It stays put without having racoon eyes.  If I do go out in the evening I do reappy.  It defines without being clumpy.  Eye makeup remover is needed to take off as it does have staying power.  I just wish it made the lashes more full.  I will use this and keep looking for my  &amp;#34;love it  mascara.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel this product was worth the price.  It is okay but doesn&#x27;t provide length or volume, color only.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this mascara.  After a number of decades, I have finally found a mascara that does not flake, stays on all day, goes on smoothly, does not clump and lengthens my lashes.  Lashes to Die For is simply the best mascara.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner and my fiance LOVES it!!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product and well worth it!I highly recommend this product to others, excellent!!</li>
    <li> I keep coming back to this mascara because it separates my lashes perfectly and the formula is perfect! I have sensitive eyes, and this never causes me any irritation. I&#x27;ve been using other mascaras intermittently because I really like dark brown mascara, and PTR doesn&#x27;t make one. The dark brown blinc is excellent formula but awful lash separation, so I&#x27;m back with the black PTR!</li>
    <li> This mascara is by far The Best !  I am a mascara junkie and have tried every high end mascara made.  Peter Roth made this formula for his wife as she was always complaining about mascara creating &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;.  This mascara creates long full lashes in just a couple of coats, very quickly.  It does not budge throughout the day until you remove it.  No raccoon eyes, no flaking, no spider leg looking lashes, just full feathery looking lashes like you put on a set of false lashes.  Just like the name of the product......it creates &amp;#34;Lashes to Die For&amp;#34;  Effortlessly!,,,,Seriously, you have to try it to believe your eyes.  So pleased Amazon is carrying this mascara! This mascara deserves 10 stars!</li>
    <li> This product does not run.  I had quit wearing mascara due to allergies and tearing but I am not having any problems with this mascara.  I&#x27;m very excited to find something this good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many brands of mascara trying to find one that helps to show up my lashes while not clumping, I was beginning to think I&#x27;d never find one I really liked until I found this brand (name to long to write again!).  It lengthens and defines without clumping making my lashes look natural.  In addition, I don&#x27;t get those horrible pieces of mascara in my eyes; I hate that!  Peter Thomas Roth, whoever you are, thank you for making this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this mascara and will continue to buy it through Amazon!  I enjoy shopping on Amazon for the savings it offers me as a \\&quot;Prime Member,\\&quot; the savings on shipping, and on gas (from having to drive to town to shop).  The savings make up for any price difference.  Why shop any other way?</li>
    <li> Wish I could give this a negative 5 stars.  I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice in the past from Sephora and I loved it.  I should have known based on the price that this was too good to be true.  I feel robbed.  I should have returned it but I didn&#x27;t use it until after 30 days.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara for me. My eyelashes look healthier. Does not run or flake under my eyes. I have ordered several times.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and curls nicely.  One negative is that it smears.</li>
    <li> Product has some wonderful reviews, however  as the company states-  it is  not  waterproof, and I found it extremely runny.. With our  hot weather- Look out with this product!! ANY amount of water/tears around the eye will cause it to wipe off. It did little to volumize or lengthen. THis product was not worth the cost of it in my opinion. I quit using it shortly after trying it . I am better off to buy cheaper Maybelline products which are far better and do what they claim. Lancôme, pricey but effective  is so far my favorite on the market, but I continue to search for the perfect brand!</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of mascara from Lancome to Dior to benifits they&#x27;re real, to urban decay to smashbox to estee lauder to bobbie brown to chanel to mac to make up forever to guerlain to  drug store mascara&#x27;s this mascara seperates and lenghtens and does add volume and it don&#x27;t clump or make your lashes stick together also it don&#x27;t smudge or cake like all above that I had mentioned. it is dark color it really looks good when you use a primer and then add this mascara I do like the dior serum primer better then the lancomes or urban decay this runs $22 at sephora and it really is wonderful I did give good reviews on other mascara&#x27;s but when I tried this it is what I have been looking for. it is not heavy and don&#x27;t weigh your lashs down what so ever. The biggiest complaint I have with other mascara&#x27;s is that they have a perfume to them an then my eyes burn and itch and water so this don&#x27;t and that is what is most important to me.it looks really soft on your eyes and does make them like drama or natural. I was so happy about this mascara that I went back to sephora and bought the last 2 mascara they had on the shelf I was there on wednesday and they were out of them then went back today Saturday and they had got 3 in so I bought one and tried it fell deeply in love with it so I went back and bought the last 2 they had on the self the brush is rubber and has long bristles that help lenghten the lashs then there is a part that adds volume. this is the best mascara no more trying and returning this is a keeper. good for work and add more good for evening wear this is worth $22 will I repurchase bet your lashs I will</li>
    <li> Fat shipping. Good product</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think mascaras really could grow lashes, but this one does.  I will never use another one again.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous different mascaras and this one is a buy again and again favorite. I wear contact lenses and there is no flaking or irritation.</li>
    <li> If there was 6 stars, I would choose that....</li>
    <li> Great product.  My lashes look longer than ever.</li>
    <li> I bought this after purchasing a tube at Beauty Brands and falling in love with it. However this doesn&#x27;t seem to work the same, it is clumpier and gloopier than my previous tube. I was pretty disappointed that this did not seem to be the same quality. It was hard to get a good application and result.</li>
    <li> I was definately hesitant to buy this mascara because I had never heard of this brand before and because I had never ordered makeup off amazon. Took a chance. Came still in packaging and before estimated time of arrival. I love this mascara, worked great, didnt clump, long lashes.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for length and separation, this mascara is for you! I don&#x27;t know how the buildability is because I am going for separation and length- I have naturally longer lashes, I just need a little color. I am not looking for the fake lash, super voluminous look. This is amazing stuff- Lasts all day without flaking (brand new tube though, so not sure if it lasts a long time). I&#x27;ve used Clinique&#x27;s Lash Power for a while, but wanted something to replace it because it starts getting super flakey after only 2-3 weeks (it&#x27;s great at first). PTR&#x27;s Lashes to DIE for is much better than CLP. And I love that it&#x27;s more natural, less of the terrible chemicals, as well as conditioning.</li>
    <li> Fantastic mascara! Probably all I will but now. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!! Love Peter Thomas! I&#x27;ve bought this several times and I&#x27;ll buy it again! Your lashes look fenomenal with this: long, full and you can wash it out easy with just water!</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used all the good ones out there.</li>
    <li> I fell for the infomercial!!! I saw this on tv and loved the way it looked and was so excited to try it. I had curled my lashes and then applied it.....a few minutes later my lashes were straight! It totally weighed my lashes down. Wanted to love it buy didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> this mascara is long wearing and does not smudge!  it delivers for me as promised especially with the humidity here in honolulu!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this and a much more affordable drug store brand.</li>
    <li> My lashes go on and on with this mascara.  I&#x27;ve ordered it twice.  I love it.</li>
