### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Awesome smelling and works well in my hair.  </li>
      <li>So happy I found it!</li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve come across in styling my hair.  </li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This product gives me shine, manageability, volume, and it smells great.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy smells great</li>
      <li>manageable and good looking.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>Love this!  </li>
      <li>Smells nice too.</li>
      <li>The price was better and it had good reviews</li>
      <li>This is better</li>
      <li>and I find this one helps keep it in place better than any of the petroleum products which are just stick and coat the hair.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE the lemongrass scent</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the &#x27;Dirt&#x27;s almond scent, but this one is Lemongrass and not bad either.</li>
      <li>Mine is fine</li>
      <li>Love the texture &amp; fresh scent.</li>
      <li>My wife and I enjoy the light citrus scent.</li>
      <li>assuming it is no longer available.</li>
      <li>The fragrance does seem to fade more quickly on this than the Dirt, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
      <li>I have had good hair days every day since starting to use this product!</li>
      <li>This is the perfect combination of something, not too much or too little.</li>
      <li>I chose this product after using Jonathan Dirt Texturizing Paste for years and wanting to try a more natural product.</li>
      <li>but I also loved the other.  </li>
      <li>Most natural Palm aid like product I could find on Amazon for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>and it is a light paste not a heavy butter texture.</li>
      <li>The smell is exactly what you would expect.  </li>
      <li>This paste has more of a whipped texture and is much more pliable out of the jar, whereas the &#x27;Dirt&#x27; is hard and waxy, so this one is a bit easier to lather into your hands before going into the hair.</li>
      <li>of all, it is chemical free, so it&#x27;s safe for everyday use.</li>
      <li>I have straight fine-but-thick, color treated hair</li>
      <li>Thanks, amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>This really does nourish your hair.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant, subtle lemongrass smell, as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find products with natural ingredients and Jonathan does pretty good.</li>
      <li>Work as well or better on her pixie haircut than any other product we have tried.</li>
      <li>The best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my thin, dry and wavy hair.</li>
      <li>Also this product is more touchable and leaves less residue on your hands if you play with your hair during the day.</li>
      <li>Very pure and chem-free and provides soft and natural styling.  </li>
      <li>would recommend to anyone who like using natural product like me.</li>
      <li>Not nearly as heavy as the Dirt yet still provides a lot of body and shine.</li>
      <li>This texture paste has strong hold and leaves hair styled but dry - not the \\&quot;wet hair\\</li>
      <li>After first drying it can be a little crunchy, but generally stays soft and pliable if moved again.</li>
      <li>While short, my hair is thick and has a strong cowlick and this product has enough hold to keep it off my forehead and stays where I style</li>
      <li>Styling products have always been way too much or way too little.</li>

<li> or if we just got a bad batch, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for that reason.</li>
<li> The product holds well and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, however, every time he uses this product, it causes his head to itch so bad he has to rinse it out within the hour.  </li>

    <li> This texture paste has strong hold and leaves hair styled but dry - not the \\&quot;wet hair\\&quot; look associated with gels.  While short, my hair is thick and has a strong cowlick and this product has enough hold to keep it off my forehead and stays where I style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it is chemical free, so it&#x27;s safe for everyday use. It has a pleasant, subtle lemongrass smell, as well.</li>
    <li> Love the texture &amp; fresh scent.</li>
    <li> The best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my thin, dry and wavy hair. It smooths and adds body without adding weight. I use a tiny amount on completely dry hair each day between washing.</li>
    <li> Love this!  My second purchase.  Very pure and chem-free and provides soft and natural styling.  Minimal hold but I use it to give a little shape to my entire hair (I have a short pixie) and then use a little strong-hold product to finish the rest.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve come across in styling my hair.  Marcy</li>
    <li> Most natural Palm aid like product I could find on Amazon for a reasonable price. It&#x27;s hard to find products with natural ingredients and Jonathan does pretty good. My wife and I enjoy the light citrus scent. Work as well or better on her pixie haircut than any other product we have tried. Does not set like hairspray, can be restyled if messed up. Great product!</li>
    <li> I used to use the paste called dirt.  This is better but I also loved the other.  Not greasy smells great</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I considered using this product because I knew it would work&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone who like using natural product like me. Thanks, amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome smelling and works well in my hair.  Not too stiff, not to wimpy.</li>
    <li> I have straight fine-but-thick, color treated hair and I struggle with getting bodywithout frizz. If I don&#x27;t shampoo every day my scalp feels oily, if I do, my hair looks dry. Not anymore!  This product gives me shine, manageability, volume, and it smells great.  A little goes a long way, so I will have this tub for months. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what shampoo and conditioner I use anymore. I have had good hair days every day since starting to use this product!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for our son.  The product holds well and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, however, every time he uses this product, it causes his head to itch so bad he has to rinse it out within the hour.  I&#x27;m not sure what would cause this or if we just got a bad batch, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for that reason. The smell is exactly what you would expect.  Citrus tones of orange and lemongrass.</li>
    <li> Great product!  So happy I found it!</li>
    <li> This really does nourish your hair. Mine is fine and I find this one helps keep it in place better than any of the petroleum products which are just stick and coat the hair. It looks like the product is being discontinued however. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought this because it was vegan, so will be trying John Masters Organics bourbon vanilla and tangerine hair texturizer next since I went to the Jonathan site and don&#x27;t see this one mentioned anywhere, so assuming it is no longer available.</li>
    <li> Paste? I was expecting something a little softer.</li>
    <li> Switch to this from Dirt(tm) and I&#x27;m very pleased. Not nearly as heavy as the Dirt yet still provides a lot of body and shine. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I use Dirt and have tried this as well, I&#x27;m not sold on it....a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My head has finally met something that turned its lifeless dull flat thin hair into something manageable and good looking. Styling products have always been way too much or way too little. This is the perfect combination of something, not too much or too little. Doesn&#x27;t leave my have flaky or unwashed looking, just manageable, comb-able, style-able. I will recommend to all of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
    <li> As a &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; fan I thought I would not switch over to anything but then I came across this product. The price was better and it had good reviews so I decided to try it. HEAVEN in a paste! LOVE LOVE the lemongrass scent and it is a light paste not a heavy butter texture. I&#x27;ve tried it for a month and I find I use less than I did with &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34;. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I chose this product after using Jonathan Dirt Texturizing Paste for years and wanting to try a more natural product. This paste has more of a whipped texture and is much more pliable out of the jar, whereas the &#x27;Dirt&#x27; is hard and waxy, so this one is a bit easier to lather into your hands before going into the hair. I enjoyed the &#x27;Dirt&#x27;s almond scent, but this one is Lemongrass and not bad either. The fragrance does seem to fade more quickly on this than the Dirt, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing. Also this product is more touchable and leaves less residue on your hands if you play with your hair during the day. After first drying it can be a little crunchy, but generally stays soft and pliable if moved again. I would recommend this product and definitely buy again.</li>
