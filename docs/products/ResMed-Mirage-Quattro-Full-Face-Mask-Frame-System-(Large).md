<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> ResMed Mirage Quattro Full Face Mask&lt;br /&gt;Pro- Well made.&lt;br /&gt;Con- Shaped like a pyramid. To wide in the noise area.&lt;br /&gt;Con- Mask sets on my cheek bones. Rocks up and down on the cheek bones.&lt;br /&gt;  Will not seal at pressure of 11 or above.&lt;br /&gt;  Tighten head gear so not stretch was left.. Uncomfortable and still leeks.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Had the same trouble with the FX version.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If the mask sets on your cheek bones look for a different mask.&lt;br /&gt; I found Philips Respironics Amara Full face works for me.. Well made and fits well.&lt;br /&gt;PS I did send a email to ResMed asking if they had any masks shaped more like a Bartlett pear. They did no&lt;br /&gt;answer the question only to see my supplier. Must not have any other shapes.</li>
    <li> I was fitted with this type of mask during a recent sleep study. It seemed to give me a better sleep because it enclosed my nose and my mouth. I was due for a new mask anyway so I ordered this to replace the nose only mask I was using. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the material is hard plastic, therefore has no flexibility. I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to this during my sleep study (unless this is not the exact one used). It is hard and stiff and I have to overtighten the straps to prevent  air seepage. I sleep on my side and stomach so the edges press against my face all night. Needless to say, my face looks like a battlefield by morning.</li>
    <li> better than my first mask</li>
    <li> Struggled with other masks. Can sleep the whole night through with this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent fit and great price. I know where my replacement will be purchased. quick delivery as well</li>
    <li> Shipped fast and came as advertised. No defects noticed.</li>
    <li> I purchased two masks already and both of them broke within the first two weeks I had to glue different parts of the two masks to be able to use until I boght a new one. I have never had any problems before that. I tried to get in touch with the company they didn&#x27;t even had the courtesy to answer back. My name is Jonathan Kochlany.my phone number is 786 294 1526.</li>
    <li> was just replacing one that my husband had for over 4 years.  same brand and model.  It is one that he is comfortable with</li>
    <li> perfect, comfortable, fit.</li>
    <li> Could not have  asked  for any better.  Considerably better value that purchasing at local medical supply house.  You will not go wrong if looking for a Full Frame Mask</li>
    <li> This is a good quality mask, I have had no issues with it and find that its more comfortable than the previous one I used.</li>
    <li> I had it since march but just started using it. Doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
    <li> I thought this mask is good. I tried to clean it. You need to take the seal apart. It is clear and I could not put it back. Sleepnet masks have comfortable gel and easy to clean cushion.</li>
    <li> Local Home health care provider recommended this mask; I immediately complained of bridge- of- nose soreness; was told \\&quot;sorry your insurance won&#x27;t allow another change\\&quot; suffered for a full year with bridge-of- nose pain and redness; with help from Alicks Home Medical I was directed to an F&amp;P Simplus mask-now sleep amazingly well, relaxed, no pain and no all day bridge- of- nose redness; also no more waking up from air leaking around mask seal!</li>
    <li> great quality and great price</li>
    <li> Replacement-is high quality</li>
    <li> The listing says the mask does not come with headgear but it is incorrect. It did include headgear so don&#x27;t buy headgear like I did.</li>
    <li> Replacement of the same, works alright. I have since purchased the ResMed AIR (Large) which is much lighter and I find more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would not by this item again.</li>
    <li> I choose to go with Amazon instead of the local sleep center for my mask.&lt;br /&gt;They charge $185 for the same mask. That is if I have met my deductible for the year, if not it is 250.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time and was a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Same quality as the other masks.</li>
    <li> Having the right size mask is key to being comfortable and using the CPAP. I had a medium size mask before, and I tended to take it off halfway through the night. Now, I don&#x27;t even notice it. Mask is high quality and was easy t connect. I bought the mask strap with it so there were no issues with compatibility.</li>
    <li> Needed to replace my Mirage Quattro mask and looked on Amazon.  Saw a lot of them listed for about 60 bucks more from other vendors.  Decided to purchase here.  Shipping was very fast, and mask was an exact replica of my prior mask.  It included headgear, which I was NOT expecting, so definitely an added bonus that makes this an even better deal.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Finally getting some quality sleep</li>
    <li> A must for my husbands breathing machine.  He had worn out the old one &amp; fretted about how to replace it.  Very pleased with the fit and the shape.  Now he knows ordering more in the future will be a snap.  Much easier than going thru medical catalogs w/ much higher priced items.&lt;br /&gt;And shipping was prompt as scheduled.  Perfect timing.</li>
    <li> Received the product just as promised and cost about half of what it would through my local medical supply store.  It&#x27;s a must for anyone paying for their own CPAP supplies.</li>
    <li> Super price on this replacement mask!</li>
    <li> Great purchase, It was just like the one I was already using, Will buy from these people again.</li>
    <li> Works well. Great option for replacement of old one. It was very reasonably priced. Will definitely order again when a new one is needed. Very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Very happy with the mask.</li>
    <li> Affordable, quick shipping!</li>
    <li> you can&#x27;t beat this deal.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one word of advice - do not order the head strap until after you get your mask. don&#x27;t ask you will see!</li>
    <li> This seems to be the one to get. quite comfortable and has a good seal</li>
    <li> I received a badly needed item in a timely manner after inadvertently breaking the one I use. It works great.</li>
    <li> not happy with it all,  the rubber seal around the face mask ripped and its not even a month old, s*** material this is!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it I love it it&#x27;s soft around my face no leeks and pretty quit. Love the adjuster for the depth of it</li>
    <li> i had it before, its the only mask i have tried so i dont know if my opinion counts but its very good high quality material mask and it lasted  5 years of hard use</li>
    <li> Although it says it doesn&#x27;t come with head gear, it does. Now I have two.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the nose ResMed think and the Pillow one. I guess I&#x27;m a mouth breather so this one was necessary.</li>
    <li> I positively hate this mask. It squeaks and squeals terribly when it leaks air out the seals keeping you up all night. This occurs when your machine is on max pressure or near max. When my machine goes to max it will blow the seal no matter how tight the headgear is. Its also hot which wakes you up and to much is obstructed. Got my Oracle 452 just today and gonna put this one away (hopefully forever) unless the Oracle is worse.</li>
    <li> Fits comfortably, has a soft and pliable border on the face. I prefer the nasal pillows, as this type of mask makes me feel claustrophobic, but I will need it when I have a cold with a semi blocked nose . . .&lt;br /&gt;I have since gone back to the large full face mask, and if you add a RemZzzs padded cpap mask liner, this mask becomes one of the most comfortable full face masks to wear. The incessant fight to try and stop leaks with the full face masks become irrellavent with these mask liners -- wish I knew of them at the start, it would have saved me hundreds of dollars spent on different masks to find one fitting properly.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone to not make the same mistakes . . .</li>
    <li> This is the real thing. I used it the first night, and it is top quality. I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> great products and service</li>
    <li> I love the new ResMed Mirage masks. I had stopped using the ResMed masks because they were difficult to clean and expensive to replace the whole mask every 6 months. The removable cushions and mask is extremely easy to use and allows me to use different products to sanitize each piece. The new forehead pad adjustment system is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back as a ResMed customer and will be so for a while.</li>
    <li> The product was a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a great mask , I have used them for years (one note of caution, you must order one that fits you) the second thing you should know is Expedited shipping is not overnight but is more like priority mail. My mask had broken and I was left with out one for days , I really wish they had overnight shipping.</li>
    <li> Awesome and came with headgear!</li>
    <li> Best CPAP mask I&#x27;ve ever bought.  It covers both nose and mouth so may take some getting used to if you&#x27;ve been using the nose-only ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to live with this mask and the Respironics Amara with both the silicon and gel inserts.  I&#x27;ve posted my review of the Amara as well.  Two things make this mask the inferior version.  The nose adjuster and the silicon insert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjuster on the Resmed is very slow.  You have to twist, twist twist and at the end of the day doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference to the leakage around your nose.  The Amara has the best adjuster in the industry.  Press, set, forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second major difference is the quality of the seal against your face.  If you use lower pressures, my guess is around 10, you may not care and may prefer the silicon for being lighter.  However at higher pressures you&#x27;ll have to really haul on the head straps to get this mask to stay sealed all night.  It&#x27;s like are wearing a head corset.  That&#x27;s where the Amara&#x27;s available gel insert is just head and shoulders above.  You will need far less head squeezing and face mashing headband pressure with the Amara and gel insert than you will with the Mirage Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one place where the Mirage is a superior offering is in the strap snaps.  They are really easy to use even when barely awake.</li>
    <li> The best feature on this all-around great mask is the screw mechanism up top that lets you dial in just the right amount of pressure to seal off annoying leaks around the bridge of the nose.</li>
    <li> Just upgraded to this from the Amara... such an improvement, this Large is much larger than the Amara&#x27;s Large. Things that were difficult and that would break my seal before (and with a pressure of 19 its not hard to break the seal) the Quattro handles beautifully I can talk, open my jaw all the way, make as many funny faces as I want and the seal did not break once. Why I bought the Amara in the first place I have no idea, I&#x27;m a customer for life now.</li>
    <li> So I need to replace my mask because my PitBull ate it!! Yep you heard right... She ate it. Ugh! And I cant sleep with out it. Order It on Friday got it on Monday. Fits better than my old mask. Thx</li>
    <li> I received the product that I ordered and was thrilled with the value of the item was as if I bought it through my medical company. the cost was one third of what it would be if I ordered it from my medical company. thank you so much for having high quality medical items available to purchase at a great price.</li>
    <li> This mask is a perfect fit for those who sleep with an open mouth. The triangular mask covers the nose and mouth which eliminated snoring.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t  seal on face very good,uncomfortable will not use this product again..have to try a different mask from another brand</li>
    <li> Works great. Seller delivered on time as promised.</li>
    <li> I had the first generation mask before it broke. They improved a weak spot by eliminating it completely.</li>
    <li> Mask was at a very reasonable price and works well.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but as advertised.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the mask excellent product tried out product for the first time last night and it seal very good to the face .</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. Best I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve read reviews about problems with it....but no complaints from me. Everyones different of course....so what I think is great you might hate. Mine DID come with the headgear also with it...and that was nice. I see some reviews that said it did and some said it didn&#x27;t so who knows what you might get? I shopped around and this was as cheap as I&#x27;ve seen it as well.</li>
    <li> After dealing with a bad medical supply company (the lady only let me try medium masks, even though I have like an 8.5 hat size!), I gave up on my CPAP machine out of frustration.  From talking to her, I didn&#x27;t even know there were different sizes of full-face masks.  I finally gave it another shot on my own and did some research, which led me to the Mirage Quattro.  I absolutely love it, and it solved all the problems I had with all the different masks I tried (it hardly ever leaks, it doesn&#x27;t feel claustrophobic, it&#x27;s easier making a seal with a beard, etc.).  If you&#x27;re like me and will end up unconsciously breathing through your mouth at night and need a full-sized mask, this is definitely the one to get if you have a larger head (I&#x27;m a 5&#x27; 11&amp;#34; guy).  I love it, it completely solved my problems!</li>
    <li> I have used nasal pillows for years but began to mouth breath.  Was forced to go to a full mask and chose this mask.  It has been easy to adapt to and has worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> I was using the ResMed Quattro FX - what a difference those two little letters make! The FX has high cheek pieces as part of the frame and I prefer to sleep on my side so they were always rubbing or shifting the mask so it leaked air and woke me up.    This new mask came within a week and I hooked it up that very night - it was the most restful sleep I have had in almost two years. I didn&#x27;t wake up once all night no matter which side i was on. I have used it several nights so far, the frame is set up a bit different but it&#x27;s very easy to adjust the forehead piece with the knob in front. Although both masks were sized Large, the new Mirage was longer than the FX so when I reorder I will probably try the Medium based on the recommendations. It does ride up a bit on my nose and it&#x27;s a bit loose at the chin but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s longer than the FX for the same size. Trial &amp; error, part of the learning process in getting the perfect fit so next time I will go down one size to a medium.    Ironically, my insurance company referred me to [...] if I needed additional supplies in between insurance allowances but I checked there and this same mask - $79.00 through Amazon - cpap.com was charging $179.00 for the same identical make &amp; model!!!! My Amazon order was processed through a company called Somniair and it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out a $100.00 savings is a good thing. The mask came brand new from the factory in a sealed bag with manual AND the headgear included - it says on the Amazon listing that it isn&#x27;t included so I had ordered a separate headgear but that&#x27;s OK, I have an emergency spare. I really love this style of mask, it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes and I can still see the TV if it&#x27;s on without a problem.</li>
    <li> it works fine it was cheaper than buying from my doctor</li>
    <li> Large is too large for me and I have a large face.</li>
    <li> Obviously I have sleep apnea, but what I did not realize was my previous mask was missing the little silicon one way valve that allows you to exhale easier. That was just a nose mask. This full face mask is as comfortable as can be made and nicely adjustable. Seems way easier to breathe out or in and its helping me finally get some real sleep.</li>
    <li> I ordered this new sleep apnea mask for my dad as a surprise. It fit perfectly and he now has a new mask to wear that won&#x27;t rub his face and keep him up at night. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Mask fits my husband perfect! Will be ordering from this company again! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as I would have gotten at the specialty pharmacy for less. I will definitely order again and continue ordering as I need.</li>
    <li> Only issue is that it is rather spendy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, excellent medical device.  Works with my existing equipment...good purchase</li>
    <li> A good mask at a great price...</li>
    <li> Good quality mask at a lower price then from Doctors office</li>
    <li> Always dependable - very happy with ResMed products.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. It works great he had a different brand that was the same size however the other mask would mark his face and this one does not. The shipping was fast and the product was wrapped perfectly. It included the masks and headgear!!</li>
    <li> Needed a new cushion but, with the price difference between a cushion and the entire mask I decided to buy this as a backup.  It did NOT come with headgear as other reviewers had posted.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! As described!</li>
    <li> OEM replacement.  Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> The mask is fine and works great, shipping was fast. The product description is misleading it says it comes with a gift of the headgear. It did not come with that item. I&#x27;m fine paying for headgear separately, but it shouldn&#x27;t be listed as a \\&quot;gift\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have to leave home and received exactly what I needed. It&#x27;s exactly as described, works great, and was a better value than anywhere else I&#x27;ve checked.</li>
    <li> Met all expectations.  Adjustable size is perfect</li>
    <li> Product as advertised. Excellent service in delivering my mask.</li>
    <li> I receive a response in regard to the only question I had and in less than 24 hours.  I haven&#x27;t even received this product as of yet, but have used two other items, exactly like what I&#x27;m expecting to receive, which she has assures me to be the case or she make it right.  Her words are good enough for me and I&#x27;m really excited about getting it, especially knowing it&#x27;s already been shipped and just what she said it to be; a ResMed Mirage Quattro Full Face Mask Frame.  I&#x27;ll be happy whether it&#x27;s just a frame or just the mask, because I have other mask that I can use for the spare parts from, if necessary.  I just know I need one working mask.  Thanks.</li>
